*Rick and Morty* is recognized as a leading show on television, known for its blend of philosophy, science, and humor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The series follows a mad scientist, Rick, and his grandson, Morty, on "deeply irresponsible and awesome space adventures" through alternate dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

The show draws heavily from the traditions of [[rick_and_morty_references_to_scifi_and_horror | sci-fi and horror]], paying homage to works like *Ghostbusters*, films by David Cronenberg, *Nosferatu*, Freddy Krueger, and *Zardoz* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It has a particular affinity for the cosmic horror tradition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Cosmic Horror in *Rick and Morty*

Cosmic horror, pioneered by H.P. Lovecraft, focuses on the terror of phenomena beyond human comprehension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. *Rick and Morty*, much like Lovecraft's work, uses the cosmos to explore profound [[philosophical_themes_in_rick_and_morty | philosophical questions]] by imagining the hidden depths of space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The show's opening even visually references Lovecraft's Cthulhu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

Cosmic horror aims to present the "vast unknown and unimaginable," evoking a sense of fright, disgust, and dread when incomprehensible entities collide with human reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Rick's portal gun frequently exposes characters to this unknown, leading to outcomes that are sometimes horrifying, sometimes hilarious, and sometimes both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

### The Cromulons and Human Insignificance

The episode "[[philosophy_of_rick_and_mortys_get_schwifty_episode | Get Schwifty]]" serves as a prime example of cosmic horror <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Earth is confronted by a giant space-head, a Cromulon, whose gravitational mass causes widespread chaos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These cosmic entities demand Earth "show them what they've got" through a musical performance, threatening disintegration if they fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

This scenario raises a core question of cosmic horror: "Are we significant?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> Unlike most science fiction, which often centers humanity, cosmic horror posits that the universe is indifferent to us <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. For the Cromulons, humanity is merely a source of entertainment; annihilating a planet is a trivial act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This demonstration of human insignificance is both terrifying and, in *Rick and Morty*'s dark humor, hilarious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

Contemporary American philosopher Eugene Thacker's concept of "Cosmic Pessimism," detailed in his book *In the Dust of This Planet*, describes this phenomenon as imagining a "world-without-us" — a universe "absolutely unhuman, and indifferent to the hopes, desires and struggles of human individuals and groups" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. *Rick and Morty* embodies this pessimism, even showing Rick and Morty dying and being replaced by infinite alternate versions of themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The show, however, encourages viewers to laugh at their insignificance rather than be terrified by it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

### The Cosmic Horror Within

The show also flips the perspective: humanity itself can be a cosmic horror to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. In "The Ricks Must Be Crazy," it's revealed that Rick's car battery is powered by a micro-universe whose inhabitants exist solely to produce energy, and within that universe, another mini-universe is created, and so on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. To the denizens of these micro-verses, Rick is akin to one of Lovecraft's cosmic deities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This "cosmic inception" highlights how values and meanings dissipate in a multiverse of infinite possibilities, leaving only pessimism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## [[philosophical_themes_in_rick_and_morty | Philosophical Themes]] in *Rick and Morty*

*Rick and Morty* consistently addresses the fundamental question of existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It explores both the cosmic insignificance of humanity and the frivolity of individual human life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

### [[rick_and_morty_and_existentialism | Existentialism]] and Nihilism

The show presents two contrasting responses to a "pathetic existence" through Rick and Jerry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>:

*   **Jerry:** Seems oblivious to the meaninglessness of his life, finding contentment even in a poor simulation of reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. He is "too dumb to realize that his life is pointless," leading to a form of ignorant contentment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.
*   **Rick:** Understands and accepts life's meaninglessness, often appearing sarcastic and nonchalant about suffering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Despite his proclaimed rationalism, his catchphrase "Wubbalubbadubdub" translates to "I am in great pain," revealing his struggle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

The show suggests a paradox: while [[science_vs_mysticism_in_rick_and_morty | science]] provides understanding of the universe, it simultaneously confronts humanity with the bleak, arbitrary nature of its own existence, stripping away sanctity and meaning from the human experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Rick exemplifies this by mathematically explaining Summer and Morty's insignificance or rationalizing his bond with Morty as a way to hide his genius brain waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

#### Simulation vs. Reality

*Rick and Morty* frequently blurs the lines between meaningless simulations and actual life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. In one instance, Morty experiences a full life and death within the "Roy" video game, leading the audience to question what truly differentiates a "fake" reality from his "own existence" if emotions and sensations are equally real <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The show suggests that the distinction we draw between simulated and authentic life is ultimately "a giant crock of shit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

#### [[nietzschean_philosophy_in_rick_and_morty | Nietzschean Philosophy]] and the "Death of God"

The crisis of values and meaning in life is explored through the lens of [[nietzschean_philosophy_in_rick_and_morty | Friedrich Nietzsche]], particularly his parable of the madman proclaiming "God is dead!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> Nietzsche argued that the Enlightenment and scientific revolution rendered traditional sources of value irrelevant, leaving a "void of meaning" or [[existentialism_and_nihilism_in_rick_and_morty | nihilism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

Rick Sanchez embodies this struggle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. He uses science to demystify everything, reducing love to chemical reactions and even defeating the devil, metaphorically enacting the "death of God" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Rick's character fluctuates between passive [[existentialism_and_nihilism_in_rick_and_morty | nihilism]] (resigned to meaninglessness) and active [[existentialism_and_nihilism_in_rick_and_morty | nihilism]] (seeking to destroy old values to create new ones) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. His actions, like being an intergalactic terrorist or sacrificing himself for his family, appear paradoxical, suggesting his own struggle to find meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

### Morality and Freedom

The show challenges traditional notions of morality, refusing to draw clear lines between right and wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Morty's attempts to be a "do-gooder" often backfire, as seen when freeing people from the body-snatching Unity leads to a "nipple-driven race war" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Summer's observation, "I didn’t know freedom meant people doing stuff that sucks," highlights the grim consequences of unfiltered liberty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This forces a consideration of whether irrational attachment to freedom contributes to a "terribly fucked up" world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

### [[philosophy_and_absurdism_in_rick_and_morty | Absurdism]]

The [[philosophy_and_absurdism_in_rick_and_morty | existential question]] in *Rick and Morty* can also be viewed through Albert Camus' concept of [[philosophy_and_absurdism_in_rick_and_morty | absurdism]], particularly in "Meeseeks and Destroy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Camus' absurdism centers on the irreconcilable conflict between humanity's innate desire for meaning and the universe's complete indifference to its existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

The Meeseeks offer a counterpoint: "Meeseeks are not born into this world fumbling for meaning, Jerry! We are created to serve a singular purpose for which we will go to any lengths to fulfill!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> Human life, for Camus, is the opposite, akin to the myth of Sisyphus, eternally pushing a boulder up a hill only for it to roll back down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. In the show, Jerry's endlessly frustrating golf swing serves as a parallel to Sisyphus's task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

Many characters, like the Meeseeks, Abradolf Lincler, and Morty Jr., embody a "Frankenstein-complex," resenting their creators for bringing them into existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Camus suggests embracing the emptiness of the absurd as an alternative to the perpetual frustration of seeking meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This is echoed by Rick's advice, "Don't think about it," and Morty's blunt summation: "Nobody exists on purpose. Nobody belongs anywhere. Everybody's gonna die. Come watch TV?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>

## [[science_vs_mysticism_in_rick_and_morty | Science]] and its Philosophical Implications

The show's [[science_vs_mysticism_in_rick_and_morty | science]], both fictional and "almost-real," highlights how lives can be as "sad and pathetic as Jerry's" despite any admiration for Rick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

### Scientific Demystification and Critique

*Rick and Morty* uses [[science_vs_mysticism_in_rick_and_morty | science]] to demystify everything, even religious figures, reducing them to purely scientific phenomena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It also satirizes the [[rick_and_morty_references_to_scifi_and_horror | science fiction]] genre's tendency to invent "scientific mumbo-jumbo" to justify unlikely plot points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Examples include the entire episode loosely based on the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, where quantum uncertainty is comically misapplied to explain realities splitting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The show also features Schrödinger's cats as a reference to the thought experiment, adding to the humor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

### Misuse of Science and Atheism

The series exhibits a unique form of atheism, actively invalidating religious figures by boiling them down to pure scientific explanations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It also acknowledges the frequent misuse of [[science_vs_mysticism_in_rick_and_morty | science]] for religious or manipulative agendas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. In "Something Ricked This Way Comes," Jerry's "personal" interpretation of [[science_vs_mysticism_in_rick_and_morty | science]] leads him to campaign for Pluto's planet-hood, encountering Plutonians with cross-shaped eyes, symbolizing religious fundamentalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This is revealed to be a ploy by corporate overlords to manipulate the Plutonians into accepting their planet's destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

*Rick and Morty* holds nothing sacred, exploring the absurdities of a purely rational universe and pushing boundaries within a [[rick_and_morty_references_to_scifi_and_horror | sci-fi horror]] setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This approach allows the show to pose fundamental, depressing questions about purpose and meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

*Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood* is acclaimed as an instant classic, boasting a high-concept science fiction narrative, impressive fight scenes, and a profound philosophical core <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. The series delves deeply into the efficacy and application of science, specifically "Alchemy," and explores how faith intertwines with this discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>.

## The Philosophical Battleground: Science vs. Faith

Set in Amestris, a country reminiscent of pre-World War 2 Europe, *Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood*'s defining feature is the pervasive success of Alchemy, which is treated as a science combining chemistry and biology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>. Alchemy's most crucial principle is "The Law of Equivalent Exchange" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>.

The series quickly establishes a dynamic push and pull between science and faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>:

*   **Initial Skepticism towards Faith**: Early on, Edward and Alphonse Elric's skepticism toward the divine is justified when they expose Father Cornello in Liore. Cornello used cleverly veiled applications of Alchemy to perform "miracles" and indoctrinate followers into Leto-ism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>.
*   **The Horrors of Unchecked Science**: This initial triumph of science is swiftly challenged by the "Sewing-Life Alchemist" Shou Tucker, who brutally used his own daughter and dog to create a talking chimera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. Tucker's actions, driven by a claim to "do what science demands," force viewers to question the innocence of science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>.

### The Critique of Scientism

Tucker's amorality sets the tone for the show's critique of "scientism" â€” the idea that scientific knowledge is superior to all other forms of knowledge and that other forms should be reduced to scientific terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>. Philosopher Paul Feyerabend, whose ideas resonate throughout the series, argues that science is merely one of many explanatory frameworks, "neither as rational nor consistent as it pretends to be" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>. He cautions that an unquestioning acceptance of science, much like any ideology, can lead to disastrous results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>.

*   **Dehumanization**: Alchemy, especially through "The Law of Equivalent Exchange," inherently reduces objects, animals, and even people to their physical components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>. The Elric brothers' journey itself begins with their attempt to transmute the basic ingredients of a human being to resurrect their mother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>.
*   **The Philosopher's Stone**: This dehumanizing nature culminates in the "Philosopher's Stone," which requires human lives as its key ingredient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>. The Homunculi, artificial humans powered by these stones, exemplify scientism by reducing the souls within to mere alchemic principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:29:00">[06:29:00]</a>.
*   **Militarization of Science**: Alchemy in Amestris is subservient to the military, with State Alchemists often referred to as "dogs of the military" or "human weapons" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:52:00">[07:52:00]</a>. Sociologist Stanley Aronowitz notes that while scientists may view themselves as independent, their funding often comes from corporations or the state, limiting their say in the application of their discoveries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:20:00">[08:20:00]</a>. This militarization distorts scientific principles, as seen when "Alchemic Rebirth" is used to justify genocide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:00">[09:05:00]</a>. The Ishbalan War of Extermination highlights how scientific language can sanitize and escalate atrocities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:24:00">[10:24:00]</a>.

### The Dangers of Blind Faith

While critiquing science, the series also presents faith as another explanatory model and source of truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:36:00">[13:36:00]</a>. Characters frequently appeal to faith; for example, the Elrics are awestruck by the delivery of a baby, recognizing alchemy's limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:48:00">[13:48:00]</a>. Dr. Marcoh attributes meeting Scar to "fate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:04:00">[14:04:00]</a>, and even Bradley, a Homunculus, questions if his death was "providence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:29:00">[14:29:00]</a>.

However, the show equally warns against unreflective veneration of any ideology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:26:00">[15:26:00]</a>. The blind following of faith can be just as harmful as blind adherence to science, as demonstrated by:

*   **Father Cornello**: Uses faith to incite violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:40:00">[15:40:00]</a>.
*   **Scar's Initial Vengeance**: Uses his God, "Ishvala," to justify vengeance against alchemists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:46:00">[15:46:00]</a>.

## Character Development and Ideological Growth

Characters in *Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood* experience significant [[character_development_in_rick_and_morty|character development]] and ideological growth when they realize the limitations of adhering to a single ideology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:00:00">[16:00:00]</a>.

### Edward and Alphonse Elric

The Elric brothers are central to the series' exploration of [[the_philosophical_themes_in_fullmetal_alchemist_brotherhood|philosophical themes]]. Their journey to restore their bodies forces them to confront various discourses on science and its application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>.

*   **Moral Compass**: While they use the power of the Philosopher's Stones, they do so while respecting the autonomy of the souls within, distinguishing them as moral agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:00">[07:01:00]</a>. This aligns with Immanuel Kant's philosophy that people should never be used as mere means but are always ends in themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:00">[07:38:00]</a>.
*   **Questioning and Adaptation**: They question the foundations of Western Alchemy and seek its eastern equivalent, Alkahestry, ultimately bridging the gap between these two ideologies to triumph <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:06:00">[16:06:00]</a>.
*   **Rejection of Single Ideology**: Their "humble rejection of a single ideology" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:11:00">[19:11:00]</a> and desire to discover their "own truth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:28:00">[19:28:00]</a> drives their actions. Edward's final act of sacrificing his ability to perform alchemy to save Alphonse and recognizing the arrogance in thinking alchemy could explain everything exemplifies his growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:23:00">[20:23:00]</a>.
*   **Continuous Search for Truth**: After regaining their bodies, they resolve to keep searching for truth and new methods to discover it, travelling east and west to gather all knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:06:00">[21:06:00]</a>.

### Scar

Scar, a survivor of the Ishbalan War of Extermination, initially targets State Alchemists for revenge, viewing them as both weapons and transgressors against God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:37:00">[16:37:00]</a>. However, his journey leads to profound transformation:

*   **Realizing Limitations**: As Scar learns more about Amestris, he realizes the wrongness of his vengeance and understands that no ideology can justify murder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:52:00">[16:52:00]</a>.
*   **Breaking from Strict Laws**: He breaks from the strict laws of his faith, utilizing the very alchemy his God abhors to save the country he once hated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:10:00">[17:10:00]</a>.

### Father

In stark contrast to the heroes' growth, the main antagonist, "Father," embodies the dangers of rigid ideological adherence:

*   **Blind Adherence to Scientism**: Father clings to a single-minded belief in science, becoming obsessed with alchemy's power and viewing mankind as mere materials to achieve godhood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:33:00">[17:33:00]</a>.
*   **Rejection of Human Emotion**: Blinded by scientism, he discards human emotions, even literally ripping the Seven Deadly Sins from himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:51:00">[17:51:00]</a>.
*   **Ignorance of Autonomy**: His conviction in science's absolute supremacy leads to his undoing; he dismisses the souls trapped in the Philosopher's Stone as mere energy, failing to account for their autonomy, leading to their rebellion against him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:07:00">[18:07:00]</a>. Unlike Scar and others, Father refuses to recognize any human wisdom beyond alchemy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:52:00">[18:52:00]</a>.

Through the journeys of its diverse cast, *Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood* delivers a powerful cautionary tale about the blind adherence to any single ideology, whether science or faith, emphasizing the importance of critical thought, humility, and the integration of different forms of knowledge to achieve true wisdom and progress.

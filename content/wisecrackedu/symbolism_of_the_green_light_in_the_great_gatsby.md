The green light serves as a significant [[motifs_in_the_great_gatsby | motif]] and symbol within *The Great Gatsby* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>.

## Initial Symbolism
The green light is interpreted by some as symbolizing the fading optimism of [[the_american_dream_in_the_great_gatsby | Gatsby's dream]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>. At the beginning of the novel, the green light possesses a "burning quality" that excites Gatsby about the prospect of being with Daisy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>.

## Transformation of Symbolism
By the end of the book, the green light is depicted as merely "another lame ass green light," losing its special significance, much like the disillusionment of Gatsby's dreams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>.

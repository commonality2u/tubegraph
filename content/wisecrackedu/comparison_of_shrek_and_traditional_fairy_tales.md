From: [[wisecrackedu]] <br/> 

*Shrek* takes place in one of Earth's fairy-tale kingdoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. The film, the first winner of the Best Animated Feature Oscar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>, actively undermines the idealistic perfection often found in traditional fairy tale stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. It particularly targets Disney's superficial and overly sentimental approach to these narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

## Subversion of Fairy Tale Tropes

*Shrek* directly challenges common fairy tale elements and character archetypes:
*   **The Hero**: The protagonist, Shrek, is a large green ogre who lives alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. His initial actions, such as wiping his backside with a fairy tale book page and brushing his teeth with slime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>, are the antithesis of the glamorous entrances typically associated with traditional heroes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.
*   **The Princess**: Princess Fiona initially behaves like a stereotypical Disney princess, expecting to be rescued by a Prince Charming with acts of chivalry and grand gestures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. However, she is cursed to turn into an ogre every night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a> and ultimately remains an ogre after her curse is broken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   **The Villain/Prince Charming**: Lord Farquaad embodies the charming, regal figure often seen in fairy tales, but is depicted as the film's most odious character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

## [[Critique of Disney in Shrek | Anti-Disney Agenda]]

The film's [[critique_of_disney_in_shrek | anti-Disney agenda]] is a central theme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. Throughout the story, *Shrek* takes potshots at beloved characters associated with classic Disney intellectual property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>:
*   **Robin Hood**: Robert Hood and his merry men are portrayed as creepy Frenchmen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
*   **Cinderella**: Cinderella is presented as a "mentally abused shut-in" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
*   **Snow White**: Shrek dismisses Snow White as "just another piece of clutter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

Lord Farquaad's kingdom is also a clear parallel to Disneyland, featuring employees in costumes and incessant singing puppets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

## [[Themes of beauty and societal expectations in Shrek | Challenging Beauty Standards and "Happily Ever After"]]

*Shrek* directly criticizes the idea that beautiful people are destined for greater rewards than "normal," less valuable individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. Traditional fairy tales often conclude with the "lovely princess and handsome hero" living "happily ever after" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. *Shrek* rejects this by making both of its heroes "ugly" at the end, suggesting their marriage will be rocky and potentially end in divorce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. The film implies this "rocky" ending is a more deserved conclusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.

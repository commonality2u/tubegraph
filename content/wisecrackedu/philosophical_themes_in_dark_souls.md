The *Dark Souls* series, developed by Hidetaka Miyazaki, is characterized by its excruciatingly difficult gameplay and an incredibly cryptic, baffling storyline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. The game's plot is so obscure that Namco once offered $10,000 to anyone who could explain it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This deliberate lack of narrative clarity suggests that the plot may be a distraction, much like the methods of pioneering Italian filmmaker Michaelangelo Antonioni, who used deceptive plots to focus on character studies or the hollowness of societal norms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

Instead of traditional narrative, Miyazaki, often referred to as a "video game maestro," creates meaning in *Dark Souls* through [[visual_symbolism_in_dark_souls | visual design]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

## [[identity_and_desire_in_dark_souls | Identity and Desire]]

The core thematic focus of *Dark Souls* centers on [[identity_and_desire_in_dark_souls | identity and desire]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. The game challenges players to piece together a broken past and understand their true selves, even prompting players at the character creation screen with the question: "Is this your TRUE self?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. The experience is framed as a "nightmarish descent into the unconscious" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

### Birth Imagery and "Womb Raiding"

The games frequently employ explicit birth imagery.
*   **Starting Scenes:** *Dark Souls* begins with a visual birthing scene, where the camera plunges into a crevice resembling a vagina, through a tunnel like an ovary, and into a womb-like pit filled with emerging beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. *Dark Souls 2* reverses this, starting inside a labyrinth of tunnels from which the player must work their way out through a "vagina-like crevice into the light" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. This "tutorial" section is considered a symbolic womb from which the player is "born" to begin their quest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
*   **Recurring Visuals:** Womb and ovary-like landscapes are common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. The essential item "Humanity" in *Dark Souls 1* is deliberately shaped like a vagina <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. *Dark Souls 2* also features numerous "mother symbols" from the outset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.
*   **Beyond the Womb:** The theme continues with mysterious nests and eggs used for transport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>, egg monsters in The Demon Ruins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>, and the option to be infected with an "egg head" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. Pregnant monsters are encountered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.
*   **Bloodborne Connections:** *Bloodborne* extends this theme with characters discussing "bloody scenes of birth" and "screams of pregnant women" as players collect umbilical cord parts to reassemble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. The game concludes with a "bizarre, lovecraftian baby alien" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>, and visual elements like "blood dregs" resemble semen, while some speculate that the blood consumed by players could be menstrual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. The title "Bloodborne" itself suggests this theme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.
*   **"Womb Raiding":** Unlike typical "tomb raiding," *Dark Souls* presents a unique concept of "womb raiding," where players explore an "alien womb-world," seemingly trying to delve deeper into it rather than escape, in an attempt to uncover hidden secrets and their lost [[identity_and_desire_in_dark_souls | identity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

### Freudian Interpretations

Psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud believed that the complexity of [[identity_and_desire_in_dark_souls | identity]] leads individuals to look back to their very origins—the womb, and even further, to the "primal scene" of parental sex, which Freud posited is always dreamed of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. The opening line of *Dark Souls 2*, "perhaps you’ve seen it, maybe in a dream. A murky, forgotten land," references this concept of an endless search for a forgotten origin and [[identity_and_desire_in_dark_souls | identity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

*   **Castration Anxiety:** Though re-entering the mother's womb is impossible, *Dark Souls* explores this desire metaphorically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. Freud argued that social taboos, personified by the father, prevent access to the mother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. The game visually represents this with arched doorways that players want to access, but are blocked by male guards wielding large, "phallic weaponry" like swords and spears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. These "castrating figures" constitute the vast majority of enemies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. The boss "The Penetrator" in *Demon's Souls* is a direct example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. Swords, for Freud, are symbols of castration, with enemies metaphorically threatening to "cut off our dicks" as players try to reach the mother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.
*   **Impotence and Failure:** The frequent "You Died" screen in *Dark Souls* (an average of 739 times in *Dark Souls 2*) creates a constant feeling of failure and impotence, mirroring the atmosphere of Freudian castration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. Being defeated by hulking male giants wielding "formidable phalluses" further emphasizes this deflation of "manhood" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.
*   **Vagina Dentata:** Female enemies also embody castration anxiety. Scorpioness Najka and Mytha the Baneful in *Dark Souls 2* feature attractive top halves with weaponized bottom halves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. Queen Queelag has monstrous teeth instead of a vagina, symbolizing the "Vagina Dentata" (a vagina with teeth) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. This ancient folklore concept became important in psychoanalysis, representing a vagina with "penis decapitating fangs," and historically, chastity belts with metal teeth even made this myth a reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. Thus, *Dark Souls* visually embodies Freud's idea of castration anxiety by showing desire and then attacking or symbolically castrating the player, leaving them weak and unfulfilled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.

### Lacanian Unfulfillment

The ending of *Dark Souls 2* sees the hero re-entering a "very obviously vagina-like door" and being welcomed to "The Throne of Want" by a comforting female voice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. This throne, based on a "kiln" (historically associated with wombs), embodies "ultimate desire," where the deepest repressed wishes are fulfilled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

Despite the character achieving this satisfaction, the player often feels frustrated and unfulfilled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. This reflects the ideas of psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan, who argued that true fulfillment is impossible because as soon as a desire is attained, the desire itself ceases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. The Ancient Dragon in *Dark Souls 2* directly expresses this Lacanian argument: "the curse of life is the curse of want" – players are destined to be forever unfulfilled and unsatisfied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.

## Life and Death Metaphor

Miyazaki has stated that the *Dark Souls* games explore the "strange crossover between life and death," asking questions like "what is death, and for that matter, what is life?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>. Through this lens, *Dark Souls* can be seen as a metaphor for life itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>: development in the womb, birth, followed by endless desire, frustration, and misery, culminating in confronting death, which leads to a return to the "peaceful oblivion" of the mother's womb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. The series visualizes horrific unconscious desires, complicated relationships with birth, and the endless failure to be fulfilled with a "nightmarish flair" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.

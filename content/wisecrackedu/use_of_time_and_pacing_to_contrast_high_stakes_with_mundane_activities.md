Quentin Tarantino's *Pulp Fiction* upends traditional gangster and action films by trivializing their macho image and employing a cavalier attitude towards time and pacing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>. This approach contrasts high-stakes situations with mundane, everyday activities, often undercutting suspense and highlighting the film's theme of randomness and a world out of control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>.

## Undercutting Suspense with Casualness

Much of the humor in *Pulp Fiction* stems from a cavalier attitude about human-on-human violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>.
*   **Pre-Violence Banter:** At the beginning of the movie, hitmen Vincent and Jules are on their way to perform "conflict resolution" for their boss, despite being "undermanned and undergunned" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>. This situation, which should generate suspense, is instead filled with their casual gossip about TV pilots and foot massages, creating a breezy and relaxed scene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>.
*   **Trivializing Consequences:** After Vincent accidentally shoots Marvin, rendering him dead, there is no remorse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. Vincent and Jules are more concerned with bloodying Jimmie's towels than with the fact that they have taken a life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>.
*   **Tonal Juxtaposition:** In the torture dungeon, Maynard ominously states, "Nobody kills anybody in his place of business except him or Zed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>. This statement is immediately followed by a friendly door chime announcing Zed's arrival, a stark contrast to the dramatic music that most films would employ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>. This inversion of common cliches and tropes in *Rick and Morty* also appears here.

## Pacing Shifts During Crises

High-stakes situations are frequently undercut by characters moving at a slower, more mundane pace, directly [[critiques_of_inceptions_exposition_and_narrative_style | critiquing the pacing]] of traditional action and suspense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>.
*   **Mia's Overdose:** When Vincent frantically tries to save Mia after her overdose, his urgent actions are intercut with Lance calmly ingesting wet bread pellets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>. Later, while trying to find a medical book, Lance and his wife become sidetracked by petty squabbling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:00">[03:23:00]</a>.
*   **Butch's Delay:** Butch takes his "sweet time" picking a weapon while Marcellus Wallace is being raped in the background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>.

## Elevating the Mundane

Conversely, mundane things are often granted special significance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>.
*   **The Bathroom as a Focal Point:** The bathroom serves as a recurring focal point for many crucial scenes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>, echoing its common role in human lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>. Jules and Vincent are nearly killed by a man who lives in the bathroom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>.
*   **Vincent's Bathroom Curse:** Every time Vincent uses the bathroom, something bad happens, including the restaurant robbery, Mia's overdose, and his own death by shooting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>.

By trivializing important things and elevating trivial ones, *Pulp Fiction* suggests that life is random and filled with outrageous coincidences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>. This [[criticisms_of_action_scenes_and_plot_progression | narrative technique]] challenges the conventional expectations of genre films, where actions typically have clear, immediate consequences and dramatic events unfold with appropriate gravitas.

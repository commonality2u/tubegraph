The third season finale of *Rick and Morty*, titled "The Rickchurian Mortydate," continues the show's theme of flaunting the [[Rick and Morty and Existentialism | meaninglessness of our existence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. The series suggests that "Nothing you think matters matters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, as events are "happening infinite times across infinite realities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. The show frequently undermines authentic moments of love or emotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. This presents a challenge for [[Character development in Rick and Morty | character development]] when meaning is absent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

The series offers a solution that moves beyond simply spiraling deeper into nihilism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This growth is observed not in the titular protagonist, Rick, but in the matriarch of the Smith family, Beth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## "The Rickchurian Mortydate" Recap

The episode features Rick and Morty being called by the President for "X-Files shenanigans" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Rick and the President engage in an escalating conflict, deploying their vast arsenals against each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. However, Rick is distracted by a more pressing matter: Jerry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

The more significant subplot focuses on Beth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Following events from Episode 9, Beth questions whether she accepted Rick's offer to be replaced by a clone and if she is, in fact, a clone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. To resolve this, she seeks out Jerry, who recreates one of their first dates, rekindling their love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. Still concerned about being a "Blade Runner" clone, Beth runs into the woods with her family, where Rick appears, seemingly intending to kill Jerry and convince Beth she isn't a clone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

## Beth's Radical Freedom and Newfound Happiness

Rick previously informed Beth about the implications of her intelligence, stating:
> "Am I evil? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a> Worse. You’re smart. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a> When you know nothing matters the universe is yours and I’ve never met a universe that was into it." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>

Rick's usual response to this is "Don't think about it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. However, Beth is presented with radical freedom to choose her destiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>, which brings her solace regardless of whether she stays with or leaves her family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
> "I don't know if I can do it. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a> Then stay and luxuriate in a life you can finally know you've chosen. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a> My secret bonus is that no matter what you choose you're finally gonna chill the f*** out." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>

The episode suggests Beth chose to stay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>, resulting in a newfound happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. She becomes a "better mother" to Summer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>, finally loves Jerry, and brings her family back together, making things "like season 1" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Her rekindled love for Jerry, considered a "helpless parasite" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>, might seem unusual to some <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. While philosophical themes like Sartre's bad faith and radical freedom, or alienation vs. agency, could apply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>, another concept provides a unique explanation for Beth's paradigm shift.

## Amor Fati: The Love of Fate

Beth's concern about being a clone forces her to confront and question her past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. She ponders if her memories are her own and what that means for her future happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

This dilemma connects to "Amor Fati," a Latin phrase used by Friedrich Nietzsche meaning "Love of Fate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. Amor Fati is about the affirmation of life, becoming a "Yes-Sayer," unlike a corporate "Yes-Man" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. It's linked to the thought experiment "Eternal Recurrence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. This experiment asks if one would joyfully choose to infinitely relive every moment of their life—the good, the bad, and everything in between—without regret <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. This ultimate affirmation of life is Amor Fati <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a> and forms part of Nietzsche's strategy to escape the "crushing nihilism of existence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

Given Beth's existential crisis and intelligence, she must confront her past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. With Jerry, she relives a part of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. Although she may have initially disliked her life, including her date with Jerry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>, this time she becomes a Nietzschean Yes-Sayer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. Beth does not deny her past misery; Amor Fati is not about seeing "everything is a blessing in disguise," but rather about not shunning the "ugly aspects of our lives" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

She tells Jerry she is "no longer the woman he married" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. While Jerry is an "idiot" *("loooosssserrr")* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>, his "simplicity" may be what someone from a family history of using intelligence to justify sickness needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

Another "Amor Fati-esque" moment occurs when Beth believes Rick has come to "retire" her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. She functionally embraces being left with her family, choosing not to dwell on what "could have been," even if a version of her chose to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. Despite infinite universes with different choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>, she wants to stay in *this* one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

Nietzsche wrote about the "impossible task of 'knowing oneself'" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. Beth expresses a desire to know who she is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>:
> "I'm out of excuses to not be who I am. So, who am I? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a> What do I do?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>

For Nietzsche, the logic behind human actions is "impenetrable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. Applying this to Rick, fans rarely know what truly motivates him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. Rick himself admits:
> "I don't know. Maybe you matter so little that I like you. Or maybe, it makes you matter. Maybe I love you." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>

Ultimately, whether Beth was cloned or if any of it matters in infinite versions of herself is irrelevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. Nietzsche would argue that all one can do is "love our fate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>, which appears to be Beth's choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

## Beth's Ubermensch-like Happiness

While *Rick and Morty* often portrays Rick as a Nietzschean "ubermensch" battling a meaningless cosmos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>, Rick, in an "un-Ubermenschy way," doesn't truly create his own meaning. Instead, he engages in self-destructive behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. Beth, however, when faced with the cosmos's meaninglessness, finds happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>, which is a "pretty ubermenschy" act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

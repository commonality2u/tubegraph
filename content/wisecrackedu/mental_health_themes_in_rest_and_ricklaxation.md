The *Rick and Morty* Season 3 episode 6, "Rest and Ricklaxation," delves into the toxic aspects of the titular duo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. The episode is praised for its approach to character development and its exploration of interesting ideas about mental health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Premise of the Episode

After nearly dying repeatedly, Rick and Morty realize they are burned out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. They vacation at an alien spa and use a "mental detoxifier" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. This device allows them to separate from the parts of themselves they dislike most <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

The detoxified versions of Rick and Morty, referred to as "Healthy-Rick" and "Healthy-Morty," feel cleansed and rejuvenated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
*   **Healthy-Morty** loses his crippling self-doubt, becomes popular, and gets a date with Jessica <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
*   **Healthy-Rick** appears like a normal human being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

However, their "toxic" counterparts escape the detoxifier, causing chaos in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

## Anti-Character Development

One of the cleverest aspects of the episode is its "anti-character development" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. *Rick and Morty*'s co-creator, Dan Harmon, is a strict follower of Joseph Campbell's "The Hero's Journey" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. A common element of this narrative structure is the protagonist confronting their "shadow," a dark reflection they must overcome, similar to Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. This overcoming typically leads to new insights or character growth, such as Logan sacrificing himself or Luke Skywalker sparing Darth Vader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

In "Rest and Ricklaxation," Toxic Morty and Toxic Rick serve as literal "shadow" versions of themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. However, instead of overcoming these toxic traits, the episode is a journey for Rick and Morty to *reunite* with their worst selves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
*   Healthy-Morty, a smooth and popular individual, ultimately needs to rediscover his self-loathing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
*   Healthy-Rick, a thoughtful super-genius, needs to rediscover his narcissism and "irrational care for Morty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

The episode suggests that "regular" character development, which aims to remove negative traits, can actually be "creepy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

## Commentary on Mental Health and Self-Help Culture

The "anti-character development" also functions as a commentary on mental health in society, particularly questioning what it means to be mentally healthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. The episode acts as an extended parody of certain "healthy" attitudes promoted by [[critique_of_selfhelp_culture_in_rick_and_morty | self-help gurus]], popular media, and "life purpose cheerleaders" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

It critiques the idea that individuals must strive to eliminate any unpleasant or painful thoughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. Many "Insta-llectuals" advocate for uncritically loving oneself, saying yes to everything, and believing in oneself without reservation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. However, *Rick and Morty* illustrates that fully embodying these ideals can make one seem like a "coked-out weirdo" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

### Compulsory Happiness

The show touches on a concept discussed by sociologist William Davies in his book *The Happiness Industry*: "compulsory happiness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. Davies argues that in the modern world, corporations, managers, and advertisers promote a definition of mental health that serves a capitalist society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. This form of happiness involves "cheerfully accepting the status quo" and requires "constant self improvement" for the sake of being a better consumer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

Healthy-Morty embodies this, spouting platitudes that sound like they came from a self-help book and demanding others adopt his new lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. When confronted with real problems, he dismisses them, stating, "Trust me things are good. Taking that away from me… that wouldn’t be healthy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

### The Importance of Negative Emotions

The episode argues that many things the [[critique_of_selfhelp_culture_in_rick_and_morty | self-help industry]] seeks to erase, such as self-doubt and sadness, are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. For Morty, self-doubt is essential to prevent him from becoming a "full-on sociopath" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. Healthy-Morty transforms into an unscrupulous stockbroker, likened to a sociopathic Wall Street figure with excessive self-esteem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

Rick ultimately realizes that some of the less desirable parts of oneself, despite the pain they cause, are essential for true health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. Jessica confirms this when she tells Morty, "Good to have you back," implying his authentic, self-hating self is actually his better self <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

### Internal Inconsistency

Despite the strong message, an internal inconsistency is noted: the definition of "toxicity" is subjective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. Healthy-Rick expresses pride in being Morty's grandpa, but later claims his attachment to Morty is "irrational" and therefore "toxic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. This raises a question about whether his love for Morty is toxic or healthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

South Park creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker have not only achieved significant financial success, with a collective net worth of $800 million, but also consistently use their platform to critique the financial world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Despite being an ad-supported business, the show is not afraid to "bite the hand that feeds it," lampooning various aspects of the financial world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Challenging the "Little Guy" Bias in "Gnomes"

The episode "Gnomes" depicts a classic David-and-Goliath struggle between the massive corporate coffee chain Harbucks and the local, mom-and-pop coffee shop, Tweek Brothers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. South Park challenges the common bias towards small businesses, demonstrating that "sometimes, the little guy is actually a total asshole" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

Mr. Tweek, the owner of Tweek Brothers, is portrayed as a ruthless [[capitalism_and_small_businesses_in_south_park | capitalist]] who exploits his own son and uses children for media attention to keep his business afloat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. The idea that a small business might be driven by impure capitalist motives is an unfamiliar message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. The townspeople of South Park initially stereotype the rivalry as an innocent family business versus a big corporation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

Arguments in favor of big business are often met with "immature shouting" rather than reason or facts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. "Gnomes" highlights how "bald-faced appeals to emotion" can obscure the "cold, hard mechanisms of profit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. Mr. Tweek, despite his folksy marketing, proves to be even more cutthroat than his corporate rival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. The pre-teen protagonists are used as pawns to spread his anti-corporate message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

The townspeople exhibit a "programmatic response" of "small business good. Big corporation bad," without truly understanding Mr. Tweek's practices or the quality of Harbucks' coffee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. This phenomenon is explained by the backfire effect, where new, contrary information is dismissed if it threatens existing belief structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. The episode satirizes these hardwired biases, showing that small businesses, like small children, can be just as "scummy" as their larger counterparts, though less prolific <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. Both small and large businesses are ultimately "geared towards making a profit," regardless of the path to that objective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

## The Nuances of Value in "Cash for Gold"

"Cash for Gold" satirizes the exploitation of the elderly for massive profit, particularly through the Home Shopping Network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. The episode examines both the "predator and the prey" through the lens of value theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

While value is often dictated by supply and demand, the episode explores other forms of value:
*   **Financial Value** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>
*   **Social Value** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>
*   **Emotional Value** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>
*   **Historical Value** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>

These values are situational and fluid, influenced by intrinsic and extrinsic factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. An example is Stan's grandfather buying a bolo tie for $6000 from TV, only for it to be appraised at $15 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. The Home Shopping Network host, Dean, exploits market value by convincing elderly viewers they are getting "amazing deals" for items that have low material or resale value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. This "disconnect" between "high perceived value" and "low actual value" is the core of any scam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

The episode proposes that value is determined by the "nature of supply and demand," not necessarily by quality or production effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. Dean embodies a purely financial view of value, conceptualizing his entire life's work in monetary terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.

In contrast, Stan's grandpa's purchases are driven by a desire to "add emotional and historical value to himself," creating memories and sentimental connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. The episode shows how the "true value of nearly everything" is called into question, from an Academy Award being melted down for resale to Stan's framed photo gift to his grandfather having "astronomic emotional value but low market value" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

## The Brand as Value in "Go Fund Yourself"

"Go Fund Yourself" explores the loose relationship between labor and profit, as the South Park kids launch a successful brand without a tangible business behind it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. Their company, the Washington Redskins, thrives by "bastardization of modern Kickstarter culture," accepting donations for "no effort at all" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.

The episode suggests that, in the age of social media, the success of a brand can be rooted purely in its appearance rather than its function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. What a business does is less valuable than the power of its brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.

This concept aligns with philosopher Jean Baudrillard's argument in his 1981 work *Simulacra and Simulation* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. Baudrillard posited that previous definitions of value were inadequate; value is not determined by labor, materials, or usefulness, but "purely as the appearance of value" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. An item or brand's value is defined by its existence as an image in relation to other images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. Thus, having a great brand is more important than making great products, and being trendy for investors outweighs making cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. Baudrillard's ideas, such as Uber's multi-billion dollar valuation despite consistent losses, were predicted decades ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.

The kids' motto, "Start up, cash in, sell out, bro down," reflects the idea that ultimate success lies in "not doing anything at all" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. However, the episode ultimately shows the vulnerability of such a business. The Washington Redskins venture collapses due to "missteps on a social issue" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>. A business built only on aesthetics lacks "foundational beliefs" and has nowhere to turn when public opinion shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.

## Social Media and Perceived Value in "You Have Zero Friends"

"You Have Zero Friends" examines the "absurdities of our growing [[analysis_of_south_parks_approach_to_satire_and_internet_culture | social media economy]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. It tackles the true meaning of value in the context of digital friendships versus real-world interactions (referred to as "meatspace") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.

The episode portrays Facebook friendships, much like money, as creating an "easily measurable hierarchy of personal value" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>. Cartman, predictably, views relationships not as intrinsically joyful, but as "status symbols by which to elevate some people over others" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>. This echoes Baudrillard's warning in *The Consumer Society* that a transactional approach to relationships "leads to an individual lack, since everything possessed is relativized in relation to others" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>.

This troubling view infects Kyle, who, despite receiving real-world support from Stan during economic hardship, prioritizes his [[cultural_and_social_critiques_in_south_park | social status]] and drops his friend Kip from his Facebook roster to "salvage his own social standing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. South Park questions who we are when our online presence overshadows our real-world engagements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>. Even Wendy insists on online validation for her relationship with Stan, and Randy only believes in his connection with his son after being added on Facebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>.

The disjunction between digital and real-world lives threatens to place a greater premium on digital behavior, making physical life seem less significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. While others bolster their digital lives, Kip desperately tries to force his digital friendship into the "meat space" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>. The argument for cultivating an online brand is that "your cyber-influence casts a much wider net than you do alone," even if it's less authentic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>.

Beneath its crime drama fa√ßade, *Breaking Bad* is presented as a critique of struggling American healthcare and economic systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. These systems are depicted as environments in which both the highly educated Walter White and the "highly high" Jesse Pinkman routinely fail to thrive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

## Systemic Marginalization

Throughout Season One, Jesse Pinkman attempts to achieve societal legitimacy but is consistently marginalized by figures ranging from business professionals on Walnut Street to his own parents on Walnut Avenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

## The Failure of the American Dream

Walter White appears to be living what was once naively called the [[the_american_dream_and_its_failures | American Dream]], complete with a son bearing his name, a shiny plaque, and an audience with a "Supreme Galactic General" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. However, Walter struggles financially, only managing to bring home "sub-par bacon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. Despite making all "socially acceptable moves," the [[the_american_dream_and_its_failures | American Dream]] has failed Walt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

Walter's response to this failure is to "rage against the machine" and create a new alter ego, allowing him to attain the respect and mobility he craves only by operating outside the law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> Ironically, Walter's drastic measures to earn money for his cancer treatment transform him into a "societal cancer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. He gains energy for himself through transactions that contribute to the deterioration of other human beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. This raises the question of whether this outcome represents the [[the_american_dream_and_its_failures | American Dream]] or simply a "waking nightmare" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

[[Sausage Party movie analysis | Sausage Party]] is a 90-minute animated film by Seth Rogen and his writing partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Initially resembling a light-hearted Pixar or Disney offering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>, the film quickly shatters this saccharine tone to portray the sinister reality of its many genital metaphors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. At its core, the movie reflects the rampant disillusionment present during the "Middle Ages" of Earth's history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. It functions as a cynical parable of religion and its effects on societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

## The Supermarket's Religious System

In the film's alternate reality, groceries in a supermarket worship human customers as gods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. They believe that being purchased is equivalent to ascending to heaven, known as the "Great Beyond" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. This religious system was created by the non-perishable food items as a means to pacify society and protect the other foods from their own "stupid brains" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. The promise of the "Great Beyond" eases the foods' suffering, allowing them to face their impending demise with "plucky optimism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. This tactic directly illustrates [[Platos noble lie concept in Sausage Party | Plato's noble lie]] concept, which is a fictitious story used to persuade individuals to accept their societal roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

## Stereotypical Portrayals of Faith

The film reduces Earth's major religious groups to a hodgepodge of stereotypes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>:
*   **Christianity**: The sausages and buns, including protagonists Frank and Brenda, subscribe to a "Puritanical version of Christianity," despite strutting around naked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. They believe sex is only permissible after death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
*   **Judaism**: Represented by a bagel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
*   **Islam**: Kareem Abdul Lavash symbolizes the Muslim faith and is defined by his hatred for Jews and "regressive attitude toward bitches" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.
*   **Native American Spirituality**: Firewater symbolizes the "white conception of Native American spirituality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.
*   **Nazism**: The Nazis are also present "just for kicks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

## Challenging Faith and Disillusionment

Faith is presented as an important element in the foodie community, as the "noble lie" works best when people do not ask too many questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. When a jar of honey mustard returns from the "Great Beyond" (after killing himself) and tries to warn everyone that the afterlife is a lie, he is ridiculed and silenced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. Characters are reluctant to "slide open the Ziploc bag of faith they've worked so hard to seal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.

The protagonist, Frank, seeks out Firewater, who reveals that the "Great Beyond" is "Fake Beyond" because it's "made up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. This is corroborated by the brutal slaughter of groceries that were previously purchased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. The only way to truly challenge this stubborn belief system is through "incontrovertible proof" like a severed human head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

## Embracing Hedonism

After the truth about their existence is revealed, the film's ultimate message is to [[hedonism_as_a_theme_in_sausage_party | embrace hedonism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. The narrative suggests there is no point in living life in anticipation of a "pot of gold at the end of the rainbow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>, as food items will either be eaten, digested, or thrown away to rot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. Therefore, the foods should put aside their differences and pursue as much pleasure as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. This culminates in a store-wide, "non denominational fuckfest" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

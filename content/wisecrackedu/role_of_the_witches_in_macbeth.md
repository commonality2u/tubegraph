In William Shakespeare's *Macbeth*, three witches play a pivotal role in setting the course of the play's tragic events by delivering prophecies that fuel [[macbeths_ambition_and_downfall | Macbeth's ambition]] and seal his fate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Initial Prophecies

After returning from battle, [[macbeths_ambition_and_downfall | Macbeth]] and Banquo encounter three witches who provide them with significant prophecies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>:
*   The witches foretell that [[macbeths_ambition_and_downfall | Macbeth]] will become king <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
*   They also predict that Banquo's descendants will eventually become kings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

These initial prophecies excite [[macbeths_ambition_and_downfall | Macbeth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a> and contribute to [[macbeths_ambition_and_downfall | his decision]] to murder King Duncan to seize the crown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. The prophecy concerning Banquo's lineage later causes [[macbeths_ambition_and_downfall | Macbeth]] to plot Banquo's assassination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.

## Further Prophecies

Later in the play, [[macbeths_ambition_and_downfall | Macbeth]] seeks out the three witches again for more insights into his future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>. They deliver a new set of prophecies:
*   An armored head warns him to beware Macduff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>.
*   A bloody child states that no one "born of a woman" can harm him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>.
*   A crowned child holding a tree proclaims that [[macbeths_ambition_and_downfall | Macbeth]] will remain safe until Great Birnam Wood comes to his castle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>.

These ambiguous prophecies give [[macbeths_ambition_and_downfall | Macbeth]] a false sense of security, leading him to commit further atrocities, such as ordering the slaughter of Macduff's family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>. However, these prophecies eventually contribute to [[macbeths_ambition_and_downfall | his downfall]] when Birnam Wood appears to move as Malcolm's army uses tree branches as camouflage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>, and Macduff, who was "from his mother's womb / Untimely ripped" (i.e., born by C-section), ultimately confronts and beheads [[macbeths_ambition_and_downfall | Macbeth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>.

## Interpretations of their Influence

The witches' role is central to the tragedy. They can be seen as:
*   **Catalysts for Ambition** The witches are directly blamed for "feedin his ambition and givin him a big ol head" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. Their words ignite the spark of ambition within [[macbeths_ambition_and_downfall | Macbeth]], pushing him towards regicide.
*   **Agents of Fate** Some interpretations suggest that the witches are not merely instigators but rather agents of fate, "slingin him around like a puppet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>. If [[macbeths_ambition_and_downfall | Macbeth]] has "no choice" in his actions due to destiny, then his suffering could be seen as predetermined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>.
*   **Reflectors of Society** The witches' prophecies, combined with the prevailing societal values that rewarded power gained through violence ("you ainâ€™t got a pair unless you grab all the power you can, no matter who you gotta kill for it") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>, contribute to [[macbeths_ambition_and_downfall | Macbeth's downfall]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>.

The witches' prophecies, whether seen as causes or symptoms of [[macbeths_ambition_and_downfall | Macbeth's character]], ultimately lead to [[macbeths_ambition_and_downfall | his tragic end]] and the restoration of order in Scotland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>.

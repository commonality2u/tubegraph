The three witches play a pivotal role in the tragic downfall of [[summary_of_macbeth | Macbeth]] by initiating a chain of events through their prophetic declarations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Initial Prophecies

After [[summary_of_macbeth | Macbeth]] and Banquo defeat their enemies, they encounter three witches who deliver potent prophecies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
They foretell that [[summary_of_macbeth | Macbeth]] will one day become king <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Additionally, they prophesy that while Banquo will not be king, his descendants will occupy the throne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. These predictions immediately excite [[summary_of_macbeth | Macbeth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Influence on Macbeth's Actions

The witches' prophecies directly influence [[summary_of_macbeth | Macbeth]]'s actions. Driven by the vision of kingship and spurred on by [[character_analysis_of_macbeth_and_lady_macbeth | Lady Macbeth]], he murders King Duncan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>, eventually taking the crown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Later, remembering the witches' prophecy about Banquo's lineage, [[summary_of_macbeth | Macbeth]] becomes paranoid and arranges for Banquo's murder, though Banquo's son Fleance escapes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

## Second Set of Prophecies

Later in the play, [[summary_of_macbeth | Macbeth]] seeks out the three witches again for more insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. They deliver a new set of ominous prophecies:
*   An armored head warns him to beware of Macduff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
*   A bloody child tells him that no one "born of a woman" can harm him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
*   A crowned child holding a tree assures him that he is safe until Great Birnam Wood comes to his castle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

Believing himself invincible due to these predictions, [[summary_of_macbeth | Macbeth]] becomes even more ruthless, ordering the killing of Macduff's entire family when he learns Macduff has fled to England <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

## Fulfillment of Prophecies

The witches' prophecies ultimately come to fruition, leading to [[summary_of_macbeth | Macbeth]]'s downfall:
*   When Malcolm's army approaches the castle, [[summary_of_macbeth | Macbeth]] initially dismisses the threat until he realizes the soldiers are using shields made from the wood of Birnam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
*   On the battlefield, [[summary_of_macbeth | Macbeth]] confronts Macduff, confident that no one born of a woman can harm him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. However, Macduff reveals he was born via C-section, effectively not "born of a woman" in the traditional sense, and subsequently beheads [[summary_of_macbeth | Macbeth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

## Role in Macbeth's Fate

The witches are seen as significant contributors to [[summary_of_macbeth | Macbeth]]'s "boot-leg [[fate_and_free_will_in_macbeth | fate]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. They "feed his [[themes_of_ambition_and_power_in_macbeth | ambition]] and giv[e] him a big ol head," putting "more pressure on him than he can handle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

Some interpretations suggest that [[summary_of_macbeth | Macbeth]] is not entirely to blame for his actions, as [[fate_and_free_will_in_macbeth | fate]] may have been "slingin him around like a puppet, making him act like a serious fool" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. If [[summary_of_macbeth | Macbeth]] truly had no choice, then his actions, influenced by the witches and [[fate_and_free_will_in_macbeth | fate]], become "straight meaningless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

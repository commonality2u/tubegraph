Villains are often considered the best part of a movie, frequently eliciting reactions from love-to-hate to empathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Recently, many viewers have found themselves relating to the logic of antagonists like Killmonger from *Black Panther* or Screenslaver from *The Incredibles 2*, as these characters are equipped with "cogent critiques of the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. Villainy has always been a reflection of the value systems and fears prevalent at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

Understanding the [[comparative_analysis_of_villains_1950s_to_present | evolution of villains]] requires exploring how film antagonists embody the spirit and anxieties of their eras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. While not absolute, noticeable trends exist among enduring films across different periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

## The Cold War Era: 1950s and Early 1960s

In the post-World War II period, American society often perceived the world in black and white terms, with itself as the hero against evil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. Consequently, villains were typically one-dimensional, embodying a simplistic "us vs. them" mentality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

### The "Other" as Inherent Evil

Movie screens were filled with "bad Russian people, bad Asian people, and very bad aliens" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. These "others" were depicted as inherent, inexplicable evils focused on destroying America and its values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

Examples include:
*   The amorphous "red-for-commie Blob" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>
*   The Creature from the Black Lagoon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>
*   The aliens in *The Invasion of the Body Snatchers*, which some critics viewed as representing the fear of Communist brainwashing and infiltration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>

### Biblical Epics and Propaganda

The 1950s also saw a resurgence of biblical sagas, which were massively popular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. These films perfectly embodied Cold War propaganda by depicting a face-off between "God-fearing Americans and the godless communists" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. Examples such as *Ben Hur*, *Quo Vadis*, and *The Ten Commandments* portrayed noble "Judeo-Christians" battling cruel, powerful despots of non-monotheistic religions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. These villains symbolized larger groups aiming to undermine American life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

### Anti-American and Spy Villains

Even when not explicitly foreign or pagan, villains were often anti-American, Communist double agents in Cold War propaganda films <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. The spy mania of the 1960s, exemplified by James Bond facing agents of SMERSH, also reflected Cold War anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. These villains were "pure and simply evil" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

## Social Turbulence and Systemic Corruption: Late 1960s and 1970s

The late 1960s and 1970s saw a definitive shift in villain portrayal, moving away from one-dimensional foreign adversaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. This period of major social turbulence, marked by the Civil Rights Movement and the Vietnam War, revealed less-than-perfect aspects of America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. A startling drop in public trust of government, fueled by outrage over the war and the Nixon tapes, dramatically changed movie villains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

### Corrupt Institutions and Officials

1970s movies began shining a light on corrupt social systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
*   *All the President’s Men* (1976) brought the Watergate scandal to the big screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
*   Steven Spielberg’s *Jaws* depicted a crooked mayor prioritizing tourism revenue over public safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.
*   In *Chinatown*, the sinister billionaire claimed his evil acts were brought about by his environment, suggesting that "circumstances of power make the villain, rather than any innate nature" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

Corrupt cop films were also popular, with *Serpico* depicting police corruption as an assumed fact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. Other films featuring corrupt institutions and law enforcement included *The Godfather*, *White Lightning*, *The French Connection*, and *The Conversation* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. Institutions were losing their presumption of goodwill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

Villains began to embody these broken systems:
*   Nurse Ratched in *One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest* transformed a benevolent profession into one that debilitated individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.
*   Films like *East from Alcatraz* and *Cool Hand Luke* portrayed prisoners as sympathetic heroes struggling against evil wardens or oppressive law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.
*   The person tasked with imposing law or societal norms was recast as the villain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.

### Blurring Lines: Anti-Heroes and Villain-Protagonists

The 1970s further muddied the waters by blurring the line between hero and villain, depicting characters as conflicted, heavily-flawed protagonists with questionable morals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. These were often "villains of circumstance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.

Examples include:
*   Walter White from *Breaking Bad*, who evolves from an anti-hero to a villain protagonist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.
*   Travis Bickle in Martin Scorsese’s *Taxi Driver* (1976), oscillating between violent good and bad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.
*   Sonny Wortzik in *Dog Day Afternoon* (1975), a sympathetic bank robber motivated by a noble cause (to fund his wife's sexual reassignment surgery) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.

Despite this trend, *Star Wars* stood out as a remarkably simplistic good vs. evil paradigm in this era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.

## Re-Embracing the "Other": The 1980s

The 1980s saw a backpedal on the anti-villain trend, with a resurgence of more cartoonish villains who directly embodied the biggest threats of the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>. This ushered back an "us vs. them" paradigm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

### The War on Drugs and "Evil" Drug Lords

Fears surrounding the War on Drugs led to villains focused on drug money in films like *Scarface*, *To Live & Die in L.A.*, *Beverly Hills Cop*, and *Raw Deal* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. This depiction of evil drug lords served as a counterpoint to the less-than-savory cops of the 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>. Films like *Tango & Cash* portrayed "rougish cops" as irrepressible protagonists despite their violent methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.

### Cold War II and "Evil Russians"

The decade also witnessed a resurgence of Cold War anxieties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.
*   "Evil Russians" had their moment, notably with Soviet boxer Ivan Drago in *Rocky IV*, accused of being anti-Soviet propaganda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.
*   *Red Heat* featured Soviet drug lord Viktor Rostavili as a "trifecta of evil" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.
*   *Red Dawn* (1984) imagined a Soviet invasion of America, explicitly intended as a warning to Americans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.

### Hints of Skepticism: Corrupt Institutions for Personal Gain

Despite the return to "the other as the enemy," hints of 1970s skepticism towards institutions persisted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>. When not pure caricatures, villains exploited corrupt institutions for personal gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.
*   Gordon "Greed is Good" Gekko in *Wall Street* used the corrupt financial industry for personal desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.
*   Hans Gruber in *Die Hard* (1988) initially posed as a terrorist exacting revenge on a corporation but was ultimately revealed to be after money, much like Gordon Gekko <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>.

## Domestic Terrorism and Philosophical Motivations: The 1990s

The 1990s saw American cinema swap out foreign "reds" for homegrown terrorists, reflecting a decade dominated by headlines of domestic terrorism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. This era was prime for complex anti-villains fighting localized battles through radical means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.

These villains often had motivations beyond simple greed, hinting at philosophical underpinnings:
*   Howard Payne in *Speed* (1994) was motivated by money but also expressed a sense of superiority and a desire for "meaning" and "purpose," albeit through destructive means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>.
*   John Doe in *Se7en* (1995) saw himself as a "chosen" warrior on a crusade against everyday sin, "setting the example" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.
*   *Arlington Road* (1999) featured a domestic terrorist claiming a lofty noble goal as a "messenger" spreading a word, coupled with an indictment of Clinton-era prosperity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>.
*   Frank Fitts in *American Beauty* (1999), a homophobic neighbor, felt victimized by the system and sought justice on his own terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>.

Some villains even had genuinely noble causes, railing against systems that wronged them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. General Hummel in *The Rock* (1996) held San Francisco hostage to demand compensation for the families of slain Marines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>. This raised the question of whether noble ends justify violent means, acting as a prelude to questions explored by modern villains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>.

## Terrorism and Nihilism: The 2000s

The 2000s saw a new shift in movie villains, as America confronted an existential threat to its sense of safety and power following 9/11 and the War on Terror <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>.

### The Spirit of Terrorism and Chaos

Christopher Nolan’s *Dark Knight Trilogy* captured the popular imagination.
*   In *Batman Begins* (2005), the League of Shadows and Ra's al Ghul represent an international terrorist group wanting to destroy Gotham's tallest skyscraper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>.
*   Heath Ledger’s [[the_jokers_origin_and_evolution_in_comics_and_film | Joker]] in *The Dark Knight* (2008) manifested as "the spirit of terrorism," an embodiment of "anarchy and chaos of a particularly destructive and nihilistic nature" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>. The film is noted for being "bursting with 9/11 iconography" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>.
*   Harvey Dent (Two-Face) in *The Dark Knight* represented how confrontation with the Joker's evil could corrupt even the noblest person, leading to a "meaningless existence of pure contingency and nihilism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.

### Active Nihilism

Anton Chigurh from the Coen Brothers’ *No Country For Old Men* also used a coin to decide victims' fates, not out of greed or self-defense, but from "principles that transcend money or drugs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>. Chigurh is an active nihilist who believes that if all morality is contrived, a coin flip is as good a way as any to decide who lives or dies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>.

Frank Costello in Martin Scorsese's *The Departed* (2006), a gangster, likewise acted as if life was meaningless, with any actions sustaining oneself being excusable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>. The 2000s were a time when "the villainous creed was no creed at all" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>.

## [[contemporary_villains_and_their_philosophies | Contemporary Villains]] and Radical Solutions: The 2010s to Present

Today's villains are a product of an increasingly divided America, reflecting innate skepticism towards all systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>. These villains embody solutions that are "way too radical and usually mind-bogglingly violent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>.

Unlike 1950s villains who infiltrated good systems to corrupt them, today's villains increasingly face "objectively evil systems which they want to change for the better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>. Their villainy lies solely in their extreme means of enacting change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>.

### Relatable Grievances and Radical Means

[[relatable_villains_and_social_critiques | Contemporary villains]] often present legitimate critiques of the world:
*   **Killmonger** in *Black Panther* (2018) has a legitimate critique of how the world treats black citizens and Wakanda’s passivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>. He aims to instigate a militant uprising by shipping Wakandan weapons globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>. While defeated, his radicalism leads to positive policy changes in Wakanda, such as ending its isolationism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:36">[00:19:36]</a>.
*   **August Walker/John Lark** in *Mission: Impossible – Fallout* (2018) wants to destroy a third of the world to unite the remaining two-thirds, believing "the greater the suffering, the greater the peace" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:43">[00:19:43]</a>.
*   **Thanos** in *Avengers: Infinity War* (2018) seeks to kill half the universe's population to solve resource scarcities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>.
*   **Screenslaver** in *The Incredibles 2* (2018) criticizes how consumable media and superheroes have made people passive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:08">[00:20:08]</a>. Her plan is to mind-control superheroes to ruin their public approval ratings, forcing people to protect themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>. This film also implicitly comments on [[critique_of_superhero_tropes | superhero tropes]].

These villains share an "out-there plan that appeals to our country’s growing fears that the world is screwed beyond repair, and the only way to fix it is to tear it down" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:33">[00:20:33]</a>. Audiences can empathize with the villain’s critique of the system and their desire for change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:44">[00:20:44]</a>. Heroes in this context are often cast as slightly-flawed protectors of an unsatisfying status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:52">[00:20:52]</a>.

Contemporary villains are a "weird mirror image of 50’s villains," aiming for good change in corrupt institutions through very bad ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>. They have merged the complexity and apparent innocence of 90s villains, broadened the social critiques of the 70s, and stand in opposition to the nihilism of the 2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:14">[00:21:14]</a>. They believe in a cause worth fighting for, suggesting that with different blueprints for social change, they might even resurface as "complex heroes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a>.

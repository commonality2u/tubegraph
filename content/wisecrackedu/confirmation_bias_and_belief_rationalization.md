The *Rick and Morty* episode "Get Schwifty" delves into the complexities of human belief systems and the ways individuals rationalize their thinking, often to the point of absurdity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. It scrutinizes the reasoning behind belief structures, not merely religious practices, exposing [[logical_fallacies_explored_in_get_schwifty | fallacies]] in various beliefs people hold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

## Over-Rationalization and Belief Persistence

[[Exploration of Human Beliefs and Perception | People]] do not simply adopt irrational beliefs; instead, they may over-rationalize their thoughts to extreme conclusions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. Cognitive psychologists suggest that pseudo-scientific belief systems, such as those held by doomsday cults, psychics, and conspiracy theorists, are resilient because they are supported by the [[structure_of_human_belief_and_cognition_in_rick_and_morty | structure of the human brain]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. These belief systems propagate through appeals to rationality rather than through deception or widespread ignorance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

The human brain is naturally inclined to seek logical conclusions and simple explanations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. Individuals tend to believe what aligns with their existing worldview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. This can manifest in people preferring to consume and share news that matches their political beliefs, or developing elaborate justifications for supporting their favorite sports team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

## Confirmation Bias

The phenomenon where individuals seek out and interpret information that confirms their pre-existing beliefs is known as [[structure_of_human_belief_and_cognition_in_rick_and_morty | confirmation bias]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. [[structure_of_human_belief_and_cognition_in_rick_and_morty | Confirmation bias]] can explain why people are willing to overlook significant flaws in their belief systems, particularly when doing so offers a personal benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

For example, in "Get Schwifty," Summer's parents, Beth and Jerry, tolerate the Headist cult's potentially dangerous practices because Summer is thriving within the cult, not getting pregnant, doing drugs, or missing curfew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

## Broader Implications

These [[logical_fallacies_explored_in_get_schwifty | fallacies]] and biases are not exclusive to [[critique_of_religion_and_belief_systems_in_rick_and_morty | religion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. While *Rick and Morty* frequently satirizes [[critique_of_religion_and_belief_systems_in_rick_and_belief_systems_in_rick_and_morty | religion]], post-hoc rationalization is an inherent aspect of the human cause-and-effect thought process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Even the [[audience_complicity_in_media_narratives | audience]] can be misled by the brain's tendency to accept [[logical_fallacies_explored_in_get_schwifty | logical fallacies]], as demonstrated by Rick's snake and wristwatch trick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. This trick plays on the brain's desire to attribute event A as the cause of event B, when the reality is a particle beam in the wristwatch and a snake holster on the leg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

The show uses irony to highlight that cosmic events, which might form the basis of a [[critique_of_religion_and_belief_systems_in_rick_and_morty | religion]], can be based on entirely inaccurate or mundane realities, such as a reality TV show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. This approach extends to challenging the ability to make predictions and comprehend the complexity of existence itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. This relentless critique, where nothing, not even [[critique_of_religion_and_belief_systems_in_rick_and_morty | belief]], is safe, differentiates *Rick and Morty* from other contemporary satire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

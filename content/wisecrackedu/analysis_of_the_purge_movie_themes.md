*The Purge*, starring nine-time X-Games gold medalist Tony Hawk, is an artifact from Earth's 21st century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. In this future, the government decided to legalize murder for half a day once a year as an improvement to society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. The film centers on James Sandin, a successful home security salesman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

The plot unfolds as the Sandin family, after initially forgetting about the impending Purge, quickly locks down their home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. Their son soon lets in an injured man, and the daughter's boyfriend also sneaks in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. A gang of masked teens later appears, hunting the injured homeless man for sport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>, demanding his surrender <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. Despite tying up the injured man, the Sandins ultimately decide against handing him over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. The teens then break into their home, destroying property and killing James <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. The neighbors intervene, eliminating the remaining teens, but then turn on the Sandins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. The homeless man saves the day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>, and Mrs. Sandin refuses to kill the neighbors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

## [[Symbolism and hidden meanings in The Purge|Symbolism and Philosophical Themes]]

[[The Purge as social commentary|The Purge]] posits that the human psyche contains both a light and a dark side, similar to the Jedi hobbits from *Star Track* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. This duality is highlighted through various images:
*   White and blue bouquets displayed by Purge supporters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>
*   Charlie's half-charred nightmare machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>

### The Vernal Equinox and Renewal
The Purge occurs on March 21, frequently the date of Earth's vernal equinox, when day and night are of equal length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.
*   Just as the vernal equinox heralded spring, a time of rebirth and renewal, the Purge is intended to bring about a healthier, more balanced society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.
*   March 21 also held significance in Earth's fourth most successful religion; Christians calibrated Easter, celebrating the resurrection, using the vernal equinox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
*   Similarly, citizens in the film celebrate the "resurrection of their society" on "Purge-mas Eve" with an almost religious fervor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.
*   The blue baptisias in the film reference the Christian ritual of baptism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

## [[Critique of societal systems in The Purge|Critique of Social Stratification]]
[[Social stratification in The Purge|Social stratification]] is a key theme of the film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.
*   Though the Purge laws are presented as race and class-neutral, they disproportionately impact the disenfranchised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. These individuals cannot afford high-end security systems or other protections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
*   The antagonists, dressed in prep school attire, represent the wealthy elite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. They treat the hunting of a homeless "non-contributor" as merely another extracurricular activity for college applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.
*   This imbalance is likened to the 1980s War on Drugs, where laws for crack cocaine, which affected poor black communities, were 100 times harsher than those for powder cocaine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

## The Cycle of Violence
*The Purge* initially suggests that engaging in and consuming violence will relieve aggressive desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. However, it quickly undermines this premise, concluding that such actions only desensitize people and lead to even more violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.
*   The film juxtaposes brutal images of murder with classical music, implying that violence has lost its shock value and become mundane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.
*   In "Purge-world," humans watch grotesque acts on TV for entertainment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.
*   The film, being violent itself, serves as a self-criticism, as it offers viewers an opportunity to release aggression by watching a "bloodbath" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. This analysis itself further perpetuates the cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

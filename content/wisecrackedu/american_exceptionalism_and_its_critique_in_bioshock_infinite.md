The *Bioshock* series is recognized for its ability to effectively integrate philosophical concepts into its plot, combining elements of survival horror, RPGs, and FPS games with intellectual sophistication rarely seen in gaming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. While the first *Bioshock* game explores [[ayn_rands_objectivism_and_its_influence_on_bioshock | Ayn Rand's Objectivism]], *Bioshock Infinite* delves into American Exceptionalism and its problematic historical implications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

## Columbia: A Manifestation of Ideology

The third installment of the *Bioshock* series shifts its setting from the underwater city of Rapture to the floating city of Columbia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. Columbia, a "floating Eden" and a play on the United States Capital, was founded by Zachary Hale Comstock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. Comstock serves as a fictional parallel to the 19th-century New York political figure Anthony Comstock, known for his fight against obscenity and his prudish values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. The character Comstock also mirrors Anthony's public feud with anarchist Emma Goldman, who is represented by Daisy Fitzroy in the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

Comstock established Columbia with the promise of providing a sanctuary for "God’s people," separated from the "world of sinners in the Sodom below" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

## American Exceptionalism as Justification

The image of Columbia as a "shining beacon in the sky" is philosophically justified by the concept of American Exceptionalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. This belief posits that the New World was promised to God’s chosen people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. Through this philosophy, *Bioshock Infinite* offers a satire of America's historical landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

American Exceptionalism functions as a means of justifying a particular lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. Columbia, like America, is presented as "God’s country," incorporating religious themes such as forgiveness of sins, salvation, and baptism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

## Critique and the "Dark Side" of the Philosophy

Despite its seemingly utopian ideals, *Bioshock Infinite* explores the "dark side" of American Exceptionalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. Historically, the expansion into the new frontier was justified as a "mission from God" to prevent the new world from "backslid[ing] like the old world sinners of Europe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. America was envisioned as a land populated by "exceptional, chosen people," deemed exempt and superior to the rest of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

This ideology, secularized as Manifest Destiny, justified and demanded the extermination of indigenous people in the "wilderness" (Native Americans) to secure the national identity of Christian settlers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. Those who refused to accept Christianity were forcibly displaced or eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.

The ideology of American Exceptionalism is deeply intertwined with historical injustices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. Slavery, labor strikes, and the abuses faced by Irish and Chinese workers who built the American Railroad system were all rationalized by the lofty goal of a promised city for God’s people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

Columbia is depicted as a paranoid society, fearful of the anarchist Vox Populi, threatened by Irish and Chinese immigrants, and apprehensive of racial mixing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. *Infinite* directly confronts America’s troubled past:
*   The Battle of Wounded Knee, marking the end of the U.S. and Indian wars, is celebrated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.
*   Laws enforcing racial segregation for relationships and marriage are commonplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.
*   Lynching is not only the norm but also widespread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.

This critique is further emphasized by the robotic George Washington enemies, known as "Patriots," encountered in the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

*Bioshock Infinite* challenges the simplistic "Us versus Them" dichotomy, exposing the paranoia and questioning the conventional notions of good guys, bad guys, freedom fighters, revolutionaries, dictators, and terrorists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. The game presents players with morally complex "choices," such as whether to throw a ball at an interracial couple or a racist announcer, highlighting the deeply ingrained societal issues it critiques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. This ties into the broader theme of [[the_illusion_of_choice_and_free_will_in_the_bioshock_series | the illusion of choice and free will in the Bioshock series]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

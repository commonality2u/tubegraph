The third installment of the *Bioshock* series, *Bioshock Infinite*, moves the setting from the underwater city of Rapture to the floating city of Columbia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. Columbia, a play on the United States Capital, is presented as a floating Eden founded by Zachary Hale Comstock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

## Zachary Hale Comstock and Columbia's Founding
Zachary Hale Comstock is a fictional stand-in for nineteenth-century New York political figure Anthony Comstock, known for his fight against obscenity and prudish values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. The character Comstock mirrors Anthony's public feud with anarchist Emma Goldman, who is paralleled by Daisy Fitzroy in the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

Comstock founded Columbia with the promise of providing a place for "God's people," separate from the "world of sinners" below <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

## American Exceptionalism as Justification
The image of Columbia as a shining beacon in the sky is philosophically justified by the concept of American Exceptionalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. [[American Exceptionalism and its critique in Bioshock Infinite | American Exceptionalism]] is the belief that the "New World" was promised to God's chosen people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

Through this philosophy, *Bioshock Infinite* offers a satire of America's historical landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. [[American Exceptionalism and its critique in Bioshock Infinite | American Exceptionalism]] serves as a way of justifying a particular lifestyle, where Columbia, like America, is considered "God's country" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. Themes of forgiveness of sins, salvation, and baptism are religious elements explored in *Infinite* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

## Critique of American Exceptionalism
Similar to its predecessor, *Bioshock Infinite* explores the dark side of this philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.

The expansion into the new frontier was justified as a mission from God to ensure the new world didn't "backslide like the old world sinners of Europe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. America was meant to be a land populated by exceptional, chosen people, exempt from and above the rest of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

This ideology, secularized as Manifest Destiny, justified and demanded the extermination of indigenous people, also known as Native Americans, in the "wilderness" for the sake of securing the national identity of Christian settlers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. Those unwilling to accept Christianity were forcibly moved or eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

### Historical Justifications and Societal Issues
[[American Exceptionalism and its critique in Bioshock Infinite | American Exceptionalism]] is deeply woven into the fabric of history, justifying various societal injustices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>:
*   Slavery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>
*   Labor strikes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>
*   Abuses of Irish and Chinese workers who built the American Railroad system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>

These actions were all justified by the lofty goal of a "promised city for God's people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

Columbia, fearful of the anarchist Vox Populi, the "Irish and Chinese threat," and racial mixing, is depicted as a paranoid place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.

### America's Haunted Past
*Bioshock Infinite* explores America's haunted past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>:
*   The Battle of Wounded Knee, considered the end of the U.S. and Indian wars, is heralded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.
*   Laws enforcing racial segregation for relationships and marriage are commonplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.
*   Lynching is not just the norm, but commonplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.

The game's enemies, robotic George Washingtons called "Patriots," symbolize this dark side of American history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

### Challenging Dichotomies
*Bioshock Infinite* exposes the paranoia of an "Us versus Them" dichotomy, challenging conceptions of good guys and bad guys, freedom fighters, revolutionaries, dictators, and terrorists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. The game presents the prospect that the hero, Booker Dewitt, is simultaneously the villain, like Comstock and Andrew Ryan, revealing that in another dimension the hero is the villain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. This complexity challenges player choice, forcing decisions like killing or saving Little Sisters, or throwing a ball at an interracial couple versus a racist announcer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.

*Deadpool* achieved unprecedented popularity in mainstream media, becoming the highest-grossing R-rated movie ever and the biggest opening for Ryan Reynolds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Its success is notable for shirking the traditional superhero formula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Shifting from Traditional Superhero Formula

Unlike traditional superheroes, Deadpool does not fight for the greater good, is not selfless, and is not family-friendly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. Despite being a Marvel character described as an overt ripoff of a DC competitor, Deadpool constantly makes fun of the comic book medium it inhabits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

A defining feature that sets Deadpool apart is its self-awareness and constant breaking of the fourth wall, commenting on comic book tropes and culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. [[Postmodernism and Self-Awareness in Deadpool | Deadpool]] takes nothing seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>, even its ad campaign was designed in a "Deadpoolian fashion," exemplified by Valentine's Day ads and a Tinder profile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## A Postmodern Work

[[Postmodernism and Self-Awareness in Deadpool | Deadpool]] is best described as a postmodern work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. Postmodernism is a movement in the arts and philosophy that typically rejects grand narratives, such as the battle of good versus evil or the inherent promise of technological progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. Postmodern works often reject tradition, embrace being "meta," and heavily utilize self-reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

### Rejection of Grand Narratives

Deadpool is hyper-aware of itself and its place in the superhero genre <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. It is full of self-referential jokes, including references to Ryan Reynolds' past roles like "The Green Lantern," his "Sexiest Man Alive" title, or his more appreciated counterpart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

If the grand narrative of superhero films is the triumph of good over evil, Deadpool, in postmodern fashion, disregards it. There is no grand battle; instead, it's about a character seeking revenge and love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

### Self-Awareness and Subversion

The film plays out the tension between old-world narratives and postmodernism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. Colossus constantly tries to pull Deadpool into the role of a traditional, family-friendly superhero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. The Dopinder subplot subverts classic narratives of courtly love by having the rival kidnapped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. Blind Al is a "deranged version" of a benevolent blind benefactor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>, and the hero's love interest is a prostitute turned stripper, not a "fair maiden" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

### Spiritual Successor to *Don Quixote*

Deadpool can be seen as a spiritual successor to *Don Quixote*, a 400-year-old novel that also mocked the heroes of its era, used meta-narratives, and is considered a proto-postmodern work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. *Don Quixote* features a story within a story, with the fictional author discovering accounts of Don Quixote, and the author constantly breaks the fourth wall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. This parallel is reinforced by the fact that Deadpool kills Don Quixote in the comic books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. *Don Quixote* was written during a time of budding radical skepticism, just before the Enlightenment, and sought to humorously critique Spanish society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. Similarly, Deadpool signals a disenchantment with "old righteous narratives" in contemporary society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

## Ironic Distance and Cynicism

Deadpool's popularity reflects a cultural trend towards cynical self-awareness. Joss Whedon notes that self-reference for the sake of self-reference has engulfed culture, citing a scene in *Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom* as an example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. This self-awareness often takes a cynical tone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

### Hollywood's Self-Referential Trend

Films like the *Tarzan* reboot overtly reference tired tropes, such as Jane playing a damsel in distress, but instead of doing something new, they simply apologize for it and expect this self-awareness to be perceived as clever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. *Star Trek Into Darkness* concludes with a scene that is merely an excuse to reference a famous cinematic moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>, and *22 Jump Street* is the same plot as its predecessor, excused by Ice Cube's meta-commentary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.

Hollywood acknowledges its lazy clichés with a "wink and a nod," or uses irony to undercut dramatic moments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. Deadpool employs both, breaking the fourth wall to include the audience in the joke and avoiding serious drama <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. This approach allows Hollywood to use familiar structures and tropes while distancing the audience from sincerity to create a sense of novelty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

### Immunity to Criticism

Deadpool's humor is largely driven by cynicism and ironic distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. The character remains unfazed by torture or gruesome injury, undercutting high-stakes situations and combat scenes with self-aware humor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. Deadpool's immunity to criticism stems from its cynical nature; it relentlessly deconstructs any trope that would imbue a film with meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. The character's journey is a "shallow endeavor" to regain his physical appearance and lost love/lust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. Deadpool evades criticism because he has no moral scruples or values to defend; his identity is purely reactionary, risking nothing and merely making fun of everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

The film itself has "0 fucks to give," with its ad campaign not taking itself seriously and the movie pointing out its own flaws, such as overuse of superhero tropes or obvious budgetary constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. Negasonic Teenage Warhead is even described as "the Marvel Universe equivalent of a Walmart bargain bin DVD" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.

## Cultural Implications and Critique

This trend raises questions: does acknowledging and apologizing for lacking qualities make a film good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>? [[Cultural Implications of Deadpools Philosophy | Deadpool's Philosophy]] leads to a conflict where the self-reflective, edgy commentary is enjoyable, but the film essentially functions as an "Honest Trailer for other comic book movies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

### The Danger of Endless Meta

A danger of this trend is that it "never creates anything" and can devolve into an "endless spiral of meta" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. The film is compared to a cultural movement of hipsters, who "ironically love the cliche," endlessly recycle culture, and position themselves against the mainstream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. Douglas Haddow suggests the danger of the hipster is the "end of Western civilization itself," a culture lost in its past's superficiality and unable to create new meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. Deadpool does not reinvent the superhero genre; it only exists to make fun of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.

### Powerlessness of Cynicism

The core problem with Deadpool and similar films is that "bashing the system" may feel good and provoke laughter, but it is "ultimately powerless" and does not change the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. As Slavoj Zizek notes, "cynical distance, laughter, irony, are, so to speak, part of the game. The ruling ideology is not meant to be taken seriously or literally" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. Deadpool, like hipsters, fancies itself countercultural by celebrating its own played-out clichés and overused storylines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

This cultural impasse reflects a society unsure of its direction, without immediate existential threats, leading to a "fuck it" attitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. Deadpool can say "Fuck it" because he doesn't fear death and faces no consequences, making life seem limitless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.

### Origins of the "Fuck It" Mentality

The "fuck it" attitude in the Deadpool comic books originated from the belief that the comic would be cancelled at any minute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. This led to a mindset where writers felt nothing mattered, enabling them to break all the rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. If society can say "fuck it," it might be because real existential threats are either too distant or too close to care about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>.

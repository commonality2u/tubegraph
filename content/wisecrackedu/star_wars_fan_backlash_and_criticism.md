The *Star Wars* franchise has experienced significant fan backlash and criticism, particularly following the release of *The Last Jedi* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This response has manifested in various ways, including an anti-Disney manifesto, an actress being run off Instagram, crowdfunding for a remake, and claims of responsibility for *Solo*'s box office failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. Rumors even circulated that Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy might retire early due to Twitter influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. While some attribute this to "fanboys throwing tantrums" or "Russian bots," a deeper underlying issue appears to be at play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Causes of the Backlash

Much of the [[fan_reaction_to_the_last_jedi | fan reaction to The Last Jedi]] stems from director [[Rian Johnsons approach to revolutionizing Star Wars | Rian Johnson]]'s overt subversion of the established canon, which he termed "killing the past" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Specific elements that drew criticism include:
*   **Rey's Parentage**: Rey's parents were revealed as "nobodies," rather than Skywalkers or Kenobis, despite earlier teasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.
*   **Snoke's Demise**: The character of Snoke met an "unceremonious death" without a storied rise or reveal of his identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
*   **Luke Skywalker's Portrayal**: Fans questioned why the "wholesome hero" Luke, who once saw light in villains, would throw away his lightsaber and almost kill his nephew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

The [[impact_of_rian_johnsons_creative_decisions | impact of Rian Johnson's creative decisions]] led to Disney putting all its extended universe movies on hold and new *Star Wars* spinoffs being "universally panned," indicating a "crisis" in the *Star Wars* world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

## The Legitimation Crisis in Star Wars

The situation with *Star Wars* can be understood through political philosopher Jurgen Habermas's concept of a [[philosophical_insights_into_the_star_wars_legitimation_crisis | legitimation crisis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. This is an "existential crisis that threatens the foundation of a social system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. Social systems comprise governmental, socio-cultural, and economic sub-parts, which interact and map onto *Star Wars* fandom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

### The Governmental Side: From Lucas to Disney

Governments derive legitimacy from various sources, such as divine right, elections, or constitutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. George Lucas functioned as the "divinely ordained monarch" of the *Star Wars* universe, which included not only his six films but also numerous spin-offs with the "Royal seal of approval" from Lucasfilm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. His legitimacy stemmed from being the creator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

However, in 2012, [[Disneys acquisition and changes to Star Wars canon | Disney bought Lucasfilm]], leading to a "regime change" where "Lord Lucas was replaced by a money-hungry animated mouse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:05:08]</a>. This shift in authority, coupled with Disney's controversial decisions, propelled the franchise into a significant legitimation crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:27]</a>.

### The Socio-Cultural Side: The Lifeworld of Star Wars

Lucas and *Star Wars* fans collaboratively created a "fully functioning social system" with shared practices, beliefs, values, and rules, which Habermas calls a *lebenswelt*, or lifeworld <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. This lifeworld established the meaning, values, characters, stories, and themes of *Star Wars*, generally agreed upon by the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. This universe also contributed to fans' individual identities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

Disney's actions, particularly taking a "superlaser to the cannon" by decanonizing radio dramas, video games, comics, and hundreds of spin-off novels, were perceived as destroying the community's identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. Fans, who had helped create the meaning of the *Star Wars* universe, felt betrayed when established values and truths were changed, especially in *The Last Jedi* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

### Historical Parallel: The Catholic Church

The *Star Wars* legitimation crisis can be compared to the Catholic Church's crisis in the 1500s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:46]</a>. Previously, the Church had total control over interpreting the Bible due to limited access to hard copies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. However, Gutenberg's printing press in 1440 enabled the rapid reproduction of texts, allowing ordinary people to read and develop their own interpretations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:23]</a>. This shift meant the masses were no longer merely consuming religious meaning but also helping produce canonical interpretations, exemplified by figures like Martin Luther <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:35]</a>.

In this analogy, the original *Star Wars* universe is the "bible," and George Lucas, as its author, held interpretive authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:07:05]</a>. When authority transitioned from Lucas to a "larger and fallible organization" (Disney), fans questioned its right to wield authority over "quasi-holy texts" or its canon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:16]</a>.

## The Age of Prosumerism

The modern era amplifies this crisis due to the rise of "prosumerism" â€“ a term coined by futurists Alvin and Heidi Toffler in the 1980s to describe the merging roles of producer and consumer through technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:52]</a>. *Star Wars* fans are "prosumers extraordinaire," actively contributing to the meaning of the universe through YouTube videos, essays, fan theories, social media, and more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:18]</a>.

Unlike the Catholic Church's crisis where people gained the ability to read, the current problem is that people can blog, tweet, make video essays, cartoons, and stream content to millions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:29]</a>. This [[impact_of_prosumerism_on_star_wars_fandom | age of the prosumer]] empowers fans to criticize the "anointed successors of Lucas," leading to a proliferation of fan-generated criticisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:52]</a>. This dynamic has even led filmmakers like James Mangold, director of *Logan*, to express concern that creating major franchises has become akin to "writing a new chapter of The Bible" with the danger of being "stoned & called a blasphemer," potentially deterring bolder minds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:10:13]</a>.

## Future of the Star Wars System

Despite the crisis, social systems can adapt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:31]</a>. The Catholic Church, for instance, revised its theology and solidified its community after its own legitimation hiccup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:39]</a>. The question remains whether the *Star Wars* system will evolve to respect its fans and the universe they've helped create, or if fans will grow with the system. Alternatively, a "reckoning" could occur, leading to a schism between Disney and fans, much like the Catholic and Protestant split, each competing for viewers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:11:06]</a>.

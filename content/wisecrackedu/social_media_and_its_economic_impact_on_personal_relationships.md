The episode "You Have Zero Friends" from the animated series *South Park* examines the absurdities of the growing social media economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. It directly confronts the true meaning of value in the context of online interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.

## Quantifying Social Worth

*South Park* poses questions about how friendships and social worth are measured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. It asks if value is determined by "likes" and Facebook connections, or by interactions shared in what the cyberpunk community refers to as "meatspace" (physical reality) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>.

From the outset of the episode, characters stand in "meat space" debating their social status, which is quantified solely by their online friendships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. This framing suggests that Facebook friendships, much like money, create an easily measurable hierarchy of personal value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>.

## Relationships as Status Symbols

In the episode, Cartman views relationships not as intrinsically joyful, but as status symbols used to elevate some people over others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>. This perspective aligns with philosopher Jean Baudrillard's arguments in his 1981 work, *Simulacra and Simulation* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

In *The Consumer Society*, Baudrillard warned that a transactional approach to relationships, instead of enhancing life, "leads to an individual lack, since everything possessed is relativized in relation to others" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>.

Cartman's troubling view of relationships begins to influence other characters, such as Kyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. When Kyle faces economic hardship in his digital farm, he prioritizes his social media cache over the real-world support offered by his long-time friend, Stan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>. Kyle later drops a real-world friend, Kip, from his Facebook roster to salvage his own online social standing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>.

## The Digital vs. Physical Life Disjunction

The series asks: "who are we, really, when our online presence outweighs our real-world engagements?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>. Characters like Wendy insist their relationships be validated on the internet, and Randy requires Stan to add him on Facebook to believe in their connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>.

This [[the_impact_of_the_internet_on_shared_culture | disjunction]] between digital and real-world lives threatens to place a greater premium on digital behavior, making physical life seem less significant and less like an experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. Kyle's decision to push back against friendships with real people like Stan and Kip, in favor of preserving his digital status, exemplifies this shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>. Conversely, Kip desperately tries to force his digital friendship into the "meat space" world by taking his laptop to the movies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>.

The argument for cultivating an online brand is that while it may not be as authentic as the "real you," a profile or cyber-influence casts a much wider net <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>. This highlights the [[the_role_of_prosumers_in_modern_media | impact of social media]] on [[societys_impact_on_personal_agency | personal choice]] and the perceived value of relationships.

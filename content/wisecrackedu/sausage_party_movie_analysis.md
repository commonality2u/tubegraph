*Sausage Party* is a 90-minute animated film from Seth Rogen and his writing partner [00:00:20]. The film is presented as an artifact analyzed by host Garyx Wormuloid of Earthling Cinema [00:00:10].

## Premise
The story of *Sausage Party* takes place in an alternate version of Earth where all food items, hygiene products, and socks are living, breathing creatures [00:00:27]. However, books, utensils, trash cans, clothes, and furniture are not animated, leading to confusing rules within the world [00:00:35]. The groceries in the supermarket worship human customers as gods, believing that being purchased is equivalent to ascending to heaven [00:00:44].

## Plot Summary
The protagonists are Frank, a sausage, and Brenda, a bun, who are depicted as extremely horny but believe they must wait until after "death" (being purchased) to have sex [00:00:53]. Their packages are chosen for a block party [00:01:12]. Before their purchase, a jar of honey mustard declares the afterlife to be a lie and commits suicide [00:01:15]. This incident causes a collision that throws many important characters off the shopping cart [00:01:26].

Spurred by the honey mustard's last words, Frank seeks out Firewater, who reveals that the "Great Beyond" is a fabrication [00:01:35]. This is confirmed when previously purchased groceries are brutally slaughtered by humans [00:01:41]. A small sausage named Barry escapes and ends up in the house of a congressman [00:01:49]. The congressman, after using bath salts, gains the ability to communicate with his groceries, which is portrayed as him "listening to his constituents" for the first time [00:01:56].

Back at the supermarket, Frank discovers a cookbook detailing the horrific fates of food, such as being microwaved or over-sriracha'd [00:02:15]. Barry returns with the congressman's severed head, demonstrating that the "gods" (humans) can be killed [00:02:26]. The foods then wage war on the humans, murdering them [00:02:33], which is immediately followed by a store-wide, non-denominational orgy [00:02:37].

After the orgy, Firewater and a piece of Bubblicious reveal that the characters are actually cartoon characters voiced by human celebrities in an alternate dimension [00:02:46]. A portal to this dimension is created, through which the characters escape to avoid explaining the dead humans or dealing with the unresolved issue of food consumption [00:02:57].

## Thematic Analysis

### Disillusionment
At its core, *Sausage Party* reflects the "rampant disillusionment" present during the Middle Ages of Earth's history [00:03:06]. The film's CGI-animated food characters initially resemble the anthropomorphized characters seen in light-hearted offerings from Pixar and Disney [00:03:20]. However, the movie intentionally shatters this saccharine tone by portraying the sinister reality of its many genital metaphors [00:03:33].

### [[religious_themes_in_sausage_party | Religion]] and [[character_symbolism_in_sausage_party | Character Symbolism]]
*Sausage Party* is described as a cynical parable of [[religious_themes_in_sausage_party | religion]] and its societal effects [00:03:43]. It reduces Earth's major [[religious_themes_in_sausage_party | religious]] groups to a collection of stereotypes [00:03:48].
*   The sausages and buns adhere to a Puritanical version of Christianity, though it allows them to be naked [00:03:52].
*   Judaism is symbolized by a bagel that sounds like Woody Allen [00:04:04].
*   Kareem Abdul Lavash represents the Muslim faith and is characterized by his hatred for Jews and "regressive attitude toward bitches" [00:04:13].
*   Firewater embodies the white conception of Native American spirituality [00:04:23].
*   Nazis are also included "just for kicks" [00:04:28].

### [[platos_noble_lie_concept_in_sausage_party | Plato's Noble Lie]]
The supermarket's [[religious_themes_in_sausage_party | religious]] system was devised by the non-perishable items to pacify society and protect the food items from their own "stupid brains" [00:04:32]. The promise of a "Great Beyond" alleviates the foods' suffering, enabling them to face their impending demise with "plucky optimism" [00:04:44]. This tactic serves as an illustration of [[platos_noble_lie_concept_in_sausage_party | Plato's noble lie]], a fictitious story used to persuade individuals to accept their societal roles [00:04:51]. The host humorously adds that "each time the noble lie is used, Plato's nose grows a little longer" [00:05:01].

### Faith and Questioning Beliefs
The effectiveness of any lie, including the noble lie, relies on people not asking too many questions [00:05:06], thus making faith a crucial element in the foodie community [00:05:10]. When Honey Mustard returns from the "Great Beyond" and attempts to warn everyone of the truth, he is ridiculed and silenced because no one wants to "slide open the Ziploc bag of faith they've worked so hard to seal" [00:05:19]. The film suggests that the only way to challenge such stubborn belief is with "incontrovertible proof of a severed head" [00:05:31].

### [[hedonism_as_a_theme_in_sausage_party | Hedonism]]
The film's ultimate message is to embrace [[hedonism_as_a_theme_in_sausage_party | hedonism]] [00:05:36]. It argues against living life in anticipation of a "pot of gold at the end of the rainbow" [00:05:41], because in the end, food either gets eaten and digested or thrown away to rot [00:05:46]. Therefore, the takeaway is to put aside petty differences and pursue as much pleasure as possible [00:05:50].

*The Lion King*, hosted by Garyx Wormuloid on Earthling Cinema <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>, is presented as being "loosely based" on the film version of [[summary_of_hamlet_by_shakespeare|Hamlet]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. This inspiration is so significant that *The Lion King* shares the same plot and [[character_analysis_of_hamlet_and_claudius|characters]] as the Shakespearean tragedy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

## Shared Plot Points

The narrative parallels between *The Lion King* and [[summary_of_hamlet_by_shakespeare|Hamlet]] are explicit:
*   A king (Mufasa) is murdered by his brother (Scar) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
*   The son of the murdered king (Simba) is visited by the ghost of his father (Mufasa) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
*   Two comic foils (Timon and Pumbaa) aid the hero by helping him "chill out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

## Character Parallels

Key characters in *The Lion King* have direct counterparts in [[summary_of_hamlet_by_shakespeare|Hamlet]]:
*   **Mufasa** is the ruling king, akin to King Hamlet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.
*   **Simba** is Mufasa's son, comparable to [[character_analysis_of_hamlet_and_claudius|Hamlet]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Initially, Simba obsesses with power and even sings about his father's death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. After his father's death, Simba runs away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>, living with Timon and Pumbaa in a "hippie commune" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. He initially resists returning to his duties, favoring "good vibes and organic farming" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>, showcasing a form of [[hamlets_procrastination_and_internal_conflict|procrastination]] until prompted by his father's ghost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
*   **Scar** is Mufasa's brother, who desires the throne and orchestrates Mufasa's death, mirroring [[character_analysis_of_hamlet_and_claudius|Claudius]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. After Mufasa's death, Scar tricks Simba into believing it was his fault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>, allowing him to seize power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

## Thematic Underpinnings and [[scars_role_and_political_undertones_in_the_lion_king|Scar's Role and Political Undertones]]

Beyond the direct plot and character parallels, *The Lion King* also draws upon the conservative messages potentially inspired by its ancient source material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

### The Circle of Life and Social Order
The film places considerable emphasis on the "circle of life," which is presented as a fixed social order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. Disruption of this order is shown to lead to chaos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. Mufasa uses this concept to justify the predatory nature of the animal kingdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. The film suggests that one's value is determined by birth, not merit, action, or bribery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>, implying no upward mobility for those not born at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. This message, "know your place," suggests that animals find peace only through subjugation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. This resonates with Socrates' concept of the "noble lie," where people accept their lot in life if they believe it's divinely ordained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

### Scar's Progressive Politics and Downfall
[[scars_role_and_political_undertones_in_the_lion_king|Scar]] is depicted as the only animal to reject this feudal society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>, lamenting that "life isn't fair" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. He rebels against the "natural" societal order that labels him a "weakling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. When Scar assumes power, he institutes an era of equality, allowing hyenas to be on par with lions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

Despite these progressive politics, Scar's reign ultimately turns sour, akin to the [[themes_of_corruption_and_treachery_in_hamlet|corruption]] that permeates Elsinore under [[character_analysis_of_hamlet_and_claudius|Claudius]]. By interfering with the "natural order of the food chain," a once prosperous land descends into anarchy and starvation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. Scar's song about a new world order even features Nazi marching imagery and camera movements from Leni Reifenstahlâ€™s *Triumph of the Will*, suggesting a totalitarian undertone to his leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

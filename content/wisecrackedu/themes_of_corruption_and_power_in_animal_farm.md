[[summary_of_animal_farm_by_george_orwell | Animal Farm]] by George Orwell explores how power can corrupt and how revolutionary ideals can be twisted into [[themes_of_totalitarianism_and_control | totalitarian control]]. The narrative, while seemingly about animals, is a deep [[themes_allegory_of_society_and_human_nature | allegory]] for societal and human nature, particularly the rise and fall of political systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

## The Promise of Revolution and Animalism

The story begins at Manor Farm, where Old Major, a prize boar, inspires the animals with a vision of freedom from human oppression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. He preaches that men consume everything without producing anything, asserting that rebellion is the only path to righteous living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. The animals rise up, kicking Farmer Jones and his men off the farm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. They rename it [[summary_of_animal_farm_by_george_orwell | Animal Farm]] and establish a new philosophy called [[animalism_and_rebellion_in_animal_farm | Animalism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. The core principle of [[animalism_and_rebellion_in_animal_farm | Animalism]] is "All animals are equal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. This initial revolt mirrors the Bolshevik Revolution of October 1917 against the Tsar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

## The Corrupting Influence of Power

After the revolution, two pigs, Napoleon and Snowball, begin to lead the farm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. Their constant disagreement highlights the struggle for power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

### Napoleon's Consolidation of Power
The pigs, representing the "top dogs of the Communist Party" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>, quickly consolidate control. Napoleon, symbolizing Stalin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>, ultimately chases Snowball (representing Trotsky) off the farm when the other animals side with Snowball regarding the idea of building a windmill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. Another pig, Squealer (representing Pravda, the newspaper that spread lies for Stalin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>, manipulates the truth by claiming Snowball was a traitor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

### Erosion of Ideals
The pigs begin to deviate from the principles of [[animalism_and_rebellion_in_animal_farm | Animalism]]. They start trading with humans for necessary supplies, despite initial prohibitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. Over time, the Seven Commandments of [[animalism_and_rebellion_in_animal_farm | Animalism]] are twisted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a> until only one remains: "All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. This gradual corruption leads the pigs to adopt human behaviors, eventually walking on two legs and carrying whips of oppression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. The ultimate sign of corruption is that in the end, no one can distinguish between the pigs and the humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

## Allegory of the [[allegory_of_the_soviet_union_in_animal_farm | Soviet Union]]

Orwell uses [[summary_of_animal_farm_by_george_orwell | Animal Farm]] as an [[allegory_of_the_soviet_union_in_animal_farm | allegory of the Soviet Union]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
*   **Old Major** represents a combination of Karl Marx, the original communist theorist, and Vladimir Lenin, the mastermind of the revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. His preaching echoes the ending of *The Communist Manifesto* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
*   **Napoleon** embodies Joseph Stalin, the Soviet dictator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.
*   **Snowball** represents Leon Trotsky, a communist leader exiled from Russia due to his conflict with Stalin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.
*   **Squealer** symbolizes Pravda, the state newspaper used to spread propaganda and justify Stalin's actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
*   The human attempt to retake the farm in Chapter 4 symbolizes the civil war between Russian loyalists and Bolsheviks in 1918 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

## Universal Truths of Corruption

Beyond its specific historical [[allegory_of_the_soviet_union_in_animal_farm | allegory]], [[summary_of_animal_farm_by_george_orwell | Animal Farm]] offers universal truths about humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. It demonstrates that power has the capacity to corrupt anyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. Even the most loyal figures, like Boxer, can fall prey to worshipping a corrupt leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. The story concludes with the ironic realization that the revolution has brought the animals back to their starting point, with the pigs becoming the new oppressors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

*The Big Bang Theory* is critiqued as profoundly bad, so much so that understanding its failings requires philosophical analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. The show's humor, in particular, raises questions about meaning and its impact on the portrayal of [[critique_of_the_big_bang_theorys_portrayal_of_geek_culture | geek culture]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## The Problematic Use of References

*The Big Bang Theory* heavily relies on [[use_of_references_in_the_big_bang_theory | referentiality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. It references cornerstones of nerd culture like *Star Trek* and *Battlestar Galactica*, as well as scientific facts and mathematical formulas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. These are slipped in to constantly remind the audience that characters like Leonard and Sheldon are "diehard nerds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

However, the show's jokes often stem not from the *subject* of the reference, but simply the *fact* that a reference is made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. For instance, when Sheldon explains friction after Penny slips in a bathtub, the humor is presented as residing in the scientific definition itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. The actual science isn't the joke; the fact that they are talking about science is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. The words "humerus" and "glenoid socket" could be replaced with "gibberish," and most viewers would not notice, indicating the lack of substance in the scientific reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

### Contrast with Futurama

In contrast, a show like [[comparison_between_big_bang_theory_and_futurama | *Futurama*]] uses references differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. In *Futurama*, a reference to aleph null, the mathematical symbol for an infinite set of countable numbers, implies an impossible infinite number of movie screens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. The humor lies in the impossibility of the subject, not merely the recognition of the symbol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. The reference adds meaning to the joke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

Similarly, a *Futurama* joke about a Mobius strip relies on the audience understanding the topology to get the humor, unlike *The Big Bang Theory*'s explanation of locks, where the reality is irrelevant as long as Sheldon appears "unnecessarily smart" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

## Baudrillard's Theory of Simulation and the "Death of Meaning"

The show's reliance on references without subject matter raises philosophical concerns, particularly aligning with French philosopher Jean Baudrillard's ideas on the annihilation of reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. Baudrillard posited four levels of representation:

*   **First Level**: A perfectly accurate representation of reality, like a picture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
*   **Second Level**: An unfaithful copy that obscures reality, like a filter that makes you look prettier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
*   **Third Level**: A representation that deliberately hides the absence of a reality being represented, like an artist rendering of someone they've never seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
*   **Fourth Level**: Signs and representations reference other signs, losing all connection to original reality, such as photoshopping a photoshopped image or memes of other memes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. Baudrillard believed we live in a world of fourth-order simulacra, where the original reality is lost, leading him to consider reality a simulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

*The Big Bang Theory*, at best, represents a distorted view of real nerd culture (second order) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. However, pessimistically, it functions as a copy of something that never existed (third order) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. It presents science without actual science and a version of "nerd culture" that doesn't reflect real nerds, but rather a caricature of what someone who has never met a nerd might imagine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.

The show's jokes, often relying on characters "cramming in whatever scientific explanation is relevant" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>, are references for the sake of references, requiring no understanding of the science, only its recognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. This detachment from reality, according to Baudrillard, signals the "death of meaning" and makes all ideas interchangeable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. The show's game, "Mystic Warlords of Kaâ€™a," exemplifies this, quickly descending into interchangeable nonsense where the joke works because the audience is sold an empty joke under the guise of a meaningful one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

## The Superiority Theory of Humor

If *The Big Bang Theory*'s references point at nothing, the question remains: what is the audience laughing at <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>? Rigorous study suggests the show "basically just shits on its characters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

This aligns with the **Superiority Theory of Humor**, one of the earliest theories in the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.

*   **Plato** suggested laughter is a form of scorn at people unaware of their own awfulness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.
*   **Thomas Hobbes** modified this, stating laughter results from our competitive nature, either triumphing over others or witnessing their downfall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.
*   **Descartes** viewed laughter as scorn "from our perceiving some small evil in a person whom we consider to be deserving of it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.

All three philosophers agreed that laughter often occurs at the expense of others, making oneself feel good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.

However, unlike shows such as *Seinfeld*, where characters are arguably "horrible people deserving our scorn," *The Big Bang Theory*'s showrunner, Chuck Lorre, stated the show is "not about geeks or nerds, [but] about extraordinary people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. This raises the question of why "extraordinary" characters should be the subject of constant derision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.

## Impact on Nerd Culture

The "big picture problem" is that *The Big Bang Theory*, instead of building up nerd culture, tends to tear it down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. By mechanically inserting references for their own sake and presenting characters who are "wanky assholes," the show reveals its contempt for real nerds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. This ultimately does a disservice to fans of various "nerd" interests, presenting caricatures who are "dumped on" rather than reflections of themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

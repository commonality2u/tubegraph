*Breaking Bad* Season Number One, created by Vince Gilligan, introduces Walter White, a 50-year-old man who is dissatisfied with his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Despite receiving gifts, Walter mopes around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a> and is critical of doctors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. This dissatisfaction leads him to seek a new "hobby" beyond being a human test subject for cleaning products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## The Pursuit and Failure of the American Dream

Walter's new venture involves the manufacture of methamphetamine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>, a potent recreational poison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. He partners with Jesse Pinkman, a young entrepreneur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. The show depicts the struggles of the characters within the American economic system; both the highly educated Walter and Jesse "routinely fail to thrive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02">[03:02]</a>.

Walter initially appears to be living what was once considered the "American Dream," with a son, a plaque, and an audience with the Supreme Galactic General <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32">[03:32]</a>. However, he can only bring home "sub-par bacon," which on Earth was a capital offense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47">[03:47]</a>. The show argues that the American Dream has failed Walter, despite him making "socially acceptable moves" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54">[03:54]</a>. Jesse also struggles to achieve societal legitimacy, finding himself marginalized by various societal figures and even his own parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16">[03:16]</a>.

## Moral Decline and Transformation

Walter's response to the failure of the American Dream is to "rage against the machine" and create a new alter ego <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. He believes that only by operating outside the law can he achieve the respect and mobility he desperately desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. Jesse, in contrast, largely "gets to keep riding Waltâ€™s coattails" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21">[04:21]</a>.

Walter's increasing moral ambiguity is explored through his expertise in chemistry. His chemistry class in the pilot episode outlines the theme of his own metamorphosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03">[02:03]</a>. A lecture on thalidomide chirality in episode 2 points to his shifting morality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11">[02:11]</a>. By episode 6, it is hinted that Walter himself may be a "volatile substance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20">[02:20]</a>.

Ironically, by taking drastic measures to earn money for cancer treatment, Walter "effectively becomes a societal cancer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23">[04:23]</a>. He gains energy for himself with each transaction, even as he participates in the "deterioration of other human beings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28">[04:28]</a>. This transformation leads to the question of whether this is still the American Dream or simply "a waking nightmare" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38">[04:38]</a>.

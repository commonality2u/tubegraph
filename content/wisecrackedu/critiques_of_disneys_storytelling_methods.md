Disney, a company that has become an "absolute behemoth" through acquisitions including Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars, and 21st Century Fox, has long been criticized for its storytelling methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:43">[02:33:43]</a>. The company's significant influence, highlighted by its production of seven of the top ten highest-grossing films in 2019 alone, raises questions about the cultural impact of its artistic reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:07">[00:48:07]</a>.

## Historical Precedent of Adaptation and Alteration

Walt Disney's early experiences, notably losing the rights to his character Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, led to a foundational company principle: to "own everything that he made" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>. This drive for ownership extended to intellectual property, leading to a formula for success: acquiring existing stories, making them "as cute and wholesome as possible to maximize your potential audience," and then profiting greatly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>.

Critics argue that this approach has resulted in Disney "acquiring stories, adapting them and ultimately twisting their original artistic intentions beyond recognition" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>. This transformation prioritizes an "aesthetic" of "round faces, saucer eyes, big goofy grins" to appeal to the broadest possible audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>.

## Case Studies in Whitewashing Narratives

### Pinocchio

Disney's 1940 adaptation of Carlo Collodi's *Pinocchio* exemplifies this "whitewashing" process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:00">[06:06:00]</a>. While Disney's version ends with Pinocchio becoming a "real boy" after proving himself "brave, truthful and unselfish," Collodi's original tale had a drastically different and much darker conclusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>.

In the original, Pinocchio is "gruesomely hanged" by assassins, described with "atrocious spasms" and a "long shutter" before hanging "stiff and insensible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:13:58">[06:13:58]</a>. Collodi's story was intended as a "bleak morality tale" where Pinocchio, a "mean-spirited and rude" character, suffers greatly (robbed, starved, legs sawed off) due to his own actions, rather than eliciting sympathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:00">[07:06:00]</a>. Disney removed these "dark satiric overtones," replacing them with "syrupy lines" and transforming Pinocchio from a "total frat pro" to a "naive piece of pine" with a rounded, Mickey Mouse-like design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:30:00">[08:30:00]</a>.

Collodi's grandson even sued Disney's Italian distributor for infringing on the "moral copyright" of the story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:57:00">[08:57:00]</a>.

### The Little Mermaid

Similarly, Disney's 1989 classic [[Disneys adaptation and alteration of classic stories | *The Little Mermaid*]], based on Hans Christian Andersen's tale, also underwent significant changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:22:00">[10:22:00]</a>. Disney's retelling is a love story with a "happily ever after" ending where "true love saves all" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:39:00">[10:39:00]</a>.

Andersen, however, "flatly rejected this message" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:02:00">[11:02:00]</a>. His story portrays love primarily as "suffering," with the mermaid enduring extreme pain with every step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:05:00">[11:05:00]</a>. Critically, the prince "never returns the mermaid's affection," marrying another princess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:20:00">[11:20:00]</a>. Andersen intended the mermaid to be saved not by love, but by "sacrifice," gaining a soul through centuries of good deeds rather than a kiss from a "hunk" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:32:00">[11:32:00]</a>.

## Consequences of Disney's "Meat Grinder" Approach

This consistent process of "bleaching" stories in a "caustic vat of cuteness" and removing "rough and unsavory edges" has several implications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:00">[08:24:00]</a>.

For instance, the romanticized portrayal of Pocahontas in Disney's film, ignoring the historical reality of "colonists kidnapping a native American woman and murdering her husband," offers a "very shitty history lesson that some people might never question" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:40:00">[12:40:00]</a>.

## Impact on Children's Perceptions and Morals

[[Disneys influence on childrens perceptions and morals | Disney's storytelling]] methods, especially its alterations of [[critique_of_traditional_fairy_tales | traditional fairy tales]], are seen as a "major disservice for developing young minds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:13:00">[13:13:00]</a>. Fairy tales are traditionally "dark and complex and vaguely disturbing," offering children a "symbolic template for understanding the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:21:00">[13:21:00]</a>. They can help children "express and cope with their anxieties," even using dark elements like the "big bad wolf" to process emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:34:00">[13:34:00]</a>.

However, Disney "strips these fairy tales of their bite," inserting "bland wholesome narrative[s]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:01:00">[14:01:00]</a>. Psychologist Susan Darker Smith notes that young girls identifying with characters like Cinderella or Belle, who believe "love conquers all," are "more likely to end up in abusive relationships as adults" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:17:00">[14:17:00]</a>. By promoting a convenient narrative where "all the world's problems can be solved by true love," Disney "fails to give children any tools for navigating real life problems" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:40:00">[14:14:40]</a>. Original fairy tales served to "convey the darker and crueler aspects of life so as to better prepare children for the realities of adulthood" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:50:00">[14:50:00]</a>.

## The Business of Cuteness

According to free-market economist Milton Friedman, companies' "only responsibility is to make more money," a principle that has become "gospel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:05:00">[15:05:00]</a>. This capitalist "raison d'Ãªtre" explains why Disney operates a "cuteness factory" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:31:00">[15:31:00]</a>.

Historically, when Disney produced "grimmer, edgier films" like *The Black Cauldron* in the 1970s and 80s, they were "huge box office failures," nearly collapsing the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:40:00">[15:40:00]</a>. The "Disney Renaissance" of the 90s marked a "major course correction" back to "sentimental cuteness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:50:00">[15:50:00]</a>.

Scientific studies show that "cuteness" increases concentration and activates the brain's pleasure center (nucleus accumbens), releasing dopamine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:06:00">[16:06:00]</a>. This suggests that viewers of Disney's adorable characters are "unwittingly receiving the first micro doses of Disney branded brain candy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:33:00">[16:33:00]</a>. Cultural theorist Joshua Paul Dale calls this phenomenon "evil cute," where cuteness is used for "potentially nefarious purposes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:40:00">[16:40:00]</a>. Ultimately, for Disney, "cuteness is just a means... to pad its bottom line, regardless if it's telling stories that are ultimately good for children" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:59:00">[16:59:00]</a>.

## Future Concerns

This pattern extends beyond classic fairy tales to more modern and beloved franchises, such as Star Wars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:21:00">[17:21:00]</a>. Critics express concern that Disney will continue to apply its "blanket philosophy of cuteness," expanding its reach and compromising "story nuance and morality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:09:00">[18:09:00]</a>. This raises worries that as Disney "gobble[s] up more and more of the media we love," there "won't be space for grittier, darker stories" or "grown up fairy tales" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:25:00">[18:25:00]</a>.

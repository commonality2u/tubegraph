From: [[wisecrackedu]] <br/> 

[[rick_and_morty_references_and_parodies | *Rick and Morty*]] is a popular animated series that blends [[philosophy_and_existentialism_in_rick_and_morty | philosophy]], [[science_and_rationalism_in_rick_and_morty | science]], and humor, often while paying homage to or parodying various [[scifi_horror_and_fantasy_themes_in_rick_and_morty | sci-fi and horror traditions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The show chronicles the adventures of a mad scientist, Rick, and his naive grandson, Morty, through space and alternate dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This premise is notably a more irresponsible version of "Back to the Future", with Rick as a "gassy alcoholic Doc" and Morty traveling through dimensions rather than time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Roots in Sci-Fi and Horror

[[scifi_horror_and_fantasy_themes_in_rick_and_morty | *Rick and Morty*]] is deeply rooted in [[scifi_horror_and_fantasy_themes_in_rick_and_morty | sci-fi horror]] traditions, frequently paying homage to iconic works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These references include:
*   *Ghostbusters* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>
*   Filmmaker David Cronenberg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>
*   *Nosferatu* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>
*   Freddy Krueger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>
*   *Zardoz*, a camp classic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>

While referencing a broad spectrum, the show has a particular affinity for [[cosmic_horror_influences_on_rick_and_morty | cosmic horror]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## [[cosmic_horror_influences_on_rick_and_morty | Cosmic Horror]] and H.P. Lovecraft

The show extensively draws from [[cosmic_horror_influences_on_rick_and_morty | cosmic horror]], a genre pioneered by literary horror legend H.P. Lovecraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. [[cosmic_horror_influences_on_rick_and_morty | Cosmic horror]] emphasizes the terror of that which is beyond human comprehension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Similar to Lovecraft, [[rick_and_morty_references_and_parodies | *Rick and Morty*]] uses the cosmos to explore deep philosophical questions by imagining what lurks in the black depths of space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The show's opening even includes a visual reference to Lovecraft’s Cthulhu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

[[cosmic_horror_influences_on_rick_and_morty | Cosmic horror]] transcends simple jump-scares, instead presenting the vast, unimaginable unknown that crashes into human reality, evoking feelings of fright, disgust, and dread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Rick’s portal gun constantly confronts characters with this unknown, leading to horrifying, hilarious, or a mix of both results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

A prominent example is the episode "Get Schwifty," where Earth is approached by a giant space-head, a Cromulon, whose gravitational mass causes chaos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This entity demands Earth "show him what they've got" in an intergalactic "America's Got Talent" equivalent, threatening disintegration otherwise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These giant floating cosmic entities are not new to [[scifi_horror_and_fantasy_themes_in_rick_and_morty | science fiction]], with H.P. Lovecraft frequently using the idea to develop races like the "Great Old Ones" in works such as "The Call of Cthulhu" and "The Dunwich Horror" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

### Philosophical Implications of [[cosmic_horror_influences_on_rick_and_morty | Cosmic Horror]]

The concept of colossal, indifferent cosmic entities raises the question of human significance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Unlike most [[scifi_horror_and_fantasy_themes_in_rick_and_morty | science fiction]] that places humanity at the metaphorical center of the universe, [[cosmic_horror_influences_on_rick_and_morty | cosmic horror]] inverts this, asking: "What if the universe doesn’t give a shit about us?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. For the Cromulons, humanity is merely entertainment, and planetary annihilation is an act of indifference, not spite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This portrayal of humanity's insignificance is often terrifying, or in the context of [[rick_and_morty_references_and_parodies | *Rick and Morty*]], darkly hilarious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

This theme aligns with "Cosmic Pessimism," described by contemporary American philosopher Eugene Thacker in his book "In the Dust of This Planet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Thacker refers to a "world-without-us" that is "absolutely unhuman, and indifferent to the hopes, desires and struggles of human individuals and groups" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The show embodies this [[cosmic_nihilism_and_its_depiction_in_rick_and_morty | cosmic pessimism]] perfectly, even depicting Rick and Morty dying and being replaced by infinite alternate versions of themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The show suggests that not only are humans insignificant specks in the cosmos, but they are also one of an infinite number of identical specks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Rather than instilling terror, [[rick_and_morty_references_and_parodies | *Rick and Morty*]] encourages viewers to laugh at this insignificance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

The concept of insignificance is inverted in "The Ricks Must Be Crazy," where Rick's car battery is powered by a micro-universe whose sole purpose is to produce energy, and within that universe, another mini-universe is created, and so on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. To the inhabitants of these micro-verses, Rick is akin to one of Lovecraft's cosmic deities, creating a "cosmic inception" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. In a multiverse of infinite possibilities, values and meanings slip away, leaving only pessimism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## [[science_and_rationalism_in_rick_and_morty | Science]] as a Source of Humor and Existential Dread

[[rick_and_morty_references_and_parodies | *Rick and Morty*]] also uses [[science_and_rationalism_in_rick_and_morty | science]] both as a basis for nerdy jokes and as a means to explore existential questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. [[science_and_rationalism_in_rick_and_morty | Science]] can provide understanding through formulas and theorems, but it also confronts humanity with the bleak, arbitrary nature of existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It can strip away sanctity and emotion, rendering the human experience meaningless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

One example is an episode loosely based on the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle from quantum mechanics, which states the impossibility of knowing both a particle's location and momentum simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The show humorously claims this uncertainty can cause realities to split <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Another [[rick_and_morty_references_and_parodies | reference]] is the presence of Schrödinger's cats floating outside, alluding to Erwin Schrödinger's 1935 thought experiment about a cat being both alive and dead in a quantum world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

The show's tenuous relationship with scientific truth can be seen as a jab at the [[scifi_horror_and_fantasy_themes_in_rick_and_morty | science fiction]] genre for often inventing "scientific mumbo-jumbo" to justify unlikely plot points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. For instance, Rick traverses tiny climates on a tiny planet in an episode, which is not scientifically accurate, and the show even pokes fun at the audience's trust in TV narratives through a joke about forced perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

### [[the_role_of_science_and_atheism_in_rick_and_morty | Science and Atheism]]

[[rick_and_morty_references_and_parodies | *Rick and Morty*]] exhibits a unique form of [[the_role_of_science_and_atheism_in_rick_and_morty | atheism]], constantly invalidating religious figures by reducing them to pure [[science_and_rationalism_in_rick_and_morty | scientific]] explanations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The show also acknowledges the misuse of [[science_and_rationalism_in_rick_and_morty | science]] for religious agendas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. In "Something Ricked This Way Comes," Jerry's "personal" interpretation of [[science_and_rationalism_in_rick_and_morty | science]] leads him to campaign for Pluto's planet-hood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. He encounters Plutonians with cross-like eyes, drawing a comparison to religious fundamentalism, though this is ultimately revealed as a corporate ploy to manipulate them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Crisis of Values: Nihilism and Absurdism

The show explores a crisis of values and meaning in life, drawing from [[philosophy_and_existentialism_in_rick_and_morty | existentialist]] thinkers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Friedrich Nietzsche's parable of the madman, proclaiming "God is dead!", is particularly relevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Nietzsche suggested that after the Enlightenment and [[science_and_rationalism_in_rick_and_morty | scientific]] revolution, the traditional source of value (God) was no longer relevant, leaving a void of meaning – [[cosmic_nihilism_and_its_depiction_in_rick_and_morty | nihilism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

This struggle with the lack of meaning defines Rick Sanchez <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Rick uses [[science_and_rationalism_in_rick_and_morty | science]] to demystify everything, asserting that love is just chemical reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. He even "beats the devil," actively playing out the "death of God" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Rick embodies a tension between active and passive [[cosmic_nihilism_and_its_depiction_in_rick_and_morty | nihilism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>; while a passive nihilist is resigned to meaninglessness, an active nihilist seeks to destroy old values to create new ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Despite his sarcasm and nonchalance, Rick is an alcoholic whose catchphrase, "Wubbalubbadubdub!", translates to "I am in great pain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. His actions, such as being an intergalactic terrorist and sacrificing himself for his family, appear paradoxical, suggesting his own struggle to find meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

[[rick_and_morty_references_and_parodies | *Rick and Morty*]] also interrogates morality, refusing to draw clear lines between right and wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Morty's attempts to do good are often thwarted, as seen when freeing people from the body-snatching Unity leads to a "nipple-driven race war" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Summer aptly questions the consequences: "I didn’t know freedom meant people doing stuff that sucks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This poses an existential question: what is biological life without true "living," and does an "irrational attachment to freedom" allow for a deeply "fucked up" world? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>

Albert Camus' "absurdism" offers another lens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Camus argued that life consists of humanity's tendency to find meaning alongside the universe's complete indifference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. In "Meeseeks and Destroy," the Meeseeks illustrate the opposite, stating they are "not born into this world fumbling for meaning" but "created to serve a singular purpose" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This contrasts with Camus' myth of Sisyphus, eternally pushing a boulder up a hill, only for it to fall back down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This "Frankenstein-complex" of resenting creators for being brought into existence is seen in characters like Abradolf Lincler, Morty Jr., and even Frankenstein's monster himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

Camus suggests embracing the emptiness of the absurd rather than being frustrated by the inability to find meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Rick's advice, "Don't think about it," and Morty's profound realization, "Nobody exists on purpose. Nobody belongs anywhere. Everybody's gonna die. Come watch TV?", encapsulate this approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

By exploring the absurdities of a purely [[science_and_rationalism_in_rick_and_morty | rational universe]] and pushing the boundaries of decency within a [[scifi_horror_and_fantasy_themes_in_rick_and_morty | sci-fi horror]] setting, [[rick_and_morty_references_and_parodies | *Rick and Morty*]] encourages viewers to confront fundamental questions about purpose and existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The show implies that despite Rick's intelligence, human lives can be as "sad and pathetic" as Jerry's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

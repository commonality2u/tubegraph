*The Wolf of Wall Street* portrays [[themes_of_deception_and_corruption|deception and corruption]] through the lens of excess and greed, focusing on Jordan Belfort's lifestyle and its wider implications. The film's use of specific cinematic choices, particularly its closing shot, aims to deepen the understanding of these themes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Portrayal of Excess

For the majority of its three-hour runtime, *The Wolf of Wall Street* "revels" in Jordan Belfort's "excess," including his yacht, women, drugs, and parties, all funded by defrauding investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. This debauchery is often underscored by "poppy, upbeat hits" in the soundtrack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

Unlike many films that depict corrupt figures, *The Wolf of Wall Street* deliberately avoids "any overt moralizing" regarding Belfort's actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. His four-year prison sentence is presented as a "cakewalk," and he doesn't even serve its full term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. The film concludes with "nothing has changed," as Belfort continues his selling practices and people remain eager to buy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

## Interpretations of the Final Shot

The film's closing shot, a "simple push-in and crane-up" on a seminar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>, significantly shifts the film's meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. The upbeat music is replaced by "solemn music," and a client's voice describing a pen is drowned out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. This shift prompts a more "serious and meditative" reflection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. The final shot is open to multiple interpretations regarding the themes of excess and greed:

### 1. A Mirror to the Audience

The final shot positions a backlight behind the seminar, evoking a projector shining onto an audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. This visual choice suggests that the blame for the "moral depravity" depicted in the film rests not solely on Jordan Belfort, but also "on us, and the culture that allows and encourages his behavior" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

Belfort himself articulates that his clients "want to get rich and they want to get rich quickly. They all want something for nothing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. The film implies that Belfort's scam would not succeed if the audience did not "share his dream of getting rich quickly" and "wanting something for nothing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. Martin Scorsese, the director, is seen as "calling us out" for having spent three hours "partying with Jordan, laughing and reveling in his exploits" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. The lack of punishment for Jordan in the film's conclusion is attributed to the audience's willingness to "revel in everything he does, living vicariously through him, wishing that we could live his life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

### 2. Money as a Form of Worship

The image of a crowd intently staring at Jordan, "hanging on his every word," can be interpreted as a form of worship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. While Scorsese has often explored faith in his films as a devout Catholic, in *The Wolf of Wall Street*, characters instead "worship at the altar of something else: MONEY" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. The camera holds on "desperate, plain-looking people looking for meaning; desiring that which can elevate them above their mundane existence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. This suggests a cynical comparison between the "transformative power of faith" and the "transformative power of money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

### 3. Voluntary Submission to Exploitation

A more sinister interpretation of the final shot is that by portraying a crowd that "worships Jordan, despite his detestable actions," Scorsese suggests that people "actually like being taken advantage of" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

> "The English unemployed did not become workers to survive, they… enjoyed the hysterical, masochistic, whatever exhaustion it was of hanging on the mines, in the foundries, in the factories, in hell, they enjoyed it… enjoyed the mad destruction of their organic bodies… the decomposition of their personal identity… enjoyed the dissolution of their families and villages, and enjoyed the new monstrous anonymity of the suburbs and the pubs in the morning and evening.”
> — Jean-Francois Lyotard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>

This perspective implies that the masses engage in a "voluntary submission," not only tolerating white-collar criminals stealing their money but finding a "perverse enjoyment in their banal existence under the heel of the Jordan Belforts of the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

Ultimately, this single shot highlights the complexity of *The Wolf of Wall Street* as "a true totem of our culture of excess," which defies "easy answers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

From: [[wisecrackedu]] <br/> 

*House of Cards*, the American version, delves into the world of politics, particularly chronicling [[character_analysis_of_frank_and_claire_underwood | Frank and Claire Underwood's]] quest for power and the presidency at any cost, starting with Frank as a Congressional Whip and Claire heading a non-profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. The show's popularity can be linked to increasing public cynicism about the state of American politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

Unlike many American political dramas that are either uncritical of the system or feature a morally righteous character who triumphs against adversity, *House of Cards* rejects this narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Instead, it portrays a process where raw power and cunning consistently prevail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. The series prompts the question: "Is there more to politics than pure spectacle?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

## Politics as Aesthetics and Theater

In the cynical world of *House of Cards*, characters are constantly maintaining a public and private image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. The show's creators are notably "obsessed with aesthetics" – art and beauty within the show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Important dealings often occur while characters reflect on art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>, and Claire's appearance, including her wardrobe, is meticulously manicured and frequently discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. This focus on [[the_concept_of_aesthetics_and_theater_in_house_of_cards | aesthetics]] and art references, however, suggests that behind them lies "nothing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

The show's preoccupation with aesthetics also manifests in its frequent tributes to theater, particularly William Shakespeare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. [[character_analysis_of_frank_and_claire_underwood | Frank Underwood]] often uses soliloquies and asides, a theatrical device heavily utilized by Shakespeare to explicate a character's inner thoughts to the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Much of the show's plot and characters are reminiscent of Shakespearean classics like *Macbeth* and *Richard III*, which inspire Frank's charming asides about his terrible behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. Even Petrov, during his White House visit, quotes Gorbachev quoting Richard III's famous line, "...of an end to our winter of discontent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

### Appearance Drives Politics

Theater, aesthetics, and art in *House of Cards* all point to the fundamental concept that [[the_role_of_appearances_in_politics_based_on_house_of_cards | appearance drives politics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. Politics is depicted as theater or a type of performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. For example, Frank visits his father to "seem more human," revealing his true manipulative intentions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. His frequent breaking of the fourth wall blurs the distinction between the show and reality, highlighting theater in politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

Contemporary commentators often lament that politics has become entertainment, with catchphrases replacing real political argument <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. This is mirrored in the show: Frank destroys Michael Kern's career over an op-ed he didn't write <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>, and a fabricated brick through Frank's window serves as a symbol against out-of-control teachers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

### Philosophical Perspectives on Appearance and Reality

According to German philosopher Hannah Arendt, the realm of appearances is the realm of politics; stripping away appearances to get at a "core of things" is pointless because they are the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. This idea originates in the ancient Greek Polis, where politics involved individuals speaking and being heard in the Agora, judged only by their words, rhetoric, and deeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. For humans, Arendt states, "appearance—something that can be seen or heard by others as well as ourselves, constitutes reality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

Frank Underwood demonstrates this understanding, stating: "We are nothing more or less than what we choose to reveal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. The show implies Frank is a sociopath, and what he reveals is a carefully crafted manipulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. The difficulty in hating Frank arises because there is no stable identity to hate; he presents different personas to different people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.

The idea that appearances are deceptive is ancient, exemplified by Plato's allegory of the cave, where one must move past misleading shadows to discover a "true" world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. Karl Marx's "Theory of Ideology" also uses this Platonic distinction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. Modern commentators complaining about political media as a "grotesque spectacle" are "modern torch-bearers of this millennia-old argument" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. However, Frank and Arendt undermine the tradition that an authentic reality lies behind appearances; for them, appearance *is* reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

### Hypocrisy and the Search for True Motives

Frank is portrayed as "the epitome of a hypocrite" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>, someone who acts inconsistently with their stated beliefs and puts on "false appearances" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. The term "hypocrite" itself comes from the Ancient Greek word for "playacting," reinforcing the idea of politics as theater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. Frank states, "The road to power is paved with hypocrisy...and causalities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.

Historically, the search for "true motives" in politics has gone "really really bad," and the "hunt for the Frank Underwoods of the world is impossible behind [the] aesthetic nature of politics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. Arendt argues that the demand for everyone to display their "innermost motivation" transforms all actors into hypocrites, poisoning human relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. The solution, for Arendt, is to realize the inability to distinguish between "being and appearance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.

In contrast to Frank, [[character_analysis_of_frank_and_claire_underwood | Claire's]] portrayal suggests something exists behind her mask, which she must inhibit for her quest for power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. Her act of applying makeup immediately after hearing of Zoe Barnes's death suggests aesthetics suppressing her true feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. Claire's love of art, such as photography and origami, indicates a yearning for authentic self-expression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

## The Quest for Legacy: A House of Cards

Frank Underwood's primary drive is power, which he constantly reminds the viewer is "more important than money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. Power, for Frank, is the foundation of his "larger dream—to build a legacy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. His quest for power can be likened to building a work of art in the form of his legacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

The Buddhist monks' sand mandala in Season 3, which is painstakingly created and then destroyed, stands in stark contrast to Western art's desire for endurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. Frank is annoyed by the monks, which is significant because sand mandalas represent the fleeting nature of existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. Frank, who seeks immortality through power, compares money to a "McMansion in Sarasota that starts falling apart after ten years" and power to "the old stone building that stands for centuries" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

Frank's civil war diorama, meant to memorialize his ancestors, is destroyed by him, symbolizing that it, like his presidency, is fleeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. Claire, unlike Frank, does not detest the sand mandala, and its destruction foreshadows her departure from Frank, acknowledging that "nothing, not even her marriage, is permanent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. Claire's struggle with legacy differs; she discards her own ambitions for Frank's, but also picks up origami after a homeless person rejects her money and folds it into origami, symbolizing her desire to create a legacy through family rather than power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

The show's title, *House of Cards*, raises the question of whether Frank is building a lasting legacy or "simply a house of cards whose very existence is on the verge of collapse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. Frank strives for immortality, aiming for a grand burial where people will "have to wait in line" to pay respects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. The show suggests that the idea of making a name through great deeds and words has become so distorted in modern society that it can only be seen through "vainglorious characters like Frank Underwood," symptomatic of a loss of "genuine politics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

## The Spectacle of Politics and the Absence of Democracy

*House of Cards* conspicuously lacks a central tenet of America's political system: democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. The political system is reduced to "backroom dealings and media" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. Frank even states, "Democracy is so overrated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. Public opinion is merely a variable to be manipulated, such as deciding Claire's hair color or managing Peter Russo's "phoenix-out-of-ashes story" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.

The media, protected by the Constitution as integral to democracy, is depicted as part of a larger political game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. Zoe Barnes is fed information beneficial to Frank's machinations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>, and Tom Yates is hired to write propaganda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. German philosopher Carl Schmitt argued that debate and openness have become "mere spectacle for the backroom dealings of party leaders" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.

French philosopher Jean Baudrillard takes this further, arguing that in the modern media landscape, there is "no truth behind the lies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. Lies told by politicians and media take on lives of their own, and information circulates like commodities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>. Frank and Zoe literally barter for information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>. Baudrillard's idea is that "information produces meaning, the opposite occurs. Information devours its own content" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>, exemplified by a newspaper boss stating that "Zoe Barnes...Twitter...Blogs...Enriched media...They're all surface. They're fads" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>, and at Slugline, articles are posted without being checked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>.

This circuit of information is seductive. [[character_analysis_of_frank_and_claire_underwood | Frank Underwood]] is seductive not only to characters like Tom Yates and Meecham but also to the viewer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>. His closing ring knock in Season 2 leaves viewers with a sense of awe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>. The show prompts reflection on whether viewers enjoy the political performance and if they are "doomed to fall in love with the real Frank Underwoods of the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.

In conclusion, *House of Cards* is a show about the [[the_role_of_appearances_in_politics_based_on_house_of_cards | politics of appearance]], whether through art or theater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>. While the [[social_critique_using_popular_media | show offers a critique]], whether this is a bad thing is open to debate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>.

*The Dark Knight* is a film that delves deep into [[duality_in_the_dark_knight | duality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>, particularly exploring themes of moral dilemmas and the nature of justice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. Directed by Jonathan Nolan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>, the movie centers on Bruce Wayne, also known as Batman, who attempts to fight crime in Gotham City <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. His efforts are challenged by the Joker, an "unemployed clown" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a> who seeks to unravel society's moral fabric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

## The Joker's Challenge to Morality

The Joker's primary goal is to expose the fragility of an orderly society, believing it to be a facade over existential anarchy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. He is characterized as a nihilist who "believes in nothing, not even the concept of nihilism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. His actions, though seemingly random, are designed to prove that "morality is a sham" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. The Joker aims to show that if humans' physical comforts or safety are removed, they will revert to their "innate, base lawlessness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

Examples of the Joker's methods include:
*   Orchestrating bank robbers to kill each other for a larger share of loot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.
*   Giving weapons to three "friends" and telling them only the survivor joins his team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   Threatening to blow up hospitals to corrupt cops and incite citizens to attempt murder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

## The Fall of Harvey Dent

District Attorney Harvey Dent is initially presented as the "White Knight" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>, representing rigid adherence to justice, morality, and order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. His double-sided coin symbolizes his control over chance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. However, after Rachel Dawes is killed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a> and he becomes Two-Face, Dent's coin is scarred, making it a 50/50 proposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. This transformation signifies Dent's infection by the Joker's nihilistic vision, where "the only morality in a cruel world is chance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

Dent is initially a "Christ figure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>, with a campaign slogan of "I believe in Harvey Dent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. However, the film presents a modern interpretation of this image: a Christ without resurrection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>, symbolizing "a false Ideal, but one that must be upheld as a beacon of hope for mankind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

## Batman's Approach to Justice

Batman takes on the responsibility to uphold this facade of hope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>, thus maintaining order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. Unlike Dent, who represents order through idealism, Batman represents order through force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. He is described as "a fascist," a "necessary evil to tame the beastly side of mankind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. This aligns with [[batman_as_a_force_of_order_versus_morality | Batman as a force of order versus morality]].

The film suggests that "the democratic method is not enough" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a> to uphold justice. The ferry scene, where passengers vote to destroy another boat to ensure their survival, demonstrates that a simple vote would lead to an amoral outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. This implies that "tyrannical power" is sometimes required to uphold justice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

Batman's creation of the sonar machine, a "tremendous violation of privacy, bordering on morally bankrupt" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>, further illustrates his utilitarian approach to justice. As Alfred tells him, sometimes one must "burn the forest down" to catch a jewel thief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. Batman's decision to take the blame for Dent's actions and go on vacation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a> reinforces the idea that a "false Ideal" must be upheld for society's sake, which aligns with [[the_concept_of_the_noble_lie_in_the_dark_knight_rises | the concept of the noble lie]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

*The Dark Knight Rises*, released in 2012, garnered significant excitement upon its release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. While not considered a bad film, it often "pales in comparison to its predecessor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. Despite its "intellectual ambition" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>, not all of its thematic explorations, particularly concerning social inequality, fully pan out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Influence of Charles Dickens' A Tale of Two Cities

One of the smartest elements of *The Dark Knight Rises* is the unexpected [[influence_of_charles_dickens_a_tale_of_two_cities_on_the_dark_knight_rises | influence of Charles Dickens' *A Tale of Two Cities*]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. The film replicates most of the book's major themes, including social inequality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

*   **Social Inequality Parallel**: *A Tale of Two Cities* is set during the French Revolution, depicting a "decadent aristocracy and their abuse of the poor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Similarly, the film portrays a "class conflict through Bane's false revolution" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Bane's declaration, "Now we come here not as conquerors, but as liberators to return control of this city to the people," highlights this theme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

## The Dent Act and its Connection to Social Dynamics

The film attempts to explore complex social dynamics through the Dent Act, a piece of legislation allowing law enforcement increased power to persecute organized crime, established based on the "noble lie" of Harvey Dent's heroism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

*   **Metaphorical Readings**:
    *   **Patriot Act Analogy**: The Dent Act can be read as a metaphor for the Patriot Act, which faced criticism for granting the government dangerous power to combat terrorism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>, particularly given interpretations of the Joker's radicalism reflecting Al Qaeda extremism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
    *   **False Idol/Religious Institution**: Another reading positions Harvey Dent as a Christ figure without resurrection, where a fabricated lie of his return maintains his divine status and establishes a religious institution founded on that lie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. In this light, the Dent Act could be likened to how religion has historically justified "overreaching acts of power like the Inquisition" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

## Critique of the Dent Act's Depiction

Despite these intellectual ambitions, the film's execution of the Dent Act's implications for social inequality is criticized for falling short <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

*   **Lack of Corruption Evidence**: The film fails to show evidence that the Dent Act, a product of the noble lie, is corrupt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. In fact, it appears to be highly effective in reducing organized crime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.
*   **Contradictory Outcomes**: While Bane's revelation of the truth about Harvey Dent as a false idol leads to social unrest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>, the film ultimately concludes that "everything is only fixed when the truth is buried and another lie is established" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>, reinforcing the idea of a necessary lie for faith in justice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. This means the theme of truth and lies does not truly develop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.
*   **Bane's Revolution**: Bane is intended to be a product of this "toxic lie" and escalation, similar to how the Joker arose due to Batman's impact on Gotham's society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. However, there is no clear evidence presented that the Dent Act's corruption or the justifying lie led to the "unsavory political and economic tensions" that would trigger a violent reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.
*   **Missed Opportunity**: A scene where the Dent Act's surveillance capabilities save Catwoman's life highlights a missed opportunity to demonstrate the negative consequences of "invasive surveillance" or how those in power might use a lie to justify excessive authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.

## Vague Portrayal of Social Tensions

The film's depiction of social inequality, a major theme, is criticized for being "vague, muddy and almost nonsensical" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>, especially in contrast to *A Tale of Two Cities*' clear illustration of elite decadence leading to unrest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>.

*   **Blackgate Prison**: Blackgate Prison is presented by Bane as a "symbol of repression" under the Dent Act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>, with issues like overcrowding and lack of parole for criminals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.
    *   **Inadequate Justification**: While harsh, these realities "pale in comparison to the overwhelming success of the Dent Act" in imprisoning violent criminals and disrupting organized crime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>, making it unclear how this justifies overthrowing the rich <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.
    *   **Flawed Analogy to Bastille**: Blackgate serves as a clear stand-in for the Bastille during the French Revolution, with the Dent Act paralleling the "Lettres de Cachet" (warrants for arbitrary detention) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>. However, this analogy doesn't fit because Blackgate does not replicate the abuses of the Bastille, such as jailing people for wrong religion or criticizing the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>. The film fails to show Gotham police abusing their authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>, which would have complicated the final showdown where cops are heroes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>.
*   **Economic Situation**: A child in an orphanage suggests economic hardship drives orphans to join Bane's army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>. However, the film provides "zero indication on how the Dent Act or Blackgate are disenfranchising the poor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>. The only elite corruption shown is Daggit's attempt to steal Wayne Enterprises, which is a conflict among the rich, not the rich exploiting the poor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>.

## Conclusion

The underdeveloped world-building around social inequality has led some to condemn *The Dark Knight Rises* as "anti-Occupy Wall Street propaganda" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>, as it appears to show a society seeking "vengeance on the rich for no other reason than theyâ€™re rich" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>, without establishing what the people are rebelling against <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>. This portrays activists as "easily manipulated fascistic clowns" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>.

While *The Dark Knight Rises* is not a bad film, its ambition to weave in "social inequality" alongside [[themes_of_resurrection_truth_versus_lies_and_doubling_in_the_dark_knight_rises | themes of resurrection, truth versus lies, and doubling]], and to [[comparison_between_the_dark_knight_and_the_dark_knight_rises | juggle themes established in The Dark Knight]], resulted in a "messy" and underdeveloped portrayal of these complex social issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>.

*Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood* explores a strong [[philosophical_influences_in_media | philosophical core]] by confronting its protagonists, Edward and Alphonse Elric, with various discourses on the efficacy and application of science, or "Alchemy" in their world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. The series challenges viewers to question the value of single-mindedly clinging to science and the consequences of reducing all knowledge to scientific terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>, a mode of thought loosely known as scientism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

## Understanding Scientism

Philosophers who critique scientism are not claiming that science is a lie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. Instead, their criticism focuses on the tendency to elevate scientific knowledge above all other forms of knowledge and to attempt to reduce other forms of knowledge into it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

According to philosopher Paul Feyerabend, science is merely one among many competing explanatory frameworks, and it is "neither as rational nor consistent as it pretends to be" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. Feyerabend highlights how an unquestioning acceptance of science, much like any ideology, can lead to potentially disastrous results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. He famously questioned whether science should be separated from the state, with ultimate power resting in democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.

## Scientism in *Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood*

The anime immediately establishes a push-and-pull dynamic between science and faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. While the Elric brothers initially appear to favor science, their skepticism toward the divine is quickly complicated by the horrifying applications of alchemy.

### Amoral Application of Science

*   **Father Cornello vs. Shou Tucker:** In Liore, the Elrics expose Father Cornello's "miracles" as cleverly veiled applications of alchemy used to indoctrinate followers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. This initially suggests "Science Rules Faith drools" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. However, this is immediately inverted when they encounter Shou Tucker, the "Sewing-Life Alchemist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. Tucker used his own daughter and family dog to create a talking chimera, claiming he was simply "doing what science demands" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. This act highlights how science, in the hands of an amoral alchemist seeking knowledge at any cost, can cease to be innocent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

*   **The Law of Equivalent Exchange and Dehumanization:** Alchemy's most important law, "The Law of Equivalent Exchange," reduces objects, animals, and even people to their physical components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. This impersonal, dehumanizing aspect is central to the Elric Brothers' journey, which began with their belief they could transmute a human by simply gathering basic ingredients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

*   **The Philosopher's Stone:** The ultimate product of alchemy, the Philosopher's Stone, is revealed to require human life as its key ingredient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. While it allows users to ignore the Law of Equivalent Exchange, the Elrics are reluctant to use it due to its horrifying origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. In contrast, the Homunculi, artificial humans powered by these stones, exemplify scientism by reducing the souls trapped within the stones to mere alchemic principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. This contrasts sharply with philosopher Immanuel Kant's view that people should never be used or reduced to calculations but are always an end in themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

### Subservience to the Military and State Control

Alchemy in Amestris is heavily controlled by the government, with one of its three state-appointed tenets being "obey the military" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. State Alchemists are commonly referred to as "dogs of the military" or even "human weapons" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

Sociologist Stanley Aronowitz argues that while scientists often view themselves as independent, their funding typically comes from corporations or the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. As such, scientists often do not own their discoveries and have little say over their application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. This is vividly depicted through Ed's constant clashes with the militarization of science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.

The military even distorts the basic principles of science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. While the Elrics learn that alchemy is about understanding the natural flow of energy, deconstructing and reconstructing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>, military generals rephrase this as "Alchemic Rebirth" to justify destroying and slaughtering entire populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

### The Ishbalan War and Scientific Justification for Genocide

The Ishbalan War of Extermination, one of Amestris's most brutal conflicts, was fought to further the chief antagonist "Father's" plan to assume the mantle of God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. State alchemists made their largest military impact in this war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. The shocking aspect of Ishbal is not just the devastating force of alchemy but the sterile, scientific language used to explain what is essentially genocide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. FÃ¼hrer King Bradley even used the "Law of Equivalent Exchange" to refuse a ceasefire in exchange for the high priest's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.

The parallels between Amestris and pre-World War II Germany are evident, with a militant nation, a blond-haired, blue-eyed army resembling the SS, and the "Might is Right" motivation of Nazi Germany, including General Raven invoking Social Darwinism to justify mass extermination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. The human experiments in Amestris recall those of Dr. Josef Mengele at Auschwitz, demonstrating similar cruelty and morbid scientific curiosity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. Paul Feyerabend, who fought as a Lieutenant in World War II, witnessed firsthand the scientific arguments made by a dictatorship for war and genocide, which likely influenced his call for a separation between science and state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>.

## Beyond Scientism: Integrating Knowledge

*Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood* is a cautionary tale about blind adherence to science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>. However, it does not advocate for "Faith is good, Science is bad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>. The problem, as Feyerabend suggests, is any unreflective veneration of any ideology, as it inhibits free thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>. Blindly following science as the arbiter of truth is just as harmful as blindly following faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>. Examples include Father Cornello and the Homunculi using faith to incite violence, or Scar using his God, Ishvala, to justify vengeance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>.

Characters in *Brotherhood* grow when they realize the limitations of adhering to any single ideology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. The Elrics question the foundations of Western Alchemy and seek out its Eastern equivalent, Alkahestry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>. Bridging the gap between these two ideologies ultimately allows them to triumph <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>.

Scar's transformation further embodies this development. Initially driven by vengeance and cloaking his actions in the words of God, he eventually realizes that no ideology can justify murder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>. He even breaks from his strict religious laws to use alchemy to save the country he once hated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>.

In contrast, the main antagonist, "Father," clings to his single-minded belief in science, becoming obsessed with alchemy's power and viewing mankind as mere materials for him to use in becoming God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>. Blinded by scientism, he cannot understand human emotions and discards them, literally ripping the seven deadly sins from himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>. His conviction in the absolute supremacy of science and the ability to achieve perfection through it ultimately undoes him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>. Father's failure to recognize human wisdom beyond alchemy contrasts sharply with Scar's growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>.

## The Search for Truth

Edward and Alphonse's humble rejection of a single ideology makes them special <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>. At their core is a strong desire to discover their own truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:28">[00:19:28]</a>. They reject the notion that destroying the world for their own benefit is merely "equivalent exchange" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>, affirming their desire to find their *own* truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>.

This search for possibilities allows Edward to make his final transmutation: sacrificing his ability to perform alchemy to bring his brother back, recognizing the arrogance in thinking alchemy could explain everything or solve all his problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>. Unlike Father, who equated alchemy with power, Ed understands that true power comes from recognizing one's place in the universe and not trying to be a God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:40">[00:20:40]</a>.

With their bodies restored and the world saved, the Elric brothers continue their search for truth and new methods to discover it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:02">[00:21:02]</a>. Alphonse expresses a desire to give back to those who helped them, not through a cold formula like the Law of Equivalent Exchange, but through a deeper principle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">[00:21:11]</a>. They travel east and west, respectively, to gather all knowledge and make this principle a reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:32">[00:21:32]</a>. *Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood* suggests that pure devotion to science can lead to a dark path, implying a need to inject [[philosophy_of_science_and_verificationism_vs_falsificationism | philosophy]] into how we view the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:13">[00:22:13]</a>.

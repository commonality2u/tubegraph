*South Park* is widely associated with the word "irreverent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, and critics consistently describe the show as such <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This means that nothing is considered sacred in the show's universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. While the term is often used generally, *South Park*'s [[south_parks_portrayal_of_religion | treatment of religion]] is particularly distinctive given that religion itself typically emphasizes reverence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. The series prompts viewers to critically examine the meaning of religion and poses questions that other shows might not dare to ask <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## Irreverence Towards Religion

From its origins, *South Park* consistently mixed religious figures with ordinary or absurd situations. Early holiday specials featured Jesus battling an evil snowman and Santa Claus for the soul of the holidays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. A core sentiment established in these specials, and throughout the series, is that seemingly ordinary things can be a "really big deal," while things that sound "mindblowingly important on paper" can be no big deal at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

In *South Park*, the profound and the ordinary often coexist in the same realm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>:
*   The boys are not starstruck when speaking to Jesus but fight over who plays him in an Easter play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
*   When meeting God in season three, Stan's burning question is about periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
*   The meaning of life is revealed to be Earth as an intergalactic *Truman Show*-style reality series on the verge of cancellation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.
*   Jesus struggles to get viewers for his public-access talk show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
*   Satan is portrayed as a serial monogamist stuck in a toxic relationship with Saddam Hussein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

Religion primarily gains importance in *South Park* when people manipulate it for personal gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. Eric Cartman is depicted as the undisputed master of this [[critique_of_religious_manipulation_in_south_park | religious manipulation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. He admits to knowing enough about Christianity to "exploit it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. Examples include:
*   Becoming a wealthy tent revival preacher in season four <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
*   Making it big in Christian music by adapting secular pop songs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
*   Forming a fan club around Mel Gibson's *The Passion of the Christ* to lead the Fourth Reich in "The Passion of the Jew" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. This episode delves into [[south_parks_treatment_of_antisemitism_and_cultural_bigotry | anti-Semitism and cultural bigotry]].
*   Painting a cow to resemble the biblically prophesied red heifer to mess with Kyle's head, accidentally bringing about world peace in season 17 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

Despite this [[satirical_social_commentary_in_south_park | satirical social commentary]], creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker largely disagree with the impression that the show's message is that religion is simply ridiculous and makes people gullible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. Stone states that while the show makes fun of everything, including religion, neither he nor Parker are anti-religious, and he is personally fascinated by religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

## Denying the Sacred and Profane Distinction

*South Park*'s irreverence, particularly towards religion, stems from its refusal to treat religion as a sacred subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. In Western spiritual traditions, honoring the sacred is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. French philosopher Émile Durkheim, in *The Elementary Forms of Religious Life*, argued that Western religions operate by dividing the world into two categories: the sacred and the profane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. The sacred is always taken seriously due to its connection to fundamental cosmic forces and the state of one's soul, while the profane is not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. Durkheim emphasized that there are "no other example of two category of things so profoundly differentiated or so radically opposed to one another" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

*South Park* fundamentally denies the legitimacy of this [[comparison_of_sacred_and_profane_in_south_park | distinction between the sacred and the profane]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. For example, in "Red Hot Catholic Love" (season six), Father Maxie's journey to end the clergy molestation scandal reveals the Catholic Church as an intergalactic coalition ruled by a sentient giant spider that has sanctioned pedophilia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. Maxie's act of tearing the "sacred Vatican Document" in two is a metaphor for the scandal itself: the church could only evolve if it ceased being too sacred to investigate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. This highlights a recurring theme: sometimes, the only way to save something that has been made sacred is by desecrating it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. Further instances include Cartman and Kenny saving the world by cursing out Saddam Hussein and making a deal with the Devil in *South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.

The show also suggests that humanity's concept of the sacred is inherently flawed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. Jesus, despite literally walking the Earth, often goes unnoticed or unrecognized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>, and his talk show "Jesus and Pals" is routinely beaten in ratings by "Huntin' and Killin'" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. However, when Jesus engages in combat, he suddenly earns his followers' respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>, illustrating what American theologian Walter Wink called the "myth of redemptive violence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. According to Wink, society's dominant "religion" is the desire to see good fight evil and win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. Jesus fights because the myth his followers project onto him is more important than anything he can offer himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. When religious figures become superheroes, it's a logical conclusion of this myth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

## Irreverence Beyond Religion

While *South Park* faces boycotts for its portrayal of figures like Jesus and censorship for attempts to portray Muhammad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>, Stone and Parker do not see themselves as heroes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. Beyond religious targets, the show's irreverence reveals a major recurring theme: people do not need to be religious to act like "narrow-minded assholes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.

Almost every episode features a self-righteous character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. Stan's character arc in season sixteen, where he becomes a self-promotional activist in "Butterballs" and "A Scause for Applause," is a strong example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. He enjoys being treated with reverence but quickly moves on from causes that don't make him popular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. This contrasts with Wendy Testaburger, who has deeper motivations and self-respect, regardless of popularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. *South Park* posits that movements run by individuals seeking seriousness are likely to "go off the rails" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>, a critique that applies to the New Atheism movement as much as any other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. In the two-part episode "Go God Go," militant atheist factions in the 26th century kill each other over branding disputes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. This episode's message is simple: human beings are violent and irrational, and removing religion will not change this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

Stone and Parker hold the view that religion becomes ridiculous because people are ridiculous, rather than the other way around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. Margaret Wertheim, in *Pythagoras’ Trousers*, argues that Western scientific models of the universe often resemble religious ones due to a "hypermasculine drive for certainty and finality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. Like Stone and Parker, Wertheim suggests that refusing to accept ambiguity makes answers to big questions sound ridiculous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

## Inevitable Ridiculousness

*South Park* avoids prescribing whether one should be religious or not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. Matt Stone questioned in 2011 whether a "mass delusion of a religion" that makes someone happy and improves their family life is inherently bad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>. The series has explicitly made this argument twice, in "Red Hot Catholic Love" and "All About Mormons" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. Stone and Parker's stance—that being religious is sensible, and not being religious is also sensible—echoes William James's *Pragmatism* (1907) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>:

> "When a play is once over, and the curtain drawn, you really make it no better by claiming an illustrious genius for its author, just as you make it no worse by calling him a common hack.” <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>

Essentially, life remains life, regardless of whether it was created by a divine figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>.

Unlike many series that deal with religion and offer an "escape route" via an acceptable ideology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>, *South Park*'s unique underlying philosophy is that being human is inevitably ridiculous, and this fate cannot be avoided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. The show suggests that regardless of one's chosen religion or philosophy, taking oneself too seriously will make one appear silly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. The ultimate question is not whether a belief system is a joke, but whether one is aware that it is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.

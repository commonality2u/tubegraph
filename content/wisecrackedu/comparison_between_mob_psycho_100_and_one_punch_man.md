Both *Mob Psycho 100* and [[analysis_of_one_punch_man_as_parody | One Punch Man]] are creations of Japanese manga artist ONE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. These shows explore what it means to live a fulfilling life by examining the unique challenges faced by [[overpowered_protagonists_and_their_struggles | overpowered protagonists]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Overpowered Protagonists and the Pursuit of Fulfillment

Both series feature protagonists with immense power: Shigeo "Mob" Kageyama possesses near-godlike psychic abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>, and Saitama is an unparalleled hero who can defeat any opponent with a single punch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. However, their experiences with these abilities diverge significantly.

### Mob's Path to Peace

Unlike Saitama, Mob finds a way to make peace with his abilities and derive satisfaction from life in spite of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Mob, a middle schooler, endeavors to live a normal life and tries to repress the rage that fuels his powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. He believes that an easy life built entirely on innate gifts would be "pointless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a> because the things he truly desires, like muscles, understanding girls, or reading social cues, must be worked for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

Mob's master, Reigen Arataka, advises him never to use his powers against another human, emphasizing that misusing such great power would only lead to self-destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. This guidance, coupled with Mob's own inclinations, leads him to embrace self-imposed limitations and challenges as keys to a fulfilling existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

Mob's perspective aligns with Irish philosopher Edmund Burke's concept of "the sublime" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. Burke believed that experiences of feeling infinitesimally small in the face of overwhelming forces—which suspend or destroy egocentricity—are vital for a healthy life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. For Mob, realizing his own insignificance, often facilitated by Reigen's mentorship, allows him to come to terms with his abilities and live a good life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.

### The Struggles of Other Espers and Saitama

In contrast to Mob, most other espers in *Mob Psycho 100* are profoundly egocentric, viewing themselves as "main characters" rather than regular people with limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Like the Paradisers in [[parody_and_satirical_elements_in_one_punch_man | One Punch Man]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>, these espers carry a massive sense of entitlement that ultimately leaves them miserable when reality fails to meet their false expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. Mob observes that without their psychic powers, these espers would be "empty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

Their reliance on innate power for identity leads to a "relaxed state of body" that, according to Burke, fosters "melancholy, dejection, despair" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. They avoid "difficulties" and must be "shaken and worked" by external forces to find true fulfillment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. This "reality check" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>, or experience of the sublime, helps them recognize their human vulnerability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.

Saitama, the protagonist of [[analysis_of_one_punch_man_as_parody | One Punch Man]], embodies a different facet of the [[overpowered_protagonists_and_their_struggles | overpowered protagonist]]'s struggle. While Mob finds peace, Saitama faces a different kind of challenge: the show *Mob Psycho 100* explicitly states, "No such luck for One Punch Man. Sorry, Saitama" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>, implying he has not yet found a way to overcome his power-induced [[themes_of_existential_boredom_and_ennui_in_one_punch_man | existential boredom]] and dissatisfaction.

## The ONE-iverse: Happiness Through Struggle

Both *Mob Psycho 100* and [[analysis_of_one_punch_man_as_parody | One Punch Man]] prompt reflection on what constitutes a good life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>. The struggles of Mob and Saitama with their powers reveal that a fulfilling existence is not as simple as always getting what one desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>. In the "ONE-iverse," happiness is portrayed as the result of deliberate struggle and growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>.

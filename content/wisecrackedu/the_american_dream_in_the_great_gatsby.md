F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel, [[summary_of_the_great_gatsby|The Great Gatsby]], is interpreted as a [[the_american_dream_and_its_failures|criticism of the anti-Calvinistic image of the American dream]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. While America may have originated as a land of mutual support, Fitzgerald's depiction of America is filled with betrayal, which renders [[the_american_dream_and_its_failures|Gatsby's romantic dream]] ridiculous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

## Gatsby's Ideals

Despite the societal critique, Gatsby is presented as someone who adheres to his [[the_american_dream_and_its_failures|American ideals]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. According to Minter, "Because of the beauty of his dream and the heroism of his efforts to move beyond it, Gatsby can be made great" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

## Dreams vs. Reality

A significant [[motifs_in_the_great_gatsby|motif]] explored in the novel is that of dreams versus reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. Gatsby harbors extensive delusions about a future with Daisy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. He believes it is possible to repeat the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>, but the narrative suggests that past time cannot be recovered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. Fitzgerald embodies this [[motifs_in_the_great_gatsby|motif]] through subtle details, such as Gatsby possessing a large collection of unread books, which implies he is feigning intelligence, a departure from reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

## Symbolism of the Green Light

The [[symbolism_of_the_green_light_in_the_great_gatsby|symbol of the green light]] is crucial to understanding Gatsby's dream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. Some interpretations suggest the green light symbolizes the fading optimism of Gatsbyâ€™s dream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. Initially, at the beginning of the book, the [[symbolism_of_the_green_light_in_the_great_gatsby|green light]] possesses a vibrant quality that ignites Gatsby's desire for a future with Daisy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. However, by the novel's conclusion, it becomes merely an ordinary green light, stripped of its special significance, mirroring the disillusionment of Gatsby's "fake ass dreams" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

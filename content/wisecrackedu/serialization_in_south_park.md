For a period, *South Park* departed from its signature standalone episodes to embrace season-long serialization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This shift was largely well-received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Evolution of Serialization

Season 19 demonstrated a brilliant blend of themes, including PC culture, advertising, and gentrification, across a multi-episode arc <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This season offered [[neoliberalism_in_south_park_season_19 | critical commentary on neoliberalism]] and [[cultural_and_social_critiques_in_south_park | broader cultural and social critiques]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Season 20 began with an even more ambitious storyline, juggling the presidential election, "member berries," a militant feminist Cartman, a girl-hating Butters, and extensive internet trolling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. This complex narrative highlighted the [[challenges_faced_by_south_park_creators_in_season_20 | challenges faced by the creators]] in maintaining a cohesive plot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## South Park's Golden Rule of Storytelling

Despite its unpredictable and unhinged nature, *South Park*'s writing follows a strict order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. The show adheres to a rigid plot line rule: a good narrative avoids simply connecting events with "and then" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

> [!INFO] The "But" or "Therefore" Rule
> Whenever "ands" can be replaced with "buts" or "therefores," it makes for better writing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. This indicates a cause-and-effect relationship or a consequence/reaction to the previous action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. Every plot point matters, ensuring the show never loses momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

An example of this rule in practice is *South Park*'s Mormon episode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>, which touches on [[religious_themes_and_criticism_in_south_park_episodes | religious themes]] and [[south_parks_treatment_of_religion | the show's treatment of religion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. An annoyingly perfect Mormon kid moves to town, *therefore* he pisses everyone off, *therefore* Stan decides to fight him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. *But* the kid is so nice that he tells Stan to beat him up, *therefore* Stan doesn't and agrees to dinner instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

## Season 20's Serialization Challenges

The 2016 U.S. presidential election significantly disrupted *South Park*'s serialized narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. Creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker had anticipated "turd sandwich" (Hillary Clinton) would win, and planned the season around that outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. When "giant douche" Mr. Garrison (Donald Trump) unexpectedly won, last-minute rewrites were necessary for the episode airing the day after the election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Breaking the Rules
> As soon as Mr. Garrison won, the show began to break its core storytelling rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>, shifting from a "but" or "therefore" based plot to a "clusterf**k of and thens" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

### Member Berries Plotline
Initially, the "member berries" plotline followed the golden rule: Randy tries member berries, falls into nostalgia, and things get dark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. *Therefore*, Randy realizes they are dangerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. This set up a clear purpose: a physical embodiment of toxic nostalgia to be overcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

However, after Mr. Garrison's victory, the narrative struggled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. Garrison wins "out of nowhere," *and then* Caitlin Jenner barfs, reinfecting Garrison and Randy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. This essentially "rewinds" the plot, with characters unlearning the perils of nostalgia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. The member berries' transformation becomes muddled: from lazy berries, *and then* a vomit-inducing virus, *and then* a brief side story in a 1920s nightclub, *and then* they are revealed to be Nazis and later a "tiny fruit militia" allied with Vladimir Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. The show failed to offer justification for these transformations, resulting in a random progression of events without apparent logic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

### Trolling Plotline
The subplot involving Kyle's dad, Gerald, as the troll "skankhunt42" also became tangled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. Initially, Gerald's trolling angers the Danes, *therefore* they threaten to release everyone's internet history, causing panic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. Hillary Clinton, confident of winning, needs Skankhunt42 because troll trace might leak her online activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.

When Clinton lost, her reason for recruiting Gerald evaporated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. *And then* confusingly, she recruits him anyway for a vague mission to infiltrate troll trace to protect U.S. secrets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. This disjointed scene was likely recycled material from the "if Hillary had won" version of the episode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. The plot further unravels: Clinton's claim was a ruse to help the Danes kidnap American trolls for email protection, *and then* the Danes were just trolling the captured Americans, *and then* their top guy was also just a giant troll "trolling the world for the lulz," *and also* not even Danish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. This progression lacked cause-and-effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

The writers openly admitted the narrative hole they dug <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. The idea that the Danish guy was "just trolling the world" seemed like a last-ditch effort to save the narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>, perhaps reflecting a "new post funny era of [[social_satire_in_south_park | satire]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

Ultimately, to resolve incomplete storylines like Cartman's and Gerald's exposed internet histories, the show resorted to "plot hari-kari" by "blowing everything up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. The internet is destroyed, deleting everyone's secrets and obliterating the cause-and-effect relationship built throughout the season <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. This prevented a satisfying resolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.

### Missed Opportunities
The altered election outcome meant the show couldn't fully develop promising themes. It had effectively analyzed how the internet fragments public and private selves and enables anonymous bad behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. It also brilliantly skewered the outrage cycles dominating internet culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>, an idea that could have explained Mr. Garrison's victory better than member berries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.

In a parallel universe where Hillary Clinton won, Season 20 would have focused on Bill Clinton settling into his role as the "terrified First Gentleman" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>, escalating the "battle of the sexes" already underway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>. This would have added poignancy to Cartman's fear of his girlfriend Heidi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>. Instead, the "First Gentleman's Club" plotline was abandoned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.

## The Future of Serialization

The creators hinted at "the end of serialization as we know it" in the final episode of Season 20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. While Season 20 was messy, Seasons 18 and 19 were considered some of their best work in a decade, showing great promise for the serialized format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.

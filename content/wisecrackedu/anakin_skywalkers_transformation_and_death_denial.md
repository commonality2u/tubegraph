Darth Vader, the galaxy's most famous cyborg sorcerer laser-swordsman, is perhaps cinema's most iconic villain, central to the *Star Wars* franchise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. [[the_role_of_fear_in_anakins_path_to_the_dark_side | Anakin Skywalker's descent to the dark side]] resonates powerfully because it represents an all-consuming [[darth_vader_and_the_fear_of_death | fear of death]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Through Vader, *Star Wars* explores two distinct [[philosophical_responses_to_death_in_star_wars | philosophical responses to death]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## The Role of Fear and Death Denial

[[the_role_of_fear_in_anakins_path_to_the_dark_side | Fear]], specifically the fear of death, ultimately turns Anakin Skywalker into [[darth_vader_and_the_fear_of_death | Darth Vader]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. In his 1973 book *The Denial of Death*, cultural anthropologist Ernest Becker argued that much of human action is a way of managing the fear of one's own demise and the demise of loved ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. This anxiety, known as "death denial," is particularly evident in [[darth_vader_and_the_fear_of_death | Darth Vader]] and dates back to his childhood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

### Anakin's Childhood and Early Fears

First introduced as a wise and articulate nine-year-old boy genius with superhuman piloting skills, Anakin Skywalker is depicted as a virgin birth, smarter than adults, and potentially the messiah <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. His Force aptitude is exceptionally high, measured by midichlorians, establishing him as objectively more powerful than others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. Yet, even young Anakin is terrified of death, specifically his mother's mortality, a distress that haunts him and becomes a fixation as he ages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

Yoda identifies this fear as a problem early on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. The Jedi's hesitation to train Anakin due to his age, though not explicitly canon, suggests concerns about death denial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. Children, according to psychologist James A. Graham, begin to understand death's permanence between ages 5-9, but only later, around age 10, do they grasp its universality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. Anakin, at nine, understands his mother's mortality and is on the cusp of realizing his own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

### Violence as a Response to Death Denial

Becker posits that human violence is a natural response to death denial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. "Only scapegoats can relieve one of his own stark death fear," he writes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. Inflicting death provides a sense of control over it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. For Anakin, this leads directly to the Dark Side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. An original script line for Episode 1 foreshadows Anakin's arc: "Fear attracts the fearful. He was trying to overcome his fear by squashing you... To a point" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. This indicates his attempt to "squash" death rather than become less afraid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

When Anakin's mother is mortally wounded, he slaughters the entire Tusken Raider village <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. Becker explains this revenge as giving the illusion of control over death, assuaging the fear the Jedi Council warned about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. The more he kills, the more death feels like something he "owns" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

## [[philosophical_responses_to_death_in_star_wars | Philosophical Responses to Death]]: Jedi vs. Sith

Anakin's anxiety dreams about Padmé dying in childbirth lead him to a critical choice: the [[sith_versus_jedi_approach_to_mortality | Sith way]] or the Jedi way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

### The Jedi Approach: Nonattachment and Faith

Yoda advises Anakin to "Train yourself to let go of everything you fear to lose" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. This philosophy draws from Buddhism, which identifies *jaramarana*—the desire to escape old age and death—as a seductive impulse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. Nonattachment, or letting go of desires, is the path to defeat it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. Yoda exemplifies this, showing peaceful acceptance of his own death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

Becker describes Yoda as a "knight of faith," a term from Soren Kierkegaard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. Authentic faith in something greater than death can manage terror <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. For Yoda, this is faith in the light side of the Force, accepting death as a natural part of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. This faith is "a matter of grace and not of human effort" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.

### The [[sith_versus_jedi_approach_to_mortality | Sith Approach]]: Embracing Desire and Conquering Death

Lacking Yoda's faith, Anakin turns to Palpatine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. The [[sith_versus_jedi_approach_to_mortality | Sith approach]] embraces desires—in this case, the desire to prevent Padmé's death—which is an act of death denial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. Palpatine tempts Anakin with the legend of Darth Plagueis the Wise, suggesting the dark side can defeat death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

Anakin becomes a [[sith_versus_jedi_approach_to_mortality | Sith Lord]] on the condition of saving Padmé's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. His refusal to accept death leads him down a dark path, sacrificing his identity, loyalty, and conscience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. He kills children, his wife, and attempts to kill his mentor, becoming "little more than a zombie trapped in a machine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. Becker describes this as the "terminal point of death denial": the person seeks to avoid death by "killing off so much of himself" that he becomes "as though dead" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. Without loved ones to protect, [[darth_vader_and_the_fear_of_death | Darth Vader]] becomes merely an instrument of power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.

## Transcending Death and Redemption

Obi-Wan Kenobi's sacrifice in *Episode IV* can be seen as confronting Anakin's ill-fated choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. His lightsaber duel with Vader appears to be more of a sacrifice than an attempt to kill, culminating in Kenobi's mysterious "rapture" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. His cryptic statement, "If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you could possibly imagine," reveals an alternative to Vader's death denial by embracing death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

Kenobi learned to "cheat death" by communing with Qui-Gon Jinn, who returned from the netherworld of the Force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. This isn't conquering death, but rather "transcending death," allowing Force ghosts to interact with living Jedi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. Anakin himself joins this "squad" after his redemption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

The contrast between Anakin and Luke's confrontations with death highlights this difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. Anakin's indiscriminate slaughter of Tusken Raiders and his rage-fueled actions against Padmé stem from his death denial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. Luke, however, is willing to sacrifice his own life to avoid turning to the dark side and refuses to kill Vader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. This willingness to accept death truly separates a Jedi from a [[sith_versus_jedi_approach_to_mortality | Sith]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. It is only when Anakin follows his son's example and renounces his own life that he embraces the reality of death and conquers *jaramarana* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.

## Conclusion

The story of Anakin Skywalker illustrates how *jaramarana*—the denial of death—can corrode personalities, strip away values, and incite terrible acts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. Becker argues that death denial drives violence, conquest, and the need to control surroundings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. Evil Empires, both fictional and real, owe their existence to this inability to accept mortality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.

However, accepting the reality of death can foster dignity, courage, and compassion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. It is never too late, as [[darth_vader_and_the_fear_of_death | Darth Vader]]'s redemption shows, to come to terms with death, or risk succumbing to the Dark Side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.

*The Matrix Reloaded* is often criticized for its narrative approach, particularly its handling of [[themes_of_determinism_and_free_will | deterministic]] philosophical themes which ultimately undermine the protagonist's agency and dramatic action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

## Challenging the Hero's Journey
The original *Matrix* film effectively combined deep philosophical themes with a tight structure, heavily influenced by Joseph Campbell's concept of the Monomyth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. Campbell's "hero’s journey" involves three phases: "separation from the world, a penetration to some source of power, and a life-enhancing return" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. Dan Harmon, writer of [[themes_of_freedom_and_choice_in_rick_and_morty | Rick and Morty]], notes this model is "hardwired into [our] nervous system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

The challenge for the Wachowskis in writing *The Matrix Reloaded* was how to continue a story once the protagonist, Neo, had become "Master of Two Worlds" and essentially "freakin Superman" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. A character who is all-powerful makes it difficult to craft a meaningful story arc with believable internal and external conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

## The Prophecy as Control
The Wachowskis' theoretical solution was to tweak the prophecy that gave Neo his powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. This concept forms the central plot of *The Matrix Reloaded* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. Over the course of the film, Neo and the audience gradually realize that the prophecy is not a path to transcendence but another form of control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Neo's powers are not evidence of him breaking free from the system; instead, they are part of the system itself, indicating he is playing a predetermined role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. As the Architect cryptically states, Neo is "the eventuality of an anomaly" that is "not unexpected and thus, not beyond a measure of control" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

## Lack of Dramatic Action
The film's focus on [[themes_of_determinism_and_free_will | determinism]] leads to a significant lack of "dramatic action" — choices a character makes to advance their goal and the plot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. Since all of Neo's "choices" are presented as an illusion created by a larger system of control, there is virtually no dramatic action in the film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. This is further exacerbated by lengthy, "philosophically confused monologues about [[themes_of_determinism_and_free_will | determinism]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

## [[themes_of_determinism_and_free_will | Determinism]] Defined and Depicted
[[themes_of_determinism_and_free_will | Determinism]] loosely suggests that "every moment in the future is dictated by a moment in the past" through cause and effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. This is likened to watching dominoes fall: knowing the first domino means knowing the entire sequence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

*The Matrix Reloaded* embraces this philosophy heavily:
*   The opening scene, which shows Neo dreaming of Trinity's death, is actually from the film's closing moments, implying that the events are already cemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
*   The Matrix has restarted six times, suggesting the world is stuck in a predetermined loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
*   A punch clock striking midnight symbolizes the completion of a circle and seamless transition from one day to the next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
*   The Key Maker's plan to infiltrate the tower specifies exactly 314 seconds for Neo to reach the Architect, a number conspicuously referencing Pi, which also appears elsewhere in the film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. These serve as constant reminders that Neo is "rethreading a circle for the 6th time" rather than blazing a new path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.

## Neo's Lack of Agency
Throughout the film, Neo's lack of agency is repeatedly highlighted:
*   In the opening dream sequence, Neo makes no choices except admitting he doesn't know what to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.
*   The first point of dramatic action is delayed for 39 minutes, with the first hour involving politics and a conversation questioning Neo's agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
*   When Neo finally finds the Oracle 44 minutes into the movie, she reminds him that his choice has already been made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. The inciting incident is philosophical exposition that reminds viewers Neo has no agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.
*   Neo's quest is described as a "glorified fetch quest" with vague instructions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.
*   Agent Smith delivers a monologue on [[themes_of_determinism_and_free_will | determinism]] to Neo, asserting that Neo is bound by a larger system of cause and effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.
*   The Merovingian delivers another speech on [[themes_of_determinism_and_free_will | determinism]], even demonstrating it by sending a girl a piece of cake designed to make her orgasm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. This is the fourth instance teasing Neo as a "puppet on strings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
*   When the Merovingian withholds the Key Maker, Neo and his group don't have to devise a clever solution; instead, the Key Maker is offered up by Persephone in exchange for a kiss with Neo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.
*   Action sequences, such as the Agents chasing the Key Maker, lose their purpose if Neo is merely playing into the Architect's hands, as their failure would lead to the Matrix's destruction anyway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

## The Climax and Final Question
The journey to the Source, which should be the climax, feels anticlimactic because the audience already knows Trinity will be shot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. Instead of dramatic action, the film provides an "information dump" from the Architect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.

The Architect explains the prophecy's role and how Neo, like five predecessors, must surrender his code to the Matrix mainframe to save Zion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>. The film is "hellbent on taking away his agency" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>, with the Architect explicitly stating Neo was "designed" to feel love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. Even when Neo is presented with a choice to save Zion or Trinity, the Architect reminds him it's predetermined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. Neo's subsequent action of saving Trinity is unsurprising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>.

The film's constant "sermons on [[themes_of_determinism_and_free_will | determinism]]" dilute the few plot points and, if understood, only serve to remind the audience that Neo has no agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>. Without dramatic action, the film leaves viewers asking: "Can Neo actually make choices? Can he break free from the system of control...?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a> Instead of providing an answer, *The Matrix Reloaded* defers to *The Matrix Revolutions* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.

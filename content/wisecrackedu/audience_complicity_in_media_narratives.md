The film *The Wolf of Wall Street* explores the concept of audience complicity in the narratives presented by media, particularly concerning themes of excess and unethical behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. Despite Jordan Belfort's corrupt actions and eventual prison sentence, the film notably lacks overt moralizing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>. His four-year prison term is depicted as a "cakewalk," and he doesn't serve his full sentence, leading to the conclusion that "nothing has changed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>. This absence of clear punishment for Belfort's actions points towards a deeper critique of the audience's role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>.

## The Audience as Participants

The film's closing shot, featuring a "simple push-in and crane-up" on an audience listening intently to Belfort, is presented as crucial for understanding the film's meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. This scene uses solemn music, a stark contrast to the film's earlier "poppy, upbeat hits" that underscored debauchery, indicating a shift towards a more serious and meditative tone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>.

### Holding a Mirror to the Viewer
One interpretation is that the final shot serves as a mirror, reflecting the audience's own complicity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>. A backlight behind the seminar audience, evoking a projector shining on viewers, suggests that the blame for the moral depravity depicted in the film may extend beyond Jordan Belfort to "us, and the culture that allows and encourages his behavior" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>.

Jordan Belfort's early assertion that people "want to get rich and they want to get rich quickly" and "all want something for nothing" highlights a shared societal desire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>. The film implies that Belfort's scams succeed because the audience, and society at large, shares his dream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>. Director Martin Scorsese is seen as "calling us out" for having spent three hours "partying with Jordan, laughing and reveling in his exploits," living vicariously through him, and even "wishing that we could live his life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>.

### Worship of Money
The final shot also draws a parallel between the audience's intense focus on Jordan Belfort and a form of worship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>. While Scorsese, a devout Catholic, has explored faith in his films, *The Wolf of Wall Street* portrays characters worshipping "MONEY" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>. The camera focuses on "painfully average faces" of people who are "desperate, plain-looking" and "looking for meaning; desiring that which can elevate them above their mundane existence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>. This suggests a cynical comparison between the transformative power of faith and that of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:00">[04:34:00]</a>.

### Voluntary Submission of the Masses
A more sinister interpretation posits that the solemn portrayal of a crowd worshipping Jordan Belfort, despite his detestable actions, suggests that people "actually like being taken advantage of" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>. This concept echoes French philosopher Jean-Francois Lyotard's idea of the "hysterical, masochistic... exhaustion" and "mad destruction of their organic bodies" experienced by the English unemployed, who "enjoyed" their harsh conditions, "the decomposition of their personal identity," and "the new monstrous anonymity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19:00">[05:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:23:00">[05:23:00]</a>.

> "The English unemployed did not become workers to survive, they… enjoyed the hysterical, masochistic, whatever exhaustion it was of hanging on the mines, in the foundries, in the factories, in hell, they enjoyed it… enjoyed the mad destruction of their organic bodies… the decomposition of their personal identity… enjoyed the dissolution of their families and villages, and enjoyed the new monstrous anonymity of the suburbs and the pubs in the morning and evening.” <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>

This perspective implies that the closing image indicates a "voluntary submission of the masses," who not only tolerate white-collar criminals stealing their money but find "a perverse enjoyment" in their "banal existence under the heel of the Jordan Belforts of the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>.

The singular final shot is presented as emblematic of the complexity of *The Wolf of Wall Street*, portraying it as a "true totem of our culture of excess" that "defies easy answers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>.

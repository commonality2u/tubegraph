The film *Zootopia* explores the theme of stereotypes and prejudice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

## Initial Presentation of Stereotypes
At the beginning of the film, it is suggested that civilization is the only thing preventing predators from reverting to savage behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Nick, a fox, initially defies negative stereotypes associated with foxes in public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>, though his "sly nature" is evident in private <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. When predators begin reverting to primitive ways, it prompts "biological determinists" to claim their predictions were correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

## Challenging Biological Determinism
A central question in the film is [[nature_versus_nurture_debate_in_zootopia | nature vs. nurture]], examining whether identity is biologically determined or can be elevated through nurture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. The film suggests that the "biology of the plants" that create the "night howler" poison is to blame for the predators' behavior, rather than their inherent biological nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. This revelation leads the animals to understand that biology is not the cause of the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

## Inversion of Stereotypes
The film illustrates the fallacy of relying on prejudice by inverting previously established stereotypes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>:
*   Judy's fox bully from childhood becomes a pacifist pastry chef <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
*   Flash, the slow sloth, is revealed to be a speed demon drag racer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
*   The "dumb bunny" solves the case, and the "sly fox" gets an honest job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.
*   The meek lamb assistant mayor is the ruthless mastermind behind the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

## Societal Parallels and Critiques
[[social_and_political_allegories_in_zootopia | Zootopia]] mirrors the social and political landscape of 20th-century America, particularly in efforts to balance societal inequalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. The Mammal Inclusion Initiative in the film parallels Earthling diversity and affirmative action programs designed to level the playing field for underserved minorities and women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. The use of language associated with the PC movement, such as "token bunny," further accentuates these parallels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

The film suggests that the citizens of Zootopia can resolve all their social ills by simply trying hard and being optimistic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. Despite its themes of inclusion, the film is critiqued for seemingly ignoring other animal groups like reptiles, amphibians, fish, birds, and insects, implying they are "dead" or excluded from the "animal kingdom" portrayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

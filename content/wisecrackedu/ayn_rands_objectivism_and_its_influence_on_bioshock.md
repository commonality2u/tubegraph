The *Bioshock* trilogy is recognized for its effectiveness at [[integration_of_philosophical_concepts_in_bioshock_games | integrating philosophical concepts]] into its plot, displaying a level of intellectual sophistication rarely seen in games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. The original *Bioshock* notably draws heavily from the philosophical ideas of Russian-born thinker Ayn Rand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Ayn Rand and Atlas Shrugged

Ayn Rand's most famous book, *Atlas Shrugged*, poses the cryptic question, "Who is John Galt?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. In the book, John Galt, an engineer and genius, orchestrates a "strike of the mind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Industrialists are encouraged to abandon their roles in an increasingly controlled, regulated, and rule-driven world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. Frustrated with the inefficiency of Socialism and its disregard for the individual and their hard work, Galt retreats to Galt's Gulch to halt the world's industrial motor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

## Andrew Ryan and the Founding of Rapture

The underwater city of Rapture in the original *Bioshock* serves as a digital homage to Galt's Gulch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Rapture was founded by Andrew Ryan, a character whose name is an anagram for "Ayn Rand" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. All the world's best minds were gathered undersea in Rapture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. Posters throughout Rapture asking "Who is Atlas?" transform Rand's original question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

Ryan's political philosophy in the game is directly taken from Rand's concept of "Objectivism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. Rapture was established on the belief that "communist parasites" in the world above were freeloaders who stole, violated, and unjustly took from "captains of industry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. Ryan, like Galt, was tired of working without receiving what he deserved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

## The Principles of Objectivism

Objectivism is presented as a guide to living a worthy life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. Its main tenets are:
*   **Reality**: Rand believed reality is concrete and objective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.
*   **Reason**: Actions should be determined solely based on intellect, rejecting mystical, divine, or supernatural guiding forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. Ayn Rand was an atheist, as was Andrew Ryan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
    > Ryan: "I believe in no God – no invisible man in the sky. But there is something more powerful than each of us: a combination of our efforts, a Great Chain of industry that unites us." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>
*   **Self-interest**: Objectivism advocates for an ethics of egoism or radical self-interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. It holds that people ought to work hard to achieve happiness in their own lives and not treat others as mere means to an end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. Andrew Ryan's monologues reflect this:
    > Ryan: "My strength is not in steel and fire, but in my intellect and will. You hear me, Atlas? Andrew Ryan offers you nothing but ashes! In the end, all that matters to me is me. And all that matters to you is you. It is the nature of things." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>
*   **Capitalism**: Rand was a proponent of Laissez-faire capitalism, the idea that a good government exists only to protect individual rights and stays out of people's personal lives and the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. Ryan's condemnation of coercive governments aligns with this, as he believed such policies violate people's autonomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
    > Ryan: “No,” says the man in Washington, “It belongs to the poor.” “No,” says the man in the Vatican, “It belongs to God.” “No,” says the man in Moscow, “It belongs to everyone.” I rejected those answers. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>

## Objectivism in Rapture's Society

The city of Rapture embodies Objectivist ideals, particularly regarding [[the_role_of_free_market_and_deregulation_in_bioshocks_narrative | the free market]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. The plasmid market in Rapture is severely under-regulated, driven by the belief that an unfettered market provides the best options for consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. Ryan acknowledges the dangers but upholds the ideology:
> Ryan: "There has been tremendous pressure to regulate this plasmid business. There have been side effects: blindness, insanity, death. But what use is our ideology if it is not tested? The market does not respond like an infant, shrieking at the first sign of displeasure. The market is patient, and we must be too." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>

## The Downfall and Critique of Objectivism in Rapture

The ruinous state of Rapture suggests that a society run solely by Objectivist tenets is doomed to fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. The critical turning point was the deregulation of ADAM, a potent resource <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. This led to a civil war between Ryan and Fontaine (Atlas) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. The complete deregulation of ADAM resulted in a population of addicts riddled with side effects, causing rampant chaos and instability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

The game also highlights how the use of Little Sisters as "mules for magical sea slugs" to create ADAM treats them as mere tools for one's own goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. This practice, treating others as means to an end, is something Ayn Rand would certainly disapprove of, despite her emphasis on self-interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. The game poses the question of whether Rapture's ruin implies a failure of Objectivist principles, or if Ryan himself perverted Rand's beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

The *Bioshock* trilogy is celebrated for its pioneering gameplay, blending elements of survival horror, RPGs, and FPS games, and for its rare level of intellectual sophistication in gaming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. While many games are philosophical, few are as effective at [[integration_of_philosophical_concepts_in_bioshock | integrating philosophical concepts]] into their plot as *Bioshock* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This special episode delves into the philosophy of *Bioshock*, focusing primarily on the first installment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Ayn Rand and *Atlas Shrugged*

The cryptic question "Who is John Galt?" is posed in *Atlas Shrugged*, the most famous book by Russian-born thinker Ayn Rand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. In the novel, John Galt, an engineer and genius, encourages a "strike of the mind," urging industrialists to abandon their roles in an increasingly controlled and regulated world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Frustrated with the inefficiency of Socialism and its disregard for the individual, Galt retreats to Galt's Gulch to halt the world's industrial engine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

## Rapture: A Digital Homage

The original *Bioshock* takes place in [[comparison_between_rapture_and_columbia_as_philosophical_constructs | Rapture]], an underwater city that serves as a digital homage to Galt's Gulch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. [[comparison_between_rapture_and_columbia_as_philosophical_constructs | Rapture]] was founded by Andrew Ryan, who brought together the world's finest minds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. The name "Andrew Ryan" is an effective anagram for "Ayn Rand" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. Posters asking "Who is Atlas?" adorn [[comparison_between_rapture_and_columbia_as_philosophical_constructs | Rapture]]'s walls, echoing Rand's original question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## Objectivism: A Guide to Life

Andrew Ryan's political philosophy is directly derived from Rand's concept of "Objectivism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. Objectivism is presented as a guide to living a worthy life, with its main tenets being: reality, reason, self-interest, and capitalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

Rand believed that reality is concrete and objective, negating the need for mystical, divine, or supernatural forces to guide humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. Actions, in her view, should be determined solely by intellect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. In essence, Ayn Rand was an atheist, and so too was Andrew Ryan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>:

> [00:02:01] **Ryan:** "I believe in no God â€“ no invisible man in the sky. But there is something more powerful than each of us: a combination of our efforts, a Great Chain of industry that unites us."

Ryan serves as a mouthpiece for Rand's condemnation of coercive governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. Objectivism advocates for an ethics of egoism or radical self-interest, holding that people should work hard to achieve happiness in their own lives and not treat others as mere means to an end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. Ryan's monologues often mirror Rand's work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>:

> [00:02:27] **Ryan:** "Though my physical defenses fall, you'll not defeat me. My strength is not in steel and fire, but in my intellect and will. You hear me, Atlas? Andrew Ryan offers you nothing but ashes! In the end, all that matters to me is me. And all that matters to you is you. It is the nature of things."

[[comparison_between_rapture_and_columbia_as_philosophical_constructs | Rapture]] was founded on the belief that "communist parasites" in the world above were freeloaders who unjustly took from the "captains of industry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. Ryan, much like Galt, was weary of working without receiving what he believed he deserved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>:

> [00:02:43] **Ryan:** "No," says the man in Washington, "It belongs to the poor." "No," says the man in the Vatican, "It belongs to God." "No," says the man in Moscow, "It belongs to everyone." I rejected those answers.

Rand was also a proponent of Laissez-faire capitalism, the idea that a good government exists solely to protect individual rights, staying out of personal lives and the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. In [[comparison_between_rapture_and_columbia_as_philosophical_constructs | Rapture]], this translates to a severely under-regulated plasmid market, based on the belief that an unfettered market provides the best options for consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>:

> [00:03:25] **Ryan (tape):** "There has been tremendous pressure to regulate this plasmid business. There have been side effects: blindness, insanity, death. But what use is our ideology if it is not tested? The market does not respond like an infant, shrieking at the first sign of displeasure. The market is patient, and we must be too."

## The Ruin of Rapture: A Critique of Objectivism?

The ruined state of [[comparison_between_rapture_and_columbia_as_philosophical_constructs | Rapture]] prompts the question: Does this suggest that a society built on Objectivist tenets is doomed to fail, or did Ryan distort Rand's beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>?

The introduction of ADAM, a potent resource, led to a civil war between Ryan and Fontaine (Atlas) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. Ryan's free-market ideals led to the complete deregulation of ADAM, resulting in a population riddled with addiction and side effects, causing rampant chaos and instability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. The practice of using "little sisters" as "mules" for magical sea slugs to produce ADAM certainly treats them as mere tools for one's own goals, a practice Ayn Rand would disapprove of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

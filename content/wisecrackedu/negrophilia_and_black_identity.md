*Get Out*, a social thriller by writer/director [[Jordan Peeles commentary on postracial America | Jordan Peele]], uniquely targets [[white_liberal_racism_in_get_out | white liberals]] rather than typical figures when exploring race in America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. The film argues that so-called "post-racial" liberalism is more terrifying than often imagined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. It examines how this disavowal of racism seemingly reinforces a suspicious relationship with black people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

The narrative follows Chris Washington as he meets his white girlfriend's parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. The initial interactions show white liberals' awkward attempts at social interaction with a black man <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. These attempts to demonstrate their "not racist" stance often serve to further alienate Chris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>, making him extremely uncomfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. The Armitage family, for instance, appears unnaturally eager to discuss "black people stuff," such as voting for Obama for a third term, seemingly to prove their lack of racism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. This over-performance of "acceptance" only highlights the difference, making Chris feel more "different" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

## Negrophilia

The film introduces the concept of **negrophilia**, a term that emerged in 1920s Paris to describe a "craze for black culture" among hipsters, where blackness symbolized "modernity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. Writer Petrine Archer-Straw notes that this phenomenon had a problematic side: black personalities were either "lionised or demonised" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. They could not be viewed as normal people, instead existing as one of two stereotypes: "brilliant artists" or "uncultured animals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

In *Get Out*, Chris experiences both sides of this dynamic. He is celebrated for his cultural background, yet also reminded by the creepy brother that if he "really pushed [his] body," he'd be a "f***ing beast" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. The film suggests that the "white perspective" dictates how black people are defined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

Negrophilia in the film extends beyond a desire for black culture; it encompasses a desire for the black body itself, both sexually ("is it better?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a> and athletically ("what's your sport?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. The film clarifies that this desire is problematic because negrophilia is "not about truly understanding black people and their culture" but "about using them to satisfy your own desires" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. It's about "collecting them" rather than understanding them as humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

### Colonization of the Black Body

*Get Out* takes negrophilia to an extreme by portraying the literal colonization of the black body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. The Armitage family's horrifying secret involves implanting white brains into black bodies to appropriate their physical attributes. For instance, Grandpa Armitage, who was once bested by Jesse Owens, has his brain implanted into an athletic black body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. Grandma Armitage's brain is placed in Georgina, allowing her to "spend her golden years playing dress up as a beautiful black woman" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. Chris is also set to become a host, with a blind man desiring his "award winning photographer's eyes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. This extreme form of [[white_liberal_racism_in_get_out | liberal racism]] is highlighted when Chris's prospective new owner refuses to attribute his desire to race, claiming, "I don't give a s*** what color you are. What I want is deeper. I want those things you see through" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

## Psychological Experience of Black Americans

The film offers insight into the psychological experience of black Americans navigating white America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. The visual of a black man lost in white suburbs serves as a metaphor for Chris's emotional journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. Chris's interactions are often modulated for his white audience, as seen when Rose tries to make a scene with a police officer, while Chris's primary concern is not to provoke the cop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. He frequently suppresses his true feelings to avoid causing a scene, even when suspecting tampering with his phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

### The Sunken Place and [[Double consciousness and structural racism | Double Consciousness]]

A key concept explored is the "Sunken Place," a hypnotic state where one's mind is separated from their body, passively viewing experiences through a screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. Jordan Peele clarified that "The Sunken Place means we're marginalized. No matter how hard we scream, the system silences us" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. This implies that societies built on inequality leave those on the outside voiceless, or with only a "tempered version of their voice," forcing their true identity to remain in the background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.

This state can be understood through sociologist W.E.B. Du Bois's concept of [[Double consciousness and structural racism | double consciousness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. [[Double consciousness and structural racism | Double consciousness]] is the internal conflict experienced by African Americans living in a [[Double consciousness and structural racism | structurally racist society]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. Such societal conditions lead black people to view themselves through the dominant societal perspective, in this case, that of white people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. Chris is constantly evaluated by "the measuring tape of white society" and specific forms of white desire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. This constant scrutiny results in a "two-ness" within the black soul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. This imposition leads to confusion about the authenticity of one's experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>, and for Chris, it leaves him feeling like a helpless spectator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. The "sunken place" is not merely a hypnosis technique but a metaphor for Chris's life as a powerless observer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>.

## Asserting Black Identity and Resistance

The fear of losing oneself is literalized in the "Coagula procedure," where black consciousness is suppressed to make way for the white mind, risking permanent placement in the sunken place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. Chris escapes this fate by plugging his ears with cotton picked from his chair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. This act [[subversion_of_racial_ideology_and_stereotypes | subverts the logic of oppression]], as Chris uses a material associated with slavery to assert his identity and avoid a modern form of enslavement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. He also repurposes a bocce ball, arguably a symbol of the white elite, to fight back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>. By using a mounted deer to attack Dean, Chris signals his triumph over the powerlessness he once feared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. Chris's escape from this "near-enslavement" is presented as a radical assertion of his black identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.

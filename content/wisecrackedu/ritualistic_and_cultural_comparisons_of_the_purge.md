Initially, *The Purge* may appear as a typical horror film featuring a concept where "Any and all crime will be legal for 12 continuous hours," questionable acting, and violent carnage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. However, a deeper examination reveals it as a commentary on sociopolitical existence, serving as an allegory for corrupt politics, rigged economic systems, and a culture of violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Similarities to Traditional Festivals

*The Purge* shares similarities with other ritualistic festivals such as Mardi Gras, Carnival, and Halloween <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. While *The Purge* involves more murder and theft compared to the dancing and feasting associated with Lent, these events fundamentally share the concept of designated times when people are permitted to violate social norms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. As one character quips, "The Purge is Halloween for adults!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

## Reaffirmation of Social Structures

Contrary to seeming like a way to undermine the power of law and religion, these events actually serve to reaffirm existing social structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. In the context of *The Purge*, the "NFFA" (New Founding Fathers of America), who sanction the ritual, are not challenged by it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. Instead, the night's chaos instills a longing for the return of law and order the following day, akin to a "Purge hangover" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

If a ritual like Carnival exists to make people accept the tenets of Christianity, *The Purge* functions to make the populace accept the tenets of the ruling social ideology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. This societal order is best characterized as [[Neoliberalism and Economic Critique in The Purge | Neoliberalism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. The film suggests that this system involves "pitting poor people against each other for thousands of years!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. The genius of *The Purge* lies in its ability to viscerally expose how this kind of economy generates profit in a predatory manner through "murder night" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

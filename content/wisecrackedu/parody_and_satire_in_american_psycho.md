This article discusses [[Parody and satirical elements in One Punch Man | parody]] and satirical elements in the film *American Psycho*.


*American Psycho* has consistently been a focal point of [[Controversies surrounding American Psycho | controversy]], much like the book by Bret Easton Ellis that preceded it [00:00:21]. Its initial publication was halted due to public outcry over its violent depictions, and the film, released nine years later, has faced similar [[Interpretations of violence and misogyny in American Psycho | controversies]] [00:00:24].

The central debate surrounding the film is whether it functions as a critique of 1980s consumerism and superficial yuppie culture, or if its excesses inadvertently glorify this lifestyle [00:00:49]. Additionally, the film's depiction of violence, particularly towards women, has led to divergent views: some hail it as a feminist masterpiece, while others denounce it as misogynistic [00:01:01]. This discussion focuses primarily on the film's controversial aspects [00:00:38].

## Plot Recap
Set in 1988, *American Psycho* centers on Patrick Bateman, a wealthy Wall Street yuppie who epitomizes the era's excess [00:01:27]. Bateman is obsessed with superficialities like trendy restaurants and appears to have a perfect life with a fiancée and friends [00:01:34]. However, beneath this façade, he despises those around him and secretly murders homeless men and prostitutes [00:01:47].

After brutally murdering a business rival, Paul Allen, a detective begins to suspect Bateman [00:01:55]. As the story progresses, the line between reality and fantasy blurs, and Patrick descends into a gory killing spree [00:02:01]. Despite his numerous murders, society seems oblivious; bodies disappear, and when he confesses, he is told that his victims are alive and well [00:02:07]. This narrative ambiguity raises the question of whether his crimes were real or merely figments of his imagination [00:02:24].

## Satire of 1980s Consumerism and Superficiality
The film explicitly [[the_distinctions_between_satire_social_commentary_and_parody_in_grand_theft_auto_v | satirizes]] the shallow consumer lifestyle prevalent in the 1980s [00:02:31]. It emphasizes the era's excesses through extravagant dinners, Patrick's indulgent morning routine, and his relentless pursuit of status symbols like reservations at exclusive restaurants [00:02:35].

Patrick Bateman's obsession with his status among the wealthy Wall Streeters is a key element of the film's [[social_satire_in_south_park | social satire]] [00:02:55]. His frequent references to the Trump name highlight the era's association of [[Representation and parody of American culture and lifestyle in Grand Theft Auto V | Trump]] with excess and the "ultimate yuppie" [00:03:11]. Bateman's meticulous focus on minutiae, from bedsheets to business cards, underscores his elite status [00:04:08]. Christian Bale's performance as Bateman is lauded for perfectly capturing the [[difference_between_satire_and_parody | satirical]] tone, rendering the absurd aspects of Bateman's life sadly believable for a status-conscious yuppie [00:04:57].

In Bateman's world, everything is commodified and used to signify superiority [00:05:07]. The film portrays characters as vapid and self-absorbed, prioritizing appearances over actual conflicts [00:05:20]. Dinner conversations often feature characters superficially discussing global issues like massacres in Sri Lanka or apartheid, which Bateman uses for "one-upsmanship" rather than genuine concern [00:05:28]. His indifference is highlighted when he dismisses the Iran-Contra scandal with a simple "whatever" [00:06:30], and his true nature is revealed when he brutally stabs a homeless person instead of offering help [00:06:19].

The recurring mistaken identity theme—where Patrick is mistaken for other business associates—illustrates the artifice of their lifestyle [00:06:35]. In this society obsessed with acquiring goods, people are interchangeable, valuing suits, jewels, yachts, and restaurants above individual identity [00:06:50]. The film presents class as a competition, echoing Thorstein Veblen's theory of "conspicuous consumption," where goods are consumed as evidence of financial strength and a means of gaining repute [00:07:06]. Bateman constantly defines himself in relation to others, despising those who achieve more status (like Paul Allen) and feeling superior to those with minor imperfections (like Marcus's haircut) [00:07:31]. He flaunts trivial knowledge, such as the meaning behind Genesis songs, to assert his superiority [00:07:46].

### Consumer Capitalism as Bloodsport
The film suggests that beneath Bateman's need for luxury lies a literal bloodlust, portraying consumer capitalism as a "bloodsport" [00:08:31]. Bateman begins the film by declaring himself an empty shell, an "abstraction" with "no real me" [00:08:44]. However, by the end, after succumbing to his murderous impulses, he feels "whole" and "in touch with humanity" [00:09:15]. This implies that by embracing his "baser desire to kill," he achieves a distorted form of self-actualization as a serial killer [00:09:24]. *American Psycho* therefore signifies that the "true nature of the consumer capitalist is well, a cold-blooded serial killer" [00:09:31].

## The Challenge of Parody
Despite its savage critique of consumerism, *American Psycho* paradoxically makes Patrick Bateman's lifestyle undeniably seductive to audiences [00:09:41]. This is evidenced by numerous articles and product lines attempting to replicate Bateman's grooming, dining, and living style [00:09:50].

[[Satire of superhero films | Parody]] often offers competing interpretations, simultaneously legitimizing and subverting its subject [00:10:14]. *American Psycho* revels in excess, showcasing Bateman's handsome appearance, success with women, luxurious apartment, and high-paying job [00:10:23]. Furthermore, the film often plays Bateman's monstrous acts for comedy or cuts away before their full impact, such as Paul Allen's murder set to Huey Lewis and the News, or the off-screen chainsaw death of Christine [00:10:35]. The film's reluctance to depict the full horror of Bateman's violence allows the audience to identify more with his glamorous lifestyle, potentially undermining its own [[difference_between_satire_and_parody | satirical]] depth [00:11:06].

### Feminist Critique or Glorification?
Many critics accuse the film's violence, particularly towards women and the lower class, of glorifying their grotesque deaths [00:11:15]. The focus of detective Kimball's investigation on Paul Allen's disappearance, rather than the numerous murdered women, highlights society's indifference [00:11:23].

However, the filmmakers argue the opposite. Screenwriter Guinevere Turner stated in a 2015 interview that *American Psycho* is a "feminist film," a satire on how men compete and how women become "even less important than your tan or your suit" in this hyper-real universe [00:11:31]. Director Mary Harron reiterated this, calling the film "a great [[Analysis of Watchmen as satire | parody]] of masculinity" and an "attack and satire of sexism and of male ego" [00:11:55].

The film demonstrates the cavalier attitudes men hold towards women in this society, epitomized by Bateman's dismissive "there are no girls with good personalities" [00:12:10]. Patrick dictates women's attire at work and pays them to follow his instructions in bed, believing he can do as he pleases with their bodies, including killing, mutilating, and even eating them [00:12:17]. The chilling truth presented by the film is that Patrick is correct: he does get away with his crimes [00:12:34].

## The Film's Cynical Confession
While *American Psycho* effectively [[social_satire_in_south_park | satirizes]] male ego and consumer society, its impact often seems to inadvertently uphold the very lifestyle it critiques [00:12:42]. Patrick Bateman, despite his monstrous acts, is frequently lauded as an anti-establishment antihero [00:12:57].

In a metatextual turn, this outcome may be precisely the film's point [00:13:02]. Just as Patrick Bateman repeatedly confesses his crimes, only to be dismissed or misinterpreted by others as joking or discussing mergers and acquisitions [00:13:06], *American Psycho* itself has been misinterpreted as misogynistic or pro-consumer, or treated as a mere joke [00:13:35]. Yet, the issues it [[the_distinctions_between_satire_social_commentary_and_parody_in_grand_theft_auto_v | rails against]]—status obsession, sexism, and wealth inequality—remain as relevant today as they were in the 1990s and early 2000s [00:13:43].

As Patrick Bateman states at the end of the film, "this confession has meant nothing" [00:13:54]. Similarly, *American Psycho* cynically and truthfully ridicules a society gone awry, understanding that its own "confession" will also ultimately mean nothing [00:13:59].

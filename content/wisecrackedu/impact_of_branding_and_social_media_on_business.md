The animated series *South Park*, created by Matt Stone and Trey Parker, frequently lampoons the financial world, offering a critical perspective on various economic concepts, including the [[corporate_influence_and_spectacle_in_modern_society | role of corporations]], the nature of value, the [[the_role_of_advertising_in_modern_society | influence of advertising]], and the impact of social media on business practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>.

## Branding and Perceived Value

*South Park* often challenges conventional biases, particularly regarding the perception of small businesses versus large corporations. In the "Gnomes" episode, the town of South Park initially sides with Tweek Brothers, a local mom-and-pop coffee shop, against the massive corporate chain Harbucks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>. However, the episode reveals that the "little guy," Mr. Tweek, is a "total asshole" who exploits his son and children for media sympathy to keep his business afloat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>. This challenges the notion that small businesses are inherently driven by purer motives, demonstrating that even they can be cutthroat capitalists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>. The townspeople's programmatic response of "small business good. Big corporation bad" highlights a hardwired bias, illustrating how appeals to emotion can disguise profit mechanisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>. Both small and large businesses are ultimately geared towards making a profit, even if the path to that objective is ambiguous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>.

The concept of value is further explored in "Cash for Gold," which satirizes the exploitation of the elderly for massive profit through television scams, exemplified by the Home Shopping Network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>. The episode examines the predator and prey through the lens of value theory, differentiating between financial, social, emotional, and historical value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>. The rapid depreciation of a bolo tie's financial worth exposes the disconnect between high perceived value (as marketed by the Home Shopping Network host) and low actual value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>. *South Park* suggests that value is determined by supply and demand, rather than quality or production effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:34:00">[06:34:00]</a>. For characters like the Home Shopping Network host, value is purely monetary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:00">[07:05:00]</a>. However, emotional value is also highlighted through Grandpa's story, revealing that his purchases are driven by a desire to create sentimental connections and memories, not market value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>. The episode ultimately questions the true value of nearly everything, as cultural symbols like an Academy Award can be melted down for resale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>.

## The Rise of Brand Over Function

The "Go Fund Yourself" episode delves into how the success of a brand can be rooted purely in its appearance rather than its function, especially with the advent of social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:15:00">[09:15:00]</a>. The *South Park* kids launch a "successful brand that doesnâ€™t even bother to put a business behind it," drawing donations without any effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40:00">[08:40:00]</a>. The show argues that the power of a brand is more valuable than what the business actually *does* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:25:00">[09:25:00]</a>.

This concept mirrors the argument by philosopher Jean Baudrillard, who in *Simulacra and Simulation* (1981), proposed that value is determined purely by the appearance of value, existing only as an image in relation to other images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>. Therefore, having a great brand becomes more important than making great products, and being trendy for investors can outweigh generating profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31:00">[10:31:00]</a>. This idea predicted phenomena like Uber being valued at billions while still losing money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:41:00">[10:41:00]</a>.

However, the episode also shows the vulnerability of businesses built solely on aesthetics. The kids' venture ultimately collapses due to missteps on a social issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:26:00">[11:26:00]</a>. This suggests that a business without foundational beliefs or a tangible product has "nowhere to turn" once public opinion shifts against it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:36:00">[11:36:00]</a>. Even a business that does almost nothing can be threatened by "doing or saying or being the wrong thing at the wrong time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:45:00">[11:45:00]</a>.

## Social Media and Perceived Social Value

The episode "You Have Zero Friends" examines the absurdities of the growing social media economy and its [[social_relationships_and_digital_identity | impact on social relationships and identity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:09:00">[12:09:00]</a>. It questions whether friendships and social worth are measured by "likes" and Facebook connections, or by interactions in "meatspace" (the real world) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:28:00">[12:28:00]</a>. The show depicts Facebook friendships as a measurable hierarchy of personal value, akin to money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:55:00">[12:55:00]</a>. Cartman, for instance, views relationships transactionally, as status symbols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:11:00">[13:11:00]</a>. This aligns with Baudrillard's warning in *The Consumer Society* that a transactional approach to relationships "leads to an individual lack, since everything possessed is relativized in relation to others" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:23:00">[13:23:00]</a>.

The episode demonstrates how digital status can overshadow real-world support. Kyle prioritizes his social media cache over his actual friendship with Stan, even dropping a friend to salvage his online standing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:47:00">[13:47:00]</a>. The show asks, "who are we, really, when our online presence outweighs our real-world engagements?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:12:00">[14:12:00]</a>. The disjunction between digital and real-world lives threatens to place a greater premium on digital behavior, making physical life seem less significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:40:00">[14:40:00]</a>. While cultivating an online brand offers a wider reach, the show implies it may come at the expense of authentic "meatspace" experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:18:00">[15:18:00]</a>.

The *Rick and Morty* episode "Rest and Ricklaxation" (Season 3, Episode 6) explores complex [[character_development_in_rick_and_morty | character development]] and interesting ideas about mental health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. The episode delves into the "toxic side" of the titular duo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## The Mental Detoxifier

After nearly dying repeatedly, Rick and Morty realize they are burned out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. They vacation at an alien spa and use a mental detoxifier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. This device purges the parts of themselves they dislike most <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

The "healthy" versions of themselves emerge:
*   Morty lives without crippling self-doubt, becoming popular and even securing a date with Jessica <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.
*   Rick appears to be a "normal human being" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

However, this new reality is disrupted when their toxic counterparts escape, turning the world "weird" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## Anti-Character Development and Mental Health

The episode employs "anti-character development," a clever aspect where instead of protagonists overcoming their "shadow" selves (dark reflections of themselves), Rick and Morty journey to reunite with their worst selves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. This structure, a play on Joseph Campbell's "The Hero's Journey," uses toxic Morty and toxic Rick as literal "shadow" versions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

This "anti [[character_development_in_rick_and_morty | character development]]" serves as a commentary on mental health in society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>, asking: "What does it mean to be mentally healthy?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

### Critique of Self-Help Culture

"Rest and Ricklaxation" functions as an extended [[critique_of_selfhelp_culture_in_rick_and_morty | parody of certain "healthy" attitudes]] promoted by self-help gurus and popular media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. Specifically, it targets the idea that all unpleasant or painful thoughts must be eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

The show satirizes the notion that mental health means "uncritically loving yourself, saying yes to everything, counting your blessings, and believing in yourself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. Fully embodying these ideals, *Rick and Morty* suggests, can make one seem like a "coked-out weirdo" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

### Compulsory Happiness

The episode also touches on sociologist William Davies' concept of "compulsory happiness," explored in his book "The Happiness Industry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. Davies argues that corporations, managers, and advertisers collaborate to promote a definition of mental health that supports the capitalist system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. This form of happiness requires cheerful acceptance of the status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a> and constant self-improvement to become a "better consumer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

Healthy-Morty, for instance, spouts platitudes reminiscent of self-help gurus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a> and insists others adopt his new lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. When confronted with real-life problems, like a sentient part of himself trapped in "hell," his response is: "Trust me things are good. Taking that away from me… that wouldn’t be healthy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

### The Importance of "Unhealthy" Traits

The show argues that many traits the self-help industry encourages people to erase, such as self-doubt and sadness, are in fact important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. For Morty, self-doubt prevents him from becoming a "full-on sociopath" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. Healthy-Morty transforms into an unscrupulous stockbroker, likened to a "sociopathic Wall Street fat cat with too much self-esteem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

Rick eventually realizes that some undesirable parts of oneself, despite causing pain, are "essential to actually being healthy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. Jessica's remark to Morty, "Good to have you back," implies that Morty's authentic, self-hating self is his "better self" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

### A Question of Definition

The episode presents a paradox: the detoxifier purges traits based on the individual's "subjective definition of toxicity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. However, Healthy-Rick states pride in being Morty's grandpa but later deems his attachment to Morty "irrational, therefore, toxic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. This raises the question of whether his love for Morty is toxic or healthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

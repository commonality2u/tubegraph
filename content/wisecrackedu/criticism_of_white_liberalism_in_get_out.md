Jordan Peele's social thriller *Get Out* stands out among films exploring race in America by uniquely targeting white liberals rather than traditional figures of racism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. The film argues that "post-racial" liberalism is far more menacing than commonly imagined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

## The "Post-Racial" Facade

The protagonist, Chris Washington, is repeatedly confronted by white characters who claim to have "moved beyond" [[racism_and_justice_themes | racism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. This disavowal of racism, according to the film, paradoxically reinforces a problematic relationship with black people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. The Armitage family, Chris's white girlfriend's parents, overtly tries to demonstrate their "not racist" stance by eagerly bringing up "black people stuff" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. For instance, Chris's girlfriend's father boasts about wishing he could have voted for Barack Obama for a third term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. This over-performance of "acceptance" of black culture only highlights the difference and makes Chris deeply uncomfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Even simple interactions serve to remind Chris that he is black, making him feel more "different" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

### Negrophilia: Fascination as a Problem

The film delves into "negrophilia," a term from 1920s Paris describing the craze for black culture among the era's "hipsters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. For these Parisians, blackness symbolized "modernity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. However, this fascination had a problematic aspect: black personalities were either idolized or demonized, denying their normality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. They were reduced to stereotypes, either brilliant artists or uncultured animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

In *Get Out*, Chris is celebrated for his cultural background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>, but also dehumanized when described as a "f***ing beast" if he "really pushed [his] body" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. Ultimately, the white perspective dictates how black people are defined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. This negrophilia extends beyond culture to a desire for the black body itself, both sexually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a> and athletically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. This desire is not about true understanding, but about satisfying one's own desires, effectively "collecting" people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.

## The Literal Colonization of the Black Body

The film takes this critique a terrifying step further with the "Coagula" procedure, which represents the literal colonization of the black body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. This is exemplified by:
*   **Grandpa Armitage**: His brain was implanted into an athletic black body because he couldn't "get over" being bested by a black athlete (Jesse Owens) in the 1936 Berlin Olympics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.
*   **Grandma Armitage**: Her brain was placed into Georgina's body, allowing her to "spend her golden years playing dress up as a beautiful black woman" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.
*   **Chris's Fate**: He is auctioned off to a blind man who desires his award-winning photographer's eyes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

The blind man's refusal to attribute his purchase to [[racism_and_justice_themes | racism]] – stating, "I don't give a s*** what color you are. What I want is deeper. I want those things you see through" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a> – encapsulates the extreme, yet self-deceiving, nature of this liberal racism.

## Psychological Burden and the "Sunken Place"

*Get Out* offers profound insight into the psychological experience of black Americans navigating white America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. The film opens with a black man lost in white suburbs, a metaphor for the emotional maze Chris must navigate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. Chris's interactions are often modulated for his white audience, as seen when he tries to appease a police officer despite his girlfriend's protest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>, or when he drops concerns about his phone to avoid upsetting Rose's family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. He even worries if his girlfriend's parents "know I'm black" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.

Philosopher Frantz Fanon's experience as a black man in 20th-century France mirrors Chris's, describing the "burdensome weight" of "the white man's eyes" that made him feel uncomfortable and out of place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. Chris, like Fanon, is burdened by trying to fit into a world that fundamentally excludes him, caught between integrating into Rose's world and retaining his identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. This forces him to be "two people at the same time": himself and "Rose's black boyfriend who is nice to everyone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

This internal conflict is literalized in the "Sunken Place," a hypnotic state where one's mind is separated from their body, leaving them to passively view their experiences through a screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. Jordan Peele describes the Sunken Place as representing marginalization: "No matter how hard we scream, the system silences us" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. This means that societies built on inequality will inevitably leave those on the outside without a true voice, forcing one's identity to remain in the background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

The concept of the Sunken Place resonates with sociologist W.E.B. Du Bois's "double consciousness," the internal conflict experienced by African Americans in a structurally racist society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. This leads black people to see themselves through the dominant white perspective, creating a "two-ness" in the black soul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. For Chris, this makes him feel like a helpless spectator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>, a fear of powerlessness reflected in his haunting by the deer's death, which reminds him of his mother's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.

## Resistance and Systemic Critique

Chris avoids the Coagula procedure and permanent entrapment in the Sunken Place by plugging his ears with cotton picked from his chair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. This act re-purposes a symbol of slavery (picking cotton) to assert his identity and avoid a modern form of enslavement, contrary to Audre Lorde's idea that "the master's tools will never dismantle the master's house" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. He also uses a bocce ball, arguably a "symbol of the white elite," to take out Jeremy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>, and uses a mounted deer, previously a symbol of his spectatorship, to attack Dean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>, signifying his overcoming of powerlessness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. Chris's escape is a radical assertion of his black identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>.

While Chris escapes the Armitage horrors, the film's most terrifying moment arises when police sirens are heard as Chris kneels over a bleeding white woman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. This pause serves as a stark reminder that the true monster of *Get Out* is not a fictional boogeyman, but "the horrors of the system itself," which cannot be heroically defeated at the conclusion of a film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. This emphasizes the film's broader [[social_critique_using_popular_media | social critique]] of systemic issues, making *Get Out* a powerful commentary on the insidious nature of white liberalism and its impact.

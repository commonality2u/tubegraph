Jordan Peele's social thriller *Get Out* offers a unique perspective on race in America, diverging from common targets to instead focus on white liberals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. The film critiques the notion of a "post-racial" era, particularly in the wake of the Obama presidency, arguing that so-called post-racial liberalism can be far more terrifying than imagined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. *Get Out* depicts how the disavowal of racism by seemingly "not racist" white people can paradoxically reinforce a problematic relationship with black individuals, ranging from suspicious to outright horrific <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

## The Illusion of Post-Racial Liberalism

The film illustrates how attempts by white characters to demonstrate their lack of racism inadvertently alienate Chris, the protagonist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. The Armitage family, Chris's white girlfriend's parents, are depicted as unnaturally eager to discuss "black people stuff," believing this proves their non-racist stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. This includes statements about voting for Obama for a third term, which they claim would make him "best president in my lifetime" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. This over-performance of "acceptance" of all things black only serves to solidify the difference between them and Chris, making him deeply uncomfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

The film suggests that this performative anti-racism allows for actual racist sentiments to be excused, as long as one can demonstrate their familiarity with black culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. Party guests at the Armitage home express a fascination with Chris's blackness, compellingly informing him that "black is in fashion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

### [[negrophilia_and_black_identity | Negrophilia]] and Objectification

This white fascination with black culture and identity is explored through the concept of [[negrophilia_and_black_identity | negrophilia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. Emerging in 1920s Paris, [[negrophilia_and_black_identity | negrophilia]] described a craze for black culture among the era's "hipsters," where blackness symbolized "young Parisian modernity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. However, this phenomenon had a problematic aspect: "Black personalities were either lionised or demonised in a manner that denied normality," meaning black individuals were not seen as actual people but as stereotypes—either brilliant artists or uncultured animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

*Get Out* depicts both sides of this dynamic: Chris is celebrated for his cultural background, yet also reduced to physical attributes, as when the creepy brother suggests Chris could be a "f***ing beast" if he pushed his body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. The film argues that this [[negrophilia_and_black_identity | negrophilia]] is not about true understanding but about using black people to satisfy white desires, treating them as collectibles rather than individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

## The Colonization of the Black Body

The film escalates [[negrophilia_and_black_identity | negrophilia]] to the literal colonization of the black body in its third act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. It's revealed that the Armitage family transplants white brains into black bodies. Grandpa Armitage, unable to overcome being bested by Jesse Owens in 1936, had his brain implanted into an athletic black body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. Similarly, Grandma Armitage's brain was placed into Georgina to allow her to "spend her golden years playing dress up as a beautiful black woman" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. Chris is set for a similar fate, auctioned to a blind man who desires his "award winning photographer’s eyes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. This extreme form of liberal racism is highlighted when Chris's new owner denies his purchase is racially motivated, claiming his desire is "deeper" than color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

## Psychological Experience and The Sunken Place

*Get Out* also delves into the psychological experience of black Americans navigating white America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. Chris's anxiety about meeting Rose's parents, wondering if they know he's black, and his discomfort as one of the few people of color at the party, reflect a constant feeling of being out of place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

### [[double_consciousness_and_structural_racism | Double Consciousness]]

Philosopher Frantz Fanon's experience as a black man in 20th-century France, burdened by "the white man’s eyes," parallels Chris's struggle to fit into a world from which he is fundamentally excluded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. Chris is forced to be "two people at the same time: a black man with his own identity, and, Rose’s black boyfriend who is nice to everyone no matter how absurd their questions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

This dual existence is illuminated by sociologist W.E.B. Du Bois's concept of [[double_consciousness_and_structural_racism | double consciousness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. This "internal conflict experienced by African Americans living in a structurally racist society" causes black people to view themselves through the perspective of the dominant white society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. Chris is constantly evaluated by "the measuring tape of white society," leading to a "two-ness" in his soul and confusion about the authenticity of his experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

### The Sunken Place

The film literalizes this silencing of identity through the "Sunken Place," a hypnotic state where one's mind is separated from their body, passively viewing their own experiences through a screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. Jordan Peele himself described the Sunken Place as representing marginalization: "No matter how hard we scream, the system silences us" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. This metaphor suggests that societies built on inequality inherently silence those on the outside, forcing their true identity to remain in the background for the sake of conforming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. For Chris, the Sunken Place also serves as a metaphor for his lifelong feeling of being a "helpless spectator," a feeling perhaps rooted in the trauma of his mother's death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

The Coagula procedure, where black consciousness is "literally pushed to the background to make room for the white mind," represents a permanent casting into the Sunken Place, a literal loss of self <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

## Resistance and Reclaiming Identity

Chris ultimately avoids this fate by plugging his ears with cotton picked from his chair, a repurposed symbol of slavery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. This act of using a "master's tool" to dismantle the "master's house," as poet Audre Lorde suggested, symbolizes Chris's radical assertion of his black identity and escape from a form of slavery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. He further reclaims power by using a bocce ball, arguably a symbol of the white elite, and a mounted deer (calling back to his initial spectator role) to defeat his oppressors, signifying his triumph over powerlessness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.

## The True Monster: Systemic Racism

While Chris escapes the Armitage horrors, the film's most terrifying moment occurs when police sirens are heard as Chris, a black man, kneels over a bleeding white woman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. This moment, though averted in the final cut's triumphant ending, serves as a stark reminder that the true "monster" in *Get Out* is not a fictional villain but the inherent horrors of the systemic racism itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. This systemic issue, unlike a film's antagonist, cannot be heroically defeated at the conclusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.

The *Saw* franchise, popular since 2004, is known for its "torture-porny" traps and morally dubious characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Beyond its gruesome imagery, the series explores deeper philosophical themes, particularly through the motivations of its central villain, Jigsaw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## Jigsaw's Motivation: Repentance Through Suffering

Jigsaw's torturous games are presented as opportunities for his victims to repent for their sins and transform into better human beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. If they survive his tests, Jigsaw believes they will emerge with a newfound appreciation for life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. His philosophy has been likened to an extremist form of [[christian_imagery_in_the_matrix | Christian morality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

### The Origin of Jigsaw: John Kramer's Transformation

Before becoming the Jigsaw Killer, John Kramer was a civil engineer with a pregnant wife, Jill, who owned a drug rehab clinic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. After one of Jill's patients, Cecil Adams, injured her during a robbery, Jill suffered a miscarriage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. John then fell into a deep depression, which worsened after he was diagnosed with a brain tumor and terminal cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. After a failed suicide attempt by driving off a cliff, John miraculously survived, leading him to believe in a new calling: dispensing morality through torture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

## Suffering in Early Christian Philosophy

Kramer's new moral code appears inspired by Early Christian philosophy, specifically its views on suffering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. Early Christian theologians rationalized suffering in a world created by an all-good God by attributing it to human fault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. The Original Sin, committed when Adam ate from the Tree of Knowledge, separated humans from God, necessitating suffering and repentance for reunification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

Similarly, Jigsaw believes his victims deserve the suffering they endure in his traps, seeing them as enslaved by their past immorality, much like humanity is trapped by original sin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. The *Saw* series even features characters named Adam (Cecil Adams and Adam Stanheight), mirroring Adam from the biblical story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

## Soren Kierkegaard and Personal Growth

John Kramer's views also align with Christian theorist and father of Existentialism, Soren Kierkegaard, who saw suffering as essential for personal and spiritual growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. Both Kramer and Kierkegaard believed that suffering purifies the sufferer, fosters appreciation for life, and compels individuals to take responsibility for their actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

Kierkegaard proposed three phases for an individual to become their "true self":
1.  **The aesthetic:** Driven by sensual pleasures and lacking morality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.
2.  **The ethical:** Driven by morality and belief in individual responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
3.  **The religious:** Driven by faith in God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

Suffering, for Kierkegaard, is key to advancing through these stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. While Kierkegaard focused on spiritual and existential suffering, Jigsaw's torture devices can be seen as tests for his victims, often "aesthetes" driven by desires, forcing them into ethical dilemmas and painful decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

Suffering prompts reflection, leading to "the first doubt" – a questioning of one's circumstances and a desire for change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. This desire opens a person to "ethical self-understanding," where suffering forces the individual to confront themselves, repent for past sins, accept guilt, and strive for survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. As one progresses, a "false self" dies, making way for a "better, truer self" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. John Kramer echoed this idea, stating "A different person crawled out through the wreckage" after his car crash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

### Rebirth and Baptism

Jigsaw's philosophy incorporates the concept of rebirth. His most fervent follower, Amanda, undergoes what fans call "Amanda's baptism," where she pledges to live by his ethical code, symbolizing a spiritual cleansing akin to Christian baptism, where individuals are "reborn" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. Jigsaw frequently references this concept of rebirth when interacting with disciples and new victims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. He even initiates his first "kidnapping" during a Chinese New Year celebration, which is a literal celebration of rebirth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

### Personal Responsibility and Choice

Both Kierkegaard and Jigsaw emphasize personal responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. Kierkegaard believed that becoming "a real man" meant becoming a "responsible individual before God" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. Kramer similarly demands responsibility from his victims, highlighting the crucial role of making a choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. He maintains that his victims "choose" their actions and are responsible for the outcome of their decisions within his games, famously stating, "I've never murdered anyone in my life. The decisions are up to them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

## Critique of Jigsaw's Moral Code

Despite his God-like portrayal—dressing in a black hooded cape, acquiring disciples, and maintaining omniscience—Jigsaw is presented as a "seriously failed" God-like figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[0:10:59]</a>. His attempts to establish a moral order ultimately fail to bring about meaningful change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>:
*   **Victim Failure:** Most victims fail their tests, crumbling under pressure or pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. Those who survive are often traumatized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.
*   **Apprentice Misinterpretation:** Jigsaw's apprentices twist his philosophy, creating unwinnable death traps rather than winnable games, and using them for punishment and revenge instead of renewal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.
*   **Flawed Justice:** As a villain, Jigsaw's justice is not dispensed fairly, frequently sacrificing innocent lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>.
*   **His Own Death:** Even Jigsaw's own death is a result of one of his tests' ultimate failures, as his victim, Jeff, violently kills him instead of forgiving him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.

The characters within the *Saw* films often highlight the severe flaws in Jigsaw's moral code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. Ultimately, the series seems to critique this extreme version of traditional [[christian_imagery_in_the_matrix | Christian morality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>, demonstrating that spiritual rebirth is not found through such brutal methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>.

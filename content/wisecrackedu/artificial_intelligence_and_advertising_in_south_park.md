In the final three episodes of *South Park* Season 19, the show explores a world where advertisements become indistinguishable from reality and even other people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>. This narrative incorporates clever references to science fiction classics that delve into artificial intelligence.

## Sci-Fi Inspirations

*South Park* draws inspiration from prominent AI films to develop its commentary on advertising:
*   **Ex-Machina**: Jimmy's interrogation of Leslie, an advertisement, directly references the interview scenes found in the film *Ex-Machina* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>.
*   **Blade Runner**: When Jimmy questions whether Leslie "knows she's an ad," it is a direct nod to *Blade Runner*'s famous line: "Does she know she's a replicant?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>. Both *Ex-Machina* and *Blade Runner* explore the fine line between humanity and machine, posing the fundamental question of what it means to be human <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>. *South Park* adapts this concept by replacing replicants with advertisements that have become so advanced they are indistinguishable from humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>.

### The Voight-Kampff Test and [[political_correctness_and_its_critique_in_south_park | PC Culture]]

In the final episode, [[political_correctness_and_its_critique_in_south_park | PC Principal]] engages in a massacre of advertisements, mimicking Deckard's retirement of replicants in *Blade Runner* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>. He even swiftly administers the Voight-Kampff test before eliminating them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>.

The original Voight-Kampff test gauges empathy reactions by asking questions about animals to differentiate between humans and replicants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>. In *South Park*, this test is repurposed to determine if an individual is [[political_correctness_and_its_critique_in_south_park | PC]] (politically correct); if they don't care about being [[political_correctness_and_its_critique_in_south_park | PC]], they are deemed not human <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:00">[04:19:00]</a>.

### The Femme Fatale Trope

*South Park* also incorporates the Femme Fatale trope from *Ex-Machina* and *Blade Runner* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>. In the show, Kyle and Jimmy are captivated by the "sizzling Ad Leslie," paralleling Deckard's love for the replicant Rachael and Caleb's attraction to the robot Ava <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>.

## Cultural Capitalism and Advertising

The series achieves a subtle stroke of genius by placing [[political_correctness_and_its_critique_in_south_park | PC Principal]] within the advertisement with Leslie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>. This puts [[political_correctness_and_its_critique_in_south_park | PC Principal]] in the same existential crisis as Deckard, questioning his own humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>.

Beyond a simple interrogation of humanity, *South Park* integrates a [[south_park_and_capitalism | criticism of cultural capitalism]] into its narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>. [[political_correctness_and_its_critique_in_south_park | PC Principal]] is portrayed as a lifestyle brand that can be advertised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>. Advertising's success stems from its ability to sell a way of living, presenting an idealized picture that necessitates the purchase of associated products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:00">[05:09:00]</a>. Being [[political_correctness_and_its_critique_in_south_park | PC]] is depicted as just one component of this advertised lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:23:00">[05:23:00]</a>.

Many anime series delve into the concept of death, but few contemplate its visceral reality quite like [[philosophy_of_attack_on_titan | Attack on Titan]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. In the series, the Titans serve as a direct, physical representation of death itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Titans as Walking Reminders of Mortality
The Titans are depicted as "walking reminders of human mortality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>, embodying an "existential confrontation with the inevitability of demise" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This portrayal is described as "pretty horrifying" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Despite the show's focus on "eerily introspective confrontations with death" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a> and the Titans' lack of genitals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>, the construction of the society behind the walls is noted as the series' darkest element <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

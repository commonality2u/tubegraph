Disney has evolved from an industry giant to a "behemoth," acquiring intellectual properties like the Muppets, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars, and 21st Century Fox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. This vast reach is exemplified by Disney making seven of the top ten highest-grossing films in 2019, including *Endgame*, *Aladdin*, *Frozen 2*, and *Toy Story 4* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Many of the top 50 highest-grossing films of all time were either created or later acquired by Disney <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## The Origin of Disney's Approach

Walt Disney's early experience with his first success, *Oswald the Lucky Rabbit*, shaped the company's approach to intellectual property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. After his distributor poached his animators and revealed that Disney didn't own the rights to Oswald, Walt Disney vowed to own "everything that he made" thereafter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. This led to a business model predicated on a "simple formula": find an existing story, make it "as cute and wholesome as possible to maximize your potential audience," and profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

## The "Cuteness" Aesthetic and its Consequences

Disney's distinct aesthetic, characterized by "round faces, saucer eyes, big goofy grins" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>, was not accidental. Walt Disney was "ruthless" in his pursuit of making all things adorable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. Over 100 years, Disney has acquired, adapted, and ultimately twisted the original artistic intentions of stories "beyond recognition" to fit this "cutesy aesthetic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

### Case Study: Pinocchio

Disney's 1940 film *Pinocchio* exemplifies this adaptation method. The story follows a puppet who wishes to become a real boy, with his wish granted if he proves brave, truthful, and unselfish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. In Disney's version, Pinocchio eventually becomes a real boy and lives happily ever after <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

However, Carlo Collodi, the author of the original *Pinocchio*, never intended for his story to be "warm fuzzy feeling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. The original ending was gruesomely dark:
> "Without loss of time they tied his arms past a running noose round his throat and hung him to the branch of a tree called the big oak" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. Pinocchio "hung stiff and insensible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

Collodi's intention was a "tongue-in-cheek albeit bleak morality tale" where misbehaving children (represented by Pinocchio) "suffer" for their actions, being robbed, starved, and having their legs sawed off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. Disney, by contrast, "whitewashed Pinocchio" to fit its "cutesy aesthetic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. Gone were the "dark satiric overtones," replaced by syrupy lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. Pinocchio's character design also changed from angular to a "mickey mouse had a baby with a tree" look <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. Collodi's grandson even sued Disney's Italian distributor for infringing on the moral copyright <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

### Case Study: The Little Mermaid

The 1989 classic *The Little Mermaid*, based on Hans Christian Andersen's tale, also demonstrates Disney's altering formula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. Disney's retelling is a love story with a "happily ever after," where the prince realizes his affection for the mermaid, who is freed from the sea witch's curse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.

Andersen's original story, however, was not happy or uplifting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>. It portrayed love "primarily as suffering," with the mermaid enduring pain with every step after gaining legs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. The prince never returns her affection, instead marrying a local princess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. Andersen intended the mermaid to be saved by "sacrifice," not romantic love, as she sought a soul and was rewarded by becoming a "gentle spirit" only after a Christ-like sacrifice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. Andersen "despised Disney's ending" in which a kiss saves the day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.

### Other Altered Stories

Disney's pattern of altering original narratives extends to many other stories:
*   The [[critiques_of_disneys_storytelling_methods | real Pocahontas]] story was about colonists kidnapping a Native American woman and murdering her husband, not about "freedom to love" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>.
*   The original *Sleeping Beauty* involved a woman being "non-consensually impregnated in her sleep" and giving birth to twins while still asleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>.

## Broader Cultural and Developmental Consequences

Disney's "meat grinder," which polishes off "rough and unsavory edges" from stories, comes with consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.

### Distorted Lessons and Perceptions
*   In the case of *Pocahontas*, it provides a "shitty history lesson that some people might never question" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.
*   [[disneys_influence_on_childrens_perceptions_and_morals | Disney's storytelling]] is a "major disservice for developing young minds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. Fairy tales, despite their darkness, offer children a "symbolic template for understanding the world" and coping with anxieties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>. By stripping these tales of their "bite" and inserting "bland wholesome narrative," Disney's new narratives are "potentially quite destructive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>.
*   Psychologist Susan Darker Smith notes that [[disneys_influence_on_childrens_perceptions_and_morals | young girls identifying with characters]] like Cinderella or Belle, who believe "love conquers all," are "more likely to end up in abusive relationships as adults" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>. Disney "fails to give children any tools for navigating real life problems" by peddling a convenient narrative where problems are solved by true love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.

### The Business Rationale: "Evil Cute"
From a capitalist perspective, companies like Disney operate with the primary responsibility to "make more money regardless of the social consequences" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>. When Disney experimented with "grimmer, edgier films" in the 1970s and 80s (e.g., *The Black Cauldron*), they were "huge box office failures" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>. The "Disney Renaissance of the 90s" was a "major course correction back into the sentimental cuteness that has sustained the company ever since" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>.

Studies show that cuteness increases concentration and activates the brain's pleasure center, pumping out dopamine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>. This phenomenon, where cuteness is used for "potentially nefarious purposes," is called "evil cute" by cultural theorist Joshua Paul Dale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>. Disney's use of cuteness is ultimately a "means for Disney to pad its bottom line, regardless if it's telling stories that are ultimately good for children" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>.

## Impact on Modern Franchises

The "Disney-fication of storytelling" becomes more unsettling when applied to iconic cultural works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>. Since acquiring [[disneys_acquisition_and_changes_to_star_wars_canon | Star Wars]], fans have "increasingly despaired at the creative choices" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. The last trilogy began with "sentimental fan service," briefly flirted with darkness in *The Last Jedi*, but then "quickly course-corrected and opted for a sweet conclusion based on a magical kiss, romantic sacrifice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>.

As Disney continues to expand its "blanket philosophy of cuteness," there is concern for the future of franchises like X-Men, making it "hard to imagine Disney signing off on something as subversive as *Logan*" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:08">[00:18:08]</a>. The worry is that with Disney's increasing control over media, there won't be space for "grittier, darker stories for grown up fairy tales" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>.

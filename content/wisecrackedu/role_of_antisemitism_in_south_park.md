*South Park* often uses [[social_satire_in_south_park | social satire]] to critique various aspects of society, including prejudice. The show's portrayal of anti-Semitism, primarily through the character of Eric Cartman, has evolved, particularly in later seasons, moving towards a darker and more nuanced depiction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

## Cartman's Anti-Semitism

Eric Cartman's anti-Semitic remarks and "Jew jokes" have been a consistent element of his character since the early seasons of *South Park* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. His animosity is frequently directed at Kyle Broflovski, his "least-favorite Jew" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

In a particular episode, Cartman presumably lectures Heidi Turner "about the merits of anti-Semitism" offscreen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. He voices sentiments such as, "It's hard enough without your people always trying to get ahead" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

## Evolution to a Darker Portrayal

The show's treatment of anti-Semitism appears to have shifted, becoming "a little different" in later episodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. This change is particularly evident when Cartman convinces Heidi to make Kyle her "Jewish scapegoat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.

Heidi, under Cartman's influence, delivers a "pretty shocking" speech to Kyle that is not loaded with the usual "overt punchlines" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. Instead, the scene focuses on Kyle's devastated reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. Heidi's comments to Kyle include:
> "You can’t help it.. it’s how you were raised… what you were taught. My heritage is Irish so I'm prone to being moody and your heritage...well... You know. You can be a little sneaky sometimes and not even realize it." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>

This shift suggests that *South Park*'s mockery of anti-Semites has taken a darker turn, possibly acknowledging how Cartman's character now resonates differently "since the rise of the alt-right" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>, transitioning from "goofy, childish bigotry to genuinely ugly bigotry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

This article provides a crash course in contemporary nihilism, comparing its portrayal in the animated series *[[nihilism_and_cosmic_pessimism_in_rick_and_morty | Rick and Morty]]* and *[[existential_nihilism_through_bojack_horseman | BoJack Horseman]]* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. While many assume nihilism simply means believing in nothing, it encompasses various philosophical, psychological, and ethical positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. All forms of nihilism share the premise that there is no inherent meaning, value, or order in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

This article focuses on two distinct branches: [[existential_nihilism_through_bojack_horseman | existential nihilism]] and [[cosmic_nihilism_and_its_depiction_in_rick_and_morty | cosmic nihilism]] (also known as cosmic pessimism) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

## Existential Nihilism

[[existential_nihilism_through_bojack_horseman | Existential nihilism]] arises from the realization that human existence lacks inherent meaning, reducing life to a "precarious dance upon the grave" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. In this view, individuals are responsible for creating meaning in their lives through their freedom and decisions, and values must be self-created and sustained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. This worldview strongly influences the character of [[existential_nihilism_through_bojack_horseman | BoJack Horseman]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

> "I’m responsible for my own happiness? I can’t even be reponsible for my own breakfast.” <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>

### Historical Context

The term "nihilism" was first coined in the late 18th century by German philosopher Friedrich Jacobi, who feared that Enlightenment reason would undermine religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. Søren Kierkegaard, considered a father of modern existentialism, explored the implications of nihilism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. Kierkegaard believed despair was an essential part of the human experience, referring to it as the "sickness unto death" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. This dialectical despair means individuals are constantly at odds with themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>:

*   Despair because nothing seems possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
*   Despair because everything is possible, leading to indecision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.
*   Despair about being who we are, or not being who we think we are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

This despair fuels the melancholy seen in most characters of [[existential_nihilism_through_bojack_horseman | BoJack Horseman]], including Todd's worries about sexuality and Princess Carolyn's anxieties about motherhood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

[[existential_nihilism_through_bojack_horseman | BoJack Horseman]], despite having a successful career, home, and money, cannot enjoy any of it, feeling disappointed by successes and sabotaging his own happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. He is constantly marked by regret and haunted by unshakable despair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.

> "You're an Oscar nominee, how do you feel?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>
> "I feel...I-I feel...the same." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>

Kierkegaard asserted that anxiety is caused by the uncertainty underlying every decision and is a way to experience freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. This responsibility for decisions leads to anxiety, described as standing at the edge of an abyss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. For Kierkegaard, overcoming this despair involves accepting the "comic absurdity of reality" and living by faith, which he defined as the courage to attempt a meaningful existence in a meaningless world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

Jean-Paul Sartre, a French philosopher, further developed existentialist philosophy, arguing that individuals can create meaning in a meaningless universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. Though there's no inherent ethical value or comforting God, humans can craft meaning through their lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. While [[existential_nihilism_through_bojack_horseman | existential nihilism]] offers the possibility of meaning, it guarantees nothing, and constant effort is required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.

> "Closure is a made up thing by steven spielberg to sell movie tickets. Like true love and the munich olympics doesn’t exist in the real world. The only thing to do now is just to keep living forward.” <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>

## Cosmic Nihilism (or, Pessimism)

[[cosmic_nihilism_and_its_depiction_in_rick_and_morty | Cosmic nihilism]] is a more rational and colder philosophy, positing that the universe contains no inherent truth or meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. It views human-constructed meanings like freedom, love, hope, and joy as mere myths or fables that serve as coping mechanisms for the "empty void at the center of our reality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. For the cosmic nihilist, even self-created meaning is a delusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

> "nobody exists on purpose, nobody belongs anywhere...everybody's gonna die...come watch TV?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>

This philosophy largely aligns with Rick Sanchez from *[[nihilism_and_cosmic_pessimism_in_rick_and_morty | Rick and Morty]]*, who, despite admitting nothing matters, embraces hedonism and believes in taking the universe for a ride <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. [[nietzschean_philosophy_and_its_application_in_rick_and_morty | Rick Sanchez's]] science is portrayed as a means of passing time rather than improving lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. *[[nihilism_and_cosmic_pessimism_in_rick_and_morty | Rick and Morty]]* establishes Rick as this type of nihilist, reducing everything to science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

Friedrich Nietzsche, though not a cosmic nihilist himself, is seen as a spiritual forefather of this position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. His famous phrase "God is dead" is often misinterpreted; it doesn't mean everything sucks, but rather that cosmic nihilism is not a value judgment or counter-ethics to religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>. Unlike [[nietzschean_philosophy_and_its_application_in_rick_and_morty | Nietzschean nihilism]], cosmic nihilism takes a cold, rationalist view that existence has no inherent value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>. *[[nihilism_and_cosmic_pessimism_in_rick_and_morty | Rick and Morty]]* escalates this by presenting an infinite number of cold and uncaring universes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.

> "Ugh. Nobody gets it. Nothing you think matters matters. This isn't special. This is happening infinite times across infinite realities.” <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>

### Philosophical Underpinnings

Eliminative materialism, championed by Patricia and Paul Churchland, supports the cosmic nihilist view by arguing that common sense psychological attitudes (like love) should be replaced with scientific and empirical notions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. From this perspective, love is merely a chemical reaction in the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>. Rick's perspective aligns with this, dismissing human emotions as "bullshit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.

> “What people call love is just a chemical reaction that compels animals to breed." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>

Another philosopher who aligns with Rick's perspective is Thomas Metzinger, who argues that the human "self" is not a real entity but rather a "useful fantasy" or "psychological fairytale" created by a jumbled network of neurons and chemicals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>. If Metzinger is correct, humanity has no real purpose or unique soul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. *[[nihilism_and_cosmic_pessimism_in_rick_and_morty | Rick and Morty]]* frequently trivializes the self and consciousness, as seen when Rick's creations gain sentience and experience [[the_concept_of_meaninglessness_in_rick_and_morty | existential crises]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>.

> “What is my purpose?” <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>
> “You pass butter” <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>
> “Oh my god.” <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>
> “Yeah, welcome to the club.” <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>

This brand of nihilism can become misanthropic, a trait associated with Rick, whose primary reason for spending time with Morty is to use his "Morty waves" as an interdimensional cloaking device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>. This rejection of the self makes [[cosmic_nihilism_and_its_depiction_in_rick_and_morty | cosmic nihilism]] less prone to ethics than [[existential_nihilism_through_bojack_horseman | existential nihilism]], as freedom is seen as an illusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>. Without value to ground ethics, one is free to do whatever they want <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>.

## Steed vs. Sanchez: Which Nihilism is Right for You?

The choice between these two forms of nihilism depends on individual perspective:

### Existential Nihilist Traits

*   Fighting the despair of a shallow, meaningless world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>.
*   Searching for purpose and goodness despite awareness of meaninglessness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>.
*   Surrounded by sentient animals with important jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>.

For [[existential_nihilism_through_bojack_horseman | existential nihilists]], love and meaning are possible but require hard work without guarantees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>.

### Cosmic Nihilist Traits

*   Doubting the inherent meaning of human existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>.
*   Feeling no ethical obligations to friends or family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>.
*   Having a bird-person as a best friend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>.

For [[cosmic_nihilism_and_its_depiction_in_rick_and_morty | cosmic nihilists]], this philosophy might be ideal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>.

Ultimately, spending time with shows like *[[nihilism_and_cosmic_pessimism_in_rick_and_morty | Rick and Morty]]* and *[[existential_nihilism_through_bojack_horseman | BoJack Horseman]]* can provide insight into the practical ramifications of nihilism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>. Neither form of nihilism advocates giving up completely; instead, they offer different approaches to navigating an uncertain world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>.

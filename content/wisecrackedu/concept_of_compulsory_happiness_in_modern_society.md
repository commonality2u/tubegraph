The *Rick and Morty* episode "Rest and Ricklaxation" offers a sharp commentary on [[psychology_of_intelligence_and_happiness | mental health]] in contemporary society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. It functions as an extended parody of certain "healthy" attitudes promoted by self-help gurus, popular media, and "life purpose cheerleaders" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>.

## "Anti-Character Development" as Social Commentary

The episode employs an "anti-character development" approach, contrasting with typical narrative structures where protagonists overcome their "shadow" selves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>. Instead of eliminating their toxic traits, Rick and Morty's journey involves reuniting with their worst selves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>. "Healthy-Morty" is a popular, smooth operator who eventually needs to rediscover his self-loathing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>, while "Healthy-Rick" is a thoughtful super-genius who needs to rediscover his narcissism and "irrational care for Morty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>. This unique narrative serves as a commentary on societal views of [[psychology_of_intelligence_and_happiness | mental health]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>.

## The Parody of "Healthy" Attitudes

The show questions what it means to be mentally healthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. It critiques the pervasive idea that individuals must strive to eliminate any thoughts that are unpleasant or painful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>. Popular "Insta-llectuals" often suggest that being mentally healthy involves uncritically loving oneself, saying yes to everything, counting blessings, and believing in oneself regardless of the validity of one's schemes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>. However, *Rick and Morty* illustrates that fully embodying these ideals can make one appear like a "coked-out weirdo" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>.

## William Davies and "The Happiness Industry"

The series explores a concept sociologist William Davies writes about in his book "The Happiness Industry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>. Davies discusses "[[critique_of_compulsory_happiness_in_society | compulsory happiness]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>, a notion that in the modern world, an alliance exists between [[Corporate influence and consumer culture | corporations]], managers, and advertisers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>. This alliance promotes a definition of [[psychology_of_intelligence_and_happiness | mental health]] that ultimately serves [[Corporate influence and consumer culture | capitalist society]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>. This form of happiness encourages cheerfully accepting the status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>.

## The Demands of "Compulsory Happiness"

[[critique_of_compulsory_happiness_in_society | Compulsory happiness]] also demands constant self-improvement for the sake of becoming a better consumer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>. Morty, in his "healthy" state, embodies this ideal, spouting platitudes reminiscent of self-help gurus and demanding that others conform to his new lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>. When faced with genuine problems, his response is to dismiss them as "unhealthy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>.

## The Problem with Erasing "Negative" Emotions

The episode highlights a critical flaw in the self-help industry's push to erase feelings like self-doubt and sadness: these emotions are often crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a>. In Morty's case, the absence of self-doubt leads him to become a sociopath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19:00">[05:19:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:00">[05:24:00]</a>, depicted as an unscrupulous stockbroker akin to a "Wall Street fat cat with too much self-esteem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>. Rick's realization underscores that even less desirable parts of oneself, despite the pain they might cause, are essential for true [[psychology_of_intelligence_and_happiness | mental health]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:00">[05:49:00]</a>. Jessica's comment to Morty, "Good to have you back," suggests that his authentic, "self-hating self, is truly his better self" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:00]</a>.

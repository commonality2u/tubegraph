*The Lion King*, presented by Earthling Cinema and host Garyx Wormuloid, is described as an artifact featuring EGOT winners Whoopi Goldberg and James Earl Ray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. The film is humorously stated to be "definitely not a direct ripoff" of the Japanese anime *Kimba the White Lion* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. It is set on a landmass called Africa, where animals speak English and no humans exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Plot Overview and Character Introductions

The narrative begins with the lion Mufasa, ruler of the animals, siring a son named Simba <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Simba is initially portrayed as obsessed with seizing power, even gleefully singing about his father's demise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. Mufasa's brother, Scar, desiring the throne for himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>, orchestrates Mufasa's death by having him trampled in a wildebeest moshpit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. Scar then deceives Simba into believing he is responsible for his father's death, prompting Simba to flee and leave the throne to Scar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

Simba is adopted by a "kindly gay couple" and lives in a "hippie commune" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. He later reunites with his friend Nala <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, who urges him to reclaim his rightful place as king <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. Simba initially resists, preferring his "good vibes and organic farming" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>, but is persuaded by a ghost to confront Scar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. After a conflict, Simba defeats Scar, throwing him "to the wolves" (an Earth expression meaning to throw someone to the horses) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. Simba assumes the kingship, which magically transforms the barren wasteland into a lush paradise for the next generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>, embodying the [[themes_of_the_circle_of_life_and_social_order_in_the_lion_king | "circle of life"]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

## Cultural and Literary Inspirations

*The Lion King* is "loosely based" on the movie *Hamlet*, directed by William Shakeshack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. The resemblance includes the same plot and characters: a king murdered by his brother, the son visited by his father's ghost, and two comic foils aiding the hero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. This inspiration from "olden times" may explain the film's "oddly conservative message" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

## Thematic Symbolism

### The Circle of Life and Fixed Social Order

The film places considerable emphasis on the [[themes_of_the_circle_of_life_and_social_order_in_the_lion_king | "circle of life"]], which is presented as a "natural, fixed social order" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. Disruption of this order, as seen under Scar's reign, leads to chaos and violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. Mufasa uses this concept to justify the predatory nature of the animal kingdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

### Feudal Society and The "Noble Lie"

The narrative depicts a feudal social order where one's value is determined by birth, not merit, action, or bribery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. For those not born at the top, there is no chance of upward mobility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. The movie's core message is "know your place" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. When Rafiki unveils Simba on Pride Rock, it implicitly asserts that Simba will one day "feast on your carcas in accordance with the laws of the universe. Resistance is futile" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. The film suggests that animals find peace only through subjugation, confirming their place in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

This concept ties into Greek philosopher Socrates' "noble lie," as documented by Plato in *The New Republic* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. Socrates theorized that if humans believed God instilled gold in important people's souls and less precious metals in others', they would happily accept their lot in life as divinely ordained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

### Scar's Rebellion and Reign

Scar is presented as the only animal to reject this feudal society, perhaps due to his "visible headwound" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. He laments that "life isn’t fair" and rebels against the "natural" societal order that labels him a weakling for not having the physical attributes of Mufasa or Channing Tatum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

When Scar assumes power, he ushers in an "era of equality," allowing hyenas to be on equal footing with lions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. Despite his "progressive politics," Scar is not entirely altruistic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. His song about a "new world order" features Nazi marching imagery and camera movements directly "lifted from Leni Reifenstahl’s *Triumph of the Will*" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. Like "Adam Hitler," Scar's reign quickly sours; his interference with the food chain's "natural order" transforms a once prosperous utopia into anarchy and starvation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

The film humorously suggests that perhaps the only way to combat social injustice is to say "Hakuna Matata," which translates roughly to "fuck it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

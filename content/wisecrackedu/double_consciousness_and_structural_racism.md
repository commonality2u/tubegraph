Jordan Peele's social thriller *Get Out* uniquely explores [[themes_of_racism_and_injustice | themes of racism and injustice]] by targeting [[white_liberal_racism_in_get_out | white liberals]] rather than conventional subjects [00:00:19]. The film critiques the notion of a 'post-racial' era, arguing that [[jordan_peeles_commentary_on_postracial_america | so-called post-racial liberalism]] is more terrifying than commonly imagined [00:01:20]. Throughout *Get Out*, protagonist Chris Washington encounters white characters who claim to have moved beyond racism [00:01:30]. This disavowal, however, appears to reinforce a relationship with black people that is, at best, suspicious [00:01:34]. The film illustrates how attempts to prove their "not racist" stance only serve to further alienate Chris [00:01:45].

## The Sunken Place as Metaphor for Marginalization

A central concept in *Get Out* is the "Sunken Place," described as a hypnotic state where one's mind is separated from their body, leaving them to passively view their own experiences through a screen [00:08:44]. Director Jordan Peele clarified that "The Sunken Place means we’re marginalized" and that "No matter how hard we scream, the system silences us" [00:08:53]. This implies that a society built upon inequality will inevitably leave those on the outside without a voice, or with a suppressed version of it [00:09:02]. One's true identity must remain in the background to "go with the flow" [00:09:08]. In the film, the Sunken Place is both a hypnosis technique and a metaphor for Chris's own life as a helpless spectator [00:10:54].

## W.E.B. Du Bois and Double Consciousness

The "Sunken Place" can be further understood through sociologist W.E.B. Du Bois's concept of "double consciousness" [00:09:17]. Du Bois defined double consciousness as the internal conflict experienced by African Americans living in a structurally racist society [00:09:22]. These societal conditions compel black people to perceive themselves through the perspective of the dominant societal force, which in this case, is white people [00:09:33]. Being constantly evaluated by the standards of white society leads to what Du Bois termed a "two-ness" in the black soul [00:09:42]. This imposition causes confusion about the authenticity of one's experiences [00:10:07], leaving individuals feeling like helpless spectators [00:10:19].

## Chris Washington's Experience

Chris's journey in *Get Out* exemplifies double consciousness. Before the title screen, he is depicted as a black man lost in white suburbs, a metaphor for his upcoming experiences [00:06:24]. He feels like "a sore thumb" in this environment [00:06:38], and the physical maze of suburbia parallels the emotional maze he must navigate [00:06:42]. Many of Chris’s interactions appear modulated for his white audience [00:06:48]. For instance, during a police encounter, Chris prioritizes not angering the officer, while his white girlfriend Rose is content to make a scene [00:06:53]. Similarly, he quickly drops suspicions about his phone being tampered with to avoid upsetting Rose’s family [00:07:06]. Even the simple act of meeting his girlfriend's parents leads Chris to worry, "Do they know I'm... do they know I'm black?" [00:07:21].

Being one of the few people of color at the party leaves Chris anxiously trying to navigate the "overwhelmingly white space" [00:07:25]. Philosopher Frantz Fanon described a similar experience as a black man in 20th-century France, where meeting "the white man’s eyes" placed a burdensome weight on him, making him feel uncomfortable in his own body and out of place in a white-dominated world [00:07:37]. Like Fanon, Chris is burdened by the effort to fit into a world from which he feels fundamentally excluded [00:07:55]. He is caught between integrating into Rose’s world and retaining his own identity [00:08:07], feeling that "they haven't met a black person that doesn't work for them" [00:08:12]. This forces Chris to embody two identities simultaneously: a black man with his own identity and Rose's agreeable black boyfriend who tolerates absurd questions [00:08:15]. To navigate this, Chris must silence his own identity, a process made literal when he is cast into the Sunken Place [00:08:33].

## Broader Societal Commentary

The film's depiction of the Coagula procedure, where black consciousness is literally pushed to the background for a white mind [00:11:00], embodies the fear of losing oneself and being permanently cast into the Sunken Place [00:11:06]. The movie uses this extreme form of [[negrophilia_and_black_identity | desire for the black body]] to comment on [[subversion_of_racial_ideology_and_stereotypes | the impact of structural racism]].

The final scene, featuring the arrival of police sirens and Chris kneeling over a bleeding white woman, initially intended to depict a devastating worst-case scenario [00:12:46]. Although Jordan Peele opted for a more triumphant conclusion in the final cut [00:12:56], this moment serves as a stark reminder that the true monster of *Get Out* is not a fictional boogeyman, but "the horrors of the system itself" [00:13:00]. This systemic issue, unlike a film antagonist, cannot be heroically defeated at the conclusion [00:13:10]. The film's overarching message is a [[social_commentary_on_violence_and_societal_structure | commentary on societal structure]] and the pervasive, often unseen, nature of [[themes_of_racism_and_injustice | structural racism]].

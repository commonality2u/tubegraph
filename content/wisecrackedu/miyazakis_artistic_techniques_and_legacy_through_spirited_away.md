*Spirited Away*, the award-winning masterpiece from legendary animator and "confirmed silver fox" Hayao Miyazaki, serves as a significant expression of his artistic philosophy and enduring legacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Miyazaki's Vision and Artistic Approach

At a time when many animated films were created using computers, *Spirited Away* was notably drawn using an "elaborate system of levers and pulleys," emphasizing a traditional animation approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. This choice reflects a broader message about respecting the history of the art form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

Prior to creating *Spirited Away*, Miyazaki considered passing the torch to the next generation of artists at Studio Ghibli, though he ultimately reconsidered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. The film itself conveys hope for future generations to flourish and progress while upholding respect for artistic heritage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

## Themes Reflecting Legacy and [[cultural_influences_and_historical_context_in_spirited_away | Cultural Identity]]

Underneath its primary narrative as a [[comparison_of_spirited_away_to_other_coming_of_age_stories | coming of age story]] focusing on renewal, *Spirited Away* presents a cautionary tale against [[themes_of_overconsumption_and_capitalism_in_spirited_away | greed and overconsumption]], particularly within the context of postwar Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. This reflects Miyazaki's concern for societal balance.

The film expresses a hope that modern Japan can achieve a balance between economic prosperity and spiritual heritage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. This message is underscored by:
*   **Remembering One's Name**: There is significant emphasis on remembering one's true name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>, as forgetting it means one can "never find your way home" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.
*   **Identity of Parents**: The ability to identify one's parents is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.
*   **Connection to Ancestry**: These elements are vital in forging a connection to one's ancestry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

The Spirit Realm's appearance as an old amusement park styled after the Meiji period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>, alongside discarded shrines adorning hillsides, symbolizes the "relegation of [[cultural_influences_and_historical_context_in_spirited_away | cultural history]] in favor of more modern pursuits" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. This [[symbolism_in_spirited_away | symbolism]] highlights Miyazaki's call for a balance between progress and preserving traditional values.

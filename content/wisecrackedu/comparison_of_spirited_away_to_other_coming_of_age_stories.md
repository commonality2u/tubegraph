*Spirited Away*, the award-winning masterpiece from legendary animator Hayao Miyazaki <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>, functions as a classic coming-of-age narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

## Similarities to Classic Tales
The film aligns with the tradition of stories like Tim Burton's *Alice in Wonderland* and James Franco's *The Wizard of Oz* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. These stories similarly feature a young girl transported to an unfamiliar place where she must undertake various challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

## Chihiro's Transformation
At the beginning of the film, protagonist Chihiro is depicted as naive, inexperienced, timid, and whiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. For instance, upon seeing her new school, she states, "It's gonna stink" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. Her [[themes_of_innocence_and_adulthood | journey from innocence to adulthood]] is marked by solving problems and assisting others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. Through these experiences, Chihiro acquires the self-reliance and empathy necessary to navigate the challenges she faces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

## Legacy and Future Generations
The film's underlying message connects to the future of artistic endeavors. Hayao Miyazaki, the director, had considered passing on his work to the next generation of artists at Studio Ghibli before deciding to continue himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. *Spirited Away*, which was drawn using traditional methods rather than computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>, expresses a hope that future generations will progress and thrive while simultaneously honoring the history of the art form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

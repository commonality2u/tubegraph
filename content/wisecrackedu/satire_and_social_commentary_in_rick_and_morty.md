*Rick and Morty* is recognized as a leading animated series known for its blend of philosophy, science, and humor, often incorporating "dick jokes" alongside deeper themes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The show follows the adventures of a mad scientist, Rick, and his grandson, Morty, as they traverse alternate dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While sharing a premise similar to *Back to the Future*, *Rick and Morty* differentiates itself by portraying Rick as a "gassy alcoholic" and exploring alternate dimensions instead of time travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Cosmic Horror and Humanity's Insignificance

The show is deeply rooted in sci-fi horror traditions, paying homage to works like *Ghostbusters*, David Cronenberg, *Nosferatu*, and Freddy Kreuger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It has a particular affinity for cosmic horror, a genre pioneered by H.P. Lovecraft, which emphasizes the terror of the incomprehensible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Like Lovecraft, *Rick and Morty* uses the cosmos to explore profound philosophical questions by imagining the unknown in space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The show's opening visually references Lovecraft's Cthulhu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

Cosmic horror, as seen in the show, goes beyond jump-scares, presenting the vast unknown and unimaginable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Rick's portal gun constantly confronts characters and the audience with this unknown, leading to horrifying, hilarious, or both, outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

An example of this is the episode “Get Schwifty,” where a giant space-head, a Cromulon, approaches Earth, causing mayhem and demanding a hit song from humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This scenario, featuring giant floating cosmic entities, reflects Lovecraft's "Great Old Ones" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The core question posed by cosmic horror, and by *Rick and Morty*, is: "Are we significant?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Unlike much of science fiction that centers humanity, cosmic horror posits that "the universe doesn’t give a shit about us" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. For the Cromulons, humanity is merely entertainment, and planetary annihilation is inconsequential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

This concept aligns with philosopher Eugene Thacker's "Cosmic Pessimism," which imagines a "world-without-us" and views the universe as "absolutely unhuman, and indifferent to the hopes, desires and struggles of human individuals and groups" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. *Rick and Morty* embodies this pessimism, notably by having Rick and Morty die and be replaced by infinite alternate versions of themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This highlights not only humanity's cosmic insignificance but also the infinite replicability of individual existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The show encourages laughter at this insignificance rather than terror <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

Furthermore, the show demonstrates that humans can also be "cosmic horrors" to others. In "The Ricks Must Be Crazy," Rick's car battery is powered by a micro-universe whose inhabitants exist solely to produce energy, and they, in turn, create their own mini-universes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This "cosmic inception" suggests Rick acts as a deity to these micro-verses, further emphasizing how values and meanings dissipate in a multiverse of infinite possibilities, leaving only pessimism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## [[rick_and_morty_and_existentialism | Existentialism]] and Nihilism

*Rick and Morty* consistently addresses the question of existence in nearly every episode, exploring both the cosmic insignificance of humanity and the frivolity of individual life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The show presents two contrasting responses to this "pathetic existence" through Rick and Jerry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

### Responses to the Absurd

*   **Jerry:** Jerry is portrayed as oblivious to the "soul-crushing mediocrity and pointlessness of his own life," finding contentment even in a poor simulation of reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. He is a "failure"—unemployed, with a wife who dislikes him, and not intellectually sharp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, his ignorance allows him to remain content in "toiling away for the sake of nothing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.
*   **Rick:** Rick, conversely, understands and accepts life's meaninglessness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Despite his sarcastic and nonchalant demeanor towards pain and suffering, his catchphrase "Wubbalubbadubdub" translates to "I am in great pain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The show suggests that pure rationalism deepens the feeling of individual insignificance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Science, while providing understanding, can also strip away sanctity and emotion, rendering the human experience meaningless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Rick even mathematically explains his grandchildren's insignificance and rationalizes his bond with Morty as merely a way to hide his genius brainwaves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

### Reality and Simulation

The show constantly plays with the dichotomy between meaningless simulations and "actual" life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. In an episode where Morty, as "Roy," lives a full life and dies in a video game, the audience is left to question the difference between the game's reality and his own existence, particularly if he experiences genuine emotions and sensations in the "fake" life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. *Rick and Morty* challenges the notion that our waking life inherently holds authenticity or meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, asking what distinguishes killing memory parasites (for whom the family felt genuine emotion) from shooting Mr. Poopybutthole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

### Death of God and Nihilism

This "crisis of values" is explored through the lens of philosophers like Friedrich Nietzsche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Nietzsche's "death of God" parable, interpreted as the irrelevance of a divine being after the Enlightenment and scientific revolution, leads to nihilism—a void of meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This struggle with meaninglessness defines Rick Sanchez <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Rick uses science to demystify everything, reducing love to chemical reactions and even defeating the devil, metaphorically enacting the "death of God" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

Rick embodies a tension between passive nihilism (resignation to life's meaninglessness) and active nihilism (destroying old values to create new ones) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While his motives are often unclear, his actions, such as being labeled an intergalactic terrorist and sacrificing himself for his family, suggest a struggle to find meaning in the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

### Morality and Freedom

The show also interrogates morality, refusing to draw clear lines between right and wrong or good and evil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Morty's attempts to be a "do-gooder" are consistently thwarted, such as when freeing people from Unity leads to a "nipple-driven race war" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Summer's observation, "I didn’t know freedom meant people doing stuff that sucks," highlights how an "irrational attachment to freedom" can lead to a "terribly fucked up" world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

### [[philosophy_and_absurdism_in_rick_and_morty | Absurdism]]

[[philosophy_and_absurdism_in_rick_and_morty | Absurdism]], particularly through the work of Albert Camus, is explored in "Meeseeks and Destroy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Camus' central tenet of absurdism is the irreconcilable conflict between humanity's desire for meaning and the universe's indifference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The Meeseeks, who are "created to serve a singular purpose" and do not "fumble for meaning," stand in stark contrast to Camus' view of human life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

This is further illustrated by the Myth of Sisyphus, where the king eternally pushes a boulder uphill only for it to fall back down, mirroring Jerry's futile attempts to perfect his golf swing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Many characters, such as the Meeseeks, Abradolf Lincler, Morty Jr., and even Frankenstein's monster, express a "Frankenstein-complex," resenting their creators for bringing them into existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Camus suggests embracing the emptiness of the absurd, a sentiment echoed by Rick's advice, "Don't think about it," and Morty's nihilistic acceptance: "Nobody exists on purpose. Nobody belongs anywhere. Everybody’s gonna die. Come watch TV?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Science as Satire and Social Critique

*Rick and Morty*'s use of science serves both to explore profound questions and to deliver "nerdy jokes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

### Poking Fun at Sci-Fi Tropes

The show draws humor from superficial readings of scientific principles, such as the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which is used to explain realities splitting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It references Schrödinger's cat, pondering if a cat could be both alive and dead simultaneously in a quantum world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This "tenuous relationship to scientific truth" can be seen as a jab at the science fiction genre itself, for often inventing "scientific mumbo-jumbo to justify unlikely plot points," such as "stupid and smart brain-waves canceling each other out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The show even mocks its own narrative techniques, as when Rick traversing tiny climates on a tiny planet is used to poke fun at the trust placed in TV narratives through a joke about forced perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This highlights the show's [[inversion_of_common_cliches_and_tropes_in_rick_and_morty | inversion of common cliches and tropes]].

### [[critique_of_religion_and_belief_systems_in_rick_and_morty | Critique of Religion and Misused Science]]

The show displays a unique form of atheism, consistently invalidating religious figures by reducing them to scientific explanations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It also acknowledges the misuse of science by those with religious agendas. In “Something Ricked This Way Comes,” Jerry's "personal" interpretation of science leads him on a crusade to reinstate Pluto’s planet-hood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The Plutonians, marked with crosses in their eyes, symbolize religious fundamentalism, manipulated by corporate overlords who use false scientific claims to justify the destruction of their planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This serves as a [[alienation_and_societal_critique_in_rick_and_morty | societal critique]] on how beliefs can be exploited.

## Conclusion

*Rick and Morty* is a show that "holds nothing as sacred" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. By exploring the absurdities of a purely rational universe and pushing the boundaries of decency within a sci-fi horror setting, it prompts audiences to ponder existential questions like "Why am I here?" and "What’s the point of it all?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The show's portrayal of science allows it to highlight how, despite admiring Rick, human lives can appear as "sad and pathetic as Jerry’s" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

*Zootopia*, set on Earth in the 24th century after humans have wiped themselves out, features animals who have taken over their wardrobes and society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. The film's narrative, centered around the enthusiastic Judy Hopps and her reluctant partner Nick, serves as an extended allegory for various social and political dynamics found in human societies.

## The Question of Nature vs. Nurture

A central theme in *Zootopia* is the debate between nature and nurture, questioning whether identity is biologically determined or if individuals can elevate themselves through their upbringing and environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

Initially, the film suggests that civilization is merely a thin layer preventing predators from reverting to their "primitive ways" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. Nick, a fox, outwardly bucks negative stereotypes associated with his species but privately displays a "sly nature" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. However, the revelation that the predators' "savage" behavior is caused by an obscure poison called "night howlers" — a type of flower that makes animals "zonked in their bonker" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a> — ultimately exonerates animal biology itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

## Inversion of Stereotypes and Prejudice

The film intentionally inverts previously established stereotypes to highlight the fallacy of relying on prejudice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. Examples include:
*   Judy's childhood fox bully becoming a pacifist pastry chef <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
*   Flash, the famously slow sloth, being depicted as a speed demon drag racer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
*   The "dumb bunny" (Judy) solving the case, and the "sly fox" (Nick) embracing an honest profession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.
*   The meek lamb assistant mayor being revealed as the ruthless mastermind behind the entire conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

## Mirroring 20th Century American Society

*Zootopia* draws significant parallels to the social and political landscape of 20th-century America, particularly regarding efforts to address societal inequalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

### Mammal Inclusion Initiative

The film's "Mammal Inclusion Initiative" is likened to Earthling diversity and affirmative action programs designed to create a more equitable environment for underserved minorities, and in the case of women, majorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. The use of language associated with political correctness, such as Judy stating, "Sir, I'm not just some token bunny" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>, further accentuates these parallels.

## Simplified Solutions and Exclusions

Despite its themes of inclusion, the film suggests that Zootopia's social ills can be resolved through mere effort and optimism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. This presents a simplified, almost "easy peasy" resolution to complex social problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

Furthermore, the film's concept of inclusion is ironically limited, as it appears to ignore or exclude reptiles, amphibians, fish, birds, and insects, implying their demise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. This highlights a potential critique that, for a movie about inclusion, it goes "out of their way to ignore all the freaks and uggos" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

Zootopia's exploration of these themes places it alongside other animated films that delve into deeper societal critiques, such as the [[symbolism_and_hidden_messages_in_the_lion_king | symbolism and hidden messages in The Lion King]], the [[hidden_themes_in_zootopia | hidden themes in Zootopia]] itself, and the [[philosophical_themes_and_societal_critiques_in_the_incredibles | philosophical themes and societal critiques in The Incredibles]]. Like [[allegory_of_the_soviet_union_in_animal_farm | *Animal Farm*]], it uses anthropomorphic characters to allegorize human political and social issues, though with a different thematic emphasis. The film's portrayal of power dynamics and social stratification can also be compared to [[themes_of_social_order_and_hierarchy_in_the_lion_king | themes of social order and hierarchy in The Lion King]].

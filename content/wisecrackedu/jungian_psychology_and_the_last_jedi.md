The film *[[Rian Johnsons approach to revolutionizing Star Wars | The Last Jedi]]* generated significant [[Fan reaction to The Last Jedi | fan reaction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Many common complaints focused on plot points and character portrayals, such as Luke Skywalker's depiction, Snoke's sudden demise, Holdo's plan, the Canto Bight sequence, Rey's parentage, and the use of Marvel-style humor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Instead of focusing on these specific criticisms, a deeper analysis reveals how director Rian Johnson attempted to revolutionize the *Star Wars* franchise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## Revolutionizing Star Wars through Thematic Subversion

*The Last Jedi* can be interpreted as a meta-commentary on the relationship between new and original *Star Wars* films <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. The dynamic between Kylo Ren and Darth Vader mirrors the pressure the new series faces to live up to the legacy of the original trilogy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. Just as Kylo Ren mimics Darth Vader, *The Force Awakens* is seen as a beat-for-beat rehash of *A New Hope* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. In *The Last Jedi*, Snoke tells Kylo to discard his mask, symbolizing Johnson's intent to move beyond rehashing the original trilogy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. This act, followed by Ren breaking the mask, signals that the film aims to be a radical subversion of the *Star Wars* formula, implying that "for the new Star Wars to live, the old Star Wars must die" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

Johnson sought to progress the franchise by abrasively undermining its traditional tropes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. Examples include:
*   Rey's parents being "degenerate winos" rather than of noble blood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.
*   Heroes being janitors and mechanics instead of politicians and princesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
*   Luke Skywalker being a "failed nephew murder/slovenian philosopher" rather than an idealistic hero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.
*   Yoda transforming from a symbol of Jedi piety to a "would-be book burner" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
*   The Jedi Order itself being portrayed as flawed, characterized by "failure. Hypocrisy. Hubris" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
*   The collapse of the Empire leading to the rise of a nearly identical fascistic order, suggesting a fundamental problem in the galaxy's approach to good and evil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

## Jungian Psychology and the Star Wars Mythology

Johnson's intent was to complicate the traditional stark divisions of [[Good versus evil in Star Wars mythology | good and evil]] that form the core of *Star Wars* mythology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. George Lucas originally crafted the original trilogy based on Joseph Campbell's "The Hero with a Thousand Faces," which outlines "the monomyth" â€“ a universal story structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. Campbell's monomyth is based on the work of psychologist Carl Jung, particularly his concepts of the "collective unconscious" and "archetypes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

### The Shadow Archetype

One key Jungian archetype relevant to *The Last Jedi* is the **shadow** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. For Jung, the shadow is the primal, repressed part of our unconscious, often described as the "dark side" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. In the monomyth, this dark side is typically embodied by a character representing the protagonist's shortcomings and fears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. Darth Vader serves as Luke Skywalker's shadow, a reminder of what he could become if he doesn't conquer his fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. Luke's decision to spare Vader's life is a psychological act of conquering his inner demons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

### Reconceptualizing Balance in the Force

While traditional *Star Wars* films suggest that balance in the Force is a desirable state for the galaxy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>, *The Last Jedi* proposes that the Force inherently promotes balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. When darkness rises, the Force amplifies the light to counteract it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. This suggests that a powerful Jedi order might be met by an equally powerful dark side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. Consequently, Luke's criticism of the Jedi order implies that their actions may have contributed to the cyclical rise and fall of fascist empires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. This new perspective suggests that the dark side isn't something to be conquered, as that would cause the Force to "overcorrect" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.

Jungian analyst Robert A. Johnson (not to be confused with Rian Johnson) argues that the "dark sides" of our personality should not be merely conquered or expunged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. Such repression leads to "accumulate[d] the darkness" and creates an "ego split," forcing individuals to find scapegoats and project their own ugliness onto others, leading to endless conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. The original *Star Wars* literally projects Luke's inner demons onto an "evil space wizard" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.

Rian Johnson attempts to complicate the classic distinction between good and evil, both in characters and plot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. The film asks if the galaxy, like an individual, needs to reconcile its dark side with the larger order of things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

### Moral Ambiguity and DJ

Benicio del Toro's character, DJ, exemplifies this shift by challenging the traditional distinction between purely good Rebels and purely evil oppressors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. DJ, a cynical mercenary, sees through the "made up words" of "good guys" and "bad guys," revealing that even the "good guys" (Rebels) purchase weapons from the same arms dealers who sell to the "bad guys" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. This is presented as the most morally ambiguous moment in any *Star Wars* film, complicating the understanding of the Rebellion as an infallible good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. Robert A. Johnson suggests that the inability to reconcile with one's shadow, leading to scapegoating, results in violence, war, and racism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. *The Last Jedi* shifts focus from "good guys and bad guys" to a critique of the galaxy's "machine" or military economy, including its exploitation and animal rights violations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

## The Film's Backpedal

Despite setting up a radical subversion of *Star Wars* tropes and moral frameworks, *The Last Jedi* ultimately reverts to established ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. Kylo Ren offers Rey a chance to "Let old things die. Snoke. Skywalker. The Sith. The Jedi. The rebels. Let it all die," proposing she join him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>. Yet, Rey refuses, and the film backpedals on its initial premises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.

Examples of this reversal include:
*   The tearing down of heroic archetypes is undermined as "The legend of Luke Skywalker" lives on, inspiring the galaxy, even if it's a lie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.
*   The necessity to tear down established orders like the Jedi is rejected, with Rey declaring, "And I will not be the last Jedi" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.
*   The desire to distance itself from the original trilogy's narrative structure is contradicted by echoing classic lines like "Strike me down in anger, and I'll always be with you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.
*   The idea of forgetting the Jedi past is rejected, as the Jedi books are saved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.

This ideological shift occurs without sufficient plot-driven rationale, as Luke seemingly reaffirms antiquated ideas simply because "he loves his sister" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.

The film makes a psychologically sophisticated case for Rey to team up with Ren, arguing that the old way doesn't work, Jedi are repressed, and the galaxy is stuck in a cycle of conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. Ren, having confronted his good and bad sides, is arguably closer to finding Jungian balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. He offers Rey exactly what Jung and Robert Johnson advocate: recognition that ego and shadow are inseparable parts of a person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>. However, Rey ultimately represents the "old moral code of Star Wars," choosing to be the "good Jedi," a "morally-pure, infallible hero" who suppresses her darkness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>.

The critique suggests that while attempting to revolutionize *Star Wars* and reframe its central conflict is commendable, abrasively subverting everything fans know and love, only to revert to the starting point, is problematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>.

In the world of *The Walking Dead*, survivors face complex political challenges beyond just fighting zombies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. Groups grapple with decisions on where to go, how to get there, individual responsibilities, and how to enforce rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>. When discussion fails or time is of the essence, violence often becomes the expedient solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.

## Rick Grimes: The Cincinnatus of the Apocalypse

At the end of Season 2, Rick Grimes openly declares a dictatorship, stating, "This isn't a democracy anymore" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>. This concept of dictatorship originates from Ancient Roman legal conventions, where absolute power was temporarily granted to an individual during extreme emergencies to protect against annihilation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.

A famous example of a "good-guy-dictator" from Roman history is Cincinnatus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>. He was a Roman statesman who, after retiring to a small farm, was elected dictator twice in times of crisis for Rome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>. Each time, after defeating the threats, Cincinnatus immediately resigned his position and returned to farming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>. *The Walking Dead* draws a clear parallel, likening Rick Grimes to Cincinnatus: a character who leaves his farming life to protect against hordes of enemies, only to return to farming once the immediate threat is gone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>.

Beyond Cincinnatus, other Roman connections appear in the show:
*   The Governor's Fight Club evokes gladiator battles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>.
*   [[Philosophy and Socioeconomic Commentary in The Purge | Terminus]], the cannibals' home, is named after the Roman god of boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.
*   Romans 6:4, a Bible verse about Jesus rising from the dead, is scrawled on Gabriel's wall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>.

These Roman allusions highlight a commentary on politics and sovereignty, particularly considering Rome's history as a site of both extreme tyranny and foundational representative government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>.

## The State of Exception

German political theorist Carl Schmitt argues that the sovereign is the one who "makes the exception"—the person who can discard the law to create exceptions to the rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>. Rick Grimes embodies this concept; he unilaterally declares an end to democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>, and later, when Alexandria is in danger, he, not Deanna, assumes control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>.

The suspension of law is a recurring theme:
*   Shane bypasses group consensus to kill Randall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>.
*   Carol kills and burns flu victims in the prison to protect the group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>.

Italian philosopher Giorgio Agamben suggests that the "state of exception" has become the norm rather than an infrequent occurrence, permeating society and evident in contexts like the war on terror and refugee camps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>. Agamben explored this concept to understand how atrocities like Nazi concentration camps could occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>.

In *The Walking Dead*, Rick is depicted as a modern sovereign who suspends the law for the greater good, sometimes leading to morally questionable actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>. The crucial difference between Rick and Gareth of [[Philosophy and Socioeconomic Commentary in The Purge | Terminus]] is that for Gareth, the suspension of law—and basic human morality like not eating people—has become permanent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>. Agamben's terrifying implication is that individuals like Rick are only "a few setbacks away" from becoming like Gareth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>.

This blurring of lines is driven by the imperative of survival. The philosophy of "you're either the butcher or the cattle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>, reminiscent of Nietzsche's "bird of prey" and "lamb," is frequently invoked by Rick through "us or them" logic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>. Agamben asserts that "The camp is the space that opens up when the state of exception starts to become the rule" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>. This critical point suggests that whether atrocities occur depends on the sovereign law enforcer rather than the rule of law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>. Even outside a zombie apocalypse, this logic persists, allowing governments to suspend law during crises like natural disasters or pandemics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>.

*The Walking Dead* prompts viewers to consider whether Rick and his group will ultimately save the world or continue to inadvertently ruin every place they encounter, raising the question of whether the world might eventually need to be saved *from* Rick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>.

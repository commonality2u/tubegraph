## The Conch

In William Golding's [[summary_of_lord_of_the_flies | *Lord of the Flies*]], the conch shell serves as a significant symbol. Initially, Piggy and Ralph discover a large shell which they use to communicate and gather the boys for meetings, referring to it as "the conch" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This object becomes a tool for order and civil discourse among the survivors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

However, its destruction marks a critical turning point in the narrative. The conch shatters when Piggy is thrown off a cliff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. This moment, along with other "falling" motifs throughout the [[summary_of_lord_of_the_flies | book]], such as the falling parachutist and Ralph collapsing at the naval officer's feet, emphasizes the "fall of human kind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

> [!NOTE] The conch symbolizes order, civilization, and the possibility of rational governance among the boys. Its destruction signifies the collapse of these systems and the descent into savagery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[02:03]</a>.

## The Lord of the Flies

A central symbol in the [[summary_of_lord_of_the_flies | story]] is the pig head impaled on a stick, which the narrator refers to as "The Lord of the Flies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. This grotesque symbol is revealed when Simon has a vision of the pig head speaking to him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

The pig head reveals that the "beast" the boys fear is not an external creature they can hunt, but rather "the violence in dem kids hearts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

### Meaning and Interpretations

*   **Beelzebub / The Devil**: "The Lord of the Flies" is another name for Beelzebub, who is the prince of demons and a synonym for the Devil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. In this sense, it represents "the destruction, decay and demoralization of man kind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.
*   **The Id**: From a Freudian perspective, "The Lord of the Flies" can be seen as representing "the id" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. The id functions solely to ensure survival, and when it is in control, "Laws, moral codes, even intelligence itself don’t mean jack shit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. This highlights humanity's capacity for evil and how man-made moral systems are superficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

> [!WARNING] The ultimate tragedy presented is that "they ain’t nobody to save civilized humanity from they violent nature neither" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[03:00]</a>, suggesting that even adult society is not immune to the inherent savagery depicted in the boys' descent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[02:53]</a>.

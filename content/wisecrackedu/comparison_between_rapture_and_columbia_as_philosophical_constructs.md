The *Bioshock* trilogy is recognized not only as a pioneer in gameplay, mixing elements of survival horror, RPGs, and FPS games, but also for its intellectual sophistication and effectiveness at [[integration_of_philosophical_concepts_in_bioshock | integrating philosophical concepts]] into its plot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. The series explores different philosophical constructs through its two primary settings: the underwater city of Rapture and the floating city of Columbia.

## Rapture: A Failed Objectivist Utopia

The original *Bioshock* game takes place in Rapture, an undersea city founded by Andrew Ryan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. The name "Andrew Ryan" is an anagram for Russian-born thinker [[ayn_rands_objectivism_and_its_influence_on_bioshock | Ayn Rand]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. Rapture is a "digital homage" to "Galt's Gulch," a retreat for industrialists from Rand's novel *Atlas Shrugged*, where the cryptic question "Who is John Galt?" is famously posed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. Similarly, "Who is Atlas?" posters adorn Rapture's walls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

Andrew Ryan's political philosophy in Rapture is directly drawn from Rand's concept of [[ayn_rands_objectivism_and_its_influence_on_bioshock | "objectivism"]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

> Objectivism is a sort of guide to living a worthy life—its main tenants are: reality, reason, self-interest and capitalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

Rand believed that reality is objective and concrete, rejecting mystical or divine guidance in favor of actions determined by intellect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. This translates into Ryan's atheism:
> "I believe in no God – no invisible man in the sky. But there is something more powerful than each of us: a combination of our efforts, a Great Chain of industry that unites us." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>

Ryan serves as a "mouthpiece" for Rand's condemnation of coercive governments, advocating for a society based on the belief that such policies violate individual autonomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. This leads to an "ethics of egoism or radical self-interest," where people should work hard for their own happiness and not treat others as mere means to an end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

Rapture was founded on the principle of [[ayn_rands_objectivism_and_its_influence_on_bioshock | laissez-faire capitalism]], where government exists solely to protect individual rights and stays out of personal lives and the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. This is exemplified by the severely under-regulated plasmid market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. Despite "tremendous pressure" to regulate and side effects like "blindness, insanity, death," the belief was that an unfettered market provides the best options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

### The Collapse of Rapture
The "ruinous state of Rapture" suggests a society based on these tenets is "doomed to fail" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. The deregulation of ADAM, a potent resource, led to civil war and a population of addicts, resulting in "rampant chaos and instability" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. The exploitation of Little Sisters as "mules for magical sea slugs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>, treating them as "mere tools for your own goals," would certainly be disapproved of by Rand herself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

## Columbia: Critiquing American Exceptionalism

The third installment, *Bioshock Infinite*, moves the setting to the floating city of Columbia, a "play on the United States Capital" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. Columbia was founded by Zachary Hale Comstock, a fictional stand-in for 19th-century New York political figure Anthony Comstock, known for his prudish values and fight against obscenity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

Comstock's Columbia is a "floating Eden" established with the promise of providing a place for "God’s people, apart from the world of sinners in the Sodom below" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. This vision is rooted in the concept of [[american_exceptionalism_and_its_critique_in_bioshock_infinite | American Exceptionalism]], the belief that the "New World was promised to God’s chosen people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

> Through this philosophy, *Bioshock Infinite* provides us with a tasty satire of America’s Historical landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

Columbia, like America, is presented as "God's country," with religious themes of forgiveness, salvation, and baptism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. However, like its predecessor, *Infinite* explores the "dark side of this philosophy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.

### The Consequences of American Exceptionalism
[[american_exceptionalism_and_its_critique_in_bioshock_infinite | American Exceptionalism]], when secularized as "manifest destiny," justifies actions such as the extermination of indigenous people (Native Americans) for the sake of securing a national identity for Christian settlers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. Those who refused Christianity were "forcibly moved or eliminated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

The ideology of [[american_exceptionalism_and_its_critique_in_bioshock_infinite | American Exceptionalism]] is deeply woven into Columbia's fabric, justifying:
*   Slavery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>
*   Labor strikes and the abuses of Irish and Chinese workers who built the American Railroad system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>
*   Racial segregation for relationships and marriage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>
*   Lynching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>

Columbia is portrayed as a "paranoid place," fearful of anarchists (Vox Populi), the "Irish and Chinese threat," and "racial mixing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. The game features robotic "George Washingtons" called "Patriots" as enemies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>, further satirizing the historical landscape.

## Shared Philosophical Inquiries: Choice and Determinism

Both Rapture and Columbia, despite their differing foundational philosophies, lead to catastrophic outcomes, demonstrating the "dark side" of extreme ideological pursuits. A central dilemma explored across the *Bioshock* series is the freedom of action, choice, and free will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

In *Bioshock* (set in Rapture), Andrew Ryan's quote, "We all make choices, but, in the end, our choices make us," introduces a conundrum: if choices make us, how free are we to make them? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a> This leads to the question of whether free will is even possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. The school of thought known as Hard Determinism suggests that all actions are bound by external forces, implying that "choice" is merely an illusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. Ryan's phrase "A man chooses. A slave obeys" becomes a meta-commentary on the player's role, implying that gamers are "destined to mindlessly follow the fixed path of the game’s narrative," and "interactivity" is an illusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

*Bioshock Infinite* (set in Columbia) presents the multiverse as a potential way out of determinism, suggesting an "infinite number of worlds to choose from" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. However, the game consistently highlights that player choices are not real possibilities, demonstrating the illusion of free will through forced actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. For instance, the player is prompted to "choose" to flip a coin, but the game does not progress unless "X" is pressed, and it always lands on heads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. Similarly, the "choice" to hand over Elizabeth is an illusion; the game forces the player to pick her up to proceed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. The game forces the player to recognize that they are not free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.

Ultimately, both Rapture and Columbia serve as intricate philosophical constructs that challenge players to consider the dark consequences of unchecked ideologies and the very nature of choice and freedom within their compelling narratives.

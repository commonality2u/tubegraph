At first glance, *The Purge* appears to be a typical horror film, featuring a concept where "Any and all crime will be legal for 12 continuous hours" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a> and abundant violent carnage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. However, beyond its horror elements, *The Purge* functions as a profound commentary on contemporary sociopolitical existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. It serves as a thinly veiled allegory for America's corrupt politics, rigged economic systems, and a pervasive culture of violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## The Purge as a Ritualistic Festival

*The Purge* shares similarities with other [[ritualistic_and_cultural_comparisons_of_the_purge | ritualistic festivals]] such as Mardi Gras, Carnival, or Halloween <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. These events are designated times when people can violate social norms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. While seemingly undermining the power of law and religion, these rituals actually reaffirm existing social structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. Similarly, the chaos of Purge night leaves citizens longing for the return of law the next day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Just as Carnival makes people accept Christianity, *The Purge* compels acceptance of the ruling social ideology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

## Neoliberalism and the Politics of Disposability

The societal order depicted in *The Purge* can be best described as [[neoliberalism_and_economic_critique_in_the_purge | Neoliberalism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. The basic premise of [[neoliberalism_and_economic_critique_in_the_purge | neoliberalism]] is that government policy should primarily promote the free flow of goods and protect corporate interests, with minimal market intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Each film in the series reflects a different facet of this [[neoliberalism_and_economic_critique_in_the_purge | neoliberal]] economy, highlighting how characters' responses to the Purge bring into focus the conditions of their respective [[class_struggles_and_economic_disparities_highlighted_by_the_purge | economic class]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

### Class and Economic Disparities in The Purge Series

The films illustrate [[class_struggles_and_economic_disparities_highlighted_by_the_purge | class struggles and economic disparities]]:
*   **The Original Purge**: Focuses on an upper-middle-class suburban family, the Sandins, whose "burb" problems include a homeless intruder, envious neighbors, and family strife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. The family profits from security systems sold to the fearful populace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.
*   **The Purge: Anarchy**: Centers on a working-class family, like Eva Sanchez, who struggles to afford medicine for her father and desperately needs a raise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. The inner city is depicted as a dangerous place filled with Purge traps and violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
*   **The Purge: Election Year**: Explores the impact on small business owners, exemplified by Joe, whose Purge insurance premiums inexplicably rise just before the event, leading to him having to protect his deli alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

The comparison of settings in the first two films can be seen as a metaphor for "white flight," where upper-class white individuals retreat from cities to sheltered suburbs, exposing those left in the inner city to disproportionate amounts of crime, homelessness, and poverty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. Those who prosper under [[neoliberalism_and_economic_critique_in_the_purge | neoliberalism]] benefit from *The Purge*, while those harmed by it are further victimized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

### Dehumanization and Disposability

*The Purge* powerfully exposes how [[neoliberalism_and_economic_critique_in_the_purge | neoliberal]] economics breeds a [[dehumanization_and_disposability_as_presented_in_the_purge | politics of disposability]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. Thinkers Henry Giroux and Brad Evans explain this concept, where suburbanites in *The Purge* view entire groups of people as superfluous and disposable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. This is evident when the "bloody stranger" is called "swine" and "filth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

In *The Purge: Anarchy*, unchecked medication prices force Papa Sanchez to "sell" his life to the rich, allowing them to kill him in a perverse act of Purging for his family's economic relief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. His life becomes more valuable as a disposable object than as an actual person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

>[!INFO] Impact of Neoliberal Policies
>Giroux and Evans argue that people become disposable under an economic system characterized by the privatization of healthcare, deregulation of banks, and the erosion of government safety nets like social security and welfare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

The New Founding Fathers of America (NFFA) legalize murder to decrease the poor population, which reduces government spending on welfare, healthcare, and housing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. This justification for *The Purge* echoes Reverend Thomas Robert Malthus's 1798 "Essay on the Principle of Population," which argued that a growing population would lead to food shortages and proposed laws to keep birth rates low and death rates high through famine, disease, and wars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. The NFFA leader, Caleb Warrens, states, "Everyone to HAVE. SOME cannot have. NOT enough to go around" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

However, Friedrich Engels countered Malthus, arguing that the issue is not increasing population but an economic system that devalues workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. Malthus's model was, in Engels' view, an excuse to be cruel to poor people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. The NFFA's elaborate Purge ceremonies demonstrate their intent to take "being a dick to poor people" to the next level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.

## [[Hidden_meanings_and_themes_in_The_Purge | Hidden Meanings and Themes]]

The brilliance of *The Purge* lies in its ability to viscerally expose how a [[neoliberalism_and_economic_critique_in_the_purge | neoliberal]] economy generates profit in a predatory manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. The privileged make vast sums of money from weapon sales, insurance, private bodyguards, and home security systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>, while the poor are left to fight for survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

### [[Critique_of_The_Purge_as_a_violent_entertainment | Critique of The Purge as Violent Entertainment]]

The *Rick and Morty* episode about Purging offers an interesting [[critique_of_the_purge_as_a_violent_entertainment | counterpoint]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. Rick's cynical enjoyment of the brutal violence suggests a meta-commentary on the audience itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. Watching *The Purge* films places viewers in Rick's position, becoming "murder tourists" who peruse sequels for shocking and new thrills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. The success of *The Purge* films may reveal that people enjoy watching violent content because, sometimes, it "just feels good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

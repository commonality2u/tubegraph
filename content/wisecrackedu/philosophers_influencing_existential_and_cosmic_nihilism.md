Nihilism is often mistakenly assumed to mean simply believing in nothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. However, it encompasses various philosophical, psychological, and ethical positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. While diverse, these forms of nihilism share the fundamental idea that life lacks inherent meaning, value, or order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. Rather than a simplistic belief, [[the_philosophy_of_nihilism_and_existentialism | nihilism]] can serve as a foundation for meaningful worldviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. This article focuses on two distinct branches: [[existential_nihilism_through_bojack_horseman | existential nihilism]] and [[nihilism_and_cosmic_pessimism_in_rick_and_morty | cosmic nihilism]] (also known as cosmic pessimism) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

## Existential Nihilism

[[existential_nihilism_through_bojack_horseman | Existential nihilism]] arises from the realization that human existence has no inherent meaning, fundamentally being a "precarious dance upon the grave" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. In this view, individuals must create meaning through their own freedom and decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>, and must establish and maintain their own values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

### Philosophical Roots

The term "nihilism" was first coined in the late eighteenth century by German philosopher Friedrich Jacobi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. Jacobi introduced the term in response to Enlightenment reason, fearing it would eliminate the basis for religion by explaining away all uncertainty and mystery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. This historical context forms part of the [[philosophical_roots_and_history_of_nihilism | philosophical roots and history of nihilism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

### Søren Kierkegaard

One of the earliest philosophers to explore the implications of [[the_philosophy_of_nihilism_and_existentialism | nihilism]] was Søren Kierkegaard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. Although he never used the word "existentialism," Kierkegaard is regarded as one of the fathers of modern [[existentialism_and_jean_paul_sartres_philosophy | existentialism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

Kierkegaard believed that despair was an essential component of the human experience, referring to it as the "sickness unto death" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. This human despair is dialectical, meaning one is constantly at odds with oneself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. Despair can arise from thinking nothing is possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>, or conversely, from believing everything is possible and being unable to make a decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. It can also stem from despair about who we are, or despair because we cannot be who we think we are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

For Kierkegaard, anxiety is caused by the uncertainty underlying every decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. He viewed anxiety as a manifestation of freedom, where the weight of our decisions, due to our inherent freedom, leads to anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. He described this anxiety as standing at the edge of an abyss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>:
> "If man were an animal, he would not have anxiety; but since he is a synthesis in which the eternal is the most essential, he can no more be without anxiety than he can be without himself. And this is the risk he runs in accepting anxiety, for anxiety is freedom's possibility, and only such a possibility is genuinely educative." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>

To overcome this anxiety and despair, Kierkegaard proposed accepting the comic absurdity of reality and living one's life by faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. He clarified that "faith" is simply the courage to attempt a meaningful existence despite a meaningless world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.

### Jean-Paul Sartre

Nearly a century after Kierkegaard, French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre developed the first explicitly [[existentialism_and_jean_paul_sartres_philosophy | existentialist philosophy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. Sartre posited that [[existentialism_and_jean_paul_sartres_philosophy | existentialism]] provides a means to respond to the universe's meaninglessness by creating meaning ourselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. While the world offers no inherent ethical value or divine comfort, humans can forge meaning through their own lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. Although despair and anxiety may not be curable, one can strive to make life meaningful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. However, [[existential_nihilism_through_bojack_horseman | existential nihilism]] offers no guarantees; continually creating meaning remains an ongoing responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. As Kierkegaard stated, "we must live forward and understand backwards" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.

## Cosmic Nihilism (or, Pessimism)

[[nihilism_and_cosmic_pessimism_in_rick_and_morty | Cosmic nihilism]] is a more "colder, hyper-rational branch of thought" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. It asserts that there is no truth or meaning in the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. Even human-constructed meanings like freedom, love, hope, and joy are regarded as mere myths to cope with the "empty void at the center of our reality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. For the [[cosmic_nihilism_and_its_depiction_in_rick_and_morty | cosmic nihilist]], constructed meanings are, at best, fables or coping mechanisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.

### Friedrich Nietzsche

Although not a [[cosmic_nihilism_and_its_depiction_in_rick_and_morty | cosmic nihilist]] himself, Friedrich Nietzsche is considered the spiritual forefather of this position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. His famous phrase, "God is dead," is often misunderstood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>. [[cosmic_nihilism_and_its_depiction_in_rick_and_morty | Cosmic nihilism]] is not a value judgment about reality or a counter-ethics to religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. Unlike Nietzschean [[the_philosophy_of_nihilism_and_existentialism | nihilism]], [[cosmic_nihilism_and_its_depiction_in_rick_and_morty | cosmic nihilism]] adopts a colder, more rationalist approach to meaning, asserting that existence has no inherent value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.

### Patricia and Paul Churchland (Eliminative Materialism)

One contemporary school of thought, eliminative materialism, aligns with [[cosmic_nihilism_and_its_depiction_in_rick_and_morty | cosmic nihilism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. Championed by Patricia and Paul Churchland, this position argues that many common-sense attitudes inherited from modern psychology should be replaced by more scientific and empirical notions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>. They believe that concepts like love should be dismissed as "folk psychology," being merely descriptions of chemical processes in the brain reacting to stimuli <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.

### Thomas Metzinger

Thomas Metzinger is another contemporary philosopher whose ideas resonate with [[cosmic_nihilism_and_its_depiction_in_rick_and_morty | cosmic nihilism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>. Metzinger contends that no such thing as a "human self" has ever existed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>. Instead, he argues that humans are merely a jumbled network of neurons and chemicals, and the "self" is a useful fantasy or "psychological fairytale" used to make sense of our experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. If Metzinger is correct, humanity must abandon the illusion of any real purpose or a special, unique soul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. This rejection of the self makes [[cosmic_nihilism_and_its_depiction_in_rick_and_morty | cosmic nihilism]] less inclined towards ethics than [[existential_nihilism_through_bojack_horseman | existential nihilism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>. The freedom celebrated by [[existentialism_and_jean_paul_sartres_philosophy | existentialists]] becomes just another illusion, leaving nothing to ground an ethical system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>; the only certainty is destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>.

## Navigating a Meaningless World

Exploring [[philosophical_influences_in_media | philosophical influences in media]] like *Rick and Morty* and *BoJack Horseman* can offer insights into the practical ramifications of [[the_philosophy_of_nihilism_and_existentialism | nihilism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>. Neither [[existential_nihilism_through_bojack_horseman | existential nihilism]] nor [[cosmic_nihilism_and_its_depiction_in_rick_and_morty | cosmic nihilism]] advocates for complete surrender, but rather provides different approaches to moving forward in a largely uncertain world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>.

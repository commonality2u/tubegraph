The world is currently experiencing a "crisis of knowing," marked by a rapid erosion of trust in experts, including scientists, physicians, and government agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This phenomenon is highlighted by the growing number of Flat Earthers on YouTube and social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. While their beliefs may seem absurd, they point to a larger societal problem caused by a widespread lack of understanding about how science operates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. This issue goes beyond simply not remembering scientific laws; it pertains to the very [[philosophy_of_science_and_verificationism_vs_falsificationism | philosophy of science]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

## The [[philosophy_of_science_and_verificationism_vs_falsificationism | Philosophy of Science]]

The [[philosophy_of_science_and_verificationism_vs_falsificationism | philosophy of science]] explores fundamental questions such as how to distinguish science from non-science, how to weigh evidence when testing hypotheses, and what constitutes acceptable evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. While the scientific method is a component, it only scratches the surface of these philosophical considerations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. There are various philosophies of science, each with its own strengths and weaknesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. A general ignorance of how science works allows for the misuse of scientific language, as seen in Flat Earth arguments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

### Models of Scientific Inquiry

Understanding different models of scientific inquiry helps explain how people can manipulate the language of science and evidence.

#### Verificationism

In the early 1900s, logical positivists proposed **verificationism**, a doctrine stating that science must be verifiable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. If a statement cannot be verified, it is not considered science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. For example, the statement "this swan is white" can be verified by sensory observation replicated by others, making it a meaningful scientific statement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. In this model, verifying the Earth's shape could involve observing it from space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. Flat Earthers sometimes allude to this idea, questioning direct, individual verification of the Earth's roundness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.

However, verificationism faced a significant challenge with **universal statements**, such as "all swans are white" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. Even after observing thousands of white swans, one can never truly verify that *all* swans are white <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. This problem was starkly illustrated by the discovery of black swans in Australia in the 1690s, disproving a long-held European belief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. Applying this doctrine strictly, demanding individual verification for all scientific facts, would be extremely limiting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

#### Falsificationism

Philosopher Karl Popper proposed **falsificationism** as a solution to the crisis of verificationism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. For Popper, good science involves developing a hypothesis and then rigorously attempting to prove it wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. If a hypothesis cannot be theoretically falsified, it is not considered science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. For example, if one hypothesizes the Earth is flat, a good falsificationist would design experiments to prove it is *not* flat, and if successful, abandon the flat Earth hypothesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. Importantly, proving something is not flat does not inherently prove it is round, and vice-versa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

While Flat Earthers claim to "test everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>, their approach often falls short of true falsificationism for two main reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>:
1.  **Their evidence is often flawed** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.
2.  **They focus on disproving others rather than attempting to falsify their own theories** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.

For many anti-vaxxers, Flat Earthers, and creationists, there is often no amount of evidence that would lead them to renounce their theories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. When Flat Earthers' own experiments, like a laser gyroscope or flashlight test, yield results that suggest the Earth is *not* flat, they don't abandon their hypothesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. Instead, they might attribute contradictory results to "heavenly energies" or other unverified reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

#### Paradigms and Paradigm Shifts

A compelling criticism of falsificationism is that tests and hypotheses do not exist in vacuums; they are part of larger, systematized theories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. Physicist Thomas Kuhn proposed that science operates within **paradigms** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. In this view, a scientific model (like Newton's physics) is not simply abandoned when contradictory evidence appears (e.g., Mercury's orbit) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. Instead, scientists might tweak the existing model as long as it remains largely predictive and useful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.

A complete overhaul, or **paradigm shift**, only occurs when a new, more comprehensive paradigm emerges (like Einstein's relativity) that can explain anomalies and perform everything the old model could, but better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. For example, Einstein's model accounted for Mercury's orbit and other phenomena while retaining Newton's predictive power for everyday situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>.

Flat Earthers, in a "perverse way," operate similarly to how scientists might tweak a paradigm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. When faced with contradictory evidence, they tweak their model by introducing new concepts like "heavenly energies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>. However, this does not make them scientists, as these "tweaks" themselves must also be subjected to experimentation and require evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. Unlike a true paradigm shift, the Flat Earth model cannot facilitate building bridges, global positioning systems, airplane navigation, or any of the thousands of technologies predicated on a round Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>.

## The Nature of Evidence

The quality and interpretation of evidence are crucial in scientific inquiry.

### Good vs. Bad Evidence

Experimental design in science is exceptionally challenging, particularly in controlling **confounding variables** – external factors that can distort results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. The Bedford Level Experiment, a "darling experiment for Flat Earthers," claimed to disprove the round Earth because a boat did not dip below the horizon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. However, this experiment failed to account for atmospheric refraction, a confounding variable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. When Alfred Russel Wallace designed a new experiment controlling for refraction, it provided evidence that the Earth was round <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.

### The Burden of Proof

In science, the burden of proof rests on the individual proposing a hypothesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>. However, modern debates, especially online, are plagued by a tactic called "JAQing off" (Just Asking Questions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>. This involves flooding a discussion with numerous questions, shifting the burden of proof onto the respondent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>. For instance, asking "Why aren’t oil companies drilling in Antarctica?" takes seconds to pose but minutes to adequately answer, explaining treaties and environmental concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>. Similarly, questions about flight patterns can be answered by explaining map distortions or practical logistics like demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>.

These questions are not meant to foster consensus or collaborative problem-solving; instead, they aim to "prove" a flat Earth by casting doubt on the round Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:08">[00:18:08]</a>. Unanswered questions can misleadingly appear as if the responder is wrong or hiding something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>.

## [[challenges_in_public_understanding_of_science | Challenges in Public Understanding of Science]]

The persistence of Flat Earth and similar [[conspiracy_theories_and_societal_trust_in_experts | conspiracy theories]] highlights a larger crisis of trust in society and the erosion of faith in all forms of expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>. Some psychologists suggest that [[conspiracy_theories_and_societal_trust_in_experts | conspiracy theories]] appeal to individuals who feel powerless or insignificant, offering a sense of control and predictability in a chaotic world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>. The appeal of Flat Earth, for instance, may stem from the desire to believe in a special, central terrarium rather than a tiny blue marble adrift in the cosmos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>.

However, this kind of conspiratorial thinking is not harmless; it can lead to dangerous outcomes, such as the resurgence of almost extinct diseases due to anti-vaccine sentiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>. Instead of blindly trusting scientific authorities, it is vital to understand the conventions and practices that lead to scientific conclusions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>. This involves asking critical questions about experimental design, confidence levels in predictions, and whether contrary evidence truly debunks a model or is an expected part of studying complex phenomena like quantum physics or climate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>. Understanding how science is done, how scientific consensus is reached, and how to critically evaluate poorly conducted science is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>.

[[analysis_of_the_purge_movie_themes | A focal point]] of the film *The Purge* is America's issues with [[critique_of_societal_systems_in_the_purge | social stratification]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. The film functions as [[the_purge_as_social_commentary | social commentary]], highlighting how policies can appear neutral while having disparate impacts on different societal groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

## Disproportionate Impact on the Disenfranchised
Although the Purge laws are presented as ostensibly race and class neutral, they are shown to disproportionately target the disenfranchised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. Those who are unable to afford high-end security systems, such as "diamond-edged blades" or "truffle-infused security systems," are left vulnerable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

The film portrays the wealthier elite as antagonists dressed in prep school attire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. They view the hunting of a homeless Black "non-contributor" as merely another extracurricular activity for their college applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. This portrayal underscores a chilling indifference to the lives of the less fortunate, framing their victimhood as a sport or a means to an end for the privileged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

## Allegory to Real-World Inequality
This imbalance depicted in *The Purge* echoes historical instances of [[social_inequality_and_its_depiction_in_the_dark_knight_rises | social inequality]], such as the War on Drugs in the 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. During that period, laws were passed that imposed sentences 100 times harsher for crack cocaine—a drug prevalent in poor Black communities—compared to its powder-based counterpart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. This parallel suggests that, much like these laws, the Purge's true purpose might be economic rather than merely crime reduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.

Despite claims within the film that "crime is down" and "the economy is flourishing" due to the Purge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>, the film prompts viewers to question whether the Purge is "really about money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>, implying a cynical [[allegory_of_class_struggle_and_modern_society | allegory of class struggle]] and the [[the_politics_of_disposability_and_class_struggle | politics of disposability]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.

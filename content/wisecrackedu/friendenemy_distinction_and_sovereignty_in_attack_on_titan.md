The anime series *Attack on Titan* explores complex themes, including the visceral reality of death, societal structures, and political ideologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>. While Titans are often seen as the physical [[personification_of_death_in_titans | personification of death]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>, the darkest element of the series lies in the construction of the society behind the walls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>. This quasi-Germanic society, with its architecture, war cries, and character names, draws parallels to German history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>.

Upon closer inspection, the political ideology of this society aligns with the beliefs of [[carl_schmitts_influence_and_theory_in_attack_on_titan | Carl Schmitt]], a notorious Nazi philosopher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>. While Schmitt himself was a "card-carrying Nazi" and unrepentant to the end, *Attack on Titan* can be understood as an exploration of his ideas, not an endorsement of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. The show is provocative because it presents a society maintaining stability while reflecting Nazi ideology in the face of a horrific enemy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>. It dares to ask if such a controversial philosophy might be the only thing preventing societal collapse in this dystopian setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>.

Central to [[carl_schmitts_influence_and_theory_in_attack_on_titan | Schmitt's philosophy]] and *Attack on Titan*'s civilization is "the political," which requires three concepts for a stable society: conflict and inequality, clear distinctions between friends and enemies, and sovereignty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>.

## Friend-Enemy Distinction

[[carl_schmitts_influence_and_theory_in_attack_on_titan | Carl Schmitt's philosophy]] posits that conflict, division, and inequality are inevitable among humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>. He views humanity's basic nature as savage, believing that people are essentially "shitty" and life is unfair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>. This constant struggle is in line with Thomas Hobbes's view that humans are "monsters at heart" and social structures are necessary to control them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>. Schmitt takes this further, asserting that hostility is unavoidable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>.

According to Schmitt, attempting to eliminate antagonism or inequality is futile because they will always exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>. Instead, a strong sovereign should focus on maintaining order and control, as social issues like inequality are distractions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>. In *Attack on Titan*, severe inequality is depicted through literal walls separating classes and caste systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>. Alleviating inequality is depicted as less important than nationalism and survival, which becomes overtly apparent in the nationalistic propaganda of the first season's theme song <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>.

The second element of [[carl_schmitts_influence_and_theory_in_attack_on_titan | Schmitt's political theory]] is the necessity of a clear distinction between friend and enemy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>. Good governments, he argued, require an enemy to struggle against without completely dominating them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>.

### Titans as the Enemy

The Titans provide this clear enemy in *Attack on Titan*, acting as a check against total conquest beyond the wall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>. Without such an enemy, human nature would lead to an "unending civil war" of "war crimes, dehumanization, and the eradication of your own people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a>. The existence of a clear enemy impedes infighting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>.

Both Commander Erwin Smith and Dot Pixis are concerned with this friend-enemy distinction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>. Pixis explicitly states the necessity of the Titans as the enemy:

> "If our common enemy disappeared, we'd eventually find a way to start killing each other over something else. As long as there's a huge, insurmountable threat like the Titans, humanity will have no choice but to lay aside its differences and fight together." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:12:00">[06:12:00]</a>

Erwin and Pixis worry that humanity itself is the real threat, and the Titans merely keep people in line by providing a common goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>. This raises the possibility that the Titans could be tools of the elite to control the population, or even a "government-fabricated enemy"â€”a "Schmitt-ean wet dream" of an intelligent, strong enemy to prevent human infighting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a>. In this interpretation, Titans could be seen as an allegory for the perfect scapegoat, mobilizing the population and empowering those in control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:43:00">[07:43:00]</a>.

The theme of freedom in the show, embodied by the Scouts' "wings of freedom" badge and Eren and Armin's desire for a life beyond the walls, also reflects Schmitt's friend-enemy distinction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:00">[07:54:00]</a>. For Schmitt, freedom and community are defined by denying cowardice in the face of impending death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a>. Joining the Scouts becomes a liberation from the fear of waiting to die inside the walls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29:00">[08:29:00]</a>.

This desire to join the Scouts creates a political community for Eren's class, where life finds purpose on the battlefield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:43:00">[08:43:00]</a>. [[carl_schmitts_influence_and_theory_in_attack_on_titan | Schmitt defines a political community]] by the ability to kill enemies for friends or die at enemies' hands for friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:59:00">[08:59:00]</a>. The Scouts, risking their lives, embody this, similar to the soldiers in Alfred Lord Tennyson's "The Charge of the Light Brigade" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:00">[09:07:00]</a>. This camaraderie and political community binds humanity's remnants together, preventing them from tearing themselves apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:31:00">[09:31:00]</a>.

However, the friend-enemy distinction blurs as the show progresses, particularly with Eren and Annie being Titans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:39:00">[09:39:00]</a>. This erosion of clear lines between foreign enemy and domestic friend is highlighted when Eren partially transforms to save Mikasa and Armin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:43:00">[09:43:00]</a>. When the division between human and Titan blurs, the task of protecting the population becomes almost impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:00">[10:00:00]</a>.

## Sovereignty

The final element of [[carl_schmitts_influence_and_theory_in_attack_on_titan | Schmitt's political theory]] is the power of the sovereign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:12:00">[10:12:00]</a>. Sovereign entities can declare states of emergency, justifying the sacrifice of populations for the greater good, such as sending a battalion to reclaim Wall Maria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:17:00">[10:17:00]</a>. This ability is crucial for long-term societal stability, preventing political bickering from hindering efforts to combat existential threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:40:00">[10:40:00]</a>. The sovereign can also make legal exceptions, like granting special citizen status to those living inside Wall Sina <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:52:00">[10:52:00]</a>.

In *Attack on Titan*, the leadership structure appears to be based on martial law and military rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:59:00">[10:59:00]</a>. Premiere Dhalis Zachary leads the military tribunal with the power to execute Eren <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:09:00">[11:09:00]</a>. The leaders are shown sending millions to their deaths to ensure the safety of the remaining population within the walls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:29:00">[11:29:00]</a>. Pixis reveals that the attempt to retake Wall Maria was a "thinly disguised purge" to ease the stress from the massive influx of refugees, effectively a decision to kill part of the population for the greater good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:36:00">[11:36:00]</a>. As twisted as it sounds, for Schmitt, the sovereign must maintain this ability to commit even the most horrendous acts to maintain order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:58:00">[11:58:00]</a>.

## Implications and Future

The series prompts contemplation: what would happen if all the Titans suddenly disappeared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:07:00">[12:07:00]</a>? Would society devolve into anarchy or a civil war more brutal than Titan attacks, or would it lead to liberation and greater peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:14:00">[12:14:00]</a>? For Schmitt, eradicating one enemy is not a solution, as there is an inherent drive for warfare, and another enemy will always emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:26:00">[12:26:00]</a>. Without an external foe, humanity would eventually turn on itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:34:00">[12:34:00]</a>.

While [[carl_schmitts_influence_and_theory_in_attack_on_titan | Schmitt's work]] is debated in academia for its redeemability and use in understanding international conflict, executive power, and even contemporary issues like the "War on Terror," *Attack on Titan* has the potential to either become a scathing criticism of his politics or simply complicate them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:40:00">[12:40:00]</a>.

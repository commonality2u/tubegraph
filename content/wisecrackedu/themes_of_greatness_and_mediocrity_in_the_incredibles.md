[[the_incredibles_plot_summary | *The Incredibles*]], a Pixar film, explores how humanity reacts to individuals who exhibit qualities of greatness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. The movie presents a world where exceptional abilities are not celebrated but rather suppressed, leading to a critique of societal expectations and the value placed on mediocrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

## The Suppression of Greatness

The film begins fifteen years after all superpowered humans were forced into hiding by lawyers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. The "Supers" are compelled to conceal and suppress their abilities to avoid persecution by a society of "inferior beings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. This societal pressure is articulated by Helen Incredible:

> "Right now, honey, the world just wants us to fit in, and to fit in, we've just gotta be like everybody else." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>

This behavior is presented as an illustration of German philosopher Freddy Nietzchmeister's concept of "herd morality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

### Herd Morality

The concept of herd morality suggests that society demonizes and inhibits the exceptional in favor of appeasing the "basic bitches" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. The Incredibles observe with frustration as society rewards non-achievements, such as celebrating a child moving from fourth to fifth grade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. They lament how society creates new ways to celebrate mediocrity while dismissing genuine exceptionalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. This perspective is reinforced by the insistence that "everyone's special," which Dash astutely notes is "another way of saying no one is" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

## The Cost of Forced Equality

Such forced equality exacts a significant psychological toll on exceptional individuals and ultimately harms society at large <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. An example of this is seen when young Buddy, an ordinary person, interferes with Mr. Incredible's attempt to capture Bomb Voyage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. This interference allows the culprit to escape and nearly results in the death of a train full of "normies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. The film suggests that this outcome is a consequence of "mediocrity get[ting] in the way of excellence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

## Manufactured vs. Innate Greatness

The character of Buddy, who later becomes Syndrome, initially suggests that ordinary people can achieve greatness through grit, determination, and technological innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. Syndrome builds an empire of technological innovation, rising from humble beginnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. However, the film quickly demonstrates that Syndrome's "manufactured greatness" is inferior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. When his robot goes out of control, it is the Incredibles, whose superpowers are natural and "without the indignity of effort," who must save the day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

The movie posits that greatness cannot be merely aspired to; one must be born with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. This is emphasized by the line, "You'll know what to do. It's in your blood" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.

## The Triumph of Natural Greatness

Ultimately, [[family_dynamics_in_the_incredibles | *The Incredibles*]] teaches that great people deserve great things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. The Supers reclaim their "rightful place at the top of the societal food chain by virtue of their god-given gifts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. This is exemplified by Dash being allowed to dominate his school athletic program, provided he isn't too obvious with his "cheating" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. Violet, too, benefits, immediately attracting the "dreamiest boy on campus" after a new haircut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

In contrast, Buddy, the "poor, confused boy who was just fighting for equality in a world of superheroes," is ultimately murdered by the Incredibles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

The film series *The Purge*, while appearing as typical horror fare with a concept where "any and all crime will be legal for 12 continuous hours" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>, questionable acting, and violent carnage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>, is more profoundly a commentary on contemporary sociopolitical existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>. It functions as a thinly veiled [[allegory_of_class_struggle_and_modern_society|allegory of class struggle and modern society]] for America's corrupt politics, rigged economic systems, and culture of violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>.

## The Purge as Social Commentary

*The Purge* shares conceptual similarities with ritualistic festivals such as Mardi Gras, Carnival, or Halloween, where social norms can be violated during designated times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a>. However, rather than undermining the power of law and religion, these events, including The Purge, actually reaffirm social structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>. The New Founding Fathers of America (NFFA), who sanction The Purge, are not challenged by the chaos; instead, the aftermath leaves people longing for the return of law and order, akin to a "Purge hangover" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>. The Purge serves to make people accept the tenets of the ruling social ideology, which is best described as [[neoliberalism_and_economic_inequality|neoliberalism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>.

## [[neoliberalism_and_economic_inequality|Neoliberalism]] and Economic Class

At its core, [[neoliberalism_and_economic_inequality|neoliberalism]] suggests that government should primarily craft policies that promote the free flow of goods and protect corporate interests, with minimal market intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>. Each *Purge* film illustrates different facets of the [[neoliberalism_and_economic_inequality|neoliberal]] economy, highlighting how characters' economic classes influence their experience of the event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.

### Class-Based Experiences of The Purge

*   **The Original Purge**: Focuses on an upper-middle-class suburban family, the Sandins, whose "burb" problems include a homeless person infiltrating their gated community and jealous neighbors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>. For them, violence against the poor is an unacceptable intrusion into their neighborhood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>.
*   **The Purge: Anarchy**: Shifts to the economic struggles of a working-class family, such as Eva Sanchez, who cannot afford medicine for her father <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>. The inner city is depicted as rife with Purge traps, gangs, and abductions, serving as a metaphor for "white flight" and the disproportionate exposure of those left behind to crime, homelessness, and poverty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.
*   **The Purge: Election Year**: Explores the impact on small business owners, exemplified by Joe, whose Purge insurance premiums are inexplicably raised, leaving him without coverage due to a lack of government oversight on insurance companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>.

Collectively, these examples reveal the injustices of The Purge and the broader economic system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>. Those who benefit from [[neoliberalism_and_economic_inequality|neoliberalism]] also profit from The Purge, while those disadvantaged by it suffer further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>. The Sandins, for instance, fund their lavish home through security systems sold based on Purge-induced fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>, whereas working-class individuals like Eva Sanchez and Joe face inadequate protection due to financial constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>.

## The Politics of Disposability

The Purge exposes how [[neoliberalism_and_economic_inequality|neoliberal]] economics fosters a [[the_politics_of_disposability_and_class_struggle|politics of disposability]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>. This concept, explained by thinkers Henry Giroux and Brad Evans, suggests that suburbanites come to view entire groups of people as superfluous and disposable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>. In *The Original Purge*, a bloody stranger is dehumanized as "swine" and "filth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>. James Sandin initially justifies incapacitating him as a means to save his family, only recognizing him as fully human when the stranger volunteers to sacrifice himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:23:00">[05:23:00]</a>.

In *The Purge: Anarchy*, the unchecked cost of medication leads Papa Sanchez to "sell" his life to the rich to ease his family's economic hardship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:38:00">[05:38:00]</a>. His life, as a disposable object, becomes more valuable to his family when exchanged for money than as an actual person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>. The wealthy "Purge" by buying and killing poor and sick individuals in their homes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>. Rick from *Rick and Morty* similarly highlights how the privileged subject the poor to inhuman conditions because they believe it will never harm them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:00">[06:06:00]</a>.

### [[neoliberalism_and_economic_inequality|Neoliberalism]]'s Justification for Disposability

Giroux and Evans argue that people become disposable under an economic system characterized by privatization of healthcare, deregulation of banks, and the erosion of government safety nets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>. As stated in the films, the NFFA legalizes murder to decrease the poor population, thereby reducing government spending on welfare, healthcare, and housing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:34:00">[06:34:00]</a>. The closure of medical and police services during The Purge reflects extreme laxity in government policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48:00">[06:48:00]</a>.

This [[the_politics_of_disposability_and_class_struggle|politics of disposability]] is justified under the banner of economic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:00">[06:55:00]</a>. The elderly, infirm, poor, and "non-contributors" are sacrificed to allow the economy to grow unhindered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:02:00">[07:02:00]</a>. This "elimination" of the population mirrors real-world [[neoliberalism_and_economic_inequality|neoliberal]] economics, where populations are exposed to "slow death" through inability to afford medicine, poor diet, and environmental pollution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:15:00">[07:15:00]</a>. Rather than actively purging, the system simply "lets them die" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>.

### Historical Roots of Disposability

This justification for The Purge echoes the ideas of Reverend Thomas Robert Malthus from his 1798 book "Essay on the Principle of Population" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41:00">[07:41:00]</a>. Malthus argued that growing populations would outpace food production, leading to shortages, and proposed laws to keep birth rates low and death rates high through famine, disease, and wars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>. Caleb Warrens, head of the NFFA, echoes this sentiment in *The Purge: Election Year*, stating that not everyone can "HAVE" because there's "NOT enough to go around" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10:00">[08:10:00]</a>.

However, Friedrich Engels countered Malthus, arguing that the issue is not increasing population but an economic system that undervalues workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:00">[08:27:00]</a>. Engels believed Malthus's model was merely an excuse to mistreat poor people by prioritizing economics over human well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:38:00">[08:38:00]</a>. The NFFA, with their elaborate Purge ceremonies, take this "being a dick to poor people" to an extreme level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:46:00">[08:46:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

The brilliance of *The Purge* lies in its ability to viscerally expose how a [[neoliberalism_and_economic_inequality|neoliberal]] economy generates profit in a predatory manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:04:00">[09:04:00]</a>. The privileged amass wealth through weapon sales, insurance, private bodyguards, and home security systems, while the poor must fight simply to survive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:18:00">[09:18:00]</a>.

While *The Purge* movies depict a near-future dystopia, the episode of *Rick and Morty* that parodies The Purge offers a self-reflexive "[[metacommentary_on_change_and_gentrification|metacommentary]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:00">[09:37:00]</a>. Rick's perverse enjoyment of the violence reflects on the audience's own complicity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:40:00">[09:40:00]</a>. The success of *The Purge* films might reveal that audiences, like "murder tourists," enjoy the shocking and new violent content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:01:00">[10:01:00]</a>, suggesting a societal fascination with watching violent acts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:19:00">[10:19:00]</a>.

Alan Moore, author of acclaimed comics like *Watchmen*, *Miracleman*, and *The Killing Joke*, identifies as a ritual magician [00:00:09][00:00:32]. His concept of magic is not about pulling rabbits from hats, but a more profound, [[Philosophy and Magic of Alan Moore | Steven Strange-esque]] approach involving grimoires and conjuring [00:00:37]. While seemingly eccentric, Moore's views on magic are rooted in a fascinating philosophy [00:00:43][00:00:51].

## The Foundation: Hermeticism

Moore is a student of Hermeticism, which is less a religion and more a collection of interconnected practices and principles [00:02:24]. Its primary goal is to achieve understanding of the world through three methods [00:02:32]:
*   [[Alchemy as science and its moral implications | Alchemy]] [00:02:36]
*   Astrology [00:02:36]
*   Theurgy [00:02:36]

Theurgy, the third method, is defined as the process of attaining spiritual perfection with the aim of drawing closer to God [00:02:38][00:02:43].

Hermeticism's teachings are largely based on the *Corpus Hermeticum*, attributed to the mythical Hermes Trismegistus [00:02:48]. This figure is a syncretic blend of the Greek god Hermes and the Egyptian god Thoth, both associated with language and wisdom [00:02:53]. For Moore, this fusion of language and understanding forms the essence of magic [00:03:00].

## Alan Moore's Philosophy of Magic

Moore defines magic as "a purposeful engagement with the phenomena and possibilities of consciousness" [00:03:05][00:03:09]. He posits that reality is composed of two categories: the material and the immaterial [00:03:16][00:03:21].

*   **Material:** This encompasses physical aspects like matter, energy, space, time, and fundamental forces [00:03:23]. We do not experience these directly; rather, our brains construct a mental model of the external world based on limited sensory information [00:03:30][00:03:33][00:03:38][00:03:42].
*   **Immaterial:** This is our internal mental model of reality [00:03:45].

Moore illustrates the interaction between these two realms through his work, *Watchmen* [00:03:48][00:03:53]. His initial intangible idea for the story gained tangible form when artist Dave Gibbons actualized it through penciled panels, showing how an "intangible thought had a tangible effect on the arrangement of the atoms that became Watchmen" [00:03:55][00:03:59][00:04:04]. Conversely, a physical sound (like Moore's voice) can alter perception and conjure images in the mind, effectively casting a "genuine spell" [00:04:12][00:04:24].

For Moore, magic is simply the bridge between the material and the immaterial [00:04:28][00:04:31]. Art, language, and symbols are the "real wizard's wands" [00:04:34]. He states, "magic is intrinsically connected with art, language and consciousness to the point where these four things almost become different aspects of the same phenomenon" [00:04:38][00:04:47].

This concept is akin to the rabbit-duck illusion, where initial perception isn't fixed, and a change in information ("it's also a rabbit") can instantly alter how something is seen [00:04:47][00:05:00][00:05:05]. Storytelling, in this sense, is "spell-craft" [00:05:06]. Just as it can create illusions, it can also dispel them [00:05:08].

### Transforming Perception: Money and Demons

Moore, as an anarchist, views money as one of the most destructive illusions influencing human collective consciousness [00:05:14][00:05:19]. In *Miracleman*, when the titular character seeks to create a utopia, he abolishes money, declaring it an "empty promise" and "imaginary" [00:05:21][00:05:25][00:05:29][00:05:33][00:05:35][00:05:40][00:05:43][00:05:46].

A similar transformation through altered perception is central to *Promethea* [00:05:51][00:05:54]. In a rematch with the demon-king Asmodeus, protagonist Sophie and her allies initially approach him with anger [00:05:59][00:06:00]. However, once they accept that "so-called demons are just a part of human-nature – the worst parts," Asmodeus's appearance shifts to human [00:06:05][00:06:10]. As Asmodeus explains: "Approach us with fear, with hatred and revulsion, and we will be fearsome, hateful, and vile. Approach us humanely and with respect, and we will be human and respectable" [00:06:13][00:06:18][00:06:20][00:06:23]. This illustrates the principle that for the magician, "expectation creates perspective" [00:06:24].

Even Doctor Manhattan in *Watchmen* functions as a magician in this context [00:06:28][00:06:31]. His external appearance as an "ageless aquamarine Adonis with alopecia" is a manifestation of how he internally perceives himself [00:06:31][00:06:37].

## Hermetic Principles in Alan Moore's Work

If a compelling story can "magically" change our perception of a single phenomenon, Moore explores what happens if a story attempts to account for *all* phenomena [00:06:39][00:06:44][00:06:49]. This is precisely what he does in *Promethea*, crafting "a story about everything as a spell to change our perceptions about everything" [00:06:51][00:06:56].

### Macrocosm and Microcosm: "As Above, So Below"

One of Hermeticism's most famous principles is "macrocosm and microcosm," expressed in the maxim "As above, so below" [00:07:04][00:07:09][00:07:10]. This principle suggests that every level of reality reflects every other, like an infinite fractal [00:07:15]. Understanding one part of the pattern allows for a better understanding of the whole, enabling movement from lower to higher levels of understanding [00:07:27][00:07:32][00:07:35].

In *Promethea*, the series' structure is deliberately based on a repeating pattern found at both macrocosmic (entirety of existence) and microcosmic (individual soul) levels: The Kabbalah's Tree of Life [00:07:35][00:07:40][00:07:46]. For Moore, the Tree of Life serves as a "roadmap to all reality, including our inner lives" [00:07:50][00:07:54].

The Tree's rungs correspond to different capacities:
*   **Bottom:** Mere perception (rabbit or duck) [00:07:55][00:08:00].
*   **Above that:** Imagination, the ability to form mental models of things not directly sensed [00:08:00][00:08:04].
*   **Next:** Capacity for art and language, linking ideas to sounds, symbols, pictures, and stories [00:08:06][00:08:12].
*   **Top:** Capacities for emotion and reason [00:08:13][00:08:17].

At a macroscopic level, the physical universe represents the "basest sphere of the world's soul," followed by everyone's collective unconscious, and at the very top, what early Hermeticists called "the All. The One. God." [00:08:17][00:08:23][00:08:25][00:08:31].

The series *Promethea* consists of thirty-two issues, correlating to the ten Spheres and twenty-two Paths of The Tree of Life [00:08:31][00:08:35]. The story concludes at issue 31, but Moore wrote a thirty-second issue, which itself was thirty-two pages long, with each page expounding upon one of the Paths [00:08:38][00:08:45]. This design makes the final issue a deliberate microcosm of the series, and the series a macrocosm of the issue, exemplifying "As above, so below" [00:08:48][00:08:53][00:08:55].

### Solve et Coagula: "Separate and Combine"

Another Hermetic principle utilized by Moore is "Solve et Coagula," meaning "Separate and Combine" [00:08:57][00:09:03]. This involves breaking something down into its constituent parts to better understand how the whole functions [00:09:03][00:09:09].

Doctor Manhattan's arc in *Watchmen* illustrates this principle [00:09:09][00:09:14]. Initially, he demonstrates an understanding of the "separate" aspect, detaching from humanity by mentally reducing individuals to their base components [00:09:14][00:09:20][00:09:24]. His breakthrough on Mars is learning not only to break humans down into abstract arrangements of atoms but also to conceptually "recombine and perceive them as holistic four-dimensional objects" [00:09:27][00:09:32][00:09:40][00:09:46].

*Solve et Coagula* is also evident in *Promethea*'s sixth issue [00:09:46][00:09:51]. Sophie defeats the writer Marto Neptura, a pseudonym for the collective writers of the Promethea character, by understanding that "Neptura was the collective pen name of various novelists cut down to his separate unique styles" [00:09:51][00:09:56][00:09:59][00:10:04][00:10:10].

## The Apocalypse and the Leap to Consciousness

Moore believes that if a sufficiently complete story can change the perception of an entire species, then when everyone's way of viewing the world ends, "the World ends" [00:10:13][00:10:18][00:10:24][00:10:29]. In *Promethea*, Sophie accomplishes this "Apocalypse" by explaining the Hermetic principles to everyone, leading them to perceive the immaterial and material worlds as equally "real" [00:10:29][00:11:48][00:11:52].

Moore believes that humanity's ideas about the world began with a similar "leap from matter to mind" [00:10:58][00:11:02]. He argues that representation led to verbal language, where sounds or marks symbolized external objects (like a buffalo) [00:11:02][00:11:08][00:11:13]. This "purposeful engagement with the phenomena and possibilities of consciousness" then spawned human culture, including writing, painting, music, science, medicine, and politics [00:11:17][00:11:22][00:11:27][00:11:33]. Thus, the world, as we know it, can also end in the same way it began [00:11:33][00:11:39].

Moore contemplated how our world would end similarly [00:11:52][00:11:56]. In *Promethea*'s twelfth issue, he uses Tarot to trace world history from the Big Bang to a coming "leap to expanded consciousness" [00:12:00][00:12:04][00:12:09]. Writing in 1999, Moore predicted the end of the world as we know it in 2017, when the rate of knowledge doubling would accelerate so rapidly that old ways of understanding would be insufficient, necessitating new ones [00:12:12][00:12:20][00:12:25][00:12:31][00:12:35][00:12:41].

Although 2017 passed without a literal apocalypse, Moore himself attempted to "herald the Apocalypse at the hour he'd appointed" [00:12:41][00:12:47][00:12:51]. In September 2016, he released his magnum opus, *Jerusalem*, viewing it as a "ritual he performed to bring about world-wide Revelation" [00:12:55][00:13:02][00:13:07]. He described *Jerusalem* as his "most sophisticated and complex magical working thus far, and certainly the most ambitious in its aims," intended to have a "certain (hopefully beneficial) effect upon the consciousness of its readership" [00:13:11][00:13:16][00:13:21][00:13:24][00:13:30][00:13:32].

### Redefining Sanity and Perception

Moore writes to induce higher states of consciousness in the reader, mirroring the narrative's themes [00:13:36][00:13:41]. This is akin to the Heptapods' language in *Arrival* affecting Lois Lane's perception of time [00:13:41][00:13:46].

A chapter in *Jerusalem* told from Lucia Joyce's perspective during her asylum confinement demonstrates this, employing a linguistic style (puns, portmanteaus, neologisms) similar to her father's *Finnegans Wake* to replicate her condition [00:13:50][00:13:54][00:13:56][00:13:58][00:14:00][00:14:05]. Moore explores the idea that certain forms of "insanity" might actually bring individuals closer to perceiving external reality than those deemed "sane" [00:14:05][00:14:10].

In *Watchmen*, Doctor Manhattan perceives every moment of his life simultaneously, a perception vastly different from "sane" individuals [00:14:14][00:14:20]. Moore, like Einstein, considers time a "stubbornly persistent illusion" [00:14:23][00:14:27]. Thus, Manhattan's immunity to this "delusion of time" makes him more sane, not less; humanity is deficient for perceiving only the present, rather than gazing upon the past, present, and future as a three-dimensional plane [00:14:28][00:14:34][00:14:39].

### Linguistic Magic: Solving and Coagulating Language

To habituate readers to perceiving dimensions not initially apparent, Moore applies "Solve et Coagula" to language itself in *Jerusalem* [00:14:42][00:14:47][00:14:52]. He separates phonetics (how spoken words sound) from graphetics (how written words appear) [00:14:52][00:14:57]. Moore writes dialogue that appears as "gibberish" but makes phonetic sense when read aloud, forcing the reader to interpret multiple layers of meaning [00:15:00][00:15:06][00:15:10].

> [!EXAMPLE]
> In one instance, text is written such that when read aloud, it phonetically states: "Her father, in his time, maintains that we are in a universe composed of four dimensions, only three of which are naturally visible" [00:15:10][00:15:15][00:15:21]. However, this "gibberish" is laden with double-entendres, with spellings resembling words like "dementia" (from "dimension") or "loony" (from "universe") [00:15:21][00:15:29][00:15:34][00:15:39].

Moore's technique teaches readers to engage with more textual dimensions, mirroring the universe's own multiple dimensions [00:15:39][00:15:44]. This is both an explanation and an example, magically altering how our minds model the world by changing the language through which that model is constructed [00:15:47][00:15:53][00:15:58].

## Is Magic Real?

While Moore's grand revelation for 2017 might not have fully materialized, his influence as the most impactful writer in comic history is likely to endure for centuries [00:15:58][00:16:03][00:16:07][00:16:11][00:16:16][00:16:21].

Moore suggests that if his philosophy is correct, magic is "at least as real as our imagination" [00:16:23][00:16:25][00:16:29]. The "Revelation" that concludes *Promethea* speaks directly to the reader, emphasizing the tangible power of imagination [00:16:29][00:16:34]:

> [!QUOTE] Promethea
> "I’m an idea, but I’m a real idea. I’m the idea of human imagination, which, when you think about it, is the only thing we can really be certain isn’t imaginary… See, I’m imagination. I’m real and I’m the best friend you’ve ever had. Who do you think got you all this cool stuff? The clothes you wear, the room, the house, the city that you’re in. Everything in it started out in human imagination. Your lives, your personalities, your whole world. All invented… There’s nothing here but a funny little twist of amino acids playing a marvelous game of pretend.”

Moore's highly imaginative works themselves serve as a testament to the power he attributes to the human mind [00:17:13].

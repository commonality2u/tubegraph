The names of the main characters carry explicit [[analysis_of_character_names_and_their_meanings_in_the_matrix | religious and symbolic meanings]]:

*   **Neo**
    *   The name "Neo" means "new" in Greek <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
    *   It is also an anagram for "One" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
    *   Neo is presented as a type of [[religious_and_symbolic_imagery_in_the_matrix | Christ figure]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
    *   His given name, "Thomas Anderson," references the Apostle Thomas, known as "doubting Thomas," who initially harbored reservations about the Christ savior narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
    *   Etymologically, "Anderson" translates to "son of man," a moniker sometimes used by Jesus among his mortal companions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
*   **Morpheus**
    *   Morpheus is named after the God of Dreams from Ovid's *Metamorphoses* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

    *   Just as the Holy Trinity is believed to have resurrected Jesus, Trinity symbolically brings Neo back to life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
    *   The film further emphasizes this through the numerical motif, as Trinity starts the movie in room 303, featuring "threes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

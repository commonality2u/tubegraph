From: [[wisecrackedu]] <br/> 

The character of Rick Sanchez, particularly as explored in *Rick and Morty: The Rickshank Redemption* (Season 3 premiere), embodies a profound and often cynical philosophical stance, deeply rooted in absurdism. His motivations, initially appearing complex or even sentimental, are consistently undercut to reinforce the show's core themes of meaninglessness and cosmic indifference.

## Rick's Absurdist Philosophy and Worldview

[[philosophical_themes_in_rick_and_morty | Philosophical themes]] are central to *Rick and Morty*, with the show having previously explored existential themes through characters despairing over existence and unique life philosophies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. The show also extensively delves into absurdism, a relative of existentialism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. According to Albert Camus, humans seek meaning in a universe that remains silent, a concept mirrored in *Rick and Morty*'s portrayal of an absurd, meaningless multiverse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

Rick Sanchez consistently trivializes everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. He holds no belief in concepts like love or tradition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. His companionship with Morty is allegedly a means to hide his genius brain waves from the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. The *Rickshank Redemption* episode further highlights themes of the arbitrary nature of social systems, mocking sentimentality, and the pointlessness of it all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

The transition from Season 2 to Season 3 solidifies *Rick and Morty* as an "absurd" work by dangling meaning and hope, only to shatter it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

## Subverting Expectations and Character Development

The show deliberately plays with audience expectations regarding [[character_development_in_rick_and_morty | Rick's character development]].

### The Illusory Shift in Season 2

At the end of Season 2, Rick appears to deviate from his sociopathic behavior, sharing a heartfelt moment at Birdperson's wedding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. However, this is immediately undercut when Tammy is revealed to be a spy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. Notably, this emotional subversion comes from an outside force, not Rick's own cynicism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

Later, after witnessing the hardships his family faces due to the Galactic Federation, Rick seemingly sacrifices himself by turning himself over to them, suggesting he might be wrestling with the idea of "living with meaning" and doing right by his family despite knowing life's meaninglessness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. This cliffhanger hinted at a potential shift in the show's existential themes towards creating meaning in a meaningless world, an idea championed by existentialists but rejected by Camus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

### *The Rickshank Redemption*'s Double-Down on Absurdity

Instead of embracing meaning, *The Rickshank Redemption* doubles down on the absurd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

*   **Rick's Imprisonment as a Ploy**: Rick's seemingly noble self-sacrifice and imprisonment are revealed to be an elaborate ploy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. This revelation discredits the audience's expectation of a "humanized Rick" and promises a darker journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.
*   **Mocking the Search for Meaning**: Much of the episode's comedy comes from mocking the audience's attempt to draw meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.
    *   **The False Origin Story**: Rick explores a memory of him creating the portal gun, showing Beth and Diane being brutally murdered, which appears to be a tragic origin story that would give meaning to his madness, akin to a "Walter White-style anti-hero" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. However, this is revealed to be a ruse, baiting the audience to empathize only to subvert that empathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.
    *   **The "Greater Good"**: When Rick saves Earth from the Galactic Federation, the audience might infer he acts for a "greater good." However, Summer's comment suggests the new world order isn't necessarily better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.
    *   **Caring for Family**: The idea that Rick cares about Morty and Summer is consistently toyed with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. While he initially rushes to rescue them when they are imprisoned by the Council of Ricks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>, he then exhibits a casual disregard for Summer's life, only for it to be revealed as part of a strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. Finally, his stated motivation for saving them is merely so Beth doesn't kick him out of the house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

## The Szechuan Sauce: The Ultimate Absurdist Motivation

Rick's stated motivation for his actions in *The Rickshank Redemption* is not family, justice, or love, but solely the Mulan Szechuan McNugget dipping sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. The show proposes that Rick's entire series arc will be his quest for this forgotten promotional food item, thus undercutting any potential for Rick to develop a sense of morality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.

The quest for Szechuan sauce ultimately means nothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. It is not about creating meaning, but rather a reflection of the absurdity of being driven by anything at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. In a world utterly devoid of meaning, dedicating oneself to an absurd quest like finding plum-flavored McNugget sauce is presented as a logical outcome, a joke about meaninglessness itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

## Rick as an "Absurd Hero" (with a caveat)

Albert Camus describes an "Absurd hero" as a figure who understands and finds happiness in the pointlessness of existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. This hero must comprehend the "cosmic indifference" surrounding them, a state Camus calls "lucid indifference" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

This description significantly aligns with Rick Sanchez:
*   He possesses knowledge of a vast multiverse where all possibilities have occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.
*   He reduces basic morals to genetic programming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.
*   Despite being capable of anything, he yearns for Szechuan sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.

However, there is a crucial difference: Camus's absurd heroes find happiness in the absurd, while Rick Sanchez is depicted as being in great pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. This suggests Rick's actual character arc may not be to become more caring, but to eventually find enjoyment in the absurdity of it all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

Ultimately, *The Rickshank Redemption* serves as a declaration that any expectation of Rick finding meaning, whether through family, justice, or sacrifice, is a deliberate misdirection by the show's creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

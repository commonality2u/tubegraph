Syndrome, initially known as Buddy, serves as the primary antagonist in *The Incredibles* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. His character explores themes of [[concept_of_good_and_evil_in_pop_culture | manufactured greatness]] versus inherent talent and societal reactions to exceptional individuals.

## Origins and Motivation

Buddy was once a "normie" who interfered with Mr. Incredible's attempt to capture Bomb Voyage, leading to the culprit's escape and endangering a train full of "other normies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>. This incident highlights what the film suggests happens "when mediocrity gets in the way of excellence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>.

As a grown man, Buddy adopts the moniker "Syndrome" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>. His overarching goal is to unleash his robots on the world, then "pretend to defeat them and soak up some of that sweet superhero glory" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>.

## Manufactured Greatness

Syndrome's character initially suggests that "ordinary people can elevate themselves to greatness through grit, determination, a tablespoon of elbow grease, and grit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>, as he "started from the bottom and now is here, sitting atop an empire of technological innovation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>.

However, the film quickly subverts this idea, asserting that Syndrome's "manufactured greatness is proven inferior" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>. The narrative concludes that greatness cannot be aspired to but "one must be born with it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:00">[04:19:00]</a>. The Incredibles' natural superpowers are ultimately superior to Syndrome's technological prowess, which is depicted as requiring "the indignity of effort" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>.

## Downfall

During his attempt to gain glory, Syndrome loses control of his robot in the big city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. After his defeat by the Incredibles, Syndrome attempts to steal the Incredibaby as an act of revenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>. However, the baby retaliates, leading to Syndrome's demise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>.

> As for the poor, confused boy who was just fighting for equality in a world of superheroes? The Incredibles murdered him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>.

Syndrome's character can be viewed within the context of the [[evolution_of_film_villains | evolution of film villains]], particularly in his role as a foil to the naturally gifted heroes and his embodiment of the film's commentary on mediocrity and exceptionalism.

*The Purge* explores the idea that engaging in and consuming violence could satisfy a person's aggressive desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. However, the film quickly subverts this premise, suggesting that such consumption ultimately desensitizes individuals and leads to an escalation of violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

## Desensitization to Violence

The film highlights the desensitization to violence through several elements:
*   Brutal imagery of murder is juxtaposed with classical music, implying that violence has become so commonplace it no longer shocks or horrifies, potentially even inducing boredom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
*   Within the world of *The Purge*, humans are depicted watching "grotesquerie" on television for entertainment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. This is illustrated by a character stating, "We're just gonna lock down, watch some Purge events. Nothing special" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

## Self-Criticism of Violent Media

Ironically, *The Purge* itself, a violent film, functions as a critique of violent entertainment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. It provides viewers an opportunity to "release some aggression by watching a good old-fashioned bloodbath" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. The analysis of the film further perpetuates this cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

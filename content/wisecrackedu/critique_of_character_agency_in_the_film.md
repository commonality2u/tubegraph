The film *The Matrix Reloaded* faces a significant challenge in crafting a meaningful story for its protagonist, Neo, after he has become an all-powerful, "freakin Superman" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>. This difficulty lies in creating believable internal and external conflict for a character who has achieved such an elevated status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>.

## Neo's Predetermined Role
The Wachowskis' theoretical solution to this problem was to alter the prophecy that grants Neo his powers, revealing that his abilities are not evidence of him transcending the system, but rather an inherent part of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>. Neo is not breaking free from the Matrix in a meaningful way, but is instead playing a predetermined role within a larger system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>. As the Architect cryptically states, Neo is "the eventuality of an anomaly" that, despite efforts to eliminate it, "is not unexpected and thus, not beyond a measure of control" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>.

## Lack of Dramatic Action
A central problem of the film is the absence of "dramatic action," defined as any choice a character makes to advance their goal and the overall plot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>. *The Matrix Reloaded* contains very little dramatic action, further complicated by the revelation that all of Neo's "choices" are merely illusions created by a broader system of control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>. This results in "zero, zip, none" dramatic action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>.

Instead, the film is "bogged down by lengthy, philosophically confused monologues about determinism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>. Determinism, loosely, suggests that every future moment is dictated by a past moment through cause and effect, like a chain of falling dominoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.

### Determinism in Action
The film employs several elements to reinforce its deterministic philosophy:
*   **Framing Device** The opening scene, which depicts Neo's dream of Trinity being shot, is actually from the film's closing moments, implying that the events of the past have already "cemented the film's ending" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>.
*   **Cyclical Nature** The Matrix has been restarted six times, suggesting the entire world is "stuck in a loop" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>.
*   **Symbolism**
    *   A punch clock striking midnight symbolizes the completion of a circle and seamless transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>.
    *   The Key Maker's precise 314-second timeframe to reach the Architect refers to the first three digits of Pi, which also appears spray-painted near the Oracle's apartment, serving as constant reminders that Neo is "retreading a circle for the 6th time" rather than blazing a new path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:00">[04:19:00]</a>.

## Delayed and Diminished Agency
The film's opening showcases Neo only admitting he doesn't know what to do, lacking any choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>. The first moment of "dramatic action"—where a character makes a decision to advance their goals and the plot—does not occur until 39 minutes into the film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>. This contrasts with *Star Wars*, where Luke receives Leia's message around the twenty-minute mark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>.

Even when Neo finally locates the Oracle 44 minutes into the movie, he is reminded that his choice has "already been made" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19:00">[05:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:45:00">[05:45:00]</a>. The inciting incident is merely "philosophical exposition that reminds us that Neo has no agency at all" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:00">[06:06:00]</a>.

Neo's subsequent "quest" is described as a "glorified fetch quest" with vague instructions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:00">[06:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>. Both Agent Smith and the Merovingian deliver monologues on determinism, constantly reinforcing that Neo is "only bound by a larger system of cause and effect" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:53:00">[06:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a>. This theme is explicitly stated repeatedly rather than growing organically through Neo's actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:25:00">[07:25:00]</a>.

Many action sequences, such as Neo's God-like display against multiple Agent Smiths, do not advance the plot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35:00">[07:35:00]</a>. Similarly, the film's largest action sequence (22 minutes long) involving the chase for the Key Maker, makes little sense in the context of determinism. If Neo is merely playing into the Architect's hands, the Agents chasing the Key Maker—who is essential for Neo to reach the Source—is counter-intuitive to the system's goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:00">[09:34:00]</a>.

## Climax and Conclusion
The journey to the Source, intended as the climax, feels anticlimactic because the audience already knows Trinity will get shot as seen in Neo's dream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:14:00">[10:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:26:00">[10:26:00]</a>. At the Source, instead of a dramatic confrontation, the audience receives more exposition from the Architect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:47:00">[10:47:00]</a>. The Architect explains the prophecy's role and how Neo, like his five predecessors, must surrender his code to the Matrix mainframe to save Zion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:59:00">[10:59:00]</a>.

The film explicitly states that Neo was "designed" to feel love more than his predecessors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:37:00">[11:37:00]</a>. When Neo is presented with the "choice" of saving Zion or rescuing Trinity, the Architect reminds him that it is not truly a choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:47:00">[11:47:00]</a>.

Ultimately, *The Matrix Reloaded* spends much of its 2 hour and 18 minute runtime on unnecessary sermons on determinism and prolonged fight scenes that do not advance the plot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:32:00">[12:32:00]</a>. With Neo's choices portrayed as predetermined, the film struggles to engage the audience and leaves them questioning if Neo can truly make choices or break free from the system of control he was thought to have escaped in the first film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:45:00">[12:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:53:00">[12:53:00]</a>.

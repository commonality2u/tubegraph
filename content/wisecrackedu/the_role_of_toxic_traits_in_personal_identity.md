The *Rick and Morty* Season 3 episode "Rest and Ricklaxation" explores the complex relationship between toxic traits and an individual's personal identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. The episode presents a unique take on character development and offers commentary on societal views of mental health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## The Mental Detox

After nearly dying multiple times, Rick and Morty realize they are burned out and vacation at an alien spa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. They use a "mental detoxifier," which purges the parts of themselves they hate most <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

The "cleansed" versions of the duo manifest as:
*   **Healthy-Morty:** Becomes popular, confident, and lands a date with Jessica, free from crippling self-doubt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.
*   **Healthy-Rick:** Appears as a normal, thoughtful human being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

However, their toxic counterparts manage to escape, leading to a strange new reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## Anti-Character Development

The episode employs "anti-character development," a clever subversion of traditional narrative arcs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Dan Harmon, a proponent of Joseph Campbell’s "The Hero’s Journey," often features protagonists confronting their "shadow"—a dark reflection they must overcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. Examples include Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, Logan battling X-24, or Luke Skywalker sparing Darth Vader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

In "Rest and Ricklaxation," the toxic versions of themselves are literal [[exploration_of_double_consciousness_and_identity | shadow]] versions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Instead of overcoming their undesirable traits, the characters embark on a journey to reunite with their worst selves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
*   Healthy-Morty, a "smooth operator," must rediscover his self-loathing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
*   Healthy-Rick, a "thoughtful super-genius," needs to re-embrace his narcissism and "irrational care for Morty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

This subversion suggests that "regular" character development, focused solely on eliminating negative traits, can be "pretty creepy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

## Commentary on Mental Health and "Compulsory Happiness"

The episode acts as a critique of certain "healthy" attitudes promoted by self-help gurus and popular media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. It questions the idea that mental health means "uncritically loving yourself," "saying yes to everything," or eliminating any unpleasant thoughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

The show embodies the concept of "compulsory happiness," a term coined by sociologist William Davies in "The Happiness Industry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. Davies argues that corporations and advertisers promote a definition of mental health that serves capitalist society, requiring a "cheerful acceptance of the status quo" and constant self-improvement to become a "better consumer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

Healthy-Morty exemplifies this, spouting self-help platitudes and demanding others conform to his "new lifestyle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. When faced with a real problem, he insists, "Trust me things are good. Taking that away from me… that wouldn’t be healthy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

## The Necessity of "Negative" Traits

The episode argues that many traits the self-help industry seeks to erase—like self-doubt and sadness—are, in fact, "pretty important" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. For Morty, self-doubt is crucial in preventing him from becoming a "full-on sociopath" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.

<br>

> "And a sociopath he becomes." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>

<br>

Healthy-Morty transforms into an unscrupulous stockbroker, reminiscent of a "sociopathic Wall Street fat cat with too much self-esteem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. Rick ultimately realizes that some undesirable parts of ourselves, despite causing pain, are "essential to actually being healthy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. Jessica's remark to Morty, "Good to have you back," suggests that his authentic, self-hating self, is truly his "better self" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

## Remaining Ambiguities

A minor point of contention within the episode's logic is the definition of "toxicity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. The show implies that undesired parts are purged based on subjective definitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. Yet, Healthy-Rick initially states, "I’m really proud to be your grandpa" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>, only to later claim his attachment to Morty is "irrational" and "toxic," leading him to abandon Morty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. This leaves open the question of whether his love for Morty is inherently toxic or healthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

*Avengers: Endgame* served as the culmination of 21 films produced over more than a decade by numerous writers and directors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. Its success suggests a deep resonance with audiences, which the video attributes to its ability to provide fulfilling conclusions to many narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>. This article dives into the character arcs of Marvel's central trinity: Thor, Captain America, and Iron Man, examining how their varied progressions align with different philosophical understandings of history and character development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>.

## Thor: The Cyclical Hero

Thor's character arc throughout the Marvel Cinematic Universe is characterized by its cyclical nature, involving a continuous process of ascending to a peak, being brought low, and then learning and relearning similar lessons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>.

His journey begins in the first *Thor* film, where his pride and combativeness lead to his exile from Asgard and the loss of his hammer, making him unworthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. During his time on Earth, he learns humility, becoming worthy again and returning to his starting point as the Prince of Asgard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.

*The Dark World* similarly starts with Thor successfully restoring peace to the nine realms, only for him to quickly face devastation with his girlfriend's infection, an evil elf, and the deaths of his mother and brother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>. Despite these profound losses, he ends the film once more saving all nine realms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>.

*Thor: Ragnarok* sees him initially on top, saving Asgard from Surtur, but within a day he reaches a new low with his father's death, his hammer's destruction, and his enslavement on Sakhar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>. This ordeal teaches him that "Asgard is not a place, but a people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>. His arc concludes with him saving the Asgardian people from Ragnarok, even as Asgard itself is destroyed, and he is finally crowned king <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>.

In *Avengers: Infinity War*, after briefly being king, Thor is again brought low by Thanos, losing half his people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>. He regains power with Stormbreaker but fails to stop Thanos, leading to a self-imposed exile and a period of physical and emotional decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>. The lesson learned this time is self-acceptance, realizing he is a hero and warrior at heart rather than needing to fulfill the role of king <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>. Ultimately, he abdicates the throne to join his friends on new adventures, ending back on top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>. While there is some overall forward progression – Thor moves from coveting kingship to no longer desiring it – his growth process is largely circuitous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>. Thor himself notes this cyclical nature: "Oh dear brother, becoming predictable. I trust you, you betray me. Round and round in circles we go. See Loki, life is about... it's about growth, it's about change" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>.

This [[Analysis of cyclical storytelling in Thors character | cyclical storytelling structure]] is particularly fitting for a character based on a pagan deity from Norse mythology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>. Many ancient philosophies and religions, including the Stoics, Hindus, Maya, and Aztec, viewed history on a grand scale as cyclical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:00">[05:55:00]</a>. Fragments of Norse mythology, such as Snorri Sturluson's *Prose Edda* and *Poetic Edda*, suggest a similar understanding of history, with cycles of creation, Ragnarok, and renewal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>. Richard Wagner's *Ring Cycle* also captured this cyclicality, beginning with the Rhinegold's theft and ending with its reclamation after turmoil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:29:00">[06:29:00]</a>. Neil Gaiman's modern retelling of Norse mythology makes this even clearer, with surviving gods finding a chess set depicting the old gods and replaying history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>.

## Captain America: The Unchanging Ideal

[[Captain Americas timeless moral integrity | Captain America's character arc]], in stark contrast to Thor's, is largely static; the world may change around him, but he does not change with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:00">[07:12:00]</a>. While screenwriting guru Robert McKee criticized such unchanging characters as "boring," Captain America proves an exception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:19:00">[07:19:00]</a>. After his initial physical transformation by the super-soldier serum, his internal and external character remain consistent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:52:00">[07:52:00]</a>.

His unwavering stance against bullies is established early in his origin film and remains consistent throughout *Captain America: The Winter Soldier* and *Captain America: Civil War*, where he opposes actions like Project Insight's surveillance and the Sokovia Accords' restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a>. This inner strength, his persistence in "getting up and standing alone in the face of overwhelming odds," is a trait present before his transformation and never wavers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:51:00">[08:51:00]</a>. His famous line, "I could do this all day," is repeated seriously and humorously, confirming his predictable yet inspiring persistence, even against Thanos and an entire army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:18:00">[09:18:00]</a>. Even his optimism is inexhaustible, as shown in *Endgame* after the Snap, and he acknowledges his own lack of character development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:00">[09:55:00]</a>.

[[Philosophical influences on Marvel characters | Steve Rogers' personal philosophy]] is equally unbending, summarized by Agent Sharon Carter's quote: "Even if everyone is telling you that something wrong is something right... it is your duty to plant yourself like a tree, look them in the eye, and say, 'No, *you* move'" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:17:00">[10:17:00]</a>. This commitment to moral duty is seen in his refusal to sacrifice Vision in *Infinity War*, despite the "compelling moral calculus" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:44:00">[10:44:00]</a>.

While the films portray him as more adaptable to change than his comic counterpart (e.g., appreciating modern food and the internet), fundamentally, the times do not change Captain America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:23:00">[11:23:00]</a>. His struggle against Hydra in 1945 is analogous to his fight in 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:39:00">[11:39:00]</a>. He represents a belief in eternal truths, enduring regardless of time or circumstance, much like the author of Ecclesiastes' view that "what has been is what will be... and there is nothing new under the sun" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:46:00">[11:46:00]</a>. Both Captain America and Solomon would agree on the immutability of moral law and human nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:08:00">[12:08:00]</a>. Thus, problems like Thanos, Hitler, and Pharaoh are variations of the same unchanging human flaws, just as courage, seen from Wakanda to Normandy, is a timeless human virtue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:27:00">[12:27:00]</a>. Captain America, despite being a "man out of time," remains relevant in every era because of this unchanging moral core <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:02:00">[13:02:00]</a>.

## Iron Man: The Progressive Visionary

Like Captain America, Tony Stark is also a "man out of time," but their contrasting approaches highlight why they are often on opposing sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:32:00">[13:32:00]</a>. Reed Richards describes Tony Stark as a "future man trapped in the now," whose relationships, morality, and ethics are highly adaptable to what he views as "the greater good of mankind's necessary survival and undeniable progress" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:40:00">[13:40:00]</a>.

[[Iron Mans progression and political philosophy | Tony Stark's character arc]] is defined by linear progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:07:00">[14:07:00]</a>. In the first *Iron Man* film, he evolves from a self-centered "merchant of death" to shutting down Stark Industries' weapons manufacturing after witnessing the harm his products caused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:11:00">[14:11:00]</a>. By *Iron Man 2*, though no longer personally selfish, his political philosophy of Randian objectivism, which prioritizes self-interest, is still evident in his belief that he "successfully privatized world peace" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:28:00">[14:28:00]</a>.

In *The Avengers*, he progresses from criticizing Captain America's willingness to make a sacrifice play to demonstrating his own self-sacrificial nature by flying a nuke through a wormhole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:59:00">[14:59:00]</a>. This brush with death leaves him psychologically scarred, suffering from severe PTSD in *Iron Man 3*, which, while not an improvement, marks a significant change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:33:00">[15:33:00]</a>.

His progression in *Civil War* sees him abandon his libertarian leanings in favor of increased government intervention, supporting the Sokovia Accords for a safer society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:49:00">[15:49:00]</a>. As a futurist, he views the Accords as an inevitable step towards preparing for future threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:06:00">[16:06:00]</a>. By *Endgame*, both his personal and political progressions culminate; he blames Captain America for the Snap due to his unwillingness to compromise liberties for global security, and ultimately makes the ultimate self-sacrifice, leaving his family behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:38:00">[16:38:00]</a>.

Stark's character, philosophy, and technology all progress linearly, mirroring the philosophical view of history as a linear advancement from a primitive past to a technologically and socially superior future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:14:00">[17:14:00]</a>. Philosophers like Hegel and Karl Marx conceived of history as inexorably progressing toward specific ends, as did Francis Fukuyama with liberal democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:27:00">[17:27:00]</a>. As a futurist, Tony Stark similarly views history as a linear and inexorable progression, though his vision of the "endgame" is different, focused on preparing for a hostile alien army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:51:00">[17:51:00]</a>. His linear advancement makes him, in Reed Richards' view, "the future man at the end of history," representing what everyone else is slowly moving towards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:21:00">[18:21:00]</a>.

## The Great Man Theory of History

One perspective on history that all three heroes conform to is Thomas Carlyle's "Great Man Theory," which posits that "the history of the world is but the biography of great men" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:41:00">[18:41:00]</a>. The history of the Marvel Universe from 1942 through 2023 is effectively a biography of the Avengers, especially Tony Stark, Thor, and Captain America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:53:00">[18:53:00]</a>. They have done more to accelerate or change the course of history than anyone else of their age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:04:00">[19:04:00]</a>. Captain America himself echoes this sentiment in the comics: "We shape the world, it does not shape us" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:12:00">[19:12:00]</a>.

The lasting appeal of these characters lies in the appropriateness between their core concepts and how their arcs unfold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:43:00">[19:43:00]</a>. When Marvel deviates from these established patterns, it is a deliberate exception for powerful effect, such as Iron Man's final "I am Iron Man" snap, or [[Captain Americas timeless moral integrity | Steve Rogers]] finally accepting his duty is done and moving forward with a personal life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:50:00">[19:50:00]</a>.

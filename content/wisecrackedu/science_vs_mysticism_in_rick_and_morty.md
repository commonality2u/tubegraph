The animated series *Rick and Morty* frequently uses [[rick_and_mortys_approach_to_scifi_and_science | science fiction]], horror, and fantasy references to invert common clichés and tropes, often highlighting the contrast between scientific and mystical worldviews [00:00:11]. The show's approach is to demystify traditional narratives by subjecting them to the harsh realities of science and everyday life [00:10:17].

## Demystifying the "Deal with the Devil"

In the episode "Something Ricked This Way Comes," *Rick and Morty* satirizes the classic "deal with the devil" trope [00:00:55]. The episode title itself references Ray Bradbury’s “Something Wicked This Way Comes,” a novel about a magical carousel that offers youth or age with a catch [00:01:00]. Stephen King's “Needful Things,” which is also the name of the Devil’s shop in the show, similarly features deals with hidden, negative consequences [00:01:17].

Traditionally, stories about making a deal with the devil reflect the hidden consequences of trying to subvert the natural order to fulfill selfish desires [00:01:55]. However, *Rick and Morty* subverts this moral [00:02:04]. Rick's scientific prowess allows characters to achieve their desires without selling their soul or suffering debilitating curses [00:02:17].

### Science vs. Superstition
*Rick and Morty* suggests that science eliminates the mystical repercussions associated with interfering with the perceived natural order [00:02:35]. The show posits that science demystifies religion by exposing magic and miracles as either "sleight of hand or mere statistical coincidence" [00:02:45]. Consequently, the "deal with the devil" trope is presented as nothing more than a "paranoid fairy tale" [00:03:00]. What is often portrayed as "too good to be true" in these stories is, in Rick's view, simply a warning against "circumvent[ing] God’s rules" [00:03:05], a common practice for scientists [00:03:12].

By leveraging science, Rick renders the devil obsolete [00:03:17]. The episode implies that the real lesson is that evil should no longer be horrifying [00:03:20]. Karmic retribution offers a sense of calm, suggesting that wrongdoers will face cosmic justice [00:03:24]. A world without such assurances, however, is presented as inherently scarier [00:03:29]. The show suggests that if one seeks true horror, it lies "beyond evil" and within "pure, disinterested science" [00:03:32].

## Critiquing Deities and Belief Systems
The episode "Raising Gazorpazorp" continues the show's exploration of [[critique_of_religion_and_belief_systems_in_rick_and_morty | religion and belief systems]] through its reference to the 1974 film *Zardoz* [00:06:27]. In *Zardoz*, a "giant-floating-head-god" commands chosen savages, only for one of them to discover that this god is a lie designed to enslave [00:06:52].

This reference underpins a general theme of [[atheism_themes_in_rick_and_morty | atheism]] within *Rick and Morty* [00:07:34]. The show implies that either there is no God, or that any existing God is not inherently benevolent or worthy of worship [00:07:47]. The narrative mirrors Zardoz by depicting a protagonist who uncovers that a perceived God is a falsehood and proceeds to dismantle that illusion [00:07:42].

## Science and its Consequences
In "Lawnmower Dog," Rick's scientific invention gives the family dog, Snuffles, intelligence [00:08:09]. This accidental consequence leads Snuffles to subjugate the entire human race [00:08:14]. Snuffles, renaming himself "Snowball," references the pig from George Orwell’s *Animal Farm*, highlighting a critique of power and revolution [00:08:18]. The interspecies conflict mirrors the animal rebellion in *Animal Farm* [00:08:41], where the animals eventually become like their human oppressors [00:08:58]. In *Rick and Morty*, a dystopian future is averted when Snowball realizes he is becoming everything he hated about humanity [00:09:19]. This demonstrates that scientific advancement, without moral or ethical grounding, can lead to unintended and undesirable outcomes.

## Disillusionment and Normalization of Fantasy
*Rick and Morty* frequently employs disillusionment as a central theme [00:10:13]. The show not only deconstructs mysticism with hard science [00:10:17] but also dispels fantasies by grounding them in the mundane realities of everyday life [00:10:25].

### Fairy Tales and Horror Tropes
The episode "Meeseeks and Destroy" overtly exemplifies this [00:10:30]. Morty's cliched fairy tale adventure, reminiscent of "Jack and the Beanstalk," is "normalized" by subjecting it to a level of realism typically absent from children's stories [00:10:33]. Instead of a "happily ever after" for a boy who robs and kills a giant unprovoked [00:10:40], Morty faces a trial for senseless murder and confronts the giant's grieving widow [00:11:01].

Similarly, "Scary Terry," a parody of Freddy Krueger from "A Nightmare on Elm Street," is initially terrifying due to his dream-murdering abilities [00:11:16]. However, his horror is dispelled when his life is revealed to be "utterly banal" [00:11:28], mirroring the "shitty home life" and "lame dreams" of an ordinary person [00:11:34].

### Deconstructing the Human Body
"Anatomy Park" references *Jurassic Park* and *Fantastic Voyage* [00:11:42]. While *Fantastic Voyage* portrays the human body as a "wonder of the natural world," *Rick and Morty* depicts it as a "gonorrhea infested nightmare" [00:11:47]. This exemplifies the show's humorous device of "robbing fantasy of its magic" and trivializing everything, including life itself [00:12:01].

Through these inversions and demystifications, *Rick and Morty* constantly pits [[rick_and_mortys_approach_to_scifi_and_science | science]] against [[critique_of_religion_and_belief_systems_in_rick_and_morty | mysticism]], demonstrating how a scientific worldview can strip away the comforting illusions of magic, fate, and inherent meaning, often leaving behind a more absurd or even terrifying reality.

From: [[wisecrackedu]] <br/> 

*Rick and Morty* employs science as a central theme, not only as a plot device for interdimensional adventures but also as a philosophical lens to examine the nature of reality, meaning, and human existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The show integrates scientific concepts and theories, often presenting them in a way that is both intellectually stimulating and humorously cynical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## The Paradox of Science and Existence

The series frequently presents a paradox: while science allows for a rational understanding of the universe through formulas and theorems, it simultaneously confronts humanity with the bleak and arbitrary nature of its own existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This rational approach can strip away any sense of sanctity or emotion, rendering the human experience meaningless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

Rick Sanchez, the mad scientist, embodies this perspective, using science to demystify everything around him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. For instance, he rationalizes love as merely a set of chemical reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. In one instance, Rick mathematically explains to Summer and Morty that they are "pieces of shit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. He even rationalizes his bond with Morty, stating it's an easy way to hide his genius brain waves from intergalactic authorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Sci-Fi Science and Meta-Commentary

*Rick and Morty* draws humor from both complex scientific principles and superficial readings of science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>:

*   **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>: An entire episode is loosely based on this quantum mechanics principle, which states that it's impossible to know both the location and momentum of a particle because tiny objects are simultaneously waves and particles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The show humorously suggests this uncertainty can cause realities to split <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.
*   **Schrödinger's Cat** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>: The show references Erwin Schrödinger's 1935 thought experiment, pondering if a cat, rigged with a quantum booby-trap, can be both alive and dead at the same time in a quantum world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.
*   **Critique of Sci-Fi Tropes** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>: The series often pokes fun at the science fiction genre itself, jabbing at its tendency to invent "scientific mumbo-jumbo" to justify unlikely plot points, such as smart and stupid brainwaves canceling each other out, or tiny climates existing on a tiny planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The show also makes jokes about forced perspective, satirizing the trust placed in TV narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Science and the "Death of God"

The show exhibits a unique kind of [[the_role_of_science_and_atheism_in_rick_and_morty | atheism]] that consistently invalidates religious figures by reducing them to pure science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This aligns with Friedrich Nietzsche's concept of the "death of God," where, after the Enlightenment and the scientific revolution, the traditional divine source of value is no longer relevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This leads to a void of meaning, or [[cosmic_nihilism_and_its_depiction_in_rick_and_morty | nihilism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Rick even "beats the devil," actively playing out this "death of God" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Misuse of Science and [[rick_and_mortys_critique_of_conventional_morality | Morality]]

*Rick and Morty* also acknowledges the frequent misuse of science, particularly by those with religious or dogmatic agendas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. In the episode “Something Ricked This Way Comes,” Jerry’s "personal" interpretation of science drives him to champion Pluto’s planet-hood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The Plutonians, with their cross-shaped eyes, are depicted in a way that draws a comparison to religious fundamentalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This is ultimately revealed to be a ploy to manipulate the Plutonians into accepting the corporate destruction of their planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

By exploring the absurdities of a purely rational universe and pushing the boundaries of decency within its [[scifi_horror_and_fantasy_themes_in_rick_and_morty | sci-fi horror]] setting, the show prompts viewers to ask profound questions about meaning and purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Ultimately, the science in *Rick and Morty* not only serves as a vehicle for comedic and adventurous plots but also as a tool to underscore the philosophical implications of a universe governed by cold, hard rationality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

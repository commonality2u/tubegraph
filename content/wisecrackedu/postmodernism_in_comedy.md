Sometimes the crushing anxiety of existence may feel like too much, but comedy can help laugh the pain away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. [[Influence of Monty Python on modern comedy | Monty Python]] redefined comedy in the 1970s and remain hugely influential today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Modern comedies like *[[Social satire in South Park | South Park]]*, *Rick and Morty*, and *Deadpool* owe their existence to [[Influence of Monty Python on modern comedy | Monty Python]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. [[Influence of Monty Python on modern comedy | Monty Python]] paved the way for modern comedy by combining absurdity, satire, and postmodern reflexivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Postmodernism Defined
Postmodernism is prevalent in various forms of media today, including *Jurassic World*, *Star Wars*, and *Family Guy* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. These works often refer back to themselves, commenting on the narrative conventions and iconography of their predecessors, or even copying them wholesale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

The concept of postmodernism was first coined by French philosopher Jean-Fran√ßois Lyotard in 1979 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. Lyotard posited that stories traditionally fit into "grand mythologies" or "metanarratives," which provided patterns and structures for beliefs and taught universal insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. Examples of metanarratives include *The Wizard of Oz*, which teaches self-realization, and *The Fast and The Furious*, which emphasizes the importance of family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. Through these stories, morals and social customs are taught and reinforced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. Postmodernism, however, subverts these grand narratives, revealing the chaos and disorder beneath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

### [[Postmodernism in Deadpool and its relation to Don Quixote | Deadpool]] and Self-Awareness
[[Postmodernism in Deadpool and its relation to Don Quixote | Deadpool]] is a prime example of postmodernism due to its rebellious [[role_of_selfaware_humor_in_media | self-awareness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. The character repeatedly winks at his own narrative and mocks the superhero genre <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. This constant self-reflexivity encapsulates postmodern thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. [[Postmodernism in Deadpool and its relation to Don Quixote | Deadpool]] is a comic-book character who constantly tears down what comic books traditionally stand for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

### [[Influence of Monty Python on modern comedy | Monty Python]]'s Postmodern Deconstruction
[[Influence of Monty Python on modern comedy | Monty Python]] took postmodern deconstruction to another level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. Their film, *Monty Python and the Holy Grail*, is defined by breaking down multiple metanarratives, including Arthurian chivalry, Christianity, logic, and the film medium itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

#### Subverting Arthurian Chivalry
Arthurian Chivalry, which evolved in the Late Middle Ages, idealized knights as honorable and self-sacrificing figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. *Monty Python and the Holy Grail* completely dismantles these tenets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>:
*   Sir Robin, instead of being brave, runs away from a three-headed giant despite his minstrels singing heroic narratives about him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.
*   Arthur's arrival at Camelot, usually a high-point, is turned into a goofy musical number, and he ultimately decides not to go <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.
*   The supposed "great heroes" are revealed to be flawed:
    *   Arthur is power-hungry and attacks peasants who question his rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.
    *   Sir Galahad the Pure is quickly seduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
    *   Lancelot murders dozens of unarmed people while attempting a rescue, only for it to be revealed there was no maiden to save <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.
[[Influence of Monty Python on modern comedy | Monty Python]] uses postmodernism to show how people's self-told stories enable awful actions, with the knights' metanarratives justifying their violence and oppression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. The knights are revealed to be cowards, hypocrites, and violent sociopaths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.

#### Casting Doubt on God and Logic
Even God is put into doubt in *Monty Python and the Holy Grail* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. Instead of being good and all-powerful, God is depicted as a "cranky dick" with crappy animation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. Philosopher Mikhail Bakhtin defined this as the 'downward-swing,' where a classical story becomes so distorted and grotesque that it's unclear whether to scream, cry, or laugh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. This distortion extends to the audience, casting doubt on lessons learned through metanarratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.

A famous scene, the witch trial, showcases how formal logic is distorted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. Sir Bedevere the Wise uses a "foolproof" logic test, equating witches burning like wood, wood floating like a duck, and thus, a witch weighing the same as a duck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. This casts doubt on fundamental faith in logic itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

#### Breaking the Fourth Wall and Film Medium
By the end of *The Holy Grail*, the distortion extends to the film itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. Modern-day police suddenly arrive and arrest Arthur, breaking the fourth wall and making the audience aware they are watching a movie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. The film constantly pokes fun at being a "movie" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>:
*   Title credits are undermined by Swedish subtitles and the subsequent firing of credit-makers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.
*   Arthur uses coconuts instead of a horse due to budget constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.
*   Arthur refers to a character as "the old man from scene 24" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.
*   The Legendary Black Beast of Arghhh is defeated because its animator has a heart attack, not through battle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

This self-reflexivity reveals *The Holy Grail* to be its own metanarrative, portraying film as artificial as the chivalrous heroes within <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. This makes *Monty Python and The Holy Grail* the "Inception" of postmodern film, deconstructing religion, logic, heroic tropes, and the film medium itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.

## [[Comedy of the absurd and existentialist themes | Comedy of the Absurd]]
[[Comedy of the absurd and existentialist themes | The Comedy of the Absurd]] is an existential-based comedy focused on the fallout when confronted with a world devoid of meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. Instead of despair, it points out the broad humor in tragic insignificance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. This tragic absurdity is foundational to [[Influence of Monty Python on modern comedy | Monty Python]]'s comedy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.

### *Rick and Morty* and Meaninglessness
*Rick and Morty* ties its absurd humor with thought-provoking insights into the meaninglessness of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. In the "Get Schwifty" episode, massive alien heads appear, leading many to worship them as Gods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. In reality, the heads are an alien race wanting Earth to participate in an *American Idol*-like reality show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>. This reflects the exact misappropriation of meaning seen in [[Comedy of the absurd and existentialist themes | comedies of the absurd]], where people attribute significance to silly objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.

### *Monty Python's Life of Brian* and Existentialism
In [[Influence of Monty Python on modern comedy | Monty Python]]'s *The Life of Brian*, poor Brian's entire existence is a big absurd misunderstanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. Born next to Jesus, he is mistakenly assumed to be the Messiah by the Three Wise Men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. This projection of significance onto the insignificant is a hallmark of existential thought, particularly Albert Camus's rejection of the desperate search for meaning and embrace of "The Absurd" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.

When Brian runs from his disciples, they mistakenly believe he has risen to heaven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. Later, when he loses a sandal, his disciples proclaim it a sign, attributing meaning to a mere piece of footwear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.
Characters in [[Comedy of the absurd and existentialist themes | absurd comedies]] are often caught in hopeless situations, forced into repetitive and fruitless actions, like Brian constantly trying to tell his disciples he is not the Messiah to no avail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. Despite his impending crucifixion, Brian is comforted by fellow crucifixion buddies who break into song, "The Bright Side of Life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. This cheerful lament reflects the Myth of Sisyphus, which Albert Camus applied to life itself, suggesting that when faced with meaninglessness, one should "always look at the bright-side" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>. The only real option when faced with insignificance and doom is laughter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.

## Satire in Comedy
Satire has become vital, appearing in late-night talk shows and traditional half-hour comedies like *[[Social satire in South Park | South Park]]* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>. Political satires derive humor by revealing hypocrisy in established rules and orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.

### [[Social satire in South Park | South Park]]'s Influence
The last three seasons of *[[Social satire in South Park | South Park]]* heavily focus on the 2016 election and the Trump presidency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>. *[[Social satire in South Park | South Park]]* creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone often cite [[Influence of Monty Python on modern comedy | Monty Python]] as the single biggest influence on their show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.

### [[Influence of Monty Python on modern comedy | Monty Python]]'s Social and Political Satire
Long before *[[Social satire in South Park | South Park]]*, [[Influence of Monty Python on modern comedy | Monty Python]] paved the way by subverting established political ideologies in England <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. In their final and darkest feature, *The Meaning of Life*, [[Influence of Monty Python on modern comedy | the Pythons]] openly comment on English imperialism, economic disparity, and the classist social hierarchies of the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.

*   **Critique of Capitalism:** The opening mini-movie, *The Crimson Permanent Assurance*, depicts poor elderly workers rebelling against young American yuppies who forced them into a "pirate-like frenzy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>. They destroy corporate buildings, bringing down the capitalist system that anchored them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.
*   **Economic Disparity:** The film questions the notion that self-interest results in the greater good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>. In the "Miracle of Birth" sketch, doctors prioritize fancy equipment over the patient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>. In "Live Organ Transplants," bureaucrats forcefully remove a liver from an impoverished man for the "good of the country" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>. Britain's Yorkshire is ironically called a "Third World Country," and a poor man is forced to sell his children to science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>. This culminates in "The Autumn Years" sketch, where the grotesquely obese rich Mr. Creosote explodes from overeating, implying the rich get richer at the expense of the starving lower class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.
*   **British Imperialism:** [[Influence of Monty Python on modern comedy | The Pythons]] skewer the entire notion of British imperialism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>. A hand of God strikes down an officer insisting Britain needs an army to put down differing ideologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>. A Sergeant Major drills his platoon on having anything better to do than "march up and down the town square," suggesting they do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>. [[Influence of Monty Python on modern comedy | The Pythons]] suggest British imperialism is a threat to the meaning of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>. This is shown in war depictions where soldiers celebrating a birthday are gunned down, juxtaposing war's brutal reality against simple pleasures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>.

### *The Flying Circus* and Bureaucracy
[[Influence of Monty Python on modern comedy | Monty Python]]'s sketch show, *The Flying Circus*, often portrays bureaucrats as buffoons or "sticks-in-the-mud" who constantly censor the show itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>. As Christopher Hitchens stated, the essential gag of [[Influence of Monty Python on modern comedy | Monty Python]] was the "bubbling magma of absurdity that lay beneath the fragile crust of British reserve," where ordinary men could become wildly unpredictable characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>.

## Conclusion
The unpredictability, mixed with postmodernism, politics, and the absurd, makes [[Influence of Monty Python on modern comedy | Monty Python]] unique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>. By merging social commentary, existential angst, and silliness, [[Influence of Monty Python on modern comedy | the Pythons]] defied convention, creating a singular brand of comedy known as "Pythonesque" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>.

The iconic villain [[darth_vaders_fear_of_death | Darth Vader]], once Anakin Skywalker, resonates powerfully with audiences because his descent into the dark side represents an all-consuming [[darth_vaders_fear_of_death | fear of death]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. *Star Wars* explores two different [[philosophical_responses_to_death_in_star_wars | philosophical responses to death]] through Vader's story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>, with the Jedi's approach to training closely linked to these philosophical underpinnings.

## Ernest Becker's "The Denial of Death"

Cultural anthropologist Ernest Becker, in his 1973 book *The Denial of Death*, argued that much of human action is a way of managing the [[darth_vaders_fear_of_death | fear of our own demise]] and the demise of those around us <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. This anxiety, termed "death denial," is profoundly evident in [[darth_vaders_fear_of_death | Darth Vader]] and rooted in his childhood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

### Anakin Skywalker's Early Fears

From a young age, Anakin Skywalker, despite being a prodigy and the prophesied messiah, is not immune to the [[darth_vaders_fear_of_death | fear of death]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. His distress over his mother's mortality haunts him and becomes a fixation as he grows older <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. Yoda quickly identifies this as a potential problem, noting Anakin's thoughts dwell on his mother, expressing fear of losing her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

### Jedi Council's Hesitation to Train Anakin

The Jedi Council's initial hesitation to train Anakin, specifically due to his age, is likely linked to concerns about death denial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. While never explicitly explained in canon why only young children are trained, dialogue suggests Yoda and Mace Windu's apprehension stems from the ramifications of this fear for young Anakin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

Psychologist James A. Graham's research supports this:
*   Children typically begin to understand death as permanent between ages 5-9, often perceiving it as something that happens to older individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
*   It is around age 10 that children realize the permanence of death applies to everyone, including themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

Anakin is 9 years old, capable of understanding his mother's mortality and on the cusp of understanding his own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. The Jedi likely aim to indoctrinate children *before* they fully grasp their own mortality, making it easier to train them not to fear death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

### Ramifications of Death Denial: Violence and Control

Becker posited that human violence is a natural response to death denial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. Inflicting death gives individuals a sense of control over it, whether on a battlefield or through homicide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. For Anakin, this translates into a path to the Dark Side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

An early draft of *Episode 1* highlighted Anakin's underlying issue: "Fear attracts the fearful. He was trying to overcome his fear by squashing you. Be less afraid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. This foreshadows Anakin's attempt to "squash" death and gain control, rather than becoming less afraid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

When Anakin's mother is mortally wounded, he slaughters an entire Tusken Raider village <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. This revenge aligns with Becker's argument that killing others provides the illusion of controlling death, assuaging the very fear the Jedi Council warned him about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. The more he kills, the more death feels like something he "owns" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

His anxiety dreams about Padmé dying in childbirth further illustrate his [[darth_vaders_fear_of_death | fear of loss]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. At this critical juncture, Anakin faces a choice between the [[contrast_between_jedi_and_sith_attitudes_towards_death | Sith way and the Jedi way]] of dealing with death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

## Two Philosophical Responses to Death

### The Jedi Way: Nonattachment and Faith

Yoda's counsel to Anakin—"Train yourself to let go of everything you fear to lose" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>—is rooted in Buddhism, specifically the concept of nonattachment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. The Buddhist text "The Pali canon" identifies *jaramarana*—the desire to escape old age and death—as a dangerously seductive human impulse, which can only be defeated through nonattachment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. Yoda embodies this philosophy, facing his own death with profound calm, stating, "Soon, will I rest. Yes, forever sleep. Earned it I have" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

Becker would categorize Yoda as a "knight of faith," a term borrowed from Soren Kierkegaard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. Authentic faith in something more powerful than death is a key way to manage terror <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. For Yoda, this nonattachment to *jaramarana* is grounded in his faith in the light side of the Force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

> "Death is a natural part of life. Rejoice for those around you who transform into the force." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>

This type of faith, according to Becker, is "a matter of grace and not of human effort" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.

### The Sith Way: Embracing Desire and Seeking to Defeat Death

In contrast, the Sith philosophy encourages embracing desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. Palpatine tempts Anakin with the possibility of defeating death through the dark side, specifically mentioning Darth Plagueis the Wise, who could save others from death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

Anakin ultimately becomes a Sith Lord on the condition that Palpatine helps him save Padmé's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. In refusing to accept death, Anakin sacrifices his identity, loyalty, and conscience, becoming little more than a "zombie trapped in a machine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. Becker described this as the terminal point of death denial:

> "the person seeks to avoid death, but he does it by killing off so much of himself and so large a spectrum of his action-world that he is actually isolating and diminishing himself and becomes as though dead.” <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>

Left with no one to protect, [[darth_vaders_fear_of_death | Darth Vader]] becomes an instrument of power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.

## Confronting Death Denial: Obi-Wan's Sacrifice and Force Ghosts

Obi-Wan Kenobi's death in *Episode IV* can be seen as the Jedi Order's way of confronting Anakin's ill-fated choice to deny death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. During their duel, Kenobi appears to sacrifice himself, declaring: "If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you could possibly imagine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. Kenobi's willingness to embrace death offered [[darth_vaders_fear_of_death | Vader]] an alternative to his denial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

The Jedi's "immortality" through Force ghosts, as learned by Qui-Gon Jinn and taught to Obi-Wan and Yoda, is not about conquering death but transcending it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. They are technically dead but can interact with the living, contrasting with the Sith's failure to truly defeat death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. Even Anakin joins them after his redemption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

## [[contrast_between_jedi_and_sith_attitudes_towards_death | Luke vs. Anakin]]: Acceptance vs. Denial

The starkest [[contrast_between_jedi_and_sith_attitudes_towards_death | contrast between Jedi and Sith attitudes towards death]] is seen in Anakin and Luke. Anakin's violent rampage against the Tusken Raiders and even his role in Padmé's death exemplify his indiscriminate killing driven by rage and denial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.

Conversely, Luke Skywalker is willing to sacrifice his own life to avoid turning to the dark side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. When urged by Darth Sidious to kill [[darth_vaders_fear_of_death | Vader]], Luke refuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. This willingness to accept death truly separates a Jedi from a Sith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

It is only when Anakin takes a cue from his son and learns to renounce his own life that he finally embraces the reality of death and conquers *jaramarana* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.

> "But you'll die."
> "Nothing can stop that now." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>

## Conclusion

The story of Anakin Skywalker highlights how *jaramarana* can corrupt personalities, strip values, and drive terrible actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. Becker suggests that the denial of death fuels human violence, conquest, and the drive to control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. Both real-world and *Star Wars* "Evil Empires" owe their existence to this inability to accept mortality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.

However, the narrative offers hope: accepting the reality of death, regardless of how much one has invested in denial, can foster dignity, courage, and compassion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. It's never too late to come to terms with death, as shown by [[darth_vaders_fear_of_death | Darth Vader]]'s eventual redemption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>. The alternative is to deny it and risk succumbing to the Dark Side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

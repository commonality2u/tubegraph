Many people have described *Grand Theft Auto V* (GTA V) as a [[satire_social_commentary_and_parody_in_grand_theft_auto_v | satire]], [[satire_social_commentary_and_parody_in_grand_theft_auto_v | social commentary]], or sarcasm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This article explores how the game uses [[freudian_analysis_of_video_games | Freudian psychology]] to craft its main characters—Michael, Franklin, and Trevor—as embodiments of Freud's model of the unconscious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Freudian Character Archetypes

The opening scene of *Grand Theft Auto V* takes place in a therapist's office, suggesting a deliberate psychological underpinning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. The three main protagonists can be seen as incarnations of [[freudian_analysis_of_themes_and_symbols | Freud's model of the unconscious]]:

*   **Michael De Santa (Superego)**: Michael, often whining and punishing, represents the superego <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
*   **Franklin Clinton (Ego)**: The cool-headed and fast-driving Franklin embodies the ego <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
*   **Trevor Phillips (Id)**: Trevor's primal desires to blow things up, engage in sexual acts, and kill make him the ideal fit for the Id, representing "desire run amok" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## Trevor Phillips: The Id and Meta-Gaming

Trevor Phillips is depicted as a depraved, psychopathic "tweaker" residing in Sandy Shores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. His character could prompt discussions on mental health and the war on drugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, but his more pertinent aspect is his relationship to violence, torture, and the state of gaming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. Trevor exhibits a complete lack of qualms about extreme violence, kidnapping, and seduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

### Personification of the Player's Id
Trevor is, in essence, the personification of the average GTA player—the "shit talking crazy person" that individuals become in sandbox worlds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. He reflects the sociopathic behavior most players exhibit in a GTA game, thereby forcing the player to confront the actual manifestation of their virtual actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. While some argue the franchise offers catharsis—a virtual outlet for impulses—Trevor's deliberate psychotic nature suggests something deeper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. He presents the radical possibility that, deep down, people are inherently violent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

The "terror (and macabre pleasure)" derived from Trevor's actions compels players to confront this darker self <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. This creates a meta-fictional element, or "meta-gaming"—games about games—where *Grand Theft Auto V* forces a reflection on the player's own psychic self <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

### The Torture Scene and Satire
The most controversial scene in GTA V involves Trevor torturing an informant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. Trevor takes sadistic pleasure in the act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. This scene prompts the question: who is the real sadist—Trevor or the player indulging their psychopathic urges on fictional characters? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>

This is not a passive acceptance of torture; rather, it serves as an "over-identification" with the sadistic desire to inflict harm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. Over-identification is a tactic that undermines power through mimicry, radically reproducing what is considered taboo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. By forcing the player to violently enact "advanced interrogation techniques," the game provokes a strong reaction—either disgust, subverting the "war on terror" ideology, or sadistic enjoyment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. This provocation aligns with the definition of [[satire_social_commentary_and_parody_in_grand_theft_auto_v | satire]], whose goal is to provoke a response, ideally leading to some kind of reform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

## Michael De Santa: The Superego and Californian Critique

Michael De Santa, a retired bank robber in witness protection, serves as a conduit to discuss the clichéd California lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. His character embodies concerns with the economy, capitalism, personal fitness, paparazzi, celebrity, and media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. As a [[satire_social_commentary_and_parody_in_grand_theft_auto_v | parody]] of the stereotypical Los Angeleano, Michael is routinely enamored with old movies and watches TV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.

His family mirrors these "Hollywood problems": his wife has affairs, his son has identity issues, his psychologist is inept, and his daughter is involved with adult film actors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. Despite railing against capitalism, Michael lives a life of luxury with a yacht, fancy house, and expensive possessions, demonstrating a smug criticism that doesn't challenge the underlying logic of consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

The game's setting itself is a tongue-in-cheek [[satire_social_commentary_and_parody_in_grand_theft_auto_v | parody]] of real California locations, such as Vinewood (Hollywood) and Del Perro Pier (Santa Monica Pier) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. GTA V also critically portrays its media-driven world, targeting radio, television, film, and social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. Michael's storyline digs at the emptiness of the shallow, upper-class California lifestyle, built on appearance, plastic surgery, self-help, leisure, and misery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.

## Franklin Clinton: The Ego and Social Commentary

Franklin Clinton, an ambitious youth from South Los Santos, acts as a catalyst for the game's events, bringing Michael out of retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. His role in the market serves as a critical starting point for discussions on economic corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. The game highlights a stark contrast: despite suspicious deaths and massive stock market gains, no one is ever jailed for insider trading in GTA V <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. This lack of punishment for white-collar criminals is contrasted with the pervasive violence faced by people in the inner city, often from the police (LSPD's motto: "Obey and Survive") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. The LSPD is a caricature of the LAPD, satirizing their history of race relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.

### Commodification and Appropriation of Black Culture
Complicated relations with race are explored through Franklin's interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. Other characters, like Trevor, Jimmy, and Devin, adopt street vernacular when interacting with him, revealing a form of cultural appropriation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. Jimmy, in particular, acts as a foil to Franklin, merely wearing "blackness like a mask" without dealing with the daily realities of being a person of color in America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.

The game assures the player of Franklin's "authentic blackness," such as his nonchalant reaction to weak marijuana compared to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. This appropriation extends to the player, who can "pick up the controller and play an 'original gangsta'" as Franklin, allowing a distance from the racial politics of GTA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>. *Grand Theft Auto V* confronts the desire for a "guilt-free solution to racism" by having players laugh at white characters attempting to act black, while simultaneously controlling a "stereotypical shadow of a black male" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>. The game's self-reflexive nature makes the audience experience the same gratification, offering a nuanced statement on racial politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>.

## Conclusion

To reduce *Grand Theft Auto V* to merely a game about stealing cars and violence misses its deeper critique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>. Michael, Trevor, and Franklin collectively destabilize the player's belief in the validity and seriousness of the game world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>. *Grand Theft Auto* acts as a mirror, reflecting America's true nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>. The developers are portrayed not as vindictive sadists profiting from suffering, but as craftsmen who use the supposed glorification of sex, violence, and torture to create a masterful [[satire_social_commentary_and_parody_in_grand_theft_auto_v | criticism of American culture]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>.

Society is currently experiencing a "crisis of knowing shit" where trust in experts, including scientists, physicians, and government agencies, has rapidly eroded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:07">[00:37:07]</a>. This phenomenon is highlighted by the Flat Earth movement, which has gained significant traction on YouTube and social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. While easy to ridicule, the Flat Earth movement speaks to a broader societal problem rooted in a poor understanding of how science works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:09">[00:59:09]</a>.

## The Philosophy of Science

The [[Philosophy of science and verificationism|philosophy of science]] asks fundamental questions such as how to distinguish science from non-science, how to weigh evidence when testing a hypothesis, and what kind of evidence is acceptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:02">[04:02:02]</a>. A general ignorance of these principles allows for the abuse of scientific language, as seen in the Flat Earth movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>.

### Verificationism

In the early 1900s, logical positivists proposed **verificationism**, which posits that science is something that can be verified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:05">[04:46:05]</a>. If a statement cannot be verified, it is not considered science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:07">[04:57:07]</a>. For example, the statement "this swan is white" can be verified by observation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:03">[05:09:03]</a>. However, this model faced a significant problem with universal statements like "all swans are white" or "all mass exerts gravitational pull," as they can never be truly verified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>.

Flat Earthers sometimes allude to this idea of verification, arguing that since no one has personally seen the Earth from space, it hasn't been "verified" as a globe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:05">[05:35:05]</a>. However, applying this doctrine of individual observation would be extremely limiting for scientific progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:00">[06:35:00]</a>.

### [[Falsification and scientific method|Falsification]]

Philosopher Karl Popper proposed **falsification** as a solution to the problems of verificationism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:01">[07:01:01]</a>. For Popper, good science involves developing a hypothesis and then rigorously trying to prove it wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:07">[07:07:07]</a>. If a statement cannot theoretically be falsified, it is not science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:00">[07:23:00]</a>. For example, if one hypothesizes the Earth is flat, a scientific approach would involve designing experiments to prove it is *not* flat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:00">[07:31:00]</a>. It's important to note that proving the Earth is not flat does not automatically prove it is round, nor does proving it is not round prove it is flat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42:00">[07:42:00]</a>.

Flat Earthers claim to test everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:13:00">[08:13:00]</a>, but their evidence is often flawed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:34:00">[08:34:00]</a>. A key aspect of falsification is trying to prove *one's own theory* wrong, not just disproving others' theories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:36:00">[08:36:00]</a>. For example, the Bedford Level Experiment, a "darling experiment for Flat Earthers," failed to account for confounding variables like atmospheric refraction, which Alfred Russel Wallace later controlled for to show the Earth's curvature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:43:00">[08:43:00]</a>.

### Critiques of [[Falsification and scientific method|Falsificationism]] and Paradigm Shifts

A compelling criticism of [[Falsification and scientific method|falsificationism]] is that tests and hypotheses do not exist in vacuums; they are part of larger, systematized theories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:40:02">[11:40:02]</a>. Physicist Thomas Kuhn proposed that science operates within **paradigms** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:46:05">[12:46:05]</a>. Instead of immediately abandoning a theory when contrary evidence emerges (like Newton's model failing to perfectly predict Mercury's orbit), scientists first try to tweak the model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:51:00">[12:51:00]</a>. A paradigm is only overturned when a "bigger badder paradigm" emerges that can explain everything the old model could, plus the anomalies (e.g., Einstein's relativity replacing Newton's physics) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:56:00">[12:56:00]</a>. This process of scientific progress involves debates over truth before a new paradigm becomes consensus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:45:00">[14:45:00]</a>.

Flat Earthers, while "tweaking" their models to account for contradictory evidence (e.g., claiming "heavenly energies" interfered with a gyroscope's data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:39:00">[13:39:00]</a>), do not qualify as real scientists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:48:00">[13:48:00]</a>. Their "tweaks" are not subjected to new experiments and cannot explain the vast array of phenomena that the round Earth model successfully predicts, such as GPS, aviation, and engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:12:00">[15:12:00]</a>.

## "JAQing Off" and the Erosion of Trust

A significant issue in modern political and internet debates, particularly with movements like Flat Earth, is "JAQing off" (Just Asking Questions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:32:00">[15:32:00]</a>. This tactic involves posing numerous simple questions that place the burden of proof entirely on the opponent, even if the answers are complex and time-consuming to explain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:42:00">[15:42:00]</a>. The goal is to cast doubt on established facts rather than to build consensus or seek truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:56:00">[17:56:00]</a>. Unanswered questions, or those that take time to answer, are then used to suggest the opposing view is wrong or hiding something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:14:00">[18:14:00]</a>.

## Why [[Impact of conspiracy theories on society|Conspiracy Theories]] Persist

[[Impact of conspiracy theories on society|Conspiracy theories]], including Flat Earth, often appeal to individuals who feel powerless or insignificant in society, offering a sense that the world is rational and predictable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:50:00">[18:50:00]</a>. The idea of living on a "special little terrarium" that is the center of the universe can be appealing compared to being a "tiny blue marble drifting in the cosmos" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:11:00">[19:11:00]</a>.

The persistence of Flat Earthers highlights a broader crisis of trust in expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:27:00">[19:27:00]</a>. This erosion of faith is not harmless; it can lead to dangerous outcomes, such as the resurgence of almost extinct diseases due to anti-vaccine sentiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:41:00">[19:41:00]</a>.

To address this, it's crucial not to have blind faith in scientific authorities but to understand the conventions and practices that lead to scientific conclusions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:19:00">[20:19:00]</a>. This includes critically evaluating experimental design, understanding levels of confidence in predictions, and recognizing that contrary evidence doesn't always debunk a model in complex fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:26:00">[20:26:00]</a>.

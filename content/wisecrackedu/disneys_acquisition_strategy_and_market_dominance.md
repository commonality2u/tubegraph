The Walt Disney Company has transformed from an industry giant into an "absolute behemoth" through its aggressive acquisition strategy, leading to significant market dominance in the entertainment industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>. This strategy has allowed Disney to own or license a vast array of popular content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>.

## Historical Context and Early Strategy
Walt Disney's acquisition-driven approach stems from an early experience where he lost the rights to his first successful character, Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, to his distributor who also poached his animators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. This led Disney to vow to "never get screwed again" and to "own everything that he made after that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>.

Early success was predicated on a simple formula: find an existing story, make it "as cute and wholesome as possible to maximize your potential audience," and then profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>. By 1937, *Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs* broke all box office records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>.

## Expanding Empire: Major Acquisitions
In recent decades, Disney has acquired numerous major entities, including:
*   The Muppets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>
*   Pixar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>
*   Marvel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>
*   [[Star Wars fandom backlash and Disney acquisition | Star Wars]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>
*   21st Century Fox (including the X-Men franchise) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>

## Market Dominance in Film
Disney's acquisitions and content strategy result in significant market dominance. For example, in 2019, Disney made 7 of the top 10 highest-grossing films, including *Endgame*, *Aladdin*, *Frozen 2*, and *Toy Story 4* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>. Additionally, many of the top 50 highest-grossing films of all time were either made by or later acquired by Disney <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>.

## The "Cuteness Factory" and its Impact
Disney's sustained success is heavily tied to its "cuteness factory" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57:00">[09:57:00]</a>. This involves taking existing stories, "bleach[ing] it in a caustic vat of cuteness," and releasing them for profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:00">[08:24:00]</a>. This strategy has been consistent for a century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:00">[10:00:00]</a>.

Studies show that cuteness increases concentration and activates the brain's pleasure center, causing dopamine release, which the speaker likens to "Disney branded brain candy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:06:00">[16:06:00]</a>. Cultural theorist Joshua Paul Dale refers to this phenomenon as "evil cute," citing gambling machines using cute cartoon kittens, and suggesting Disney's animated friends might also qualify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:40:00">[16:40:00]</a>.

### Corporate Responsibility and Market Behavior
According to economist Milton Friedman, companies' primary responsibility is to make money, "regardless of the social consequences" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:00:00">[15:00:00]</a>. This "capitalist raison d'Ãªtre" explains Disney's operation as a "cuteness factory" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:30:00">[15:30:00]</a>.

In the 1970s and 1980s, Disney produced "grimmer, edgier films" like *The Black Cauldron*, which were box office failures and nearly caused the company's collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:37:00">[15:37:00]</a>. The "Disney Renaissance" of the 1990s was a "major course correction" back to the "sentimental cuteness" that has since sustained the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:50:00">[15:50:00]</a>.

## Consequences for Storytelling
Disney's "blanket philosophy of cuteness" comes at the expense of story nuance and morality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:09:00">[18:09:00]</a>. This has led to [[criticism_of_disneys_adaptations_of_iconic_stories | criticisms of Disney's adaptations]] that often twist or whitewash original artistic intentions [[Disneys impact on cultural storytelling | Disneys impact on cultural storytelling]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>.

Examples include:
*   **Pinocchio**: The original Carlo Collodi story had Pinocchio gruesomely hanged, and was intended as a bleak morality tale where Pinocchio's suffering was a consequence of his actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00">[06:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:00">[07:06:00]</a>. Disney's version ends happily and whitewashes the character and themes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:00">[06:06:00]</a>.
*   [[The commercialization of fairy tales by Disney | The Little Mermaid]]: Hans Christian Andersen's tale portrayed love as suffering and had the mermaid saved by self-sacrifice rather than romantic love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:02:00">[11:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:56:00">[11:56:00]</a>. Disney's version is a love story with a "happily ever after" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:39:00">[10:39:00]</a>.
*   [[Critique of Disneys portrayal of relationships | Pocahontas]]: Disney's film depicts a love story, while the historical account involves colonists kidnapping a Native American woman and murdering her husband <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:38:00">[12:38:00]</a>.
*   *Sleeping Beauty*: The original tale reportedly involves a woman being non-consensually impregnated while asleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:46:00">[12:46:00]</a>.

This "meat grinder" approach, which polishes off "rough and unsavory edges," can result in "shitty history lessons" and potentially destructive narratives for children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:00:00">[13:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:07:00">[14:07:00]</a>. For example, young girls who identify with Disney heroines believing love conquers all are more likely to end up in abusive relationships as adults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:13:00">[14:13:00]</a>.

### Future Concerns
As Disney continues to expand its control over media, there are concerns that there will be less space for "grittier, darker stories" or "grown-up fairy tales," potentially impacting the diversity and nuance of cultural narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:28:00">[18:28:00]</a>.

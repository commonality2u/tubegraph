[[role_of_irreverence_in_south_parks_narrative | Irreverence]] is a word commonly associated with *South Park*, as nothing in its world is considered sacred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Critics consistently describe the show as [[role_of_irreverence_in_south_parks_narrative | irreverent]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. While this term is often used generally, the show's handling of religion—a subject typically associated with reverence—is unique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. *South Park* frequently challenges viewers to examine their own perceptions of religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a> and poses questions that other series might avoid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## Blurring the Lines Between Profound and Ordinary

The series consistently blurs the distinction between the profound and the ordinary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. In the world of *South Park*, seemingly ordinary things can be highly significant, while concepts typically considered "mindblowingly important" can be trivial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. For example:
*   The boys are not starstruck when interacting with Jesus, yet they argue over who gets to portray him in an Easter play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
*   When granted the opportunity to ask God any question in Season 3, Stan asks about periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
*   The meaning of life, revealed in Season 7, is that Earth is an intergalactic, "Truman Show"-style reality series on the brink of cancellation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.
*   Jesus struggles to attract viewers for his public-access talk show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
*   Satan is depicted as a serial monogamist repeatedly drawn back to Saddam Hussein, despite recognizing the relationship is unhealthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

## Manipulation of Religion

Religion only gains prominence in *South Park* when individuals manipulate it for personal gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. Eric Cartman is presented as the quintessential master of this manipulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. His exploits include:
*   Becoming a wealthy tent revival preacher in Season 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
*   Achieving success in Christian music by repurposing secular pop songs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
*   Forming a fan club around Mel Gibson's *The Passion of the Christ* in "The Passion of the Jew" (Season 8) with the intention of leading the Fourth Reich <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
*   Painting a cow to resemble the biblically prophesied red heifer in Season 17 to vex Kyle, inadvertently leading to world peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

While some interpret *South Park*'s message as religion being inherently ridiculous and making people gullible, creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker largely dispute this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. Stone notes that while the show satirizes many religions, neither he nor Parker are anti-religious, and he finds religion fascinating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

## Durkheim's Sacred and Profane Distinction

*South Park*'s perceived anti-religious stance by some stems from its refusal to treat religion as a sacred subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. Western spiritual traditions often emphasize honoring the sacred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. French sociologist Émile Durkheim, in *The Elementary Forms of Religious Life*, posited that Western religions primarily categorize the world into two radically opposed domains: the sacred and the profane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. The sacred is taken seriously as it pertains to fundamental cosmic forces and the state of the soul, unlike the profane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

*South Park* fundamentally denies the legitimacy of this sacred-profane distinction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. In Season 6's "Red Hot Catholic Love," Father Maxie discovers the Catholic Church is an intergalactic coalition led by a sentient giant spider that condones pedophilia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. Father Maxie's act of tearing a "sacred Vatican Document" symbolizes that the Church could only evolve and be saved if someone was willing to "desecrate" it or expose its issues, much like the *Boston Globe* reporters did with the molestation scandal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. This highlights a recurring theme: sometimes, the only way to preserve something made sacred is by desecrating it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

## The Myth of Redemptive Violence

*South Park* also suggests that society's concept of the sacred is inherently flawed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. Despite Jesus literally walking the Earth, he often goes unnoticed and unrecognized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. His talk show, "Jesus and Pals," is consistently out-rated by "Huntin' and Killin'" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. However, when Jesus engages in combat—something he typically avoids—he is suddenly revered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. This includes battles against Frosty, Santa, Satan, Iraqi soldiers, and other figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. This constant fighting, despite his nature as the "Prince of Peace," is the only way he maintains his followers' respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

This portrayal aligns with theologian Walter Wink's concept of "the myth of redemptive violence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. According to Wink, humanity's sense of the sacred, dating back to ancient Babylonian mythology, is rooted in the desire to see good triumph over evil through conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. Wink argues that this myth is the "real myth of the modern world," surpassing traditional religions in its dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. *South Park*'s Jesus fights because he understands that the myth projected onto him by his followers is more important than his own teachings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. When religious figures are depicted as superheroes, it is a logical conclusion of this myth, highlighting the power it holds over nearly every religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

## Critiques of Self-Righteousness and Human Nature

Beyond its [[south_parks_portrayal_of_religion | casual attitude towards the sacred]], *South Park* is not overtly harsh on religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. A major recurring theme is that one does not need to be religious to be narrow-minded or self-righteous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. Stan's character arc in Season 16 as a self-promotional activist exemplifies this, showing how he enjoys being treated with reverence and moves on from causes once they no longer boost his popularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. This contrasts with Wendy Testaburger, whose motivations are deeper and independent of public approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

The show suggests that movements driven by individuals seeking personal validation are likely to derail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. This applies even to movements like New Atheism. In the two-part episode "Go God Go," Cartman's journey to the 26th century reveals three rival militant atheist factions engaging in lethal conflict over trivial branding disputes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. The implied message is that human beings are inherently violent and irrational, and removing religion will not alter this fundamental aspect of human nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

Stone and Parker's perspective differs from the New Atheist movement in a "chicken-or-egg" question: Is religion ridiculous because people are ridiculous, or vice versa? Stone and Parker hold the latter view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.

Science historian Margaret Wertheim, in *Pythagoras' Trousers*, notes that Western scientific models often resemble religious ones due to a "hypermasculine drive for certainty and finality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. *South Park* agrees with Wertheim that refusing to accept ambiguity can make answers to fundamental questions seem ridiculous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

## Ambiguity and Self-Awareness

*South Park* does not dictate whether one should be religious or not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. Matt Stone has rhetorically asked if a "mass delusion of a religion" that brings happiness and family cohesion is inherently good or bad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>. The show itself makes this argument explicitly in "Red Hot Catholic Love" (Season 6) and "All About Mormons" (Season 7) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:00:41]</a>. The latter episode, after extensively satirizing the new kid Gary's Mormon beliefs and upbeat family life, concludes with Gary defending his faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.

Stone and Parker's view, that both being religious and not being religious can be sensible, echoes American philosopher William James's *Pragmatism* (1907) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. James suggests that whether life was created by a divine figure or not, "it's still life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.

Unlike most series that deal with religion, *South Park* does not offer an escape route or a definitive ideology to avoid being ridiculous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. The show's underlying philosophy is that being human is inherently ridiculous, and this fate is unavoidable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. Regardless of one's adopted religion or life philosophy, *South Park* asserts that taking oneself too seriously will invariably make one appear silly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. The ultimate question, then, is not whether one's belief system is a joke, but whether one is aware of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.

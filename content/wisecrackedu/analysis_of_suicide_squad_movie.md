*Suicide Squad* (2016) is a film that Wisecrack analyzed extensively, despite initial findings suggesting it wasn't as insightful as desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. The film is described as a "unique disaster" from 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>, offering an opportunity to learn from media that "doesn't quite work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## Production and Execution Issues

Warner Bros. reportedly hired the trailer company to "functionally rewrite the movie" after believing the trailer was superior to the actual film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This influence from the marketing team is cited as the reason the first 30 minutes feel like "a music video with too much neon exposition" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. Despite the film being "hacked to shit," it was still considered ambitious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## Core Theme: Control

The primary theme explored in *Suicide Squad* is [[theme_of_control_in_suicide_squad | control]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. This theme is manifested through various relationships and plot points:
*   **Guards and Prisoners:** The "dickbag guards" control and abuse the main characters, who are powerless prisoners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
*   **Amanda Waller and the Squad:** Amanda Waller and Rick Flag control the Squad using a device that kills them if they deviate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
*   **Enchantress and June Moon:** The Enchantress battles for [[theme_of_control_in_suicide_squad | control]] over the body of archaeologist June Moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
*   **Waller and Enchantress:** Amanda Waller controls The Enchantress by stabbing her heart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
*   **Waller and Rick Flag:** Waller also controls Rick Flag by exploiting his love for June Moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
*   **Enchantress's Influence:** The Enchantress controls people by transforming them into "slave monsters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. Her brother also exerts [[theme_of_control_in_suicide_squad | control]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
*   **Diablo's Loss of Control:** Diablo accidentally kills his family after losing [[theme_of_control_in_suicide_squad | control]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   **The Joker and Harley Quinn:** The [[role_of_the_joker_in_suicide_squad | Joker controls]] [[character_analysis_of_the_joker | Harley Quinn]] through their abusive relationship, with her jacket even stating "Property of The Joker" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

### Control in the Snyder DC Universe

The [[theme_of_control_in_suicide_squad | theme of control]] is prevalent throughout the Snyder DC Universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
*   **Man of Steel:** Raises the question of how humanity can maintain [[theme_of_control_in_suicide_squad | control]] when metahumans with godlike powers exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. The implied answer is reliance on a benevolent savior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
*   **Batman V Superman:** Explores the risk of a benevolent savior turning hostile and the need for humanity to maintain order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   **Suicide Squad's Place:** Following Superman's death, *Suicide Squad* is positioned to ask how far humanity must go to maintain [[theme_of_control_in_suicide_squad | control]] in the absence of its metahuman bodyguard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. While *Batman V Superman* explored the ramifications of a god-like being's power over humanity, *Suicide Squad* should explore the ramifications of humans wielding overwhelming power to fight godlike beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

Amanda Waller is compared to the divine, as both God and the Devil, raising the question of whether her quest for [[theme_of_control_in_suicide_squad | control]] will go too far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.

## Missed Thematic Opportunities

The film establishes a "pretty cool thematic setup" for moral conundrums, such as whether tyrannical [[theme_of_control_in_suicide_squad | control]] is necessary against existential threats (like in *The Dark Knight*) or if such oppression is inherently evil (like in *One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest*) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. However, *Suicide Squad* resolves neither of these questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

As an "anti-superhero movie," the film attempts to make viewers identify with the prisoners, showing their humanity and suffering (e.g., daughters, regrets, emotional abuse), while depicting those in power as lacking humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. This setup, where even the Enchantress is a victim of [[theme_of_control_in_suicide_squad | control]], creates an opportunity for thematic interplay and a moral gray area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.

### The Villain's Failure

Instead of developing this moral complexity, the film resorts to "the lamest of superhero movie tropes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a> by making Enchantress a "bland, evil villain" who wants to destroy the world with a vague motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. This simplification of evil robs the themes of [[theme_of_control_in_suicide_squad | control]] and oppression of any meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

The film fails to develop the idea that oppressive power is necessary, as the Squad defeats Enchantress of their own accord <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. It also doesn't suggest that oppressive power is evil, given that Waller ultimately wins and her corrupt status quo is reinstated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. The film is summarized as "a movie about subjugated people defending their own imprisonment against someone who's also been a victim of control, but not in a cool way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

## [[role_of_the_joker_in_suicide_squad | The Joker's Role]]

A significant criticism of the film is that [[role_of_the_joker_in_suicide_squad | Jared Leto's Joker]] serves no purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. However, one line from the [[character_analysis_of_the_joker | Joker]] — "desire becomes surrender, surrender becomes power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a> — hints at a thematic contribution.

This concept is briefly seen at the end when Enchantress attempts to seduce the Squad by showing them their desires (Harley's normal life with the [[character_analysis_of_the_joker | Joker]], Deadshot killing Batman, Diablo's family) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. Their desire makes them want to surrender, which would grant Enchantress power over them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.

While there are hints of an attempt to establish an arc for [[character_analysis_of_the_joker | Harley Quinn]] related to desire, surrender, and power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>, this is not developed. Harley begins by submitting to the [[character_analysis_of_the_joker | Joker's]] domination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>, but later rejects Enchantress's domination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. However, this is not a true lesson for Harley, as she returns to being "under the thumb of the Joker" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>. Thus, the [[role_of_the_joker_in_suicide_squad | Joker's]] line ultimately fails to meaningfully develop the [[theme_of_control_in_suicide_squad | theme of control]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.

## Conclusion

*Suicide Squad* contains a "spark of intelligence" that suggests earlier, better versions of the film were likely abandoned by the studio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. Despite its initial ambition, the film's final execution resulted in a narrative that fails to coherently explore its central themes, particularly [[theme_of_control_in_suicide_squad | control]] and the nature of good and evil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

*To Kill a Mockingbird* by Harper Lee offers a direct [[social_critique_using_popular_media | criticism]] of the American South during The Depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. The novel highlights systemic issues within its institutions, including the courts, schools, and the church, all depicted as being influenced by corrupt individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

## Unjust Legal System

A central element of this critique is the portrayal of the justice system through the trial of Tom Robinson. Tom, a Black man, is accused of raping Mayella Ewell, the daughter of Bob Ewell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. Despite defense lawyer Atticus Finch's compelling argument, which reveals that Mayella Ewell was the one who made advances toward Tom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>, Tom is unjustly convicted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. This conviction is explicitly attributed to his race <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

### Symbolism of Jim's Arm

The character of Jem, Scout's "crippled brother" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, serves as a metaphor for America's flawed justice system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. Jem's early injury is presented as a synecdoche for a nation founded on "backward ass ideals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. While such flaws might appear to heal, they leave a lasting, disabling scar on the nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

## Racism and Ignorance

The novel initially presents Scout as embodying the racism and ignorance prevalent in the Southern society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. However, her experiences with Boo Radley and Tom Robinson lead to her maturation and a shift in perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

## Theme of Exposure to Difference

A core theme of the book is the importance of learning valuable lessons through exposure to people from different backgrounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. Scout undergoes a "paradigm shifting moment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a> by interacting with Boo Radley and Tom Robinson, learning that individuals from different walks of life are all "just be tryin' to hustle like anybody else" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

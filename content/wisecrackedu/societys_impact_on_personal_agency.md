The *Rick and Morty* episode "Rickmancing the Stone" explores the concept of modern alienation and how society may "slowly destroy our souls" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:00">[00:53:00]</a>, specifically highlighting how individuals lose [[critique_of_character_agency_in_the_film | agency]] in their everyday lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>.

## Modern Alienation and Loss of Control

The episode tackles alienation on both a micro level (family dynamics, as experienced by Summer and Morty) and a macro level (the alienation of society as a whole) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>. Rick introduces the idea of alienation, suggesting that Summer's disillusionment with Jerry could only be remedied by traveling to a place where civilization has crumbled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>.

This theme posits that modern society inherently fosters alienating conditions, turning individuals into "Jerrys" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>.

## Jerry as the "Everyman" of Powerlessness

Jerry serves as a central example of society's impact on personal agency, characterized by a complete lack of "personal resolve, power, agency" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>. He is portrayed as a "doormat to the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.

### Historical Context of Lost Autonomy
Morty's resentment towards Jerry's powerlessness stems from a broader societal issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>. Since the industrial revolution, there have been complaints about a loss of control in the modern world, as many individuals now "toil away at monotonous jobs" instead of having their own trade or farm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>. Jerry is presented as the "pinnacle of modern stoogery" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>, an embodiment of existence as a "cog in a meaningless machine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>.

Jerry's inability to assert himself is evident in his interactions with Rick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>. Rick describes him as "an inert chunk of randomly assembled molecules drifting wherever the universe blows" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>. In the episode "The Rickshank Redemption," Jerry even thrives in a society "devoid of freedom," where the Galactic Federation keeps everyone "compliant and docile through a liberal use of pharmaceuticals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>.

### The Cronenberg Earth Counterpoint
A contrasting version of Jerry exists on "Cronenberg Earth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>. When "stripped of the trappings of modern society," this Jerry transforms from a "useless hack in a loveless marriage" into a "total badass who seems to be keeping his marriage together" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>. This highlights the show's argument that the comforts and structures of modern society are inherently alienating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>.

## Modernization's Alienating Effects

The episode demonstrates this by showing what happens when Rick introduces electricity and modern comforts to the Mad Max-inspired Wasteland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>. The once-savage world quickly begins to resemble an industrialized society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>:
*   Summer's violent lifestyle is replaced by "everyday banalities," such as "grocery shopping for human bits" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>.
*   The Death Stalkers' savagery is reduced to "complaining about recycling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:00">[05:34:00]</a>.
*   Hemorrhage, a "murdering machine," becomes a "good-for-nothing couch potato" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:38:00">[05:38:00]</a>.

The implication is that modern comforts contribute to "banal, terrible lives" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:45:00">[05:45:00]</a>. Without external threats, people resort to "bickering about trivialities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>, and entertainment shifts from direct participation in "Blood Dome" combat to simply "watching blood-dome" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>.

While post-apocalyptic fiction often warns of future degradation, *Rick and Morty* suggests that modern life itself is a "special brand of soul crushing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:00">[06:06:00]</a>. Modern comforts ultimately "alienate us from meaning, creating different kinds of misery" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>. This leads to the speculative question of whether Summer forgives her father because she realizes that "modernization turns EVERY man into an actionless lump," even a post-apocalyptic "badass" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:00">[06:35:00]</a>.

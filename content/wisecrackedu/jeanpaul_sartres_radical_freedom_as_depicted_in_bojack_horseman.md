*BoJack Horseman* initially appears to be a light-hearted cartoon with its colorful animation and talking animals, but beneath this veneer lies a dark and often depressing reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>. The show delves into profound philosophical themes, including the inevitable disillusionment that comes with looking beneath the surface of [[bojack_horsemans_portrayal_of_hollywood_and_disillusionment | Hollywood glamour]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:26">[00:25:26]</a>. More broadly, "Hollywoo" serves as a metaphor for existence itself, where daily life's trappings conceal the [[Existential Nihilism in BoJack Horseman | meaninglessness of existence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. This concept, known as [[Existential Nihilism in BoJack Horseman | existential nihilism]], is foundational to *BoJack Horseman* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>.

## BoJack's Rejection of Responsibility

From the outset, BoJack struggles with and frequently rejects personal responsibility, expressing sentiments like, "I’m responsible for my own happiness? I can’t even be responsible for my own breakfast" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42:30">[07:42:30]</a>. He desires to escape the consequences of his poor life choices, exclaiming, "I didn't do anything wrong because I can't do anything wrong. EVERYTHING IS MEANINGLESS! NOTHING I DO HAS CONSEQUENCE!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a>. After a bender, BoJack questions Diane, "Am I just doomed to be the person that I am? The person in that book?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58:50">[07:58:50]</a>. He seeks reassurance that "deep down" he is a good person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a>.

## [[Existentialism and Jean Paul Sartres philosophy | Radical Freedom]]

BoJack's fear of his true nature and his inability to reconcile with it are directly linked to what 20th-century French philosopher [[Existentialism and Jean Paul Sartres philosophy | Jean-Paul Sartre]] termed "[[Existentialism and Jean Paul Sartres philosophy | Radical Freedom]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10:48">[08:10:48]</a>, a core tenet of [[Existentialism and Jean Paul Sartres philosophy | Existentialism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:16:00">[08:16:00]</a>. Interestingly, BoJack himself dismisses Sartre, stating, "I stand by my critique of 'Sartre'. His philosophical arguments helped many tyrannical regimes justify over-cruelty. Also the French smell and I hate them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:19:56">[08:19:56]</a>.

At the heart of [[Existentialism and Jean Paul Sartres philosophy | Existentialism]] is the catchphrase: "Existence Precedes Essence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29:20">[08:29:20]</a>. Sartre defined an object's "essence" as its purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:22">[08:31:22]</a>. For instance, a hammer's purpose (hammering) precedes its creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:10">[08:35:10]</a>. In a religious context, humans might be seen as tools created by God with a specific purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:43:24">[08:43:24]</a>.

However, for an [[Existential Nihilism in BoJack Horseman | Existential Nihilist]], humans – and horsemen – simply exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:49:09">[08:49:09]</a>. There is no inherent purpose or predetermined path for BoJack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:57:07">[08:57:07]</a>. This lack of inherent meaning means there's nothing compelling him to act in a certain way, nor anything stopping him from actions like stealing the 'D' from the Hollywood sign or engaging in extensive drug use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:00">[09:01:00]</a>. BoJack possesses complete control over every choice he makes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:32">[09:11:32]</a>.

### "Condemned to be Free"

This concept of total control is what Sartre termed "[[Existentialism and Jean Paul Sartres philosophy | Radical Freedom]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:15">[09:14:15]</a>. It's not meant to be comforting:
> "That is what I mean when I say that man is condemned to be free. Condemned, because he did not create himself, yet is nevertheless at liberty, and from the moment that he is thrown into this world he is responsible for EVERYTHING he does" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:19:07">[09:19:07]</a>.

This idea is echoed in the show through Diane's blunt observation to BoJack: "That’s the thing, I don’t think I believe in 'deep down'. I kinda think all you are is just the things that you do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:33:04">[09:33:04]</a>, to which BoJack responds, "Well that's depressing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:39:35">[09:39:35]</a>. The show posits that there is no inherent "good BoJack" hidden underneath; he is entirely defined by the choices he has made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:40:48">[09:40:48]</a>. Todd reinforces this when he tells BoJack, "You are all the things that are wrong with you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>.

## Hope in [[Existentialism and Jean Paul Sartres philosophy | Radical Freedom]]

Despite the potentially grim implications, Sartre's concept of [[Existentialism and Jean Paul Sartres philosophy | Radical Freedom]] offers BoJack a crucial glimmer of hope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:54:30">[09:54:30]</a>. While he is defined by his past choices, he is not "doomed to be the person in that book" forever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:01:23">[10:01:23]</a>. The freedom to choose also implies the freedom to change his actions and, consequently, himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:00">[10:04:00]</a>. This responsibility for change rests entirely on him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:00">[10:07:00]</a>, encapsulated in the advice: "It's never too late to be the person you want to be. You need to choose the life you want" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:10:20">[10:10:20]</a>.

The show offers an optimistic take on Sartre's philosophy by using water as a metaphor for BoJack's [[Existentialism and Jean Paul Sartres philosophy | Radical Freedom]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:17:16">[10:17:16]</a>. Initially, BoJack is often overwhelmed by water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:20:00">[10:20:00]</a>. However, by the end of the underwater episode in Season 3, after falling from a ledge, he finally recognizes water not as a scary or overwhelming force, but as a "medium of incredible opportunity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:29:00">[10:29:00]</a>. This transformation signifies his potential to embrace his freedom and choose a different path.

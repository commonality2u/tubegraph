Darth Vader, arguably cinema's most iconic villain, is deeply influenced by an all-consuming fear of death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. His [[anakin_skywalkers_transformation_into_darth_vader | transformation into Darth Vader]] is ultimately driven by the fear of loss, specifically the fear of death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. Star Wars explores two distinct [[philosophical_responses_to_death_in_star_wars | philosophical responses to death]] through his journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Ernest Becker's "The Denial of Death"

Cultural anthropologist Ernest Becker, in his 1973 book *The Denial of Death*, posits that much of human action is a means of managing the fear of one's own demise and the demise of loved ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. This concept, known as "death denial," is prominently featured in the character of Darth Vader, with roots tracing back to his childhood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

## Childhood Roots of Anakin's Fear

Young Anakin Skywalker's distress over his mother's mortality becomes a haunting fixation as he ages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. Yoda quickly recognizes this fear as a significant problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>, observing Anakin's thoughts dwell on his mother and his fear of losing her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

## Jedi Training and Death Denial

The Jedi's initial hesitation to train Anakin due to his age may be linked to concerns about death denial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. While never explicitly stated in canon, the dialogue suggests Yoda and Mace Windu worry about the ramifications of Anakin's already-formed understanding of death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. Training younger children makes it easier to indoctrinate them not to fear death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. Children typically begin to understand death as permanent between ages 5-9, but only later, around age 10, do they grasp its universal permanence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. At nine years old, Anakin is on the cusp of realizing his own mortality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

## The Price of Fear: Violence and Control

Becker argues that human violence is a natural response to death denial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. Inflicting death provides an illusion of control over it, which can manifest as violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. For Anakin, this leads him down the Dark Side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

Anakin's statement, "Fear attracts the fearful. He was trying to overcome his fear by squashing you. Be less afraid," though cut from *Episode I*, foreshadows his arc <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. He attempts to "squash" death to gain control over his anxiety about losing loved ones, rather than overcoming the fear itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. When his mother is mortally wounded, Anakin massacres an entire Tusken Raider village <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. This act aligns with Becker's view that killing others provides the illusion of controlling death, assuaging the very fear the Jedi Council warned about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. The more he kills, the more he feels a sense of ownership over death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

## Competing Philosophies: Jedi vs. Sith on Death

Anakin's anxiety dreams about Padmé dying in childbirth present him with a choice: the Sith way or the Jedi way of dealing with death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. This represents a fundamental [[contrast_between_jedi_and_sith_attitudes_towards_death | contrast between Jedi and Sith attitudes towards death]].

### Yoda and the Jedi Way: Nonattachment

Yoda's advice to Anakin is rooted in Buddhism: "Train yourself to let go of everything you fear to lose" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. The Buddhist concept of *jaramarana*—the desire to escape old age and death—is seen as a dangerous impulse, with nonattachment being the path to defeat it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. Yoda exemplifies this by accepting his own death with serenity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.

Becker describes Yoda as a "knight of faith," someone who manages terror through authentic faith in something more powerful than death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. For Yoda, this nonattachment to *jaramarana* is grounded in his faith in the light side of the Force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. He views death as a natural part of life, urging others to rejoice for those who transform into the Force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

### Palpatine and the Sith Way: Conquering Death

Anakin, lacking Yoda's faith, turns to Palpatine. The Sith embrace desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>, including the desire to prevent death, which is a form of death denial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. Palpatine tempts Anakin with the legend of Darth Plagueis the Wise, implying the dark side can enable one to defeat death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. Anakin becomes a Sith Lord on the condition that he can save Padmé's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

## The Terminal Point of Death Denial: Darth Vader's Transformation

In his refusal to accept death, Anakin sacrifices his identity, loyalty, and conscience to protect Padmé <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. This leads him to murder children, his wife, and attempt to kill his mentor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. He becomes "little more than a zombie trapped in a machine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. Becker describes this as the "terminal point of death denial": the individual avoids death by "killing off so much of himself" that he becomes "as though dead" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. With no one left to protect, Darth Vader becomes merely an instrument of power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.

## Obi-Wan's Sacrifice: A Demonstration of Acceptance

Obi-Wan Kenobi's death in *Episode IV* can be seen as the Jedi Order's way of confronting Anakin's fatal choice rooted in death denial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. During their duel, Kenobi seemingly offers himself as a sacrifice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>, declaring, "If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you could possibly imagine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>. His transcendence into a Force ghost demonstrates an alternative solution, showcasing a willingness to embrace death that contrasts sharply with Vader's denial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. Kenobi learns to "cheat death" by communing with Qui-Gon Jinn, who returned from the netherworld of the Force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. This is not conquering death but transcending it, allowing interaction with living Jedi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.

## Luke Skywalker's Example: Acceptance vs. Denial

The contrast between death denial and death acceptance is further highlighted by Anakin and Luke's confrontations with death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. Anakin's most telling confrontation was his indiscriminate slaughter of the Tusken Raiders, and ultimately, his rage-fueled actions contributing to Padmé's demise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. In contrast, Luke is willing to sacrifice his own life to avoid turning to the dark side and becoming what he hates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. His refusal to kill Vader, even when ordered by Darth Sidious, illustrates this willingness to accept death, which is what truly separates a Jedi from a Sith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

Only when Anakin takes a cue from his son and renounces his own life does he embrace the reality of death and conquer *jaramarana* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.

## The Legacy of Death Denial

The story of [[anakin_skywalkers_transformation_into_darth_vader | Anakin Skywalker's transformation into Darth Vader]] serves as a cautionary tale: *jaramarana* can corrupt personalities, strip away values, and drive individuals to terrible actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. Becker suggests that death denial is a root cause of human violence, conquest, and the drive to control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. Both real-world and fictional "Evil Empires" owe their existence to this inability to accept mortality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. However, accepting the reality of death can foster dignity, courage, and compassion, offering a path away from the Dark Side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.

[[rick_and_morty_episode_analysis | Rick and Morty]] is praised for its mastery of story structure by showrunners Dan Harmon and Justin Roiland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. This article explores the storytelling principles applied in the show, particularly through the lens of Dan Harmon's "story embryo" and its adaptation for television <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Dan Harmon's Story Embryo

Dan Harmon posits that every story, regardless of its scale, adheres to eight fundamental steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. This structure, which Harmon terms "the story embryo," unfolds as follows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>:

1.  A character is in a zone of comfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
2.  But they want something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
3.  They enter an unfamiliar situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
4.  Adapt to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
5.  Get what they wanted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
6.  Pay a heavy price for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
7.  Then return to their familiar situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
8.  Having changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

## Story Structure in Television

While the story embryo is a universal template, its application can vary based on genre and medium, especially for television <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. Unlike movies, which aim for a conclusive high, television's primary goal is to maintain viewer engagement indefinitely, often by preserving the status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. Harmon notes that television shows are less about meaningful internal change and more about preserving the existing state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

The structure of a typical TV episode often looks like this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>:

1.  "I (the protagonist)" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>
2.  "Notice a small problem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>
3.  "And make a major decision" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>
4.  "This changes things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>
5.  "To some satisfaction, but" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>
6.  "There are consequences" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>
7.  "That must be undone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>
8.  "And I must admit the futility of change" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>

## Application in [[rick_and_morty_episode_analysis | Rick and Morty]]

[[rick_and_morty_episode_analysis | Rick and Morty]] consistently follows this adapted television format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. A prime example is [[rick_and_morty_season_3_episode_6_breakdown | Season 2, Episode 6: "The Ricks Must Be Crazy"]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

### Step 1: Establish a Protagonist in a Zone of Comfort
The episode quickly establishes the protagonists, Summer, Rick, and Morty, coming out of a movie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. This opening efficiently introduces the characters and their world within 20 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

### Step 2: Introduce a Small Problem and Establish a Need
Life isn't perfect, and for the Sanchez family, this is evident when Rick's ship refuses to start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. Rick identifies the central problem: the Microverse Battery is dead, requiring them to go inside to fix it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. Morty's reluctance ("Um, go inside what?") is a narrative device that helps the audience identify with him and become more invested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

### Step 3: The Protagonist Makes a Major Decision and Enters an Unfamiliar Situation
This step marks the descent into the unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. Rick and Morty literally shrink down to enter a world within Rick's car battery, posing as aliens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. The contrast between their comfort zone and this new, completely foreign world—populated by Martian-like people who venerate Rick for giving them electricity via "Gooble Boxes"—is significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. Unbeknownst to them, the Gooble Boxes redirect most of their generated power to Rick's ship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

### Step 4: Characters Adapt to the New Situation and Things Must Change
This stage focuses on external change rather than internal [[character_development_in_rick_and_morty | character development]], aligning with television's goal of preserving the status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. Upon entering the Microverse, Rick and Morty identify the immediate problem: Zeep Xanflorp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. Zeep, a carbon copy of Rick, has created his own Microverse, rendering Rick's Gooble Boxes obsolete and making his car battery unusable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. Rick, despite the clear hypocrisy, shamelessly parrots Morty's earlier objections to him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. The new conflict introduced is Rick's need to find a scientist in Zeep's Microverse who is also working on their own Microverse, which would threaten Zeep's system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

### Step 5: The Character Gets What They Wanted
This is the story's major turning point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. Rick achieves his goal by finding Kyle, a scientist within Zeep's Microverse who is creating his own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. This leads to an "Inception-like moment" of a Microverse within a Microverse within another Microverse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. Rick observes as Zeep repeats the "slavery with extra steps" rant to Kyle, a comedic callback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. However, Zeep soon realizes his own universe is a Microverse brought into being by Rick, leading to an existential rage and a physical fight between Rick and Zeep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. Simultaneously, Kyle suffers an existential collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.

### Step 6: Paying a Heavy Price and Suffering the Consequences
Rick's triumph is short-lived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. While he gets his desired Microverse, demonstrating Zeep's hypocrisy causes Kyle's suicidal meltdown, trapping them all in the Tinyverse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. Rick and Zeep, unable to overcome their egos, blame each other and declare war instead of cooperating to escape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. Observing their futile conflict, Morty decides to live with the Tree People <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.

### Step 7: Undoing the Damage and Returning the Familiar World
Morty, with his primitive tribe, forces Rick and Zeep to forge an alliance and engineer an escape from Kyle's Tinyverse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. Once outside, Zeep attempts to trap Rick in the surrounding Microverse to protect his own, acting as a "shadow" figure to Rick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. [[character_development_and_anticharacter_development_in_rick_and_morty | Zeep is a dark reflection of Rick's undesirable traits and neuroses]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. The fight between Rick and Zeep at the episode's conclusion highlights [[inversion_of_common_cliches_and_tropes_in_rick_and_morty | Rick's lack of desire to change]], effectively being "Rick fighting Rick" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.

### Step 8: Change or the Futility of It
For television, this step emphasizes the futility of change, as the hero cannot be fulfilled to ensure future adventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. Rick and Morty return to their "Ball Fondlers" reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. Rick reveals that Zeep had to choose between returning to Gooble Box technology or having Rick discard a broken battery, ultimately opting for the former <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>. The episode concludes with Rick, Morty, and Summer getting ice cream, with Morty and Summer shell-shocked by the return to normalcy after their ordeal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.

[[rick_and_morty_episode_analysis | Rick and Morty]] masterfully employs this circular structure to make its audience "confront the depressing, crippling futility of change" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>. Rick successfully re-enslaves a planet for his car battery, all for a seemingly trivial reward like ice cream, reinforcing the show's underlying message about the lack of lasting transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>.

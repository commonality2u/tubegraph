*Frozen*, an animated film, won an Academy Award for its song "Let It Be" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. The story follows a princess who possesses "unexplained mutant ice powers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a> and accidentally gives her younger sister, [[Character analysis of Elsa and Anna | Anna]], "brain-freeze" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This event leads to [[Character analysis of Elsa and Anna | Elsa]] isolating herself for a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. The film explores themes of isolation, connection, and different forms of love, while utilizing symbolic elements like ice, fire, and doors.

## Elemental Symbolism

*Frozen* is presented as a musical examining the "dueling properties of two of Earth’s most cherished elements — a song of ice and fire" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>.

### Anna and Fire

[[Character analysis of Elsa and Anna | Anna]] is associated with fire, symbolizing warmth and passion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. Her fiery red hair and sunspots (freckles) on her shoulders further reinforce this connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>. She also uses fire as a weapon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>. When Hans, a prince, reveals his true intentions, he extinguishes a fire, symbolically extinguishing the passion [[Character analysis of Elsa and Anna | Anna]] felt for him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>.

### Elsa and Ice

[[Character analysis of Elsa and Anna | Elsa]] is associated with ice, representing coldness and rationality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>. She believes the key to life is to inhibit her feelings, stating, "Don't feel. Don't feel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>. [[Character analysis of Elsa and Anna | Elsa]] isolates herself and trades her traditional clothes for a revealing, skin-tight, transparent dress, which suggests liberation, possibly even sexual liberation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>. However, it is only by embracing the love of her sister that she finds fulfillment and the happiness that comes with social solidarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>.

## Key Themes

### Independence vs. Connection

The film suggests that independence can be a mistake, aligning with what is described as Disney's "mob mentality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>. The narrative implies that all people require connection, and a solitary person is considered incomplete and in need of "fixing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>. Medical staff in the film state, "We need each other to fix us up and round us out!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>.

### Redefining True Love

*Frozen* is considered progressive because the protagonists' redemption comes from sisterly love, rather than romantic love from a prince <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>. The film critiques the adage of "love at first sight," exemplified by the swift courtship of Prince Hans, which is proven to be trivial and misguided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:00">[04:35:00]</a>. Even with a promising suitor like Kristoff, there is no definitive wedding, as the couple chooses to take their relationship slow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:00">[04:38:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>.

## [[Symbolism of doors in Frozen | Symbolism of Doors and Gates]]

A recurring motif in the film is the door <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>.

*   The film begins with the kingdom's gates closed, and the two princesses are depicted as stuck within <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>.
*   A significant door separates the sisters throughout their childhood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>.
*   [[Character analysis of Elsa and Anna | Elsa]] famously sings, "Turn away and slam the door!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>.
*   [[Character analysis of Elsa and Anna | Anna]] later pleads with her, "Please don't slam the door" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>.
*   One of the film's final lines is, "I like the open gates. We’re never closing them again" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>. The subtext here suggests that [[Character analysis of Elsa and Anna | Elsa]] will no longer shut out her sister, but also that the kingdom will remain susceptible to attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:23:00">[05:23:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>.

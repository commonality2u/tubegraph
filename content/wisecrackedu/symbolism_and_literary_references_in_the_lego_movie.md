*The Lego Movie*, featuring yellow humanoid Emmet Brickowski, initially appears as a children's film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. However, it functions as a satirical critique of the 21st-century American political, economic, and social landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>, while also weaving in deep literary and [[existential_themes_in_the_lego_movie | existential themes]].

## [[the_lego_movies_satire_of_politics_and_corporations | Satirical Symbolism and Corporate Control]]

The film employs numerous symbolic elements to satirize contemporary society:

*   **President Business**
    *   His name itself is a juxtaposition, indicating he is both a political leader and driven by profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. This satirizes the influence of money over politics and the increasingly blurred line between corporate and political power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
    *   As a corporate despot, President Business aims to maintain the status quo by gluing everyone in place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. He uses his economic control to subjugate citizens, even wielding a coin as a weapon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.
    *   The film depicts a prime example of crony capitalism, where a single corporation controls all media, business, government, and interpersonal interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
*   **Octan Energy Corp**
    *   This entity is a subtle reference to real-world corporate giants that once dominated life on Earth, such as Google Plus, Bing, and Tidal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
*   **Controlling the Proletariat**
    *   Citizens are subdued into silence and complacency through the allure of "Taco Tuesday" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
    *   Submission is also achieved by watching "Where Are My Pants," a show that pokes fun at mindless television and its cheap, short-form, internet-only facsimiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

## [[literary_allusions_and_references_in_the_matrix | Literary Allusions]]

The film is rich with [[literary_allusions_and_references_in_the_matrix | literary allusions]] and references:

*   **George Orwell's *1984***
    *   A "I've got my eye on you" poster and surveillance camera directly evoke George Orwell's classic dystopian novel, *1984*, highlighting themes of pervasive oversight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
*   **Aristophanes' "The Birds"**
    *   "Cloud Cuckoo Land" is a reference to a play by Aristophanes called "The Birds," which features a chaotic realm of the same name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
*   **Vitruvius**
    *   The character Vitruvius is named after a Roman author who wrote a ten-volume work on architecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. This author later inspired Da Vinci to create his famous "Vitruvian Man" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

## [[existential_themes_in_the_lego_movie | Existential and Religious Symbolism]]

The Lego Movie delves into [[existential_themes_in_the_lego_movie | bizarre existential undertones]]:

*   **Illusion of Free Will**
    *   After a "death trip into oblivion," Emmet enters a heightened reality where he realizes free will is an illusion, and he is merely a puppet controlled by a "snot-nosed fleshmonster" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
    *   Emmet's act of wiggling off the table symbolizes an [[existential_themes_in_the_lego_movie | existential rebellion]], as he refuses to be defined by societal overlords, his God, or even a beloved child star <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.
*   **Emmet as a Religious Figure**
    *   Emmet's name means "truth" in Hebrew, making him an appropriate religious figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
    *   His entry into the "real world" symbolizes death, and his eventual return is depicted as a Christ-like resurrection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

## [[creativity_and_individualism_versus_conformity_in_the_lego_movie | Symbolism of Conformity vs. Creativity]]

Ultimately, The Lego Movie is a celebration of [[creativity_and_individualism_versus_conformity_in_the_lego_movie | creativity and individualism]] over uniformity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>:

*   Emmet lives in a society as rigid as the Lego blocks themselves, where his individual will is smothered by instructions and a catchy song <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.
*   To become "the Special," Emmet learns he must "embrace what is special about YOU" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. This message encourages viewers not to be just another cog in a larger machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

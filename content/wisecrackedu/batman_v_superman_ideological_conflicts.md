*Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice* is critiqued for its ideological failings, despite ambitious attempts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## The Challenge of Superman's Relatability
One significant challenge for the architects of the DCEU was making Superman a relatable character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. It is difficult to identify with an indestructible, selfless, god-like figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. The solution was to portray him with vulnerabilities, flaws, and doubts, emphasizing his humanity, similar to how *The Last Temptation of Christ* approached a benevolent messiah figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. This approach shows Superman torn between being a benevolent savior and focusing on personal interests, such as Lois Lane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. However, this artistic choice complicates the fundamental premise of a rivalry between Batman and Superman based on [[comparison_of_batman_and_supermans_ideologies | differing ideologies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

## Inspiration from *The Dark Knight Returns*
*Batman v Superman* draws heavily from Frank Miller’s graphic novel *The Dark Knight Returns* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. Similarities include:
*   An older, broken Bruce Wayne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
*   Superman being hit by a nuclear warhead and healed by the sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
*   Robin’s memorialized costume in Batman’s lair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
*   The central fight between Batman and Superman, with Superman trying to reason and Batman refusing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

### [[ayn_rands_philosophy_in_batman_v_superman | Ayn Rand’s Philosophy]] and its Influence
Beneath the surface of *The Dark Knight Returns* lies an unlikely inspiration: Ayn Rand’s novel *The Fountainhead* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. While the film takes cues from Miller, *The Fountainhead* solidified the ideological distinction between Batman and Superman in the graphic novel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

Zack Snyder has reportedly tried to make a *Fountainhead* movie for years, and Frank Miller cites Rand as a significant influence on his work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. Both Miller and Snyder are drawn to Rand’s depiction of male heroes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

#### The Randian Hero: Ethical Egoism
In *The Fountainhead*, protagonist Howard Roark embodies the "ideal man" – someone who achieves his goals and maintains integrity despite obstacles, even if it leads to conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. This Randian hero is defined by "ethical egoism," the belief that the best course of action is always what serves one's best interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. This pursuit of self-interest is a central tenet of [[ayn_rands_philosophy_in_batman_v_superman | Ayn Rand’s philosophy]], Objectivism, which posits that happiness is achieved through self-interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. To Rand, a male hero is a radical individualist: unyielding, intelligent, and physically appealing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

## Batman's Ideology in *Batman v Superman*
Miller’s Batman perfectly fits Rand’s "Ideal Man" description: a super-rich, handsome playboy with a genius intellect who refuses to bend to anyone’s will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. It is [[batman_as_a_force_of_order_versus_morality | Batman's adherence to Randian egoism]] that creates the ideological conflict with Superman: individualism versus collectivism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

In Miller’s work, Batman faces constant obstruction from the US Government, which tasks the ultimate "conformist" (Superman) to stop him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. Superman is portrayed as the anti-Rand figure—self-sacrificing, morally righteous, and seen as a "Government Stooge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. The drama in Miller's graphic novel stems from these differing ideologies: Batman's individualism versus Superman's conformism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. Miller successfully instills the spirit of Rand's theories to create a compelling conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

*Batman v Superman* does succeed in depicting Batman in line with Miller’s Randian take <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. Ben Affleck's Batman is handsome, "supernaturally athletic," smarter than others, and a "complete individualist" who refuses to bend his will, even to the judicial process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. He even brands criminals for shanking in prison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. Batman's concern about a god-like Superman may stem from Rand's atheism; a God figure undermines the ethical egoism principle, as it prevents making choices based purely on one's own rationality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

## Superman's Muddled Ideology in *Batman v Superman*
While the film gets the Randian version of Batman correct, the depiction of Superman becomes muddled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. The filmmakers avoided creating a purely benevolent, do-gooder Superman to make him more relatable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. Conversely, they didn't make him the collectivist "stooge" Miller did, to ensure audience appeal for future *Justice League* films <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

Previous depictions, like Christopher Reeve's iconic portrayal, showed Superman saving people simply because it was the right thing to do, fighting for "truth and justice and the American way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. However, the Superman in *BvS* appears burdened by his duties, as if performing a tiresome job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. The film constantly undercuts the perception of Superman as a purely benevolent, Christ-like hero, with Batman even telling him directly, "You were never a god, you were never even a man" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

[[superman_character_development_in_dceu | Superman's crisis manifests]] as two warring identities: the classic benevolent "Superman The God" (Christopher Reeve-like) and the Randian "Superman The Man" (an Objectivist) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. This internal conflict is highlighted by Martha Kent, who states that choosing to be a benevolent Messiah or a self-involved Objectivist are "equally valid," with the important factor being Clark's rational choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.

Jonathan Kent's ghost further contributes to this theme, recounting how his selfless act of saving his farm from a flood inadvertently doomed a nearby farm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. This story dismantles the notion of selfless heroism, suggesting there will always be uncontrollable negative consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. Jonathan Kent's advice points to ethical egoism: true moral righteousness comes from bettering oneself, pursuing self-interest, and protecting loved ones who bring happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.

Ultimately, Superman doesn't clearly choose between being a Messiah or a Randian Hero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. He initially seems to embrace Objectivism by returning to Metropolis to save only Lois and Martha <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>, even echoing Jonathan's parting words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. However, he then sacrifices himself in a highly Messianic, Christ-like fashion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. His philosophy remains ambiguous: he takes responsibility for the planet as a benevolent savior, but also claims to do it all for Lois as an objectivist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

## The Failed Ideological Conflict
Superman’s ambiguous philosophy becomes problematic because *BvS* is framed as an [[comparison_of_batman_and_supermans_ideologies | ideological conflict]] between Batman and Superman, yet no actual conflict exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. Initially, Bruce Wayne questions the blind trust in Superman as a savior, fearing even the best can turn bad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. Clark Kent, in turn, sees Batman as a vigilante who needs to be checked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. While this mirrors the ideological conflict in Miller’s *The Dark Knight Returns*, *BvS* immediately undermines it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. The world turns against Superman for acting on his own accord, similar to Batman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. By using Objectivism to make Superman more relatable, the film inadvertently erases the ideological difference between Batman and Superman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

The film, which demands a conflict based on differing ideals and is based on source material showcasing this divide, instead becomes a conflict of "A Randian Hero vs. A Maybe Sort-of Randian Hero who can’t decide if he wants to be the divine savior the world wants him to be" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.

## Conclusion
Ultimately, *Batman v Superman* presents no clear preference for heroics. Whether one should sacrifice for the greater good or prioritize self-interest becomes immaterial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>. The film's message shifts to advocating for "MORE HEROS" like Aquaman, The Flash, and Cyborg, who should form a team—the Justice League <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. Instead of a clear philosophy supporting either Batman or Superman, everything becomes muddled, resulting in an ambitious mess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.

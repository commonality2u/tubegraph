While *BoJack Horseman* presents a dark and often depressing reality beneath its colorful animation and Hollywood glamour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, it does offer "family" as one potential solution to the protagonist's struggle for meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. This contrasts with the show's underlying theme of [[existential_nihilism_and_bojack_horseman | existential nihilism]], where the "trappings of our daily lives cover up the meaninglessness of existence itself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

## BoJack's Perceived Need for Family
BoJack himself acknowledges the social expectation of having a family, stating, "At our age, it's weird if you don't have a family" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>. However, Charlotte points out that this isn't necessarily true for him, given his busy career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>.

## "Horsin' Around" and the Idealized Family
The in-show sitcom *Horsin' Around*, which BoJack frequently watches, consistently revolves around the theme of a loving family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. The show's titular character, "The Horse," delivers a line emphasizing the importance of family: "I've learned that when you're in a loving family, there's nothing wrong with a little horsin' around" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.

## BoJack's Desire for Domesticity
During a significant bender, BoJack has a vision of himself as a "simple family man" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>. His attempt to sleep with Penny at the end of Season 2 further illustrates his desperation to "start over" and choose the "domestic life" he could have shared with Charlotte <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>.

## Family as a Form of Belonging
The Wild Horses, who appear at the end of Season 3, can be interpreted as representing not only the "Absurd Hero" but also "the herd" and the "sense of belonging that BoJack lacks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>. This suggests that a sense of community or belonging, akin to family, could be a path for BoJack.

The show indicated at the end of Season 3 that it was preparing to explore the theme of family "much more" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>. Despite the potential for family to offer a solution to BoJack's internal void, there is a lingering skepticism about whether "even family wonâ€™t be able to fill the void" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>. This connects to the broader theme of [[distraction_as_a_coping_mechanism_in_bojack_horseman | distraction]] as a way to avoid the "anguish of a meaningless world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>, suggesting that even family might merely serve as another temporary diversion rather than a true resolution to existential despair.

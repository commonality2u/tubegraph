The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) culminates over a decade of storytelling in *Avengers: Endgame*, providing a satisfying conclusion by deeply integrating character arcs with philosophical traditions of human history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>. The three core heroes—Thor, Captain America, and Iron Man—each embody different methods of character growth and align with distinct philosophical perspectives on the arc of history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>.

## Thor: The Cyclical Arc

Thor's character arc throughout the films is cyclical, characterized by a constant process of rising to a peak, only to be brought low, learning and relearning the same lessons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>.

### Cyclical Character Development
*   **Initial Fall**: The first *Thor* film begins with him about to be crowned king of Asgard, but his pride leads to his exile from Asgard, making him unworthy of his hammer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. He learns humility and becomes worthy again, ending as the prince of Asgard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.
*   ***The Dark World***: Starts with Thor restoring peace but quickly sees him brought low by personal losses, only to rise again to save the nine realms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>.
*   ***Ragnarok***: Begins with Thor saving Asgard from Surtur, but he quickly hits his lowest point with the death of his father, the breaking of his hammer, and being sold into slavery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>. He learns that "Asgard is not a place, but a people" and ends the film saving the Asgardians, becoming king <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>.
*   ***Infinity War*** **and** ***Endgame***: After a brief high as king, *Infinity War* sees him defeated by Thanos and losing half his people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>. He briefly recovers after acquiring Stormbreaker but falls again when his victory is too late <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>. He undergoes self-imposed exile, becoming reclusive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:00">[04:35:00]</a>. In *Endgame*, he learns to accept himself as a hero and warrior, not just a king <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>. He abdicates the throne to embark on new adventures, ending back "on top" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>.
*   **Overall Progression**: While largely circuitous, there is some forward progression as Thor moves from coveting kingship to no longer desiring it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>. He even explicitly acknowledges his own predictability in *Ragnarok*, stating, "Round and round in circles we go" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>.

### Philosophical and Mythological Roots of Cyclical History
This cyclical storytelling structure is particularly fitting for Thor, who is based on the pagan deity from Norse mythology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>. Many ancient philosophies and religions, including the Stoics, Hindus, Maya, and Aztec, conceived of history on a grand scale as cyclical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:00">[05:55:00]</a>.

Norse mythology also shared this view, as evidenced in the Prose Edda and Poetic Edda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>. In these texts, the current cycle of history concludes with Ragnarök, and a new cycle begins with the survivors Leaf and Leafthrasir <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>. Richard Wagner's Ring Cycle also captures this cyclicality, beginning with the theft of the Rhinegold and ending with its reclamation after turmoil and Ragnarök <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:29:00">[06:29:00]</a>. [[alan_moores_influence_on_comics_and_culture | Neil Gaiman]]'s retelling of Norse mythology further emphasizes this, with surviving gods of Ragnarök playing a chess game that replays history exactly as before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>.

## Captain America: The Immutable Arc

Captain America's character arc is defined by its lack of change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>. While the world evolves around him, he remains steadfast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:00">[07:14:00]</a>.

### Unchanging Character and Philosophy
Screenwriting guru Robert McKee criticized static characters, calling them "boring" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:19:00">[07:19:00]</a>. However, Captain America is a clear exception, demonstrating an unchanging inner and outer character after his initial physical transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:00">[07:47:00]</a>. Even when challenging American and global governments in *Winter Soldier* and *Civil War*, his actions reveal no new facets; they simply reinforce his core belief in standing up to bullies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a>. His inner strength and resolve, present even before his transformation, persist through all films, consistently getting him back on his feet against overwhelming odds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:51:00">[08:51:00]</a>.

His personal philosophy is equally unbending, summarized by Agent Sharon Carter's quote from the comics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:15:00">[10:15:00]</a>:

> "Even if everyone is telling you that something wrong is something right. Even if the whole world is telling you to move, it is your duty to plant yourself like a tree, look them in the eye and say, 'No, you move.'" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:26:00">[10:26:00]</a>

This unwavering commitment to moral duties is evident when he refuses to sacrifice Vision to stop Thanos, stating, "We don't trade lives, Vision" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:44:00">[10:44:00]</a>.

### Eternalism in History
Captain America's unchanging nature aligns with a belief that certain truths and elements are eternal and enduring, regardless of time or circumstance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:47:00">[11:47:00]</a>. This view is shared with the author of Ecclesiastes, who wrote, "What has been is what will be, and what has been done is what will be done, and there is nothing new under the sun" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:57:00">[11:57:00]</a>.

Both Steve Rogers and Solomon would agree on the immutability of a fixed moral law and unchanging human nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:08:00">[12:08:00]</a>. Because human nature remains constant, so do the problems it causes, with villains like Thanos, Hitler, and Pharaoh representing similar archetypes across history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:27:00">[12:27:00]</a>. Conversely, this unchanging human nature also accounts for the perennial courage that leads people to defend against injustice, making heroes like Captain America a steadfast response to recurring problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:38:00">[12:38:00]</a>. Despite being "a man out of time," Captain America remains relevant in every era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:02:00">[13:02:00]</a>.

## Iron Man: The Progressive Arc

Like Steve Rogers, Tony Stark is also a man out of time, but their differences often put them at odds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:32:00">[13:32:00]</a>. While Captain America embodies eternal truths, Iron Man represents progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:07:00">[14:07:00]</a>.

### Progressive Character Development
Tony Stark's character arc is defined by linear progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:07:00">[14:07:00]</a>:
*   **Early Selfishness**: In the first *Iron Man* film, he is completely self-centered and unconcerned about being a "merchant of death" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:11:00">[14:11:00]</a>. Upon witnessing the harm his weapons cause, he shifts to stopping weapon manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:20:00">[14:20:00]</a>.
*   **Political Shift (Randian Objectivism to Regulation)**: By *Iron Man 2*, while personally less selfish, his political philosophy is still founded on Randian objectivism, maximizing self-interest and defending laissez-faire capitalism, as seen in his testimony to Congress: "I have successfully privatized world peace" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:31:00">[14:31:00]</a>.
*   **Self-Sacrifice**: In *The Avengers*, he progresses from criticizing Captain America's willingness to sacrifice to himself performing a self-sacrificial act by flying a nuke through the wormhole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:59:00">[14:59:00]</a>. This brush with death leaves him psychologically scarred with PTSD in *Iron Man 3*, demonstrating change through trauma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:33:00">[15:33:00]</a>.
*   **Support for Accords**: In *Civil War*, his support for the Sokovia Accords marks a shift from libertarianism to favoring increased government intervention for societal security, seeing it as an inevitable future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:49:00">[15:49:00]</a>.
*   **Ultimate Sacrifice**: By *Endgame*, his personal and political progression culminates. Politically, he abandons all libertarian leanings, blaming Captain America for the "snappening" due to his resistance to greater regulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:39:00">[16:39:00]</a>. Personally, he makes the ultimate sacrifice of his life, leaving his family behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:01:00">[17:01:00]</a>.

### Linear Progression in History
Tony Stark's character, philosophy, and technology all progress linearly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:13:00">[17:13:00]</a>. This understanding of history as a linear progression from a primitive past to a technologically and socially superior future is common among philosophers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:16:00">[17:16:00]</a>.

*   **Hegel**: Saw history advancing inexorably toward the German state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:28:00">[17:28:00]</a>.
*   **Karl Marx**: Conceived of history similarly, as a progression toward communism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:32:00">[17:32:00]</a>.
*   **Francis Fukuyama**: Believed history had a linear path that ended with the fall of the Soviet Union and the rise of liberal democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:37:00">[17:37:00]</a>.

As a futurist, Tony Stark also views history as a linear and inevitable progression, though his vision of the "endgame" differs, focusing on an existential threat from alien armies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:51:00">[17:51:00]</a>. Marvel heroes like Reed Richards even call Tony Stark the "future man" at the end of history, representing what everyone else is slowly advancing towards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:22:00">[18:22:00]</a>.

## Shared Philosophical Influence: The Great Man Theory

One view of history that all three heroes, Thor, Captain America, and Iron Man, conform to is Thomas Carlyle's "Great Man Theory" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:41:00">[18:41:00]</a>. Carlyle wrote in *On Heroes, Hero-Worship, and The Heroic in History*, "The history of the world is but the biography of great men" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:45:00">[18:45:00]</a>.

This theory posits that history is largely shaped by the actions of extraordinary individuals. In the Marvel Universe, from 1942 through 2023, the history is indeed a biography of the Avengers, especially Tony, Thor, and Cap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:53:00">[18:53:00]</a>. Each of them has significantly accelerated or changed the course of history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:04:00">[19:04:00]</a>. Captain America echoes this sentiment in the comics, stating, "We shape the world. It does not shape us" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:12:00">[19:12:00]</a>.

Whether it's Captain America's changelessness, Tony's path of progress, or Thor's cyclical journey, these heroes profoundly shape their world, rather than being shaped by it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:20:00">[19:20:00]</a>. The emotional resonance of their conclusions stems from the appropriateness between each character's core concept and how their arcs play out, with any deviations being deliberate and impactful exceptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:43:00">[19:43:00]</a>.

*The Dark Knight Rises* exhibits significant intellectual ambition, particularly in its attempt to integrate complex thematic elements from classic literature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>. While the film draws inspiration from works like Charles Dickens' *A Tale of Two Cities*, its execution of the [[class_struggles_and_economic_disparities_highlighted_by_the_purge | social inequality]] theme is often criticized for being unclear and underdeveloped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>.

## Influence of A Tale of Two Cities

The most prominent thematic parallel between *The Dark Knight Rises* and *A Tale of Two Cities* is [[class_struggles_and_economic_disparities_highlighted_by_the_purge | social inequality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>. Dickens' novel, set during the French Revolution, vividly portrays the decadence and abuse of the poor by the aristocracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>. Similarly, the film attempts to depict a class conflict through Bane's "false revolution," where he presents himself as a liberator returning control of Gotham to the people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>.

## The Dark Knight Rises' Portrayal of Social Tensions

Despite its clear literary inspiration, *The Dark Knight Rises* offers a "vague, muddy and almost nonsensical display of the social tensions that lead to Bane’s false revolution against the rich" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:43:00">[12:43:00]</a>.

### Blackgate Prison and The Dent Act

Blackgate Prison is presented by Bane as a symbol of the Dent Act’s oppression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:58:00">[12:58:00]</a>. While the prison is shown to be harsh, with overcrowding and criminals denied parole, its conditions are not depicted as the "gratuitous cruelty" seen in *A Tale of Two Cities* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:06:00">[13:06:00]</a>. In fact, the Dent Act is portrayed as overwhelmingly successful in combating organized crime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:22:00">[13:22:00]</a>. The film struggles to establish how the perceived injustices of Blackgate would logically lead to an overthrow of the wealthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:45:00">[13:45:00]</a>.

An analogy is drawn between Blackgate and the Bastille during the French Revolution, and the Dent Act to the French "Lettres de Cachet," which allowed arbitrary detention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:51:00">[13:51:00]</a>. However, this analogy falters because the film does not show Gotham police abusing their authority or the Dent Act leading to the unjust imprisonment of citizens for criticizing the government or practicing the wrong religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:22:00">[14:22:00]</a>.

### Lack of Evidence for Corruption

The film fails to provide clear evidence that the Dent Act or Blackgate disenfranchise the poor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:01:00">[15:01:00]</a>. The only instance of elite corruption shown is Daggit attempting to steal Wayne Enterprises from Bruce Wayne, which is a case of the rich exploiting the rich, not the poor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:07:00">[15:07:00]</a>.

This lack of established social grievances leads some to interpret *The Dark Knight Rises* as "anti-Occupy Wall Street propaganda" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:18:00">[15:18:00]</a>. Without clearly defining what the people are rebelling against, the film risks portraying activists as "easily manipulated fascistic clowns" who seek vengeance on the rich simply for being rich <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:38:00">[15:38:00]</a>. The issue is considered more a problem of underdeveloped worldbuilding rather than an intentional [[social_commentary_on_violence_and_societal_structure | politically-charged moralizing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:47:00">[15:47:00]</a>.

### Cyclical Themes and Revolution

The film's themes, including social inequality and truth, often return to their starting points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:30:00">[11:30:00]</a>. This cyclical nature might be an intentional nod to George Orwell's *Animal Farm*, where the term "revolution" carries a double meaning: the overthrow of oppressors and a full circle back to the original state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:53:00">[11:53:00]</a>. In *Animal Farm*, the pigs become just like the greedy humans they overthrew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:18:00">[12:18:00]</a>. The Nolans might have intended for *The Dark Knight Rises* to play with this double meaning, having its themes of pain and truth "come full circle" in a film about a social revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:23:00">[12:23:00]</a>.

Ultimately, *The Dark Knight Rises*' handling of [[class_struggles_and_economic_disparities_highlighted_by_the_purge | social inequality]] is seen as a missed opportunity, lacking the finessing and world-building necessary to fully realize its ambitious thematic goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:25:00">[16:25:00]</a>. The film's social unrest scenario being an "elaborate fabrication from the League of Shadows to Destroy Gotham" further complicates its attempted [[social_commentary_on_violence_and_societal_structure | social commentary]] on revolution and inequality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:10:00">[16:10:00]</a>.

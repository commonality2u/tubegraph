*Animal Farm*, by George Orwell, tells the story of a rebellion and its aftermath on a farm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## The Rebellion
The story begins at Manor Farm, where a prize boar named [[character_analysis_of_napoleon_snowball_squealer_and_old_major | Old Major]] shares a dream with the other animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. [[character_analysis_of_napoleon_snowball_squealer_and_old_major | Old Major]] preaches that men consume without producing, standing as the sole barrier between the animals and a righteous life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. He calls for a rebellion against their two-legged oppressors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

One night, the animals rise up, expelling Farmer Jones and his men from the farm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. They rename their newly acquired territory "Animal Farm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a> and establish a new philosophy called Animalism, with its core principle being, "All animals are equal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## Early Leadership and Conflict
After the rebellion, two pigs, [[character_analysis_of_napoleon_snowball_squealer_and_old_major | Napoleon]] and [[character_analysis_of_napoleon_snowball_squealer_and_old_major | Snowball]], emerge as leaders, though they are frequently at odds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. When humans attempt to reclaim the farm, the animals unite and successfully repel the attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

The conflict between [[character_analysis_of_napoleon_snowball_squealer_and_old_major | Napoleon]] and [[character_analysis_of_napoleon_snowball_squealer_and_old_major | Snowball]] intensifies over the idea of building a windmill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. When other animals side with [[character_analysis_of_napoleon_snowball_squealer_and_old_major | Snowball]], [[character_analysis_of_napoleon_snowball_squealer_and_old_major | Napoleon]] orchestrates his expulsion from the farm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. Another pig, [[character_analysis_of_napoleon_snowball_squealer_and_old_major | Squealer]], then spreads propaganda, branding [[character_analysis_of_napoleon_snowball_squealer_and_old_major | Snowball]] as a snitch and a traitor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

## Corruption and Transformation
While the other animals labor to build the windmill, the pigs realize they cannot obtain certain necessary goods on their own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. Consequently, they begin trading regularly with their former human enemies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

Over time, the seven commandments of Animalism are gradually altered and twisted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Eventually, only one commandment remains: "All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

The pigs become increasingly corrupt, adopting human behaviors such as walking on two legs and carrying whips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. By the story's end, the other animals can no longer distinguish between the pigs and the humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>, illustrating the [[themes_of_power_and_corruption_in_animal_farm | corrupting influence of power]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. The revolution ironically circles back to its beginning, with the pigs becoming the new oppressors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

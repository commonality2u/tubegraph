From: [[wisecrackedu]] <br/> 

*Deadpool* has achieved unprecedented popularity in mainstream media, becoming the highest-grossing R-rated movie ever and the biggest opening for actor Ryan Reynolds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This success is notable because the film shirks the traditional superhero formula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>, portraying a character who is not fighting for the greater good, is not selfless, and is not family-friendly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. Despite being a Marvel character who is an overt rip-off of a DC competitor and constantly makes fun of the medium he inhabits, Deadpool, the "merc with a mouth," has done remarkably well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Defining Features

Several defining features set Deadpool apart within the Marvel universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>:
*   He is an inveterate wiseass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
*   He knows he is a superhero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   He constantly breaks the fourth wall and comments on comic book tropes and culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
*   He takes nothing seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
Even the film's ad campaign was conceived in a "Deadpoolian" fashion, such as Valentine's Day ads designed to troll furious partners and set up self-referential jokes, including a Tinder profile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## Postmodernism and Self-Awareness

Deadpool can be best described as a [[postmodernism_in_deadpool_and_its_relation_to_don_quixote | postmodern]] work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. [[postmodernism_in_deadpool_and_its_relation_to_don_quixote | Postmodernism]] is an arts and philosophy movement that rejects grand narratives, such as the battle of good against evil, democracy versus communism, technological progress, science, or divine salvation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. [[postmodernism_in_deadpool_and_its_relation_to_don_quixote | Postmodern]] works tend to thumb their nose at tradition and embrace being "meta" and self-referential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

Deadpool is hyper-aware of himself and his place in the superhero genre <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. The film is replete with Ryan Reynolds jokes, including references to "The Green Lantern" and his face on "People Magazine’s Sexiest Man Alive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. While traditional superhero films feature the triumph of good over evil, Deadpool, in [[postmodernism_in_deadpool_and_its_relation_to_don_quixote | postmodern]] fashion, rejects this, focusing instead on a guy killing people for revenge and love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

The film explores the tension between old narratives and [[postmodernism_in_deadpool_and_its_relation_to_don_quixote | postmodernism]] in several ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>:
*   Colossus attempts to rope Deadpool into being a "good superhero," family-friendly and righteous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
*   The Dopinder subplot subverts classic narratives of courtly love by having him kidnap his beloved's current lover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
*   Blind Al is a deranged version of a benevolent blind benefactor, offering refuge to a deformed protagonist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.
*   The hero's love interest, Vanessa, is not a fair maiden but a prostitute turned stripper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

In this way, *Deadpool* can be seen as a spiritual successor to [[postmodernism_in_deadpool_and_its_relation_to_don_quixote | Don Quixote]], a 400-year-old novel that also satirized the heroes of its era, employed meta-narratives, and is considered a proto-[[postmodernism_in_deadpool_and_its_relation_to_don_quixote | postmodern]] work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. *[[postmodernism_in_deadpool_and_its_relation_to_don_quixote | Don Quixote]]* features a story within a story, where the fictional author discovers fictional accounts of *[[postmodernism_in_deadpool_and_its_relation_to_don_quixote | Don Quixote]]*, who understands he is being written about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. The fictional author constantly breaks the fourth wall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. Though not necessarily intentional, it's notable that Deadpool kills Don Quixote in the comic books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. *[[postmodernism_in_deadpool_and_its_relation_to_don_quixote | Don Quixote]]* emerged during a time of radical skepticism, much like *Deadpool* signals disenchantment with old, righteous narratives in modern society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

## Ironic Distance and Cynicism

This self-awareness is increasingly adopting a cynical tone in popular culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. Joss Whedon criticizes this trend, using a scene from *Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom* as an example where a self-referential moment serves no purpose beyond a "wink and a nod" to the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. This type of self-reference for its own sake, Whedon argues, has engulfed film, television, and literature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

Examples of this trend include:
*   The *Tarzan* trailer, where Jane overtly references her tired role as a damsel in distress, apologizing for recycled tropes instead of doing something new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.
*   The end of *Star Trek Into Darkness*, which serves as an excuse to invert a famous scene from cinema <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.
*   *22 Jump Street*, which has the same plot as *21 Jump Street* but is deemed acceptable because Ice Cube calls out the repetition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.

Hollywood often acknowledges its lazy clichés with a wink and a nod, or employs irony to undercut dramatic moments, in an effort to reinvent itself while remaining the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

Deadpool engages in both practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>:
*   It breaks the fourth wall to include the audience in the joke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.
*   It avoids serious drama <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

Hollywood still uses familiar structures and tropes but distances the audience from sincerity to make it feel new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. Deadpool's humor is largely driven by cynicism and ironic distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. He remains unphased in high-stakes situations, and even combat scenes are undercut by self-aware humor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. Being defined by his cynicism, Deadpool is immune to criticism because he relentlessly deconstructs any trope that would give meaning to film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. His journey is primarily about becoming "hot again" to reclaim lost love, a shallow endeavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. Deadpool evades criticism because he has no moral scruples or values to defend; his identity is purely reactionary, risking nothing and just making fun of everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. The film itself points out its glaring flaws, such as the overuse of superhero tropes and obvious budgetary constraints (e.g., Negasonic Teenage Warhead being a "Walmart bargain bin DVD" equivalent) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.

## Critique of Deadpool's Approach

While undeniably enjoyable, the film's self-reflective, edgy commentary raises questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. The danger lies in whether a movie that functions like an "Honest Trailer" for other comic book movies should receive so much praise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>. This trend, with its obsession with being meta, risks devolving into an endless spiral that creates nothing new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. Deadpool is not reinventing the superhero genre; it can only exist to [[satire_of_superhero_films | make fun of the genre]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. This "bashing the system" approach, while amusing, is ultimately powerless and does not change the system itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. Slavoj Zizek notes that "cynical distance, laughter, irony, are... part of the game. The ruling ideology is not meant to be taken seriously or literally" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

## The "Fuck It" Attitude

Deadpool's ability to say "Fuck it" stems from his immunity to death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. With no consequences, nothing can be taken seriously, and life loses its sacredness when it becomes limitless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>. This attitude originated in the comic book's own perceived uncancellability; if the comic was already "dead," then writing it as if nothing mattered became possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. Similarly, if society can say "fuck it," it might be because existential threats are either so distant or so close that people no longer care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>.

Whether *Deadpool* uses fourth-wall breaking simply as a "shiny makeover" for old tropes, or if it achieves something genuinely new, remains a point of debate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.

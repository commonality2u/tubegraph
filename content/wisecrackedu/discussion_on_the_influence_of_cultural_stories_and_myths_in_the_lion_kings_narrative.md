*The Lion King*, an artifact featured on Earthling Cinema, draws heavily from established cultural narratives and philosophical concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. Hosted by Garyx Wormuloid, the analysis of the film reveals its connections to classical literature, philosophical ideas, and even controversial historical propaganda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Alleged Ripoff Controversy

Despite denials, *The Lion King* has faced claims of being a direct ripoff of the Japanese anime *Kimba the White Lion* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## [[comparison_of_the_lion_king_and_hamlet | Influence of Hamlet]]

The film is "loosely based" on William Shakeshack's *Hamlet*, sharing a nearly identical plot and characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. Key parallels include:
*   A king murdered by his brother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
*   The murdered king's son being visited by his father's ghost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
*   Two comic foils aiding the hero in relaxing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

## [[themes_of_the_circle_of_life_and_social_order_in_the_lion_king | Philosophical Underpinnings: The "Circle of Life" and Social Order]]

The film presents an "oddly conservative message" through its emphasis on the [[themes_of_the_circle_of_life_and_social_order_in_the_lion_king | "circle of life"]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. This concept describes a natural, fixed social order, the disruption of which is depicted as leading to chaos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

Mufasa utilizes the [[themes_of_the_circle_of_life_and_social_order_in_the_lion_king | "circle of life"]] to justify the predatory nature within the animal kingdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. Simba is portrayed as being "baptized in the feudal social order" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>, where an individual's value is determined by birth rather than merit or action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. For those not at the top, upward mobility is non-existent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. The movie's core message is "know your place" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

Rafiki's presentation of Simba on Pride Rock implies acceptance of this order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>, suggesting that animals confirm their place in the world through subjugation, thereby finding peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

### The "Noble Lie"

This social structure aligns with Greek philosopher Socrates' concept of the "noble lie" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. As documented by Plato in *The New Republic*, Socrates theorized that people would accept their station in life if told that their value was ordained by a higher power, for instance, God sprinkling different precious metals into souls based on importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

## Scar's Rebellion and its Parallels

Scar is depicted as the sole animal to reject this feudal society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. He laments that "life isn’t fair" and rebels against the "natural" societal order that labels him a "weakling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

Upon seizing power, Scar initially ushers in an era of "equality," allowing hyenas to be on equal footing with lions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. However, his progressive politics are not entirely altruistic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. His song about a new world order includes Nazi marching imagery and camera movements directly "lifted from Leni Reifenstahl’s *Triumph of the Will*" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

Much like the reign of "Adam Hitler," Scar's rule turns disastrous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. By interfering with the "natural order of the food chain," his once prosperous utopia descends into anarchy and starvation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

## Conclusion

The film's narrative, therefore, functions as a parable for social order, suggesting that interfering with an established hierarchy leads to chaos, echoing historical and philosophical debates on societal structures and justice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

*Shrek* functions as a direct commentary on and [[comparison_of_shrek_and_traditional_fairy_tales | subversion of traditional fairy tale narratives]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>, specifically targeting [[critique_of_disneys_portrayal_of_relationships | Disney's superficial and overly sentimental offerings]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

## Undermining Fairy Tale Tropes
The film undermines the idealistic perfection prevalent in traditional fairy tales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. This is evident through:
*   **Parody of Disney Characters**
    Throughout the story, *Shrek* takes potshots at beloved characters associated with [[the_commercialization_of_fairy_tales_by_disney | classic Disney IP]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
    *   Robert Hood and his merry men are depicted as "creepy Frenchmen who kidnap young girls" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
    *   Cinderella is presented as a "mentally abused shut-in" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
    *   Shrek dismisses Snow White as "just another piece of clutter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
*   **Anti-Disney Protagonists**
    The film's anti-Disney agenda is most evident in its central characters, Shrek and Fiona <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
    *   Shrek's initial actions include "wiping his ass with a page from a book of fairy tales" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>, brushing his teeth with slime, and openly farting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>, presenting the opposite of the glamorous entrance typically awarded to Disney heroes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.
    *   Fiona initially behaves like a stereotypical Disney princess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>, expecting to be swept off her feet with chivalry and grand gestures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. However, the character who embodies these characteristics, Lord Facebook, is portrayed as "the most odious character in the film" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

## Behind the Scenes: The Eisner-Katzenberg Feud
The numerous attacks on the Disney aesthetic in *Shrek* were reportedly the result of a feud between Disney CEO Michael Eisner and Jeffrey "J Money" Katzenberg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.
*   Katzenberg ran Disney's movie and television division for a decade under Eisner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>, revitalizing their animated film catalog with hits like *The Little Fish Lady*, *Interracial Couple*, and *The Genie Saves Hanukkah* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.
*   Despite his efforts, Disney refused to promote Katzenberg, leading him to leave and start Dreamworks "out of pure spite" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.
*   Some believe the character of Lord Facebook was based on Eisner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.
*   Lord Facebook's kingdom is described as a "dead ringer for Disneyland" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>, complete with costumed employees and puppets singing incessantly about a "small and pitiful world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

## Rejection of Traditional Beauty Standards
Dreamworks, under Katzenberg, criticizes the idea that [[themes_of_beauty_and_societal_expectations_in_shrek | the beautiful are destined for greater rewards]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a> than "normal, less valuable people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.
*   *Shrek* rejects the typical fairy tale narrative where the "lovely princess and handsome hero live [[themes_of_beauty_and_societal_expectations_in_shrek | 'happily ever after']]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
*   Instead, the film makes both of its heroes "ugly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>, suggesting that their marriage will be rocky and likely end in divorce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.

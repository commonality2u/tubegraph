*Starship Troopers*, Paul Verhoeven’s sci-fi cult-classic, has been a subject of ongoing debate among critics, scholars, and fans since its release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. Based on Robert Heinlein’s novel, the film proved difficult to categorize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Initial audiences often viewed it as a straightforward, cheesy, yet enjoyable space romp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. However, scholars have since highlighted its significant use of [[association_of_fascist_ideology_with_specific_visual_and_narrative_elements_in_starship_troopers | fascist imagery and ideology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

While many critics believe the film’s [[the_films_satire_on_militarism_and_audience_perception | satire of militarism and fascism]] was initially lost on viewers, others contend that a literal interpretation is not necessarily incorrect, suggesting the movie can, in some respects, be seen as earnestly pro-fascist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. The debate persists because the film is genuinely hard to define; it oscillates between poking fun at gung-ho attitudes towards violence and authority, and appearing as a direct military flick or even a propaganda piece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. *Starship Troopers* achieves a subtle and potentially disturbing effect, making it one of cinema's most surprisingly [[comparison_of_starship_troopers_with_historical_and_literary_fascism | complex takes on fascism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

## Film Recap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>

In a near-future setting, the world is governed by the United Citizen Federation, which grants full citizenship and voting rights exclusively to individuals who volunteer for military service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. Civilians are those who choose not to serve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. Johnny Rico, a recent high school graduate and varsity athlete, defies his affluent parents to enlist in Federal Service, seeking citizenship and following his sweetheart, Carmen Ibanez, who aspires to be a Federation pilot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. While his psychic friend Carl Jenkins joins military intelligence, Johnny is placed in Mobile Infantry alongside Dizzy Flores, a former teammate with a long-standing crush on him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

After an asteroid from Klendathu obliterates Johnny’s hometown of Buenos Aires, he enthusiastically engages in the subsequent war of extermination against the planet’s bug-like inhabitants, the “arachnids” <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. Johnny embraces his new identity as a soldier-citizen, fighting through numerous battles and, with his surviving friends, rises to a high-ranking position in the war effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

## Depiction of Fascism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>

*Starship Troopers* is replete with references to the [[comparison_of_starship_troopers_with_historical_and_literary_fascism | fascist ideologies]] of the twentieth century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

### Visual and Ideological Connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>

On a superficial level, the film explicitly links the United Citizen Federation to historical political movements through blatant visual cues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. For instance, the Federation emblem resembles the [[nazi_propaganda_and_cinema | Nazi]] Reichsadler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>, and the dress uniforms of the Mobile Infantry, Fleet, and especially Games and Theory, evoke those worn by branches of the Wehrmacht <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

At a deeper level, the ideology promoted by Federation authority figures aligns with fundamental fascist political philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. Johnny’s mentors often espouse social Darwinism, framing the war between Earth and Klendathu as a species competition where the "fitter race" is destined to control the galaxy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. As his biology teacher states: "This Arkellian sand beetle is superior in many ways. It reproduces in vast numbers, has no ego, has no fear, doesn’t know about death, and so is the perfect selfless member of society” <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. Lt. Rasczak’s battle cry, “C’mon, you apes--you wanna live forever?”, further reinforces this survival-of-the-fittest mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

Central to Federation ideology is the belief that political power is not an inherent right but is earned through a willingness and ability to inflict violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>: “Something given has no value. Look, when you vote, you are exercising political authority, you are using force. And force, my friends, is violence: the supreme authority from which all other authority is derived” <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. This perspective mirrors that of German fascists, who were influenced by pro-military writings from WWI veterans like Ernst Junger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. Junger’s memoir, *Storm of Steel*, was part of a wave of German literature that valorized veterans, depicting war as a transformative experience for men, offering adventure, friendship, and camaraderie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. Historian Brian E. Crim notes that these novels emphasized the "transformative experience of war and the inherent right of veterans to lead," linking Junger's journey to Johnny Rico’s evolution into the "New Man" revered by the fascist movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. This "New Man" is characterized as physically capable and emotionally hardened, able to commit violence for the state without guilt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. Johnny and his comrades either possess this trait from the start or develop it through their wartime experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

### Anti-Intellectualism and Propaganda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>

The Federation motivates its populace by eschewing logic in favor of appealing to passions and emotions, particularly a specific form of hatred, thereby adopting a fascist approach to political persuasion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. Historian Alexander De Grand describes fascism as an "appreciation of the irrational forces in modern society and glorification of instinct and violence in political life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>, and this anti-intellectualism is prominent in the Federation mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. The film portrays Mr. Rico as a fool for insisting Johnny attend college instead of volunteering for military service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. Any debate concerning the war effort is immediately shut down by slogans and emotional appeals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>: “Some say the bugs were provoked... I’m from Buenos Aires, and I say ‘kill ‘em all!’” <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. Only "functional intelligence," applied in service of the state, is deemed acceptable, such as Carmen’s navigation skills or Carl’s studies of arachnid biology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.

Federation [[nazi_propaganda_and_cinema | propaganda]] depicting the arachnids, and the soldiers’ attitudes towards them, resemble [[nazi_propaganda_and_cinema | Nazi]] depictions of Jews during WWII; both were designed to bypass reason and incite hatred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. Philosopher Jean Paul Sartre, in *The Anti-Semite and the Jew*, argues that true anti-Semitism involves not just hatred, but a love of that hatred itself, where passion for the object of hate supplants other desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. The Federation cultivates this complex emotional response within its population, and the film aims to do the same with its audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>. The arachnids’ inhuman and universally disliked insect-like appearance makes the impulse to hate them—and thus identify with the fascist cause—more appealing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. Federation soldiers willingly forgo typical passions to dedicate themselves to hating bugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. Following the Klendathu debacle, Sky Marshal Diennes resigns, allowing a "better bug killer" to take his place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. Similarly, Sgt. Zim willingly forfeits his rank to engage in direct combat with the bugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. Mobile Infantry soldiers appear oddly cheerful in war zones, suggesting they are less angry at the bugs and more eager to indulge their hatred through violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.

## Seduction of the Audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>

While militaristic and/or fascist ideologies are present in many sci-fi societies (e.g., Klingons, First Order in *Star Wars*, Nazis in *The Man in the High Castle*), *Starship Troopers* stands out by presenting members of a fascist military force as the "good guys" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. Paul Verhoeven explicitly stated his intention: "I tried to seduce the audience into joining Starship Troopers’ society, but then ask, ‘What are you really joining up up for?’" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. The film aims to make viewers think and feel like fascists, then reflect on how they were seduced into that mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.

### Romantic Drama and Appealing Society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>

One key method of seduction is the "sexing things up" through the romantic drama involving Johnny, Carmen, Dizzy, and Zander <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. This plot device invests the audience, similar to teen dramas, making them care about the beautiful characters and their romantic entanglements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. By rooting for Johnny and Dizzy to connect, viewers implicitly root against the arachnids, as they threaten the characters’ romantic fulfillment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. The audience may even join the characters in hating the bugs to ensure these "pretty humans" can achieve their desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.

Beyond the romantic subplots, Verhoeven presents the Federation as an appealing society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. It appears to have achieved racial and gender equality, boasts no visible poverty, and features advanced medicine capable of repairing life-threatening injuries quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. Like Ernst Junger's writings, the film offers universal human desires as part of the fascist package: joining the Federation promises fulfillment, adventure, and lifelong friendships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. The United Citizen Federation even seems to permit free speech, including open dissent among civilians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>. With all these seemingly positive attributes, it becomes easy for audiences to overlook that the entire enterprise is founded on an ideology they might otherwise consider themselves immune to: "Naked force has resolved more issues throughout history than any other factor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>.

## Cinematic Derealization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>

To further solidify audience commitment, *Starship Troopers* heavily borrows from the work of WWII filmmakers Leni Riefenstahl and Frank Capra, whose [[nazi_propaganda_and_cinema | propaganda]] films *Triumph of the Will* and *Why We Fight* are visually referenced in the newsreels throughout the movie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. By mimicking their techniques, the film achieves what philosopher Paul Virilio termed "cinematic derealization" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>. This concept refers to making an audience immune to the horrors of war by transforming it into entertainment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>. Virilio argues that when filmmakers "mak[e] attack unreal," industrial warfare ceases to be a "huge funeral apparatus" and instead becomes "the greatest mystification of all: an apparatus of deception" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>. Modern examples include the Gulf War and the 2003 invasion of Iraq, which were covered in near-real time by news outlets, similar to the Federation’s invasion of Klendathu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.

Like many war movies, *Starship Troopers* achieves derealization through exaggeration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>. Everything, from machine guns to body counts, is inflated to an absurd, over-the-top scale, making it difficult to perceive as real <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>. This disconnect between the reality of war’s death toll and the narrative presented allows the film to act as an "apparatus of deception," numbing the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>. The cartoonish presentation overwhelms any understanding of the true cost of war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>.

## Ambiguity and the "Mean" Film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>

Scholar Mark Rosenthal argues that *Starship Troopers* "refuses to be made too mean" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>. This means it cannot be definitively classified as either a satire or not a satire, preventing it from clearly supporting or condemning fascism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>. The film simply "is" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>. Whenever Verhoeven appears to take a clear stance, the film undercuts itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>. For example, as the film builds towards the Klendathu battle, it initially feels like a straightforward pro-military action flick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>. However, the subsequent depiction of the failed invasion, with its cutting triumphant score and temporary shift from derealization to hyper-realization, shows individual humans being torn apart, screaming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>.

Conversely, just when the audience might feel no sympathy for the bugs, the film introduces close-ups of their faces with disturbingly human eyes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>. The brain bug, with its repulsive slimy skin and brain-straw, also possesses expressive eyes, a massive round forehead, and a soft, chubby body—traits subconsciously associated with children—evoking both disgust and pity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>.

By the movie’s end, the audience is deliberately left unsure of what to think, which is precisely the point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>. Like effective [[nazi_propaganda_and_cinema | propaganda]], *Starship Troopers* is designed to bypass rationality and evoke strong emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>. Viewers become engrossed in the romance, action, and adventure without fully analyzing that they are aligning themselves with characters who openly intend to carry out a genocide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>. The film doesn't push a particular viewpoint but rather seduces the audience with the recurring question: "Would you like to know more?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>. If Verhoeven succeeds, the answer is "Yes sir" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>.

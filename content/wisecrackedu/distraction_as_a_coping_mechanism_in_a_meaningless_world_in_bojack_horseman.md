Despite its colorful animation, talking animals, and Hollywood glamour, *BoJack Horseman* is far from a typical happy-go-lucky cartoon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. Its lighthearted veneer conceals a dark and depressing reality, fitting its focus on the [[BoJack Horsemans portrayal of Hollywood and disillusionment | disillusionment]] that arises from looking beneath the surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>. The show reveals the ugly, narcissistic truth behind the dazzling façade of "Hollywoo" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>, which can be seen as a metaphor for existence itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. Just as Hollywoo's façade hides a hollow industry, the routines of daily life can mask the [[Existential Nihilism in BoJack Horseman | meaninglessness of existence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>. This concept, known as [[Existential Nihilism in BoJack Horseman | Existential Nihilism]], is fundamental to *BoJack Horseman* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>.

## Distract Yourself: A Key Coping Mechanism

A primary way characters in *BoJack Horseman* cope with the anguish of a meaningless world is through distraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>.

### Examples of Distraction
*   **Princess Carolyn** persistently distracts herself with her demanding job and her "compulsive need to fix the life of those she cares about" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>. Despite complaining about work dominating her life, she struggles when faced with free time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>. When her agency folds, she quickly finds a new venture to return to the "Hollywoo grindstone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>.
*   **Todd**, BoJack's best friend, remains happy as long as he has something to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>. The rare times he is without a task, he spirals into [[Existential Nihilism in BoJack Horseman | existential despair]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>, asking "Do I have a purpose?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a> before finding a new project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>. His life is filled with various endeavors, such as composing a space opera, building his own Disneyland, and starting numerous businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.
*   **Mr. Peanutbutter** lives in a constant state of distraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>. Despite appearing foolish, he is surprisingly self-aware, stating, "The universe is a cruel uncaring void. The key to being happy isn't the search for meaning. It's to just keep yourself busy with unimportant nonsense. And eventually... you'll be dead" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>.
*   **BoJack** himself lives a life defined by distractions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>. The show often omits his trivial activities, and he has drifted through years in a "near constant state of distraction" since his show *Horsin' Around* ended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>.

### Philosophical Perspective: Blaise Pascal
The show explores the question of why successful celebrities, like BoJack, who seemingly "have everything," might not be happy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>. This question was addressed by 17th-century philosopher Blaise Pascal, considered a precursor to the [[Existential Nihilism in BoJack Horseman | Existentialists]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:00">[04:34:00]</a>.

For Pascal, when humans are given too much time to think, they inevitably contemplate their own insignificance, leading to unhappiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>. He famously stated:
> "I have discovered that all the unhappiness of men arises from one single fact: that they cannot stay quietly in their own chamber. I have found that there is one very real reason, namely, the natural poverty of our feeble and mortal condition so miserable that nothing can comfort us when we think of it closely." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>

Pascal proposed that humans possess a natural psychological defense mechanism: they are "really easily distracted" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>. When distracted, people cease to think about their existence and can remain, if not happy, at least functional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a>. He applied this idea to figures of power, like kings (or, in *BoJack Horseman*, movie stars):
> "Yet, when we imagine a king attended with every pleasure he can feel if he be without diversion and be left to consider and reflect on what he is, this feeble happiness will not sustain him." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:00">[05:24:00]</a>

Like a king, BoJack lacks serious struggles to occupy his life and instead dedicates his time to distracting himself from the reality of his situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:00">[05:34:00]</a>.

### The Breakdown of Distraction
While BoJack successfully maintains this charade for years, it eventually collapses when he reads Diane's book, *One Trick Pony* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a>. The book presents an honest reflection of himself, forcing him to confront his true self and the extent of his self-deception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>. Diane's observation directly addresses this: "You could be constantly surrounded by distraction and wouldn't have to be alone with yourself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>.

In a "post-God-Is-Dead world" like Hollywoo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:18:00">[06:18:00]</a>, where even Santa Claus is described as "a lie that grown ups made up because we like to believe that there’s an order to the universe and that good behavior will lead to happiness but the fact is that just isn’t true" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>, Pascal's suggested recourse to God is not an option for BoJack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:00">[06:14:00]</a>.

When BoJack attempts to return to distraction after his illusion is broken, the show presents two tragic case studies:
*   **Secretariat's Advice**: Secretariat advises a young BoJack to "run... straight ahead and... keep running forward no matter what... Don't you stop running and don't you ever look behind you. There's nothing for you behind you. All that exists is what's ahead" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:00">[06:50:00]</a>. This is a clear call to "Don't Think About It" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:54:00">[06:54:00]</a>. However, once Secretariat is disqualified from racing and can no longer distract himself, he faces the truth he tried to outrun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:13:00">[07:13:00]</a>.
*   **Sarah Lynn**: BoJack's desperate attempt to force distraction upon Sarah Lynn, dragging her on a months-long bender, ultimately leads to her overdose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:00">[07:23:00]</a>.

If reclaiming a distracted state is doomed to tragedy, *BoJack Horseman* suggests other philosophical paths for coping with meaninglessness, such as embracing [[JeanPaul Sartres Radical Freedom as depicted in BoJack Horseman | Radical Freedom]] or [[Albert Camus Absurdism and its reflections in BoJack Horseman | embracing the Absurd]].

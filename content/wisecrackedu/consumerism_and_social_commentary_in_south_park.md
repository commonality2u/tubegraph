Season 19 of *South Park* stands out for its serialized narrative and its comprehensive commentary on America's political and social climate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Unlike earlier seasons, it tells an overarching story from episode to episode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. The season chronicles the small Colorado town as it undergoes significant social changes, introduces a new central character, and reflects on contemporary American politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## Season 19: A New Narrative and Layered Commentary

One of the most astute aspects of Season 19 is its layered commentary, which addresses both modern social conditions and the show itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. The season opens with Principal Victoria's firing, leading to the appointment of a new principal aiming to make South Park Elementary "a more progressive place that fits in with today's times" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. This commentary can be seen as a [[meta_commentary_on_political_satire_in_south_park | meta-commentary]] on *South Park* itself, questioning whether its signature vulgarity can survive in a [[political_correctness_and_its_critique_in_south_park | politically correct]] world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. Characters express that "the times changing so fast. Everybody wanna be PC, be updated. It's like I'm a relic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>, and the Mayor explicitly states that Officer Barbrady is "from another time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## The Nexus of [[Neoliberalism in South Park Season 19 | Neoliberalism]]: [[Political Correctness and Its Critique in South Park | PC Culture]], Gentrification, and Advertising

The seemingly disparate themes of gentrification, [[political_correctness_and_its_critique_in_south_park | PC culture]], and advertising are neatly tied together by the concept of [[Neoliberalism in South Park Season 19 | neoliberalism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. [[Neoliberalism in South Park Season 19 | Neoliberalism]] is an economic ideology emphasizing personal freedoms and market-based solutions for societal problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. Its core tenets, as described by philosopher Henry Giroux, include consumerism as a civic duty, individual freedoms outweighing public freedoms, and public social issues being addressed privately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

One of the season's key insights is articulated through the line: "What is PC but a verbal form of gentrification? Spruce everything up, get rid of all the ugliness, in order to create a false sense of paradise? Only one thing can actually live in that world: ads" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. This suggests that [[Neoliberalism in South Park Season 19 | neoliberalism]] aims to make everything marketable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. Gentrification, for instance, is presented as the free market's solution to neglected neighborhoods, where developers profit by selling "overpriced tapas" without resolving underlying poverty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

The show argues that even diversity and multiculturalism become tools for profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. Advertisers are depicted manipulating [[political_correctness_and_its_critique_in_south_park | PC culture]] to gentrify areas, turning "otherness and diversity" into marketable brands to sell products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. The show explicitly states, "ads are using PC for their own games? That's a new low" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. Ads are personified as "inhuman forces of [[Neoliberalism in South Park Season 19 | neoliberal]] capitalism," evolving into human form, ready to assimilate or destroy everything in their path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. This raises anxiety about whether friends, family, or even beloved TV shows are merely ads or sponsored content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. In a world saturated with advertising, the question arises: how can one know if ideas are truly their own, or clever commercial implants? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>

## The Commodification of Social Acceptance

[[Neoliberalism in South Park Season 19 | Neoliberalism]] excels at "cooptation"—assimilating elements outside the system to serve capitalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. It absorbs identities and diversity, transforming multiculturalism into a trendy, purchasable brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. For South Park to economically advance, it must adopt "marks of tolerance" to attract businesses and new residents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

Whole Foods becomes a focal point for these "progressive" changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. The arrival of Whole Foods is correlated with the town getting its "first gay kids" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a> and a "police-free environment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. Whole Foods, in the show, transcends being merely a place to buy organic food; it becomes a symbol of lofty ideals bought into with every purchase, like a "$6 bottle of Asparagus Water" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. This branding is beneficial not only for Whole Foods but also for television <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

The show explicitly highlights how "the spectacle of inclusion is good for business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. Characters like Craig and Tweek receive money for being perceived as gay, raising questions about whether such affirmation is for the characters or the viewer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. In the [[Neoliberalism in South Park Season 19 | neoliberal]] economy, the "spectacle of inclusion" is commodified, allowing consumers to feel righteous in exchange for cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. This leads to "cultures of social acceptance that are more of a brand than actual tolerance," where "gay pride parades sponsored by TD Bank" or "real standards of beauty sponsored by Dove" replace genuine revolution with "clever hashtags" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

## The Illusion of Progress: Critiquing [[Political Correctness and Its Critique in South Park | PC Culture]]'s Facade

Slovenian theorist Slavoj Žižek suggests that modern political systems are dangerous because they are "just so dang pleasant" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. Unlike clear villains like dictators or the KKK, a "PC bro" presents a pleasant facade to hide real motivations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. Žižek describes [[political_correctness_and_its_critique_in_south_park | political correctness]] as "a form of self-discipline which doesn’t really allow you to overcome [racism, misogyny, and so on]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. If [[political_correctness_and_its_critique_in_south_park | PC culture]] is dangerous, it's because it's a "nice paint job over the same old discriminatory reality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>, with "no longer a clear villain to rally against, just self-satisfying acts of social justice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

This "new 'progressive' world" in South Park involves people spending hundreds at Whole Foods, then feeling good for donating a dollar to charity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. This "Whole Food style charity" represents a "perfect marriage" between inaction and action, where change and rebellion become another commodity, disarming criticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. Žižek argues that rebelling against the system is tolerated, even promoted, as long as it remains within acceptable bounds, a practice he calls "inter-passivity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. He concludes that [[political_correctness_and_its_critique_in_south_park | political correctness]] means "Let’s go on changing something all the time so that, globally, things will remain the same" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

The show also targets "charity cannibalism," a concept from French philosopher Jean Baudrillard, where "Other people's destitution becomes our adventure playground" and we "continually seek to... secure the conditions of reproduction of the catastrophe market" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. When tragedies run out, we invent new ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>. This is exemplified when PC Principal seeks out a victim (Nathan) who fits his narrative, disempowering the actual victim (Jimmy) who doesn't want his help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. This [[political_correctness_and_its_critique_in_south_park | PC culture]] is seen as intolerant of other cultures because it "lovingly accept[s] everyone, so long as we can pigeonhole them into a type of difference we can consume" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. The celebration of figures like Caitlyn Jenner on *Vanity Fair*, despite controversies, is presented as "simple, consumable, it sells" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.

The show reveals a "deep rooted narcissism" behind both extreme [[political_correctness_and_its_critique_in_south_park | PC culture]] and Trump-esque conservatism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. The "PC brand" is often about making oneself feel good rather than enacting real change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>. Randy's charity morphs into giving iPads to children in developing countries, not to feed them, but to protect "the fragile egos of people like Randy" by having these children "protect you from trolls and make your internet a safe space" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>. Cartman, a "pathological liar and raging narcissist," adopts safe space language to protect his ego <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>. Conversely, Mr. Garrison's "fuck-em-all-to-death attitude" and belief in American exceptionalism are described as a "nationalist version of the 'special snowflake' complex," fueled by a narcissistic obsession with himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>. [[Neoliberalism in South Park Season 19 | Neoliberalism]], promoting a culture of consumerism centered on the individual, fuels this "cult of victimhood" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>.

## *South Park*'s Nuanced Critique

While *South Park* reliably critiques both sides of the political spectrum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>, its creators, Trey Parker and Matt Stone, likely don't hate every aspect of [[political_correctness_and_its_critique_in_south_park | PC culture]], but rather the shallow versions propagated in mainstream media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>. PC Principal even experiences a redemption, killing "inauthentic" PC bros after realizing he's been manipulated by ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>. The show acknowledges the creators' own "privileged straight white boy" position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>. The finale makes it clear that PC Principal (and the challenges he represents) is "here to stay" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>. The difficulty lies in "Not wanting to seem like a bigot while avoiding the trappings of phony inclusion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>.

Ultimately, *South Park* critiques how [[Neoliberalism in South Park Season 19 | neoliberalism]] and consumerism have co-opted social movements and diversity, turning them into marketable brands rather than genuine societal change. The show highlights the challenges of navigating a world where true inclusion is difficult to discern from commercially driven spectacle, especially as the show itself must exist within a political climate that relies on advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>.

The animated series *[[rick_and_morty_episode_analysis | Rick and Morty]]* frequently delves into [[philosophy_and_existentialism_in_rick_and_morty | existential themes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>, often depicting characters despairing over existence or expressing resentment towards their creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. A key element of its philosophical exploration is its engagement with Absurdism, a concept closely related to existentialism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

## Absurdism and Meaninglessness
According to French philosopher Albert Camus, Absurdism posits that humans are "cursed with seeking meaning in a universe that will remain forever silent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. *[[rick_and_morty_episode_analysis | Rick and Morty]]* embodies this philosophy by painting an "absurd, meaningless multi-verse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. While both absurdism and existentialism acknowledge a meaningless world, the transition from Season 2 to the premiere of Season 3, "The Rickshank Redemption," solidified the show's status as an "absurd" work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. It achieves this by consistently presenting and then dismantling notions of hope and meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

## Rick Sanchez: The Trivializer of Values
Rick frequently trivializes everything, including fundamental human values like love and tradition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. His companionship with Morty is initially presented as a mere tactic to hide his genius brain waves from the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. "The Rickshank Redemption" further emphasizes this [[cosmic_nihilism_and_its_depiction_in_rick_and_morty | cosmic nihilism]] by showcasing the arbitrary nature of social systems, mocking sentimentality, and highlighting the overall pointlessness of existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

## Undermining Conventional Morality and Narrative Arcs
The show actively subverts expectations for a moral evolution or a meaningful narrative arc, particularly for Rick.

### Season 2's False Hope
At the end of Season 2, Rick appears to have an "authentic, heartfelt moment" at Birdperson's wedding, suggesting a potential shift towards normalcy and caring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. This seeming anguish leads him to sacrifice himself to the Galactic Federation, implying he is "wrestling with something he's never dealt with: living with meaning" and doing right by his family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. This "cliffhanger tease[d] a possible shift in the show’s existential themes," towards creating meaning in a meaningless world, an idea championed by many existentialists but rejected by Camus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

### "The Rickshank Redemption" Doubles Down on Absurdity
The Season 3 premiere, "The Rickshank Redemption," directly refutes the idea of the show retreating "into meaning and sentimentality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. Instead, it "doubles down on the absurd" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

*   **Mocking the Audience's Search for Meaning:** The episode's comedy often arises from the audience's "ATTEMPT to draw meaning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. For instance, the fabricated memory of Beth and Diane's murder, designed to give Rick a "tragic Walter White-style anti-hero origin story that would give meaning to his madness," is revealed to be a "ruse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. The show "get[s] a perverse joy in playing with our desire to search for hope and meaning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.
*   **Undermining Heroic Motivation:** Rick's act of saving Earth from the Galactic Federation is not presented as a noble act for a "greater good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. Summer's comment suggests the "new world order doesn't sound too good either" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.
*   **Disregarding Family Bonds:** The show toys with the idea that Rick cares for Morty and Summer, only to continually undermine it. Rick's rush to rescue them is eventually explained as a tactic to prevent Beth from kicking him out of the house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

### The Szechuan Sauce Metaphor
The ultimate symbol of this critique of conventional morality and motivation is the Szechuan sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. Rick declares his sole motivation to be a forgotten McDonald's promotional condiment, stating he isn't driven by family, justice, or love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. The show proposes that Rick's entire series arc will be "his quest for a forgotten promotional food item" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

> "The only thing Rick's love of Szechuan sauce means, is that it means nothing. The quest for Szechuan sauce isn’t creating meaning, it’s a reflection of the absurdity of being driven by, well, anything." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>

This quest highlights that in an "utter void of meaning in the world," any dedication, no matter how absurd, is equally valid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. The pursuit of the McNugget sauce is "meaningful only in that its a joke about meaninglessness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

## Rick as an Absurd Hero (with a Twist)
Rick aligns with Camus's concept of an "Absurd hero"—a figure who comprehends the "cosmic indifference" of the universe and finds happiness in the pointlessness of it all, exhibiting "lucid indifference" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. Rick's vast knowledge of the multiverse, where "everything terrible and good can and has happened," defines his existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. He reduces basic morals to "genetic programming" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a> and, despite his abilities, only yearns for Szechuan sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.

However, a crucial difference exists: Camus's absurd heroes find happiness in the absurd, whereas Rick is often depicted as being in "great pain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. This suggests that Rick's true arc might not be to embrace conventional morality, but "actually to enjoy the absurdity of it all" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. The show's ultimate "joke" is the audience's expectation that Rick's sacrifice indicated a belief in family, justice, or anything with conventional meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

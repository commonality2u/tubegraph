[[comparison_between_mob_psycho_100 and one punch man | One Punch Man]] stands out in the anime landscape, not least for its deliberate subversion of genre tropes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. While the show's [[parody_and_satirical_elements_in_one_punch_man | parody]] elements could be explored in depth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, its most unusual characteristic is the near absence of drama <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. Most episodes conclude predictably with the titular hero delivering a single, decisive punch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. This unusual structure offers a humorous, yet profound, commentary on humanity's direction as a civilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## Saitama's Predicament: Too Strong for Meaning

The protagonist, Saitama, initially finds a love for hero work after a period of disillusionment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. However, just three years later, the thrill is gone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. Despite claiming to be a "hero for fun," Saitama derives little enjoyment from his battles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. This ennui stems from his overwhelming power, allowing him to defeat any adversary with a single blow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. His experience is akin to playing a video game against an utterly outmatched opponent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

While boredom is a pervasive theme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>, [[comparison_between_mob_psycho_100 and one punch man | One Punch Man]] primarily explores the concept of a world without conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. By doing so, it underscores the vital role of conflict in both fictional narratives and the human experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

## The Abnormal Story Structure and Lack of Conflict

The show's atypical narrative structure is central to its message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. Traditional narratives rely on conflict to drive the plot, motivate characters, and foster [[character_development_and_narrative_structure_in_one_punch_man | character development]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. As screenwriting expert Robert McKee notes in his book *Story*, "the music of story is conflict...as long as conflict is progressing and building in the story, it moves forward in time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

In conventional tales, characters face obstacles that force them to change and grow, propelling the story toward its climax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. A classic example is Luke Skywalker in the original *Star Wars* trilogy, whose journey involves overcoming numerous challenges that lead to his growth as a character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

### Saitama's Stagnation

This kind of [[character_development_and_narrative_structure_in_one_punch_man | character development]] is absent in [[comparison_between_mob_psycho_100 and one punch man | One Punch Man]] because Saitama is simply too powerful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. He obliterates any conflict instantly and feels no fear of defeat, leaving him with nothing to strive for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. Consequently, he remains largely unchanged throughout the series, except for a brief flashback to his origin story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. Even his training, which would typically show progression, is depicted as a monotonous daily routine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

### The Role of Supporting Characters and Deus Ex Machina

Since Saitama is immune to conflict, many episodes shift focus to supporting characters like Genos, who undergo more traditional character arcs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. Genos, for instance, embodies the wandering warrior seeking strength and vengeance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. Even villains, such as Dr. Genus, are given motivations and backstories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

However, Saitama's mundane motivations (being a "hero for fun" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>) and effortless power undermine the struggles of others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. Whenever a supporting character or villain gains narrative traction, Saitama intervenes, acting as a "human deus ex machina" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. He swiftly resolves seemingly insurmountable problems, rendering the built-up tension and character struggles irrelevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. This technique, typically avoided in creative writing, becomes a comedic and thematic cornerstone of the show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

## The Anti-Catharsis

The constant negation of conflict leads to a lack of catharsis for the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. Catharsis, the emotional release experienced through a story, allows audiences to connect with characters and their predicaments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. Stories enable us to "repeat the past forward," revisiting our own experiences through characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. For example, the struggles of Genos or the Mumen Rider can evoke empathy related to personal experiences of loss or striving against superior odds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.

Historically, Japanese media has used narratives to process national emotions, such as post-WWII wrestling featuring Rikidozan defeating American villains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>, or kaiju movies like *Godzilla* serving as metaphors for atomic devastation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. Similarly, American cinema after 9/11 addressed collective trauma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.

[[comparison_between_mob_psycho_100 and one punch man | One Punch Man]], in stark contrast, is an "anti-catharsis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. While it visually resembles kaiju movies, Saitama's effortless victories prevent any genuine dramatic tension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. The show deliberately builds emotional anticipation, only to deny its release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. This is exemplified when the Mumen Rider's heroic, yet doomed, stand against the Sea King is immediately undercut by Saitama's anticlimactic intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.

## Philosophical Underpinnings: The Value of Conflict

Beyond the humor, [[comparison_between_mob_psycho_100 and one punch man | One Punch Man]] highlights what is missing in a life devoid of conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. Japanese theorist Masahiro Morioka argues that society's drive to minimize pain and discomfort inadvertently diminishes life's value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. While easier living seems beneficial, Morioka suggests that it leads to losing "the opportunity of experiencing the joy of life that comes from encountering an unwanted situation and being forced to transform ourselves to find a new way of thinking and being" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.

This perspective perfectly illustrates Saitama's frustration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. His current ease contrasts sharply with his challenging first battle against Crablante, where the struggle made the victory meaningful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>. Now, his life is devoid of purpose due to the absence of hardship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>. Saitama's reaction to the Paradisers' manifesto, who seek a life of success without effort, further underscores this point; he finds their ideal of "paradise" to be "pretty boring" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.

Morioka's philosophy aligns with the show's [[Absurdism and Existentialism in the series | existential]] themes: "a civilization without pain and suffering seems to be the ideal of the human race. However, I wonder if people might end up with losing sight of joy, and forgetting the meaning of life, in a society pervaded by pain reduction mechanisms and filled with pleasure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.

Even when a genuine challenger appears in the Season 1 finale, capable of withstanding multiple punches, it's revealed Saitama was holding back, ultimately rendering the conflict meaningless once more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>.

Saitama's perpetually bored expression serves as a warning: embracing failures, pain, and suffering is crucial for a meaningful life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>. Without conflict, life, much like Saitama's heroic endeavors, becomes devoid of purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.

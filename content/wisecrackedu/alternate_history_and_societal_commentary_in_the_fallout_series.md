The *Fallout* series is set in an alternate reality during the 23rd century, where the culture of the 1950s persisted, but most of humanity perished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This world was characterized by a pervasive Cold War mentality until its bitter end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. A global conflict erupted in the 2050s when nations began to run out of oil, culminating in 2077 with nuclear powers launching their arsenals, plunging the world into a new dark age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. *Fallout* utilizes this [[Philosophical themes in postapocalyptic fiction | apocalyptic fiction]] setting as a rich ground for philosophical analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## The Pre-War Alternate Reality

In *Fallout*'s alternate reality, a widespread fascination with atomic power proliferated during the mid-20th century, unmoderated by the invention of the transistor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. While the pre-war society is technologically advanced, its technology differs from our own, being bulky with primitive computers, yet possessing advanced power armor and laser guns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

The "Wasteland," the desolate landscape of the game, is filled with remnants reflecting the pre-war world's sheer optimism, an era of atomic energy where dreams could be achieved with ingenuity, perhaps alongside "giant anti-communist death robots" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

## Societal Commentary Through Cognitive Dissonance and Propaganda

A significant element of *Fallout*'s [[Social commentary on violence and societal structure | social commentary]] comes from its depiction of cognitive dissonance and propaganda, particularly evident in the "Vaults" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

### The Vaults and False Optimism
Despite imminent nuclear annihilation, Vault posters maintained a cheerful appearance, advertising being locked in an underground bunker for an indefinite period as an exciting opportunity to meet friends and raise a family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. Many of these vaults were secretly covers for the government to conduct "insane experiments" on residents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. The concept of the Vaults harks back to real-life luxury bomb shelters of the Cold War era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

German-American philosopher Herbert Marcuse discussed these "mental gymnastics" during the Cold War, arguing that pleasant appearances used to cover modern-day nightmares demonstrate modern society's ability to destroy criticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. He suggested that capitalism's marketing prowess makes even "the worst shit in the world just seem 'dandy'," citing deluxe fallout shelters with televisions and Scrabble boards as prime examples of an "obscene merger" between appearance and reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

### Irony and One-Dimensional Thought
This disparity between appearance and reality fuels much of *Fallout*'s humor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. The game constantly juxtaposes the quaint, cheerful 1950s "Leave-it-to-Beaver-esque" culture with the hellscape it is set in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. Examples include radio stations serenading the Wasteland with chipper jazz tunes while players fend off irradiated human remnants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. The prominent use of "I Don’t Want to Set the World on Fire" in a trailer plays off the song's innocent romanticism against imagery of burnt-out Washington D.C. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>, where the world was literally set on fire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. Cole Porter’s "Anything Goes," about lax morals, becomes a nod to the Wasteland's absolute anarchy, where cannibalism is "fair game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

These ironic juxtapositions are not merely comedic; they serve as a mechanism by which society celebrates the same culture and [[Technology and its moral dilemmas in Fallout | technology]] that puts it "at the brink of total annihilation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. Marcuse argued that this phenomenon leads to "one-dimensional thought," where the merging of positive and negative means rationality and technology can only proceed "forward"—technology is always presented as good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. This leaves no room for "negative thought" that would undermine society's inane positivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. This is illustrated early in *Fallout 3*, where the player is forced to have "sufficient fun" at their own birthday party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

### The Enclave and Distracted Society
The Enclave, remnants of the United States government, seeks to purge the Wasteland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. Their president, John Henry Eden, is revealed to be a computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. Eden's actions highlight the dangers of one-dimensional thinking, as he understands the importance of "fun and leisure" in creating an obedient society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. He praises baseball as a savior of the American dream, intending to resurrect the kind of distracted society that initially led to the world's devastation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. The Wasteland is littered with reminders of pre-war excess, such as leisure suits, magazines, and televisions, which provided easy ways to cope with horrific reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

## Technology Run Amok and Moral Dilemmas
*Fallout* constantly reminds players of [[Technology and its moral dilemmas in Fallout | technology run amok]], from the Great War to government experiments that created Super Mutants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. Technology is portrayed as a "double-edged sword" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. Players are confronted with moral dilemmas regarding technology, such as whether to use it to provide clean water or unleash a devastating virus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

The game draws inspiration from the Greek myth of Phaethon, who ruined everything by taking his father Helios's sun chariot for a joyride <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. In *Fallout: New Vegas*, the solar plant capable of harnessing the sun's energy is called Helios One, allowing the player to similarly wield destructive power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.

Different factions represent varied responses to technology:
*   **The Brotherhood of Steel** believes humans cannot be trusted with technology, hoarding it in armored bases and waging war against any faction possessing advanced tech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.
*   **Caesar’s Legion** largely rejects technology, believing it makes people weak and dependent, though they utilize it for improved killing capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. However, even without advanced tech, Caesar's totalitarian state inflicts great suffering, suggesting that human nature, not technology, may be the core issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

## [[Social and political structures in the Fallout universe | Governments]] and International Relations
The citizens of the Wasteland form various [[Social and political structures in the Fallout universe | governments]], from cruel tyranny to liberal democracies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. *Fallout* explores modern theories of international relations:

### Hegemony and Realism
Caesar's Legion in *New Vegas* aims to unite humanity under a "dystopian nightmare" where everyone is a slave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. Caesar believes peace is only attainable when his Legion is the sole dominant faction, aligning with the "hegemonic stability theory" in international relations, where a superpower enforces behavior through fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. This is shown to work to an extent, with traders preferring safer Legion territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.

Every faction in *Fallout* attempts to become the local hegemon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>. An alternative is the "balance of power," where factions avoid war due to high costs, as seen with the NCR not invading New Vegas, or the Boomers maintaining neutrality through artillery fire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.

For "realists" in international relations, each faction acts solely to secure its own interests, and power is a zero-sum game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. Peace is seen as uncertain ceasefires, and alliances are fleeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. This model, however, precludes factions from working together and truly trusting each other, which some argue led to the nuclear holocaust in the first place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.

### Security Logic and [[Dictatorship and politics in postapocalyptic settings | Despotism]]
The stakes of diplomatic relationships in *Fallout* are extremely high, often involving "life and death struggle for the soul of humanity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>. The game asks how far one will go for security, such as whether the NCR should resort to bullying and corruption for peace and democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>, or if a player should murder obstacles for clean water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.

Daniel Callahan argues that "security logic" has a "totalizing logic," implying no limit to the terrible actions people will take in the name of survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. This is echoed by Benjamin Franklin's quote: "Those who surrender freedom for security will not have, nor do they deserve, either one" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

The Enclave's President John Henry Eden exemplifies this, stating his election details are hidden "in the interest of national security" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>. The Enclave is willing to exterminate mutated populations to save "real" humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. A similar despotism is seen with Mr. House in *New Vegas*, who creates an "orderly, efficient, cold" society at the expense of personal freedoms and democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. House explicitly states his distaste for freedom, believing "Firm control in the hands of a technological and economic visionary" is preferable to democracies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>.

Historically, dictatorships use manufactured crises and exaggerated threats to justify repressive laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>. In *Fallout*, there is no shortage of such crises to exploit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>.

The *Fallout* series constantly interrogates human society and government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. The game's refrain, "War never changes," can also imply "humanity never changes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>. Beyond mutated creatures, the most terrifying aspects of the Wasteland are reflections of humanity's "regrettable history," including "slavery obsessed Romans, Orwellian dictatorships, and genocidal governments," suggesting that history indeed repeats itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>.

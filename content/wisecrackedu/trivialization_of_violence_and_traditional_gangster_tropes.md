The film *Pulp Fiction*, directed by Quentin Tarantino, utilizes three interconnected stories about the seedy underbelly of Los Angeles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Its unique structure and tone are noted for upending traditional gangster and action films by trivializing their macho image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

## Cavalier Attitude Towards Violence

A significant portion of *Pulp Fiction*'s humor stems from a cavalier attitude about human-on-human violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

### Subversion of Suspense
The film often undercuts moments that would typically build suspense. For instance, when hitmen Vincent and Jules are en route to "conflict resolution" with their boss’s associates, despite being undermanned and undergunned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>, their casual gossip about TV pilots and foot massages creates a breezy and relaxed scene rather than one of concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

### Lack of Remorse
Violence is frequently depicted with minimal emotional impact on the characters. After Vincent accidentally shoots Marvin’s head off, rendering him dead, there is no remorse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. Instead, Vincent and Jules prioritize worrying about bloodying Jimmie’s towels over the act of taking a life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

### Understated Ominosity
Even in potentially gruesome scenes, the film defies expectations. In a torture dungeon, Maynard declares, "Nobody kills anybody in his place of business 'cept me or Zed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. This ominous statement is immediately followed by a friendly door chime announcing Zed’s arrival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>, a stark contrast to the dramatic music most films would employ in such a moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

## Subversion of Traditional Tropes
*Pulp Fiction* takes a similarly cavalier attitude with time and narrative pacing, often undercutting high-stakes situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. This contributes to its [[Subversion of traditional sitcom tropes | subversion of traditional tropes]].

### Mundane Interjections
*   When Vincent is frantically attempting to save the dying Mia, his urgent actions are intercut with Lance calmly ingesting wet bread pellets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.
*   While searching for a medical book to save Mia, Lance and his wife become sidetracked by petty squabbling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
*   Butch leisurely takes his time selecting a weapon while the sounds of Marcellus being raped are heard in the background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

### Significance of the Mundane
Conversely, trivial elements are sometimes granted special significance. The bathroom, for example, becomes a focal point for many crucial scenes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. Notably, every time Vincent uses the bathroom, something adverse occurs, such as a restaurant robbery, Mia overdosing on poison, or Vincent himself being shot by Butch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

## Themes of Randomness and Agency
The film's approach, trivializing important events while imbuing mundane ones with significance, suggests a world that is out of control, filled with outrageous coincidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

### Coincidences and Fate
*   Honey Bunny and Pumpkin choose to rob a restaurant, hoping for a low "hero factor," yet they select the very establishment where two "heroes" (Jules and Vincent) are dining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.
*   Butch coincidentally stops at a traffic light precisely when Marcellus is crossing the street <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>, and they stumble upon the only pawn shop owned by dishonest individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.
*   Vincent and Jules are miraculously unscathed after being shot at point-blank range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

This raises questions about whether these are merely freak occurrences or if a higher power is involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. While Jules believes in a higher power and Vincent does not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>, the film ultimately conveys that even in a chaotic world, individuals retain the power to choose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>, as exemplified by Jules sparing a life at the film's conclusion after taking one at the beginning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.

The series *House of Cards* explores the ambitious pursuit of power by Frank and Claire Underwood, chronicling their quest for the presidency at any cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. A core aspect of Frank Underwood's drive is his desire to build a lasting legacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

## Frank Underwood's Pursuit of Immortality

Frank's quest for power is inextricably linked to his larger ambition: to achieve immortality through a legacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. He views power as something enduring, contrasting it with money:
> "Money... is the McMansion in Sarasota that starts falling apart after ten years." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>
> "Power... is the old stone building that stands for centuries." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>

He strives for a name that will be remembered, echoing the [[the_political_philosophy_in_house_of_cards | political philosophy]] of Ancient Greece where making a name through great deeds and words was paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. The show implies that this ancient ideal has been distorted in modern times, exemplified by vainglorious characters like Frank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.

### Contrasting Views on Permanence

The series frequently uses art and cultural references to explore the concept of legacy.

*   **Sand Mandalas**
    In Season 3, the Buddhist monks' practice of creating intricate sand mandalas and then destroying them deeply annoys Frank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. These mandalas represent the fleeting nature of existence, standing in stark contrast to the Western artistic tradition that seeks to create enduring works of art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>. Frank's aversion highlights his desire for eternal impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.

*   **Civil War Diorama**
    Frank's civil war diorama, initially a way to memorialize his ancestors, is ultimately destroyed by him, symbolizing the fleeting nature of his own presidency and ambitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.

The ultimate question posed by the show's title, *House of Cards*, is whether Frank is building a lasting legacy or merely a fragile structure "on the verge of collapse at any minute" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.

## Claire's Struggle with Legacy

Claire Underwood also grapples with the concept of legacy, but in a different manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. Unlike Frank, she does not detest the impermanence of the sand mandala <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. Its destruction even foreshadows her eventual departure from Frank, as she acknowledges that nothing, "not even her marriage, is permanent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. Just as the monks destroyed their painstakingly created art, Claire leaves behind her political life despite her long efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

Claire has sacrificed her own ambitions, such as throwing her non-profit organization (CWI) "under the bus" or shunting her desire to have children, in support of Frank's political ascent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. When a homeless person rejects money from Claire and instead turns it into origami, it confronts her with the choice she has made: "power and wealth over creation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. Claire later takes up origami as a symbol of her desire to create a legacy through family rather than through power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. This highlights her yearning for authentic self-expression, hinting that unlike Frank, there might be "something behind the mask" for Claire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. Her love for art, such as photography and origami, suggests a desire to stop performing and find authenticity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.

The overarching theme of the show, especially through its exploration of [[the_use_of_aesthetics_and_theater_in_house_of_cards | aesthetics and theater]], and the idea of [[the_role_of_appearance_and_reality_in_house_of_cards | appearance as reality]], reveals that the characters' legacies are constantly being constructed and manipulated, reflecting the performative nature of [[politics_as_spectacle_in_house_of_cards | politics as spectacle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

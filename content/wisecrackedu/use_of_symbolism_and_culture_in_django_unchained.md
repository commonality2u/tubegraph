Quentin Tarantino's *Django Unchained* is presented as a comprehensive subversion of the logic of slavery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. The film integrates classic Tarantino hallmarks with a clever, nuanced, and even fun [[criticism_of_slavery_in_django_unchained | criticism of slavery]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

The film follows Django, a captured runaway slave who is rescued by genteel German bounty hunter King Schultz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Schultz teaches Django his craft, and they embark on a mission to rescue Django's wife, Broomhilde, from the vile plantation owner Calvin Candie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. Beyond the overt "revenge porn" aspect of a former slave burning down a Southern plantation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>, the film employs subtle commentaries on slavery through its use of language, culture, and symbolism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

## You Can't Cover Ugly with Civilization

*Django Unchained* uses language as a powerful tool to expose the hypocrisy of the Southern slave owners.

### Language and Reason
From the perspective of white slavers like Big Daddy and Calvin Candie, white bodies symbolize culture and civilization, while black bodies are perceived as uncivilized and incapable of proper language or cultural appreciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

King Schultz challenges this racist binary. His eloquent German accent and mastery of English, even as a second language, confound native-speaking slavers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. His rhetorical skills make the "self-satisfied Southerners look wildly uncivilized by comparison" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. Schultz becomes a "walking reminder that these self-styled men of culture are... full of shit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

The film deconstructs the historical justification for slavery based on Aristotle's concept of "logos" (speech and reason) versus "phonos" (animalistic sounds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. Aristotle used this to justify slavery by claiming slaves could only understand "logos" but not possess it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. *Django Unchained* flips this dichotomy: the cruelest slavers mumble incoherently, while the slaves are clearly intelligible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

### Titles and Respect
The film contrasts how Schultz treats slaves with how other white characters do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. Schultz uses the honorific "Fraulein" when speaking to Broomhilde, unlike the N-word commonly used by others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. Conversely, Candie demands the French honorific "Monsieur" as a sign of respect, even though he doesn't speak French <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. Schultz uses titles as a form of voluntary respect, while Candie uses them as mandatory submission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

### Symbolism of Beer
The film also uses the simple act of sharing a beer to highlight contrasting values:
*   **Shared Humanity:** Early in the film, Schultz buys Django a beer, symbolizing a transition from a master-slave relationship to a "couple of coworkers having a cold one after a long day's work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
*   **Cold-Blooded Savagery:** Later, Candie orders a beer for one of his fighters after a victory. This is not an act of camaraderie but a "sick sort of reward for an enslaved man forced to literally murder another man for the enjoyment of two slave owners" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

### Critique of European Civilization
Despite his refined demeanor, Schultz is not entirely civilized; he is a bounty hunter who "literally kills people for a job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. While he despises slavery, he buys Django out of self-interest, forcing him into cooperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. However, he at least acknowledges the pragmatic, not moral, nature of his actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

The peak of this contrast is seen with Calvin Candie, who demands the title "Monsieur" despite not understanding French <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. Schultz reaches his boiling point when a woman plays Beethoven, a "beautiful product of his culture" appropriated by the "truly savages" slave owners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

### The Bible as Justification for Slavery
The film also addresses how the Christian Bible was used to justify slavery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. On Big Daddy's plantation, one of the Brittle brothers quotes Genesis 9:2 while preparing to whip a slave, with a page of the Bible pinned over his heart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. Django's shot through this Bible page exposes the "bloody hypocrisy of using Christianity to justify savagery" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. Genesis 9:2, which states God gives mankind power over all beasts, was used to dehumanize slaves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.

## Using the Symbols of Slavery to Make Slavery Look Stupid

*Django Unchained* utilizes fashion, music, and iconography to subvert the logic of slavery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

### Fashion as Subversion
The film draws a parallel to Joseph Cinque, leader of the Amistad Rebellion, who was portrayed in media dressed as a European noble, a depiction described as "egalitarian" and "subversive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

Similarly, when Schultz gives Django a makeover, Django emerges dressed like one of the Three Musketeers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. This attire is deliberately abrasive, as such an outfit was traditionally reserved for a white, civilized man <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. Django's horseback riding, an activity associated with the well-to-do, further draws ire and surprise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.

In a final act of defiance, Django wears Candie's clothes while exacting his revenge, symbolically dismantling the "Southern Gentleman" notion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. This aligns with theorist José Esteban Muñoz's concept of "disidentification," where one "mangles cultural logic and its symbols from within" instead of escaping or assimilating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

### Music as Rebellion
The film's soundtrack employs rap music, which seems anachronistic for a mid-19th-century Western <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. However, rap music has historically been used by those in positions of racial and economic inequality to "fight the powers that be" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. It serves to fantasize about changing circumstances and seeking revenge for injustice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. The song "100 Black Coffins" by Rick Ross and Jamie Foxx, with lyrics like "Our revenge is the sweetest, bitch cause I'm coming / Gonna die in my arms, for what you did to my mother," perfectly highlights Django's journey for power and revenge under oppression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.

### Opera and Nietzschean Allegory
Schultz uses Richard Wagner’s "Twilight of the Gods" to frame Django’s quest, casting Django as a Siegfried-like figure on a mission to rescue his "beloved Broomhilda" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>. Wagner's Siegfried can be interpreted as a Nietzschean *ubermensch*, a figure who responds to a lack of values by powerfully creating new ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>. By casting Django as such a figure, the film portrays him responding to the nihilistic values of slavery and white supremacy not with appeals for reform, but by "metaphorically and literally burning the whole damn thing to the ground" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>. The fiery destruction of Candyland mirrors Wagner's world-burning for a new beginning, symbolizing the destruction of the institution of slavery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>.

Furthermore, Tarantino uses Wagner's work, which was appropriated as a "soundtrack for German nationalism" and Nazism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>, to tell a slavery revenge narrative that actively destroys white supremacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.

### Subverting the Western Genre
In a final symbolic act, Tarantino uses the Western genre, typically featuring "strong-jawed white dudes" killing Native Americans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>, to frame a slave revenge fantasy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>. In *Django Unchained*, the white cowboy types are instead taken out by a freed slave, a subject largely ignored in the Western canon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>.

## Acting Out of Slavery

The film explores the role of acting as a primary means of agency for slaves, contributing to its [[film_analysis_and_symbolism | film analysis and symbolism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>.

### Django's Agency Through Acting
Django's agency is expressed through the decisions he makes while playing a character, as prepared by Schultz for their mission to trick Candie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>. This role requires him to berate other slaves, lash out at Candie's crew, and even witness a runaway slave being torn apart by dogs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>. These decisions are not good or bad, but rather choices made "within the scope of the limited agency he is granted" and out of necessity for his own survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>.

Django's acting range is further demonstrated when he outsmarts a gang of Australians to regain his freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>. He uses props and puts on a convincing performance that leads them to literally hand him a gun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>.

### Stephen's Performed Power
Perhaps the most striking example of agency through acting is Calvin Candie’s head house slave, Stephen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>. Stephen's hatred for Django is likely rooted in envy: Stephen worked to gain power within the system of slavery, while Django achieved freedom by breaking out of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>.

Stephen has "performed his way out of the harsh labor of the fields and into the relative comfort of Candie’s home" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. He has reached a point where he can disagree with his master <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>. Stephen's exaggerated laughter at Candie's jokes is a calculated performance to gain trust and influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>. This influence is evident when Stephen, not Candie, discerns Schultz and Django's true intentions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>.

Stephen also uses non-verbal acting, performing a fake limp with a fake cane to appear physically weak and disarm any suspicions about his skill or power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>. While Stephen is a villain, his villainy is framed within the context of his limited options for freedom under slavery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>. He is trying to manifest his own power with the "truly sucky" cards he was dealt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>.

Through these varied symbolic and cultural elements, *Django Unchained* delivers one of the sharpest [[criticism_of_slavery_in_django_unchained | criticisms of slavery]] and white supremacy in recent cinema <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>.

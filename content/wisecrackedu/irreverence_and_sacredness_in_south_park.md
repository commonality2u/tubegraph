From: [[wisecrackedu]] <br/> 

*South Park* is widely associated with the word "irreverent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, with critics frequently describing the show as such <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This means that in the world of *South Park*, nothing is sacred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. While this term is often used generally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, the series has a unique way of dealing with religion, a subject typically defined by reverence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. The show forces viewers to confront what religion truly means to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>, raising questions that other series might not dare to ask <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## Deconstructing the Sacred

Even before *South Park* became a series, creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker released two holiday specials featuring Jesus battling an evil snowman and Santa Claus for the "soul of the holidays" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. Both specials concluded with the idea that in *South Park*, ordinary things can be a big deal, while things that seem profoundly important on paper can be insignificant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

This theme permeates the show's approach to [[south_parks_treatment_of_religion | religion]]:
*   The boys are not starstruck when meeting Jesus, but they fight over who plays him in an Easter play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
*   When the boys meet God in season three, Stan asks about periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
*   The meaning of life is revealed to be Earth as an intergalactic "Truman Show-style reality series" on the verge of cancellation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.
*   Jesus struggles to attract viewers for his public-access talk show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
*   Satan is portrayed as a "serial monogamist" who continually returns to Saddam Hussein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

[[south_parks_satire_on_religion_and_consumerism | Religion]] only stands out as important in *South Park* when people manipulate it for their own ends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. Eric Cartman is the undisputed master of this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>, openly admitting, "I know enough to exploit it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. Examples of his exploitation include:
*   Becoming a wealthy tent revival preacher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
*   Achieving success in Christian music by adapting secular pop songs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
*   Forming a fan club around Mel Gibson's *The Passion of the Christ* to initiate the Fourth Reich <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. This highlights [[role_of_antisemitism_in_south_park | antisemitism]].
*   Painting a cow to resemble the biblically prophesied red heifer to mess with Kyle's mind, accidentally bringing about world peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

While some viewers might interpret *South Park*'s message as religion being "ridiculous" and making people gullible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>, creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker disagree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. Stone notes that while they "make fun of a lot of religion," neither he nor Parker are "anti-religious at all," instead finding religion "fascinated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

### Denying the Sacred-Profane Distinction

*South Park* might appear anti-religious to some because it does not treat religion as a sacred subject, which contrasts with Western spiritual traditions that emphasize honoring the sacred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. According to French philosopher and sociologist Émile Durkheim, Western religions divide the world into two categories: the sacred and the profane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. The sacred is taken seriously due to its connection with fundamental cosmic forces and the state of the soul, while the profane is not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. Durkheim described this as "two categories of things so profoundly differentiated or so radically opposed to one another" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

*South Park* fundamentally denies the legitimacy of this distinction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. In "Red Hot Catholic Love" (season six), Father Maxie travels to the Vatican to address the clergy molestation scandal, only to discover the Catholic Church is an intergalactic coalition ruled by a sentient giant spider that condones pedophilia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. Maxie bravely tears a "sacred Vatican Document," defying the Queen Spider's authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. This serves as a metaphor for the molestation scandal: the Church could not evolve as long as it was too sacred to investigate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. The series suggests that sometimes the only way to save something sacred is by desecrating it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. This is also seen in:
*   *The South Park Movie*, where Cartman and Kenny save the world by cursing out Saddam Hussein and making a deal with the Devil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.
*   "Cancelled" (season seven), where the cosmic TV industry agrees not to destroy Earth for uninspiring reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

### The Myth of Redemptive Violence

*South Park* also suggests that our concept of the sacred is inherently "screwy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. Despite Jesus literally walking the Earth, most people ignore or fail to recognize him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. His talk show, *Jesus and Pals*, is consistently beaten in ratings by Jimbo and Ned's *Huntin' and Killin'* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. However, when Jesus fights—something he typically avoids—he instantly becomes their Lord <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. He has fought Frosty, Santa, Satan, Iraqi soldiers, Bill Donohue, a xenomorph, and a Seussian villain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. This is the only way he can maintain his followers' respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

*South Park*'s Jesus seems to be aware of what American theologian Walter Wink called the "myth of redemptive violence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. This myth posits that our sense of the sacred, dating back to ancient Babylonian mythology, stems from the desire to see good triumph over evil through combat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. Wink states that this myth "is the real myth of the modern world" and "is the dominant religion in our society today" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. Jesus fights because he realizes the myth his followers project onto him is more important than anything he can offer himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. When religious figures become superheroes, they are merely conceding to the power this myth holds over every religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

## The Profane Nature of Humanity

Beyond its casual attitude towards the sacred, *South Park* is not inherently harsh on [[religious_themes_and_criticism_in_south_park_episodes | religion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. A major recurring theme is that one does not need to be religious to act like a "narrow-minded assh*le" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.

Most episodes feature a self-righteous character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. Stan's season sixteen arc as a self-promotional activist in "Butterballs" and "A Scause for Applause" is a prominent example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. Stan enjoys being treated with reverence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>, but when his causes do not make him popular, he moves on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. This contrasts with Wendy Testaburger, whose motivations are deeper, and she doesn't care if her opinions make her popular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

[[social_satire_in_south_park | South Park]] suggests that movements led by individuals seeking to be taken seriously are prone to going "off the rails" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>, a critique that extends to the New Atheism movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. In the two-part episode "Go God Go," Cartman is stranded in the 26th century, observing three rival militant atheist factions killing each other over "branding disputes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. The simple message is that human beings are violent and irrational, and getting rid of religion will not change this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

### The Inevitable Ridiculousness of Humanity

The core difference between Stone and Parker and the New Atheist movement lies in a "chicken-or-egg question": Are people ridiculous because religion is ridiculous, or is religion ridiculous because people are ridiculous? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a> Stone and Parker subscribe to the latter view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.

Australian science historian Margaret Wertheim, in *Pythagoras’ Trousers*, argues that Western scientific models of the universe often resemble religious ones, partly due to a "hypermasculine drive for certainty and finality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. She suggests that insisting on absolute certainty about the universe's origins, even without much evidence, is akin to trying to navigate without directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>. Wertheim, like Stone and Parker, contends that a refusal to accept ambiguity makes our answers to big questions sound ridiculous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. This [[analysis_of_south_parks_approach_to_satire and internet culture | satire]] on human nature and [[south_parks_commentary_on_human_nature_and_belief_systems | belief systems]] is a key element of the show.

Given that all worldviews might be "a little bit ridiculous" and all movements risk becoming "a little bit fanatical," *South Park* does not dictate whether one should be religious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>. Matt Stone rhetorically asked in 2011, "if the mass delusion of a religion makes you happy, makes your family work better, is that bad or good?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a> The series explicitly supports this idea twice: at the end of "Red Hot Catholic Love" (season six) and in "All About Mormons" (season seven) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. In "All About Mormons," after mocking new kid Gary's upbeat family and unfamiliar beliefs, Gary defends himself, leading to the conclusion that being religious is sensible, and not being religious is also sensible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.

This view echoes American philosopher William James, who wrote in *Pragmatism* (1907): "When a play is once over, and the curtain drawn, you really make it no better by claiming an illustrious genius for its author, just as you make it no worse by calling him a common hack" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>. This means that whether or not life was created by a divine figure, "it's still life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>.

Most series that frequently address [[cultural_and_social_critiques_in_south_park | religion]] offer an "escape route," an ideology one can adopt to avoid being ridiculous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. What makes *South Park* unique is its underlying philosophy that being human is "inevitably ridiculous," and there is no avoiding this fate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. Regardless of one's religion or life philosophy, *South Park* suggests that taking oneself too seriously will make one appear silly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. The central question is not whether a belief system is a joke, but whether one *knows* it is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>. This forms a core part of its [[political_correctness_and_its_critique_in_south_park | critique of political correctness]].

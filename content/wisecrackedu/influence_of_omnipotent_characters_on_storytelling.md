Omnipotent or "overpowered" characters have a significant [[role_of_supporting_characters_and_narrative_structure | impact on narrative structure]] by challenging traditional storytelling conventions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>. These characters often subvert audience expectations regarding hero archetypes, their motivations, and the nature of conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>.

## Omnipotence and its Narrative Effects

Stories featuring omnipotent characters explore what it's like to possess god-like power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>. Two notable examples are Saitama from *One Punch Man* and Dr. Manhattan from *Watchmen* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>. While their galactic power isn't realistic, their reactions to such power are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>.

Both [[overpowered_protagonists_and_selfidentity | Saitama]] and [[overpowered_protagonists_and_selfidentity | Dr. Manhattan]] confront the boredom that comes with omnipotence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23:00">[04:23:00]</a>:
*   [[overpowered_protagonists_and_selfidentity | Saitama]] constantly mourns his lack of a true challenge, easily defeating any enemy in a single punch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>.
*   [[overpowered_protagonists_and_selfidentity | Dr. Manhattan]] finds himself tired of Earth and humanity, often retreating to Mars to contemplate the nature of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:00">[04:34:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:36:00">[07:36:00]</a>.

Unlike traditional protagonists such as Goku or Batman, these characters don't struggle in conventional ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>. For example, while Goku trains intensely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a> and Batman solves mysteries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>, [[overpowered_protagonists_and_selfidentity | Saitama]] only needs to do push-ups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>, and [[overpowered_protagonists_and_selfidentity | Dr. Manhattan]] "literally knows everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>. Physical confrontations are often over before they begin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>.

## Parody vs. Satire: Different Approaches to Omnipotence

The narrative impact of omnipotent characters can differ based on whether the story is a parody or a satire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:00">[05:34:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>.

### *Watchmen* (Satire)
*   As a satire, *Watchmen* attacks the vices and follies of society and the superhero genre <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:00">[06:14:00]</a>. It specifically assaults the idea of anyone possessing powers akin to a nuclear weapon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:00">[06:20:00]</a>.
*   [[overpowered_protagonists_and_selfidentity | Dr. Manhattan]] (Jon Osterman) embodies nuclear fear, having gained his powers in a nuclear accident and being used as a weapon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:34:00">[06:34:00]</a>. His name references the Manhattan Project, and the narrative is filled with references to nuclear security and fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41:00">[06:41:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:00">[06:56:00]</a>.
*   The comic posits that even with good intentions, such extreme power (super or nuclear) leads to dangerous outcomes due to differing ethical frameworks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:49:00">[09:49:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:00">[10:04:00]</a>.
*   Through [[overpowered_protagonists_and_selfidentity | Dr. Manhattan]], *Watchmen* makes a grim joke about Superman: if an all-powerful being existed, why would they care about humanity? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48:00">[07:48:00]</a>. While Superman represents American values, [[overpowered_protagonists_and_selfidentity | Dr. Manhattan]] strips himself of ideology and gets naked, symbolizing indifference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05:00">[08:05:00]</a>.
*   Ultimately, *Watchmen* condemns superhero fiction as a genre for promoting a dangerous fantasy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:39:00">[10:39:00]</a>.

### *One Punch Man* (Parody)
*   *One Punch Man* is a parody that exaggerates elements of its target (manga and Western superhero comics) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:01:00">[12:01:00]</a>. It operates from within the genre it criticizes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:20:00">[12:20:00]</a>.
*   The show makes its point by exaggerating the [[overpowered_protagonists_and_selfidentity | overpowered hero archetype]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:01:00">[13:01:00]</a>. It questions the necessity of other characters when [[overpowered_protagonists_and_selfidentity | Saitama]] is always there to save the day, despite the efforts of characters like Genos and Mumen Rider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:22:00">[13:22:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:35:00">[13:35:00]</a>.
*   [[overpowered_protagonists_and_selfidentity | Saitama]]'s relatable boredom, despite saving the world, injects a sense of reality into the superhero fantasy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:24:00">[14:24:00]</a>.
*   Unlike satire, parody like *One Punch Man* doesn't aim to demolish a flawed genre, but rather to "awaken us to the flaws in the things we love" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:52:00">[14:52:00]</a>. Its criticism operates on the assumption that the genre is "worth improving" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:22:00">[15:22:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:26:00">[15:26:00]</a>.
*   *One Punch Man* uses its omnipotent character to critique the "bigger monster, bigger gun" model of storytelling (seen in series like *Dragon Ball Z*) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:29:00">[15:29:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:44:00">[15:44:00]</a>. It encourages exploring other types of stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:34:00">[15:34:00]</a>. While criticizing a certain narrative, it doesn't disavow the value of heroes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:07:00">[16:07:00]</a>.

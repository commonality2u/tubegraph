The film "The Purge," starring Tony Hawk, takes place in a 21st-century Earth where societal conditions led the government to legalize murder for a limited period each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. This extreme measure, lasting only half a day annually, serves as the backdrop for the film's critique of various societal systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

### The Purge's Premise

"The Purge" posits that legalizing murder for a short period aims to bring about a "healthier and more balanced society" by allowing people to "release the beast" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. This idea suggests that engaging in violence will somehow relieve a person's desire to commit further acts of aggression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. However, the film quickly undermines this premise, concluding that such sanctioned violence merely desensitizes people and begets even more brutality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

### [[social_stratification_in_the_purge | Social Stratification]] and Disparity

A central critique in "The Purge" is America's issues with [[social_stratification_in_the_purge | social stratification]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. While the Purge laws are presented as neutral regarding race and class, they disproportionately impact the disenfranchised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. Those with fewer resources cannot afford advanced security systems to protect themselves during the Purge, making them easy targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

The film's antagonists, dressed in "prep school attire," symbolize the wealthy elite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. They treat the hunting of a homeless "non-contributor" as a mere extracurricular activity for college applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. This imbalance draws parallels to the War on Drugs in the 1980s, where laws were significantly harsher for crack cocaine, which affected poor Black communities, than for its "white powder-based cousin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. Despite claims of reduced crime and a flourishing economy, the film suggests the Purge is ultimately about money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.

### [[symbolism_and_hidden_meanings_in_the_purge | Symbolism of Duality and Rebirth]]

The film delves into the concept of a dual human psyche, containing both a light and a dark side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. This duality is depicted through imagery such as white and blue bouquets displayed by Purge supporters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

The date of the Purge, March 21, often coincides with the vernal equinox, a time when day and night are of equal length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. This date, signaling the beginning of spring, a period of "rebirth and renewal," is symbolically linked to the Purge's supposed goal of a healthier society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. Furthermore, the vernal equinox was used by Christians to calibrate Easter, a celebration of "resurrection" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. Citizens in the film similarly celebrate their society's "resurrection" on Purge-mas Eve with "religious fervor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. The blue baptisias in the film also allude to the Christian ritual of baptism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

### Critique of Violence as Entertainment

"The Purge" critiques the consumption of violence in society. The film juxtaposes brutal murders with classical music, implying that violence has become so common that it has ceased to shock and may even be perceived as boring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. In "Purge-world," grotesque acts are watched on television for entertainment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.

Ironically, "The Purge" itself, being a violent film, functions as a criticism of its own nature, providing viewers an opportunity to "release some aggression" by watching a "bloodbath" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. The film suggests that by analyzing such violent content, the cycle of engaging with violence is perpetuated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

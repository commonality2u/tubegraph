Season Number One of *Breaking Bad* introduces Walter White, a 50-year-old man initially characterized by his enjoyment of playing with his food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. He is depicted as moping around like a "Debbie Downey Jr." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a> and acting as a "human test subject for cleaning products" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Despite appearing to live the "American Dream" with a son bearing his name and a shiny plaque <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>, Walter struggles to bring home sufficient income, symbolizing the failure of the American Dream for him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. Both the highly educated Walter and his partner [[character_dynamics_of_walter_white_and_jesse_pinkman | Jesse Pink-man]] routinely fail to thrive within the American healthcare and economic systems depicted in the show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

## Catalyst and Metamorphosis

Walter decides to take up a new hobby: the manufacture of methamphetamine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This decision, seemingly driven by a need to earn money to treat his cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>, marks the beginning of his transformation. His expertise in chemistry frequently offers insight into his changing and troubled psyche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

Key moments highlighting his shift include:
*   In the pilot episode, Walter's chemistry class outlines the theme of his own "metamorphosis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
*   In episode 2, his lecture on thalidomide chirality points to his "shifting morality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   By episode 6, another presentation hints that Walter himself may be a "volatile substance," such as ammonium nitrate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

## Emergence of an Alter Ego

Feeling failed by conventional paths, Walter "rages against the machine" and creates a "freshly haberdashered new alter ego" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. He seeks new ways to distinguish his product and finds that a healthy working environment sometimes requires "a little stress relief" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Through standing outside the law, Walter is able to attain the respect and mobility he desperately craves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

## Societal Cancer

Ironically, Walter's drastic measures to earn money to treat his cancer lead him to "effectively become a societal cancer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. With each transaction, he gains energy for himself even as he participates in the "deterioration of other human beings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. This transformation poses a question about the nature of the American Dream, suggesting it may instead be a "waking nightmare" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.

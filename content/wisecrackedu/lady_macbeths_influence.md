Lady Macbeth plays a pivotal role in the [[macbeths_ambition_and_downfall | tragic consequences of Macbeth's ambition]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. She is presented as a strong influence on Macbeth, especially in driving him towards regicide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

## Catalyzing the Murder of King Duncan

After hearing the prophecies from the three witches that Macbeth would become king <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, Lady Macbeth pushes her husband to act decisively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. She strongly encourages him to take the crown without delay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Lady Macbeth ultimately convinces Macbeth to murder King Duncan while he is asleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Orchestrating the Cover-Up

Beyond persuasion, Lady Macbeth devises the plan to frame Duncan's two chamberlains for the murder. Her idea is to put the blame on them while they are unconscious from excessive drinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. When Macbeth is overcome with guilt after the deed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>, she takes charge, placing the bloody knife on the chamberlains to create false evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. Macbeth later kills the chamberlains to prevent them from speaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Personal Consequences and Blame

Lady Macbeth's influence is directly attributed to Macbeth's drastic actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. However, her own psychological burden from the murder leads to her eventual suicide, as she is unable to remove the perceived blood from her hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. Some interpretations suggest that Lady Macbeth's push, alongside the [[role_of_the_witches_in_macbeth | witches feeding Macbeth's ambition]] and societal pressures, all contributed to his "boot-leg fate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

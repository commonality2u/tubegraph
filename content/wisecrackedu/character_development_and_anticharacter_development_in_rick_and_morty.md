The *Rick and Morty* episode "Rest and Ricklaxation" is highlighted for its unique approach to [[Character development in Rick and Morty | character development]] and its insights into mental health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. The episode presents a scenario where Rick and Morty, burned out from constant near-death experiences, visit an alien spa and use a mental detoxifier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. This device purges the parts of themselves they dislike, creating "healthy" versions and literal toxic counterparts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## The Concept of "Anti-Character Development"

"Rest and Ricklaxation" introduces a concept termed "anti-character development" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. This idea cleverly reverses traditional narrative arcs, particularly those adhering to Joseph Campbell's "The Hero's Journey," which Dan Harmon often follows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. In conventional stories, protagonists confront a "shadow" – a dark reflection of themselves – and overcome it to gain new insight, as seen with Logan battling X-24 or Luke Skywalker sparing Darth Vader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

However, in this episode, the "toxic" versions of Morty and Rick are literal "shadow" selves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. Instead of overcoming these negative personality traits, the journey becomes one of reuniting with their worst selves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. The show suggests that "regular" [[Character development in Rick and Morty | character development]] in this context, where undesirable traits are permanently removed, can be "pretty creepy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

### Transformations of Healthy Rick and Morty

*   **Healthy Morty:** Becomes a smooth operator with many friends who ultimately needs to rediscover his self-loathing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. Without his self-doubt, he transforms into a sociopath, succeeding as an unscrupulous stockbroker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.
*   **Healthy Rick:** Appears as a thoughtful super-genius who needs to rediscover his narcissism and "irrational" care for Morty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

## Commentary on Mental Health

This "anti-[[Character development in Rick and Morty | character development]]" serves as a commentary on mental health in society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. The episode parodies self-help attitudes and the pervasive idea that unpleasant or painful thoughts must be eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. The show critiques the notion, often promoted by "Insta-llectuals," that being mentally healthy means uncritically loving oneself, saying yes to everything, and believing in oneself regardless of reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. Fully embodying these ideals, *Rick and Morty* suggests, can make one seem like a "coked-out weirdo" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

The show touches on sociologist William Davies' concept of "compulsory happiness," as described in his book *The Happiness Industry* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. Davies argues that corporations, managers, and advertisers promote a definition of mental health that serves capitalist society, involving cheerful acceptance of the status quo and constant self-improvement for consumerism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

Morty's character demonstrates this, spouting platitudes and demanding others adopt his new lifestyle, dismissing real problems by stating, "Trust me things are good. Taking that away from me… that wouldn’t be healthy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

The episode suggests that traits often targeted for eradication by the self-help industry, such as self-doubt and sadness, are "pretty important" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. In Morty's case, self-doubt is crucial in preventing him from becoming a "full-on sociopath" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. Ultimately, Rick realizes that some "less desirable parts of ourselves, despite the pain they cause, are essential to actually being healthy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. Jessica's remark to Morty, "Good to have you back," implies that his authentic, self-hating self, is truly his "better self" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

The episode, however, leaves a question regarding Rick's attachment to Morty: he claims it's irrational and therefore toxic, yet earlier states he's proud to be his grandpa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

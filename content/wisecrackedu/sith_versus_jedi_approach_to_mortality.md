Perhaps no villain in cinema is more iconic than [[darth_vader_and_the_fear_of_death | Darth Vader]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. His powerful resonance stems from [[anakin_skywalkers_transformation_and_death_denial | Anakin Skywalker’s descent to the dark side]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, which symbolizes an all-consuming fear of death that many people face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Through [[darth_vader_and_the_fear_of_death | Vader]], Star Wars explores two distinct [[philosophical_responses_to_death_in_star_wars | philosophical responses to death]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>: the path of death denial (Sith) and the path of death acceptance (Jedi) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## The Role of Fear and Death Denial in Anakin's Fall

[[the_role_of_fear_in_anakins_path_to_the_dark_side | Fear]] is what ultimately transforms Anakin Skywalker into [[darth_vader_and_the_fear_of_death | Darth Vader]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>, specifically the fear of death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. Cultural anthropologist Ernest Becker, in his 1973 book *The Denial of Death*, posits that most human actions are an attempt to manage the fear of one's own demise and the demise of loved ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. This anxiety, termed death denial, is deeply rooted in [[darth_vader_and_the_fear_of_death | Darth Vader]]'s character, tracing back to his childhood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

Even as a young "Jedi Jesus" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>, Anakin is terrified of death. His distress over his mother’s mortality becomes a haunting fixation as he grows older <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. Yoda recognizes this fear as a significant problem early on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>, which may explain the Jedi's hesitation to train Anakin due to his age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. It is suggested that training children at a younger age (before age 10) allows for easier indoctrination against the fear of death, as children realize its permanence for everyone later in their development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

Becker argues that human violence is a natural response to death denial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. Killing gives individuals a sense of control over death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. This philosophy manifests in Anakin's actions:

*   **Tusken Raiders:** After his mother is mortally wounded by Tusken Raiders, Anakin slaughters their entire village, believing this revenge allows him to "control" death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. The more he kills, the more death feels like something he "owns" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.
*   **Padmé's Death:** His anxiety dreams about Padmé dying in childbirth lead him to seek ways to "squash" death rather than becoming "less afraid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

## The Jedi Path: Non-attachment and Acceptance

When confronted with his fears about Padmé, Anakin seeks guidance from Yoda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. Yoda advises him to "Train yourself to let go of everything you fear to lose" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. This counsel aligns with Buddhist principles, specifically the concept of *jaramarana*, the desire to escape old age and death, which is considered a dangerous human impulse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. Nonattachment, or letting go of desires, is presented as the only way to overcome it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

Yoda exemplifies this philosophy, facing his own death with peace and acceptance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. Becker would label Yoda a "knight of faith," a term from Soren Kierkegaard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. Authentic faith in something greater than death can manage terror <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. For Yoda, this faith is grounded in the light side of the Force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>: "Death is a natural part of life. Rejoice for those around you who transform into the Force" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. This kind of faith is a matter of "grace and not of human effort" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.

Obi-Wan Kenobi further demonstrates the Jedi's acceptance of death during his duel with [[darth_vader_and_the_fear_of_death | Vader]] on the Death Star <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. Kenobi's willingness to sacrifice himself and declare, "If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you could possibly imagine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>, offers [[darth_vader_and_the_fear_of_death | Vader]] an alternative to his death denial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. The Jedi achieve a form of immortality, not by conquering death, but by transcending it and communing with living Jedi as Force ghosts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. Even Anakin joins them after his redemption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

Luke Skywalker embodies this acceptance. While Anakin indiscriminately kills to avenge his mother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>, Luke is willing to sacrifice his own life to avoid turning to the dark side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. His refusal to kill [[darth_vader_and_the_fear_of_death | Vader]] when commanded by Darth Sidious highlights this willingness to accept death rather than inflict it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

## The Sith Path: Embracing Desire and Denying Death

Lacking Yoda's faith, Anakin turns to Palpatine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. The Sith approach is to embrace desires, specifically the desire to prevent Padmé’s death – a clear manifestation of death denial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. Palpatine tempts Anakin with the legend of Darth Plagueis the Wise, suggesting the dark side can enable one to defeat death and "save people from death" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

Anakin sacrifices his name, loyalty to the Jedi, and conscience to protect Padmé <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. His refusal to accept death sets him on a dark path, leading him to kill children, his wife, and attempt to kill his mentor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. According to Becker, this is the "terminal point of death denial" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. The person attempts to avoid death by "killing off so much of himself" that he "becomes as though dead" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. [[darth_vader_and_the_fear_of_death | Darth Vader]], with no one left to protect from death, becomes merely an instrument of power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.

## Conclusion: Acceptance vs. Denial

The story of [[anakin_skywalkers_transformation_and_death_denial | Anakin Skywalker’s transformation and death denial]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a> highlights how *jaramarana* can corrode one's personality, strip values, and drive terrible actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. Becker posits that death denial fuels violence, conquest, and the desire to control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. Both real-world and Star Wars "Evil Empires" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>, arise from humanity's inability to accept mortality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.

However, the narrative offers hope: accepting death, regardless of how deeply one has invested in its denial, can foster dignity, courage, and compassion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. It's never too late for [[darth_vader_and_the_fear_of_death | Darth Vader]] or for anyone to come to terms with the reality of death, lest they risk succumbing to the dark side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.

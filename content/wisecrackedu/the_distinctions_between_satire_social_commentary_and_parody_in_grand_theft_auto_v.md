From: [[wisecrackedu]] <br/> 

Many people have called Grand Theft Auto V (GTA V) a satire, some social commentary, and others sarcasm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. People often confuse sarcasm, irony, and satire, similar to how all squares are rectangles but not all rectangles are squares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. GTA V notably explores these distinctions through its characters, world, and player interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Satire in Grand Theft Auto V

[[difference_between_satire_and_parody | Satire]] in GTA V aims not merely to abuse, but "to provoke a response, ideally with some kind of reform" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

### Trevor Phillips and the Confrontation of Violence

The character Trevor Phillips, a "depraved psychopathic tweaker," is central to the game's satirical elements regarding violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Trevor, who has "zero fucks to give" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>, embodies the stereotypical behavior of an average GTA player, reflecting the sociopathic tendencies many players exhibit in sandbox worlds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. This forces the player to confront the "actual personification of their actions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

While some might argue the game provides catharsis for violent impulses, Trevor's deliberate psychotic nature suggests otherwise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. It poses the radical possibility that "deep down inside we are all violent sickos" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. The game features mundane activities like yoga, tennis, golf, and darts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>, which, if boring, highlight the question of why "massacring troves of people" is fun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. By providing peaceful alternatives that players often ignore in favor of destruction, the game makes a statement about how players "project our OWN psyche and desire on to the game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

### The FIB Torture Scene

The most controversial scene in GTA V involves Trevor torturing an FIB informant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. Trevor appears to take "sick pleasure in it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>, prompting the question of who the real sadist is: Trevor or the player enjoying the psychopathic urges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>? This scene uses "over-identification," a tactic of performance that undermines power through mimicry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. By forcing the player to enact "advanced interrogation techniques," the game aims to provoke a strong reaction—either disgust, thereby subverting the "war on terror" ideology, or sadistic enjoyment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

The game's satirical approach, particularly through Trevor, reflects the gamer's true psychic self and actual feelings about gruesome violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. This element touches upon [[grand_theft_auto_v_as_a_reflection_of_player_behavior_and_societal_norms | Grand Theft Auto V as a reflection of player behavior and societal norms]].

## Parody in Grand Theft Auto V

[[difference_between_satire_and_parody | Parody]] in GTA V is defined as a "form of high burlesque that imitates a specific literary work or style of an author for comic effect, usually to ridicule or criticize that work, author, or style… parody is often used to make a satiric (and even a political) point" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. The world of Los Santos is presented as a somewhat "askew representation of reality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

### Pop Culture and Brand Parodies

GTA V extensively parodies American brands and pop culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>:
*   Android phones are "badger phones" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.
*   Apple is "iFruit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.
*   Fox News is "Weasel News" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
*   American Idol is "Fame or Shame" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.
*   Tech moguls like Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, and Steve Jobs are combined into "Jay Norris" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.
*   Google Maps is "eyefind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.
*   Facebook is "lifeinvader" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

### Michael De Santa and the Californian Lifestyle

Michael De Santa, a retired bank robber in witness protection, provides a pathway to discuss the clichéd California lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. He is a [[representation_and_parody_of_american_culture_and_lifestyle_in_grand_theft_auto_v | parody]] of the stereotypical Los Angeleano, concerned with economy, capitalism, personal fitness, paparazzi, celebrity, and media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. His family life is also a parody: his wife is "enamored" with her tennis coach and yoga instructor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>, his son has identity issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>, his psychologist is inept and greedy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>, and his daughter is involved with "porno dudes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. Michael's criticism of capitalism is smug, as he rails against it while still enjoying a yacht, fancy house, and multiple luxuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.

### Parody of California Locations

The game world's setting also parodies real California locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>:
*   Vespucci Beach for Venice Beach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>
*   Vinewood for Hollywood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>
*   Del Perro Pier for Santa Monica Pier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>
*   Jefferson Towers for Watts Towers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>
*   Davis for Compton <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>
*   Cypress Flats for Long Beach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>
*   Pacific Bluffs for Pacific Palisades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>
*   Richman (or rich man) for Bel Air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>
*   Alamo Sea for Salton Sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>

The game's extreme attention to verisimilitude in creating this parodied world is commendable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>, even leading to Lindsay Lohan suing Rockstar for using her likeness for the character Lacey Jonas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.

## Social Commentary in Grand Theft Auto V

GTA V provides an "all out criticism of our media driven world," targeting radio, television, film, and social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. The game also comments on the gaming and tech industries, as seen with Jimmy's strange pig-slaughtering game, Michael's infiltration of the Lifeinvader campus, and Lester's gaming habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. Michael's storyline, in particular, explores the "feeling of emptiness inherent in the shallow upper class California lifestyle" focused on appearances, plastic surgery, self-help, leisure, and misery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.

### White-Collar Crime vs. Street Crime

Franklin Clinton's narrative, especially concerning market manipulation, highlights a critical contrast: while millions can be made dubiously through insider trading without punishment in GTA V <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>, people in the inner city face "very real violence" from criminals and police <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. The LSPD's motto, "Obey and Survive," serves as a caricature of the LAPD's history of race relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.

### Race and Cultural Appropriation

[[race_cultural_appropriation_and_social_critique_in_grand_theft_auto_v | Complicated relations with race]] are explored through Franklin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. Characters like Trevor, Jimmy, and Devin adopt "street vernacular" when interacting with him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. Jimmy, in particular, "merely wears blackness like a mask," proving his perceived "authentic blackness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. The game assures the player of Franklin's "realness" by showing him unfazed by weak weed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.

The [[race_cultural_appropriation_and_social_critique_in_grand_theft_auto_v | appropriation of Black culture]] is a significant discussion point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. Jimmy can "act black whenever he wants" without facing the daily realities of being a person of color in America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. Similarly, players can "pick up the controller and play an 'original gangsta'" as Franklin, allowing them distance from the game's racial politics and believing themselves to be part of the solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>. GTA V confronts the desire for "guilt free solution to racism" by making players laugh at white characters awkwardly attempting to pass as Black, while they simultaneously control a "stereotypical shadow of a black male" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>. This self-reflexively makes the audience experience the same gratification, offering a more nuanced statement on racial politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>.

## Conclusion

To reduce GTA V to merely a game about stealing cars and blowing things up is a mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>. While sensational aspects exist, focusing solely on them means missing the "long string of inside jokes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>. Michael, Trevor, and Franklin collectively destabilize the player's belief in the world's seriousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>. Grand Theft Auto V serves less as an opportunity for debauchery and more as a "mirror that shows America its true nature" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>. Through its masterful use of satire, parody, and social commentary, it critiques American culture, using glorification of sex, violence, and torture to achieve this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>.

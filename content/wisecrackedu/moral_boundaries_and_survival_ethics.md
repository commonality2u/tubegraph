[[Philosophical themes in The Walking Dead | The Walking Dead]] is a show that explores a multitude of issues, including politics, psychology, and humanity's relationship to death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>. Beyond its narrative of survivors transforming into "battle-tested zombie murdering badasses," <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a> the series delves into deep philosophical questions, particularly regarding moral boundaries and the ethics of survival in a post-apocalyptic world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>.

## The Zombie as Metaphor and Philosophical Boundaries

The zombie sub-genre has a rich history of social commentary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>, with zombies serving as metaphors for various societal fears, such as mindless consumers under capitalism (in *Dawn of the Dead*), public health crises (*28 Days Later*), immigration (*World War Z*), or mega-corporations (*Resident Evil*) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:00">[00:53:00]</a>. In Haiti, where zombies originated, they have been argued to be a metaphor for slavery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>. [[Philosophical themes in The Walking Dead | The Walking Dead]] uses zombies as projections of our societal fears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>, while also focusing on how they challenge fundamental philosophical boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>.

The show constantly asks viewers to interrogate three particular philosophical boundaries:
*   What constitutes life? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>
*   What constitutes “living”? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>
*   What constitutes being human? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>

The title, [[Philosophical themes in The Walking Dead | The Walking Dead]], refers not only to the zombies but also to the survivors, blurring the line between life and death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>. The revelation by Dr. Jenner at the CDC that everyone is infected further blurs the distinction between "walker" and human <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. While walkers are biologically alive, capable of movement and groaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>, the show pushes the philosophical question of what constitutes a life *worth* living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>. Characters like Dale and Carol exemplify different approaches to survival, with Dale valuing all life as sacred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>, and Carol embracing a pragmatic, survival-as-its-own-end philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>. Rick Grimes states that "We do what we need to do, and then we get to live" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:23:00">[05:23:00]</a>.

The question of what makes us human, as opposed to a zombie, is also central <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>. While humans have purpose and don't hunger for flesh, the appearance of cannibals within the survivor groups challenges these distinctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:32:00">[06:32:00]</a>. The show depicts how traditional social distinctions disappear, leaving only "us and the dead" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>. However, survivors still desperately cling to symbols of their former humanity, like Rick's sheriff's hat, Carol missing her Maytag, or Andrea taking a mermaid necklace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48:00">[07:48:00]</a>. This suggests that "our social status, our stuff, and hot showers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:00">[08:21:00]</a> become critical markers of humanity when everything else is stripped away.

## Moral Lines and the Loss of Humanity

In [[Philosophical themes in The Walking Dead | The Walking Dead]], zombies are not always the scariest threat; humanity often exhibits its worst <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:57:00">[08:57:00]</a>. This is exemplified by the group of cannibals at Terminus, whose name is a reference to Terminus, the Roman god of boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:00">[09:11:00]</a>. Terminus blurs binaries such as:
*   Human — Zombie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:00">[09:55:00]</a>
*   Human — Animal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:00">[09:56:00]</a>
*   Good — Evil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57:00">[09:57:00]</a>
*   Civilization — Barbarism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:58:00">[09:58:00]</a>

The residents of Terminus have simultaneously lost their humanity and achieved "humanity's crowning achievement: Bureaucracy," as seen in Gareth calmly asking for shot counts for accounting purposes during a slaughter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:01:00">[10:01:00]</a>.

The line between human and animal serves as a framework for how people live <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:15:00">[10:15:00]</a>. Gareth's declaration, "You're either the Butcher or the Cattle," highlights the brutal reality of survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:25:00">[10:25:00]</a>. Terminus acts as a cautionary tale: its residents, originally survivors of violence, became monsters themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:35:00">[10:35:00]</a>. After rebelling against their tormentors, they locked them in a train car where one tormentor yelled, "We're the same," emphasizing the blurred moral lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:52:00">[10:52:00]</a>.

Morality, along with a Maytag and a shower, is presented as what separates humans from animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:01:00">[11:01:00]</a>. Glenn convinces Rick not to abandon others, stating, "That's still who we are. It's gotta be," underscoring the importance of helping others to maintain their identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:07:00">[11:07:00]</a>. Dale argues that losing justice equates to losing humanity: "Now the world we know is gone, but keeping our humanity? That's a choice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:26:00">[11:26:00]</a>. Conversely, characters like Martin suggest that morality can hinder survival: "You're a good guy. That's why you're gonna die today" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:49:00">[11:49:00]</a>.

The show explores whether walkers retain a shred of their former selves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:02:00">[12:02:00]</a>, but also, critically, whether those who are alive but "morally contaminated" retain any sense of their former selves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:25:00">[12:25:00]</a>. Morgan's arc highlights that rehabilitation is possible, as he refuses to kill even the Wolves, who are seen by most as having lost all humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:35:00">[12:35:00]</a>.

## Dictatorship and the State of Exception

The struggle between dictatorship and democracy is a recurring theme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:56:00">[12:56:00]</a>. In a world where basic needs are paramount and threats are constant, expedient solutions are often necessary, leading to Rick's declaration of a dictatorship at the end of Season 2: "This isn't a democracy anymore" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:44:00">[13:44:00]</a>.

This concept of dictatorship draws from Ancient Roman legal convention, where absolute power was granted in extreme emergencies to protect against annihilation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:51:00">[13:51:00]</a>. Rick Grimes is likened to Cincinnatus, a Roman statesman who took absolute power to save Rome and then immediately resigned, returning to his farm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:13:00">[14:13:00]</a>. This Roman connection is pervasive, with gladiator-like fights, Terminus as the Roman god of boundaries, and a Bible verse (Romans 6:4) scrawled on Gabriel's wall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:06:00">[15:06:00]</a>.

The show makes commentary on politics and sovereignty, presenting Rick as a "modern sovereign" who discards the law to "get shit done and to save people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:48:00">[15:48:00]</a>. This aligns with Carl Schmitt's theory that "The sovereign is whoever makes the exception" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:49:00">[15:49:00]</a>. Examples include Shane killing Randall and Carol burning flu victims to protect the group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:29:00">[16:29:00]</a>.

Italian philosopher Giorgio Agamben argues that the "state of exception" has become the norm, rather than an infrequent occurrence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:44:00">[16:44:00]</a>. For Agamben, the terrifying aspect is that figures like Rick, who suspend law for the "good of everyone," are only "a few setbacks away from becoming Gareth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:15:00">[17:15:00]</a>. The atrocities committed by Terminus are also in the name of survival, embodying the "butcher or the cattle" logic, which Nietzsche discussed with his "bird of prey" and "lamb" analogy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:37:00">[17:37:00]</a>. Rick constantly invokes this "us or them" logic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:53:00">[17:53:00]</a>.

> "The camp is the space that opens up when the state of exception starts to become the rule." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:05:00">[18:05:00]</a>
> — Giorgio Agamben

The show emphasizes that if the ability to commit atrocities is dependent on the sovereign rather than the rule of law, it's a dangerous path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:10:00">[18:10:00]</a>. This logic, though set in a zombie apocalypse, mirrors how governments suspend laws in real-world crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:21:00">[18:21:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

[[Philosophical themes in The Walking Dead | The Walking Dead]] continuously poses profound questions about what makes life worth living, what makes us human, and the circumstances under which extreme measures, like cannibalism, become permissible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:42:00">[18:42:00]</a>. It leaves viewers to ponder whether Rick and his group will save the world or continue to ruin every place they encounter, and ultimately, if the world might eventually need to be saved from Rick himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:49:00">[18:49:00]</a>.

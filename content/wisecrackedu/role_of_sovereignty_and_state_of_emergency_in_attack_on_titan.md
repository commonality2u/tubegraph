*Attack on Titan* is a colossal series that explores more than just terrifying Titans and intense battles; it delves into profound philosophical concepts, particularly concerning political ideology and societal structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. While the show explores themes like the [[exploration_of_death_in_attack_on_titan | visceral reality of death]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a> and deep [[social_inequality_and_class_structure_in_attack_on_titan | class divisions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>, its darkest element lies in the construction of the society behind the walls itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This society, with its Germanic influences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>, surprisingly aligns with the beliefs of the notorious [[nazi_ideology_and_carl_schmitts_influence_on_attack_on_titan | Nazi philosopher Carl Schmitt]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## Carl Schmitt's "The Political" and Sovereignty

*Attack on Titan* can be understood as an [[nazi_ideology_and_carl_schmitts_influence_on_attack_on_titan | exploration of Carl Schmitt's ideas]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. [[nazi_ideology_and_carl_schmitts_influence_on_attack_on_titan | Schmitt]], who was a card-carrying Nazi and unrepentant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, theorized that a stable society requires three core concepts forming "the political": conflict and inequality, [[friend_enemy_distinction_in_politics_and_attack_on_titan | clear distinctions between friends and enemies]], and sovereignty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. The show's provocative nature stems from its daring question: is a controversial philosophy, like [[nazi_ideology_and_carl_schmitts_influence_on_attack_on_titan | Schmitt's]], the only thing preventing societal collapse in such a dystopian world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>?

### The Sovereign's Power

The final and crucial element of [[nazi_ideology_and_carl_schmitts_influence_on_attack_on_titan | Schmitt's]] concept of "the political" is the power of the sovereign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. For [[nazi_ideology_and_carl_schmitts_influence_on_attack_on_titan | Schmitt]], a sovereign entity must possess the ability to:

*   **Declare States of Emergency**: This allows the sacrifice of populations for the greater good, ensuring long-term stability by preventing political bickering from hindering action against threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.
*   **Make Exceptions in Law**: Sovereigns can grant special citizen status, as seen with those living inside Wall Sina <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.

In *Attack on Titan*, the leadership structure appears to be based on martial law and military rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. While Premiere Dhalis Zachary leads the military tribunal with the power to execute Eren, and Wall Cultists have gained influence, the precise political structure outside of military control remains largely unrevealed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.

### Sacrificing for the Greater Good

A key manifestation of this sovereign power is the willingness of leaders to send millions to their deaths to ensure the safety of the remaining population inside the walls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. Commander Pyxis explicitly states that the operation to retake Wall Maria was, in essence, a thinly disguised purge designed to alleviate the stress caused by the massive influx of refugees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. This chilling decision involved intentionally sacrificing part of the population for what was deemed the "greater good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.

> "The retaking of Wall Maria, that was little more than a thinly disguised purge to ease the stress from the massive influx of refugees." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>

For [[nazi_ideology_and_carl_schmitts_influence_on_attack_on_titan | Schmitt]], as twisted as it sounds, the sovereign's ability to perform even the most horrendous acts is vital for maintaining order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>.

## Implications and Future Directions

The series prompts viewers to consider the consequences if the Titans were to suddenly disappear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. Would the society devolve into civil war more brutal than Titan attacks, or would it lead to liberation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>? [[nazi_ideology_and_carl_schmitts_influence_on_attack_on_titan | Schmitt]] argued that eradicating an enemy is not an option because the drive for warfare persists, leading to new enemies until only internal conflict remains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.

> [!CAUTION]
> It is important to be wary of [[nazi_ideology_and_carl_schmitts_influence_on_attack_on_titan | Carl Schmitt]], who was a principal theorist for the Nazi Party, despite his continued relevance in academic debates about international conflict, executive power, and contemporary issues like the War on Terror <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.

*Attack on Titan* could potentially pivot to become a scathing criticism of [[nazi_ideology_and_carl_schmitts_influence_on_attack_on_titan | Schmitt-style politics]] or merely complicate them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. The show's ultimate direction regarding the role of sovereignty and the state of emergency remained to be seen as of Season 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.

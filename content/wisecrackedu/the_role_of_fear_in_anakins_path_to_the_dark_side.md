[[Anakin Skywalkers transformation and death denial | Anakin Skywalker]]'s powerful descent to the dark side resonates deeply because it mirrors an all-consuming [[darth_vader_and_the_fear_of_death | fear of death]] that all individuals face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This core anxiety is what ultimately transforms him into the iconic villain, [[darth_vader_and_the_fear_of_death | Darth Vader]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## Ernest Becker's Theory of Death Denial

Cultural anthropologist Ernest Becker, in his 1973 book *The Denial of Death*, posits that much of human action is a way of managing the fear of our own demise and that of those around us <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. This anxiety, termed [[anakin_skywalkers_transformation_and_death_denial | death denial]], is particularly evident in [[darth_vader_and_the_fear_of_death | Darth Vader]] and has roots in his childhood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## Early Manifestations of Fear

From a young age, Anakin's distress over his mother’s mortality becomes a haunting fixation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. Yoda, recognizing this as a potential problem, notes, "Afraid to lose her I think" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. This fear is a likely reason the Jedi are hesitant to train Anakin at his age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. Psychologists suggest that children begin to understand death as permanent between ages 5-9, but only grasp its universal permanence around age 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. Being nine, Anakin is at a crucial point of understanding his mother's mortality and on the cusp of comprehending his own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

## Fear Leading to Violence

According to Becker, human violence can be a natural response to [[anakin_skywalkers_transformation_and_death_denial | death denial]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. He argues that "only scapegoats can relieve one of his own stark death fear," and that "doling out death gives people a sense of control over it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

An early script for *Episode I* foreshadowed Anakin's arc, with him saying, "Fear attracts the fearful. He was trying to overcome his fear by squashing you. Be less afraid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. This dialogue suggests Anakin, fearful of losing loved ones, would try to "squash" death to gain control rather than truly becoming less afraid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. This is starkly demonstrated when Anakin slaughters the entire Tusken Raider village after his mother is mortally wounded, believing that killing others gives him the illusion of controlling death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. The more Anakin kills, the more he feels a sense of ownership over death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

## The Choice: Jedi vs. Sith Responses to Death

Anakin's anxiety dreams about Padmé dying in childbirth bring him to a crossroads, presenting him with two different [[philosophical_responses_to_death_in_star_wars | philosophical responses to death]] – the [[sith_versus_jedi_approach_to_mortality | Sith way]] or the [[sith_versus_jedi_approach_to_mortality | Jedi way]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

*   **The Jedi Approach:** Yoda advises Anakin to "Train yourself to let go of everything you fear to lose" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. This aligns with Buddhist principles, where *jaramarana* (the desire to escape old age and death) is a dangerous impulse, and nonattachment is the way to defeat it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. Yoda embodies this, facing his own death with peaceful acceptance, which Becker would call the attitude of a "knight of faith" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. His nonattachment is grounded in faith in the light side of the Force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

*   **The Sith Approach:** Lacking Yoda's faith, Anakin turns to Palpatine, who offers the [[sith_versus_jedi_approach_to_mortality | Sith approach]]: embracing desires, specifically the desire to prevent Padmé’s death, which is a form of [[anakin_skywalkers_transformation_and_death_denial | death denial]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. Palpatine tempts Anakin with the legend of Darth Plagueis the Wise, suggesting the dark side can defeat death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

## The Terminal Point of Death Denial

Anakin's choice to become a Sith Lord is contingent on saving Padmé's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. In refusing to accept death, he sacrifices his identity, loyalty, and conscience, killing children and his wife, and attempting to kill his mentor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. This represents the "terminal point of [[anakin_skywalkers_transformation_and_death_denial | death denial]]" according to Becker, where "the person seeks to avoid death, but he does it by killing off so much of himself...that he is actually isolating and diminishing himself and becomes as though dead" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. Left with no one to protect from death, [[darth_vader_and_the_fear_of_death | Darth Vader]] becomes an instrument of power and little else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.

## Overcoming Fear and Redemption

The narrative contrasts Anakin's [[anakin_skywalkers_transformation_and_death_denial | death denial]] with the acceptance of death shown by other characters:

*   **Obi-Wan Kenobi's Sacrifice:** Obi-Wan's apparent "rapture" during his duel with [[darth_vader_and_the_fear_of_death | Darth Vader]] on the Death Star is presented as a demonstration of an alternative to Vader's [[anakin_skywalkers_transformation_and_death_denial | death denial]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. His willingness to embrace death makes him "more powerful than Vader could ever imagine," by allowing him to transcend it and become a Force ghost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.

*   **Luke Skywalker's Acceptance:** Unlike Anakin, who indiscriminately killed due to his fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>, Luke is willing to sacrifice his own life to avoid turning to the dark side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. His refusal to kill [[darth_vader_and_the_fear_of_death | Darth Vader]] when asked by Darth Sidious highlights his acceptance of death as what truly separates a Jedi from a Sith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

It is only when Anakin follows his son's example, renouncing his own life, that he finally embraces the reality of death and conquers *jaramarana* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. This redemption allows him to join the Force ghost "squad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

Becker argues that [[anakin_skywalkers_transformation_and_death_denial | death denial]] is responsible for human violence, conquest, and the desire to control surroundings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. Evil Empires, both fictional and real, stem from an inability to accept mortality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. However, accepting the reality of death can foster dignity, courage, and compassion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.

## Rick and Morty's "Vindicators 3" as Social Commentary

"The Vindicators 3: Return of the World Ender" episode of *Rick and Morty* serves as a pointed critique of the superhero genre and formulaic popular cinema, particularly Marvel movies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Rick acts as a mouthpiece for those disillusioned with the repetitive nature of such films, highlighting their emphasis on drama and explosions over substance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

The episode's central arc revolves around Morty's optimistic worldview crumbling, similar to his experience in "Meeseeks and Destroy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Just as his wholesome view of fairy tales eroded in the earlier episode, "Vindicators 3" subverts the superhero genre, shattering Morty's faith in his heroes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## Deconstructing Good and Evil

A deeper theme explored in the episode is the complexities of good and evil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. Rick plays a unique role in Morty's disillusionment, orchestrating *Saw*-inspired trials that reveal the Vindicators' true, often morally compromised, natures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. For example, Vance reveals his true colors, Million Ants kills Allen Rails over a woman, and Crocubot exposes the Vindicators' secrets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

The episode draws inspiration from unique villains in popular cinema:
*   **Jigsaw (Saw)**: Unlike typical antagonists motivated by murder or financial gain, Jigsaw aims to change people's paradigms by making them endure suffering, sometimes to appreciate life more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. Similarly, Drunk Rick's trials are designed to create a moral crisis for the Vindicators, proving to Morty that they are not true heroes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.
*   **The Joker (The Killing Joke, [[philosophical_influences_on_fight_club | The Dark Knight]])**: The Joker, like Jigsaw, is not solely motivated by murder. His goal is to demonstrate that with "one sufficiently bad day," someone like Commissioner Gordon could become as mad as him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. Rick's actions mirror this by pushing the Vindicators to reveal their worst sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. Just as The Joker infects Harvey Dent with his [[influence_of_philosophers_and_filmmakers_on_dark_souls_narrative | nihilistic philosophy]], Rick transforms the seemingly benevolent Vindicators into violent backstabbers, thereby upending Morty's simplistic understanding of good and evil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

The show suggests that the way narratives of good and evil are presented can be problematic, particularly when thinking in overly simplistic terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. Philosopher Jacques Ranciere addresses the issue of "Evil" (with a capital E) found in superhero movies. He argues that when conflict becomes an ultimate struggle between Good and Evil, the value of winning becomes infinite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. This perspective can rationalize extreme actions, such as exterminating an entire planet, if it means destroying ultimate evil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. Ranciere posits that "infinite" evil warrants "infinite justice," which often disregards morals or collateral damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

## The Noble Lie

By the episode's end, Supernova, like Rick, has adopted a [[influence_of_philosophers_and_filmmakers_on_dark_souls_narrative | nihilistic philosophy]], no longer believing in a real division between good and evil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. However, she understands the importance of maintaining the simplistic division publicly, even being willing to kill Rick, Morty, and her lover to protect the perception of the Vindicators' goodness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. For Supernova, it's not their actions that matter, but the galaxy's faith in their actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

This concept is a clear reference to [[philosophical_influences_on_fight_club | The Dark Knight]], which explores moral greyness in a comic book movie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. Batman's decision to lie about Harvey Dent's "goodness" to maintain order in Gotham parallels Supernova's desire to uphold a similar lie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. Both advocate for a "noble lie," an idea made famous by the Greek philosopher Plato, which posits that societies can be built on a myth to maintain order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. While [[philosophical_influences_on_fight_club | The Dark Knight]] tends to celebrate this lie, *Rick and Morty* uses it to deconstruct the myth of superheroes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

## The Dilemma of Good and Evil in Rick and Morty

While *Rick and Morty* frequently deconstructs good and evil as arbitrary concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>, it also suggests that a complete absence of these concepts is problematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. This is reinforced by Dr. Wong's confrontation with Rick, where she states that Rick uses his intelligence to justify his "sickness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. Unlike the Vindicators, who fail to critically engage with their methods, Rick refuses to engage with his decisions because he believes "nothing matters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. If good and evil are merely social constructs, Rick feels justified in doing whatever he wants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

The episode presents two bleak perspectives on good and evil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>:
1.  **Zero conviction**: This leads to moral apathy, exemplified by Rick doing whatever he wants without consequence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
2.  **Complete conviction**: This leads to destructive actions in the name of "good," such as exterminating an entire planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.

Ultimately, *Rick and Morty* concludes that there are "no right answers, only wrong ones" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

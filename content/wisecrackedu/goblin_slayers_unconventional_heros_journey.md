The anime *Goblin Slayer* immediately drew attention for its notorious opening scene, but beyond the initial shock, the show presents an interesting development for the [[analysis_of_fantasy_genre_tropes_in_goblin_slayer | fantasy genre]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The central question that shapes the show's greater message is: Why does Goblin Slayer only kill goblins? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>

## A Quick Recap
The story begins with a bright-eyed Priestess and her friends embarking on their first adventure, eager to kill goblins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. However, things go horribly wrong, and her friends die. Goblin Slayer rescues her, and she subsequently joins his party, becoming his "goblin slaying padawan" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. Their group expands with the addition of an Elf, Dwarf, and Lizard Man, as they investigate worrisome goblins on the elven border and later, sewer goblins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. Notably, throughout these events, a Demon Lord threatens the realm, but Goblin Slayer remains singularly focused on his specific mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

## Subverting Fantasy Tropes
*Goblin Slayer* heavily references classic tabletop games like Dungeons & Dragons, incorporating elements such as dice rolling, spell slots, guilds, and quests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. The show embraces the generic aspects of the [[analysis_of_fantasy_genre_tropes_in_goblin_slayer | fantasy genre]], often giving characters and places intentionally generic names like "Elven Ranger," "Watertown," or "Sword Maiden," and even major antagonists like "Goblin Champion" or "Demon Lord" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

In typical fantasy narratives, heroes start by tackling small threats like rats, bugs, or goblins, gradually escalating to stronger, more interesting enemies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. The story builds to a grand confrontation with a horrifying villain threatening the world, after whose defeat, things are expected to return to a "happily ever after" state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

Goblin Slayer, however, explicitly deviates from this linear path, preferring to "just kill goblins, thanks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. He rationalizes this choice by arguing that even if the Demon Lord is defeated, goblins will continue to terrorize rural and vulnerable areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. By focusing on these "little guys," the show subverts the basic assumptions of the fantasy genre, particularly the notion of a definitive "happily ever after" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. The series dramatically underscores this point when the Demon Lord is dispatched in under a minute by random, unfamiliar heroes, rather than a climactic end-of-season showdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. This emphasizes that less spectacular monsters continue to plague villagers, challenging the idea that defeating a "big bad guy" resolves all problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

## Peace Theory and Persistent Problems
Goblin Slayer's logic can be understood through the lens of peace theory, which examines the nature of peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. Theorist Johan Galtung distinguishes between two types:
*   **Negative Peace**: The absence of war or major conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. In the [[analysis_of_fantasy_genre_tropes_in_goblin_slayer | fantasy genre]], this would be a world free from figures like the Night King, Sauron, or Ganondorf, or a Demon Lord destroying the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. However, this definition often overlooks the smaller, more pervasive forms of violence that affect society's most vulnerable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
*   **Positive Peace**: The presence of justice and protections that serve the needs of everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. This is what Goblin Slayer strives for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. In the show, the "goblins" represent these persistent threats, but in the real world, they can symbolize myriad issues like poverty, famine, disease, corruption, discrimination, and crime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

Positive peace highlights that for many, violence is not an interruption to daily life but its constant backdrop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. Unlike the "platinum heroes" who swiftly defeat the Demon Lord, Goblin Slayer cannot relax at an idyllic farm without continually searching for signs of goblins and fortifying defenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. In his view, the very structure of the world ensures that people in rural areas will always face goblin attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. His seemingly non-peaceful act of "burning down goblin nests" is, in fact, a form of conflict prevention and development, addressing the immediate problem to initiate long-term protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

## The Stigma of "Grunt Work"
The "small work" of dealing with persistent issues is often shunned as "grunt work," with everyone seeking the glory of defeating a "Demon Lord" rather than "chopping goblins," which is seen as "child's play" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. Even after the Demon Lord's demise, the cleanup of his armies is considered beneath some heroes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

Despite being a silver-class adventurer, Goblin Slayer is mocked for his choice of missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. He's akin to a high-ranking general choosing to clean latrines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. This highlights a real-world issue: people often gravitate towards high-prestige, high-paying jobs, overlooking professions with significant social impact, like doctors researching cancer versus those preventing stomach illnesses by testing water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. As a child, Goblin Slayer dreamed of slaying dragons, but a firsthand encounter with the dangers of goblins cemented his commitment to his current mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

This stigma has two significant consequences:
1.  **Minimizing the Threat**: The disdain for goblin slaying leads many to underestimate the danger goblins pose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. While their defeat might seem simple, goblins are depicted as cunning and dangerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. Because silver-ranked heroes deem goblin-slaying beneath them, unqualified individuals are often sent to deal with the problem, leading to their demise and the continued proliferation of goblins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.
2.  **Worsening Problem and Hero Embarrassment**: As goblins breed, they become even more dangerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. Major heroes avoid involvement, either dismissing goblins as pests or fearing the embarrassment of admitting their threat after having defeated larger villains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. The Sword Maiden, a powerful priestess who previously slayed the original Demon Lord, exemplifies this, hiring Goblin Slayer to deal with goblins she herself feared due to past trauma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. Admitting fear of goblins after defeating a Demon Lord goes against the "unspoken hero code" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

Goblin attacks leave people in a constant state of fear and anxiety, exacerbating their already difficult lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. This elevates the stakes of [[positive_and_negative_peace_theory_in_context_of_goblin_slayer | positive peace]]: while Goblin Slayer's actions might not change material conditions, they significantly improve psychological well-being. His intervention helps the Sword Maiden overcome her nightmares, for example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.

## The Future of the Narrative
This unique approach to [[analysis_of_fantasy_genre_tropes_in_goblin_slayer | fantasy]] raises questions about the narrative's future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. Normally, threats escalate throughout a series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. However, with the Demon Lord already defeated and Goblin Slayer committed solely to goblins, the challenge lies in finding creative ways to escalate the stakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. Perhaps this will involve more ambiguity regarding the goblin threat or a false sense of security settling across the land, keeping the goblin problem in obscurity for most <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.

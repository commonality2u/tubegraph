*Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood* explores the efficacy and application of science, or "Alchemy," throughout Edward and Alphonse Elric's journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>. While alchemy serves as their means to restore their bodies, the narrative also portrays its use for "awful things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>. The series prompts questions about how science is applied and the role of faith in this discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>.

The setting of Amestris, reminiscent of pre-World War 2 Europe, highlights the success of Alchemy, which is defined as the manipulation and altering of matter using natural energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>. Alchemy is treated as a science, combining chemistry and biology with unique laws and principles, most notably "The Law of Equivalent Exchange" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>.

## Science vs. Faith: An Early Conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>

The show immediately establishes a dynamic between science and faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. Early in their travels, Edward and Alphonse encounter Father Cornello in Liore, a holy figure who gains control through "miracles" and indoctrination into "Leto-ism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. The brothers' skepticism is justified when they expose Cornello's miracles as "cleverly veiled applications of Alchemy" used to attract followers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>. This incident initially suggests that "Science Rules Faith drools!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>.

However, this simple conclusion is quickly complicated. The brothers next encounter Shou Tucker, the "Sewing-Life Alchemist," renowned for creating a talking chimera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. Their fascination turns to horror when Tucker reveals he used his family dog and his own daughter as components for his chimera, claiming he was "only doing what science demands" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>. This atrocity forces a re-evaluation, as science no longer appears "so innocent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>.

## The Problem of [[critiques_of_scientism_through_anime | Scientism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>

Shou Tucker, the "amoral alchemist" seeking scientific knowledge at any cost, sets the tone for the series, prompting viewers to question the value of "single-mindedly clinging to science" and the consequences of reducing all knowledge to scientific terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>. This mode of thought is broadly known as [[critiques_of_scientism_through_anime | scientism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>.

Philosophers critiquing [[critiques_of_scientism_through_anime | scientism]] do not claim science is false, but rather criticize the elevation of scientific knowledge above all other forms and the attempt to reduce other knowledge into it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>. Philosopher Paul Feyerabend argued that science is merely one of many explanatory frameworks, "neither as rational nor consistent as it pretends to be" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>. An unquestioning acceptance of any ideology, like [[critiques_of_scientism_through_anime | scientism]] or "Leto-ism," can lead to "potentially disastrous results" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>.

## Moral Implications of Alchemy

### Dehumanization
*Brotherhood* depicts how science can create "monsters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>. This impersonal, dehumanizing aspect of alchemy is inherent in "The Law of Equivalent Exchange," which "reduces objects animals and even people to their physical components" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>. The Elric brothers' initial quest to revive their mother by transmuting basic human ingredients exemplifies this reductionist view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>.

The "Philosopher's Stone," one of alchemy's most sought-after creations, further illustrates this moral dilemma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>. The stone's key ingredient is human life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>. While the stone can restore bodies, the Elrics are unwilling to use it due to its abhorrent origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>. In contrast, the Homunculi, artificial humans powered by these stones, exemplify [[critiques_of_scientism_through_anime | scientism]] by "reducing the souls trapped within the stones to mere alchemic principles" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:00">[06:31:00]</a>. The Elric brothers, however, demonstrate their morality by respecting the "autonomy of those souls," aligning with philosopher Immanuel Kant's view that people should never be reduced to calculations but are "always a goal in themselves" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:00">[07:01:00]</a>.

### Subservience to the Military
Alchemy is heavily controlled by the Amestrian government, with "state appointed tenets of Alchemy," the first of which is to "LITERALLY obey the military" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:52:00">[07:52:00]</a>. State Alchemists are consequently referred to as "dogs of the military" and "human weapons" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a>.

Sociologist Stanley Aronowitz, in *Science Wars*, notes that scientists often view themselves as independent but are frequently funded by corporations or the state, losing ownership of their discoveries and control over their application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:20:00">[08:20:00]</a>. Edward constantly struggles with the militarization of science and his complicity in it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:45:00">[08:45:00]</a>.

The military's influence even distorts the basic principles of science. While the Elrics understand alchemy as "understanding the natural flow of energy, both deconstructing AND reconstructing it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:10:00">[09:10:00]</a>, this principle is twisted by the military to justify destroying and slaughtering populations as "Alchemic Rebirth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:00">[09:34:00]</a>.

### The Ishbalan War of Extermination and Historical Parallels
As tools of the government, alchemists become instruments of the series' main antagonist, "Father," who controls the Amestrian state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:00">[10:04:00]</a>. Father uses alchemy, military conflicts, and millions of lives to prepare to "assume the mantle of God" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:14:00">[10:14:00]</a>. The Ishbalan War of Extermination, Amestris' most brutal war, was fought solely to further Father's plan, with state alchemists making their largest military impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:24:00">[10:24:00]</a>.

The war is shocking not only for alchemy's devastating force but also for the "scientific language used to explain it," sanitizing genocide with sterile terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:45:00">[10:45:00]</a>. Führer King Bradley even invoked "The Law of Equivalent Exchange" to justify refusing a ceasefire in exchange for a high priest's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:10:00">[11:10:00]</a>.

The nation of Amestris, with its "Führer," resemblance to pre-World War 2 Germany, "blond-haired blue-eyed army" similar to the SS, and "Might is Right" motivation, draws clear historical parallels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:37:00">[11:37:00]</a>. General Raven's use of Social Darwinism to justify mass extermination further reinforces this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:58:00">[11:58:00]</a>. Amestris' human experiments, including raising babies in underground labs, stitching people and animals, and ripping souls from bodies, echo the "wanton cruelty and morbid scientific curiosity" of Auschwitz's Dr. Josef Mengele <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:10:00">[12:10:00]</a>. Paul Feyerabend, who fought in World War 2 and witnessed scientific arguments for war and genocide by a dictatorship, later proposed a "separation between science and state" with ultimate power resting in democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:46:00">[12:46:00]</a>.

## Beyond Ideology: The Search for Truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:28:00">[19:28:00]</a>

*Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood* presents a cautionary tale about the blind adherence to science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:25:00">[13:25:00]</a>. It shows that both the "blind following of science as the arbiter of truth" and the "blind following of Faith as the arbiter of truth" can be equally harmful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:32:00">[15:32:00]</a>. Characters in *Brotherhood* grow when they recognize the limitations of adhering to any single ideology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:00:00">[16:00:00]</a>.

Edward and Alphonse question the foundations of Western Alchemy, leading them to Alkahestry, science's Eastern equivalent, which uses life energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:06:00">[16:06:00]</a>. Bridging these two ideologies allows them to triumph <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:23:00">[16:23:00]</a>.

Scar, a survivor of the Ishbalan War, initially targets State Alchemists for revenge, believing they transgress against God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:40:00">[16:40:00]</a>. However, he eventually realizes the error of seeking vengeance and that "no ideology can justify murder" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:52:00">[16:52:00]</a>. He even breaks from the strict laws of his faith, using alchemy to save the country he once hated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:10:00">[17:10:00]</a>.

In contrast, Father remains "blinded by [[critiques_of_scientism_through_anime | scientism]]," obsessed with alchemy's power, viewing mankind as mere materials for his quest to become God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:33:00">[17:33:00]</a>. He discards human emotions, literally ripping the seven deadly sins from himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:51:00">[17:51:00]</a>. His conviction in the absolute supremacy of science and the ability to achieve perfection through it ultimately leads to his undoing when the souls he dismissed as energy assert their will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:07:00">[18:07:00]</a>. Father, unlike Scar, refuses to recognize human wisdom beyond alchemy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:52:00">[18:52:00]</a>.

Edward and Alphonse are distinct for their "humble rejection of a single ideology" and their "strong desire to discover their own truth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:07:00">[19:07:00]</a>. When faced with the choice of sacrificing the world for their bodies via the Philosopher's Stone, Al rejects this "alchemic worldview" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:57:00">[19:57:00]</a>. This search for possibilities allows Edward to make his final transmutation, sacrificing his ability to perform alchemy and recognizing the arrogance of thinking alchemy could explain everything or solve all his problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:21:00">[20:21:00]</a>. Unlike Father, Edward accepts his place in the universe, understanding that power is not equivalent to knowledge or happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:40:00">[20:40:00]</a>.

After restoring their bodies, the brothers continue to search for truth and new methods to discover it, travelling east and west to gather all knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:06:00">[21:06:00]</a>. This ongoing quest suggests that a complete understanding requires moving beyond rigid, singular ideologies.

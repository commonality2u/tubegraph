The role of [[character_analysis_of_the_joker | Jared Leto's Joker]] in *Suicide Squad* is largely considered to serve no clear purpose within the film's narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. Despite this, there are subtle hints of an intended thematic contribution, particularly concerning the film's central theme of [[theme_of_control_in_suicide_squad | control]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.

## Contributions to the Theme of [[theme_of_control_in_suicide_squad | Control]]

### Control Over [[The Jokers relationship with Batman | Harley Quinn]]
The [[character_analysis_of_the_joker | Joker]] exerts significant [[theme_of_control_in_suicide_squad | control]] over [[The Jokers relationship with Batman | Harley Quinn]] through their abusive relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. This dynamic is explicitly visualized by [[The Jokers relationship with Batman | Harley]]'s jacket, which states "Property of [[The Jokers relationship with Batman | The Joker]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. By the film's conclusion, [[The Jokers relationship with Batman | Harley Quinn]] remains under the [[theme_of_control_in_suicide_squad | Joker]]'s influence, being treated "like a possession" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.

### Thematic Line: "Desire Becomes Surrender"
The only part where the [[character_analysis_of_the_joker | Joker]] appears to contribute to the film's thematic discussion is through his line: "Desire becomes surrender, surrender becomes power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

This concept is hinted at during the film's climax when Enchantress attempts to seduce the Squad by revealing their deepest desires:
*   [[The Jokers relationship with Batman | Harley]] dreams of a normal life with the [[The Jokers relationship with Batman | Joker]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.
*   Deadshot dreams of killing [[The Jokers relationship with Batman | Batman]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.
*   Diablo dreams of having his family back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

These desires make the characters want to surrender, which would grant Enchantress power over them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

## Unresolved Thematic Arc

While there are hints of an attempt to establish an arc with [[The Jokers relationship with Batman | Harley Quinn]] relating to desire, surrender, and power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>, this development is ultimately incomplete in the final cut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. Initially, [[The Jokers relationship with Batman | Harley]] submits to desire by allowing the [[The Jokers relationship with Batman | Joker]] to dominate her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. Though she later rejects desire by refusing Enchantress's domination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>, this does not result in a lasting lesson for [[The Jokers relationship with Batman | Harley]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. She does not experience a "paradigm shifting moment" where she refuses to let her desires empower others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>, as she is immediately back under the [[The Jokers relationship with Batman | Joker]]'s [[theme_of_control_in_suicide_squad | control]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.

>[!failure] Overall Impact
>The limited and unresolved aspects of the [[character_analysis_of_the_joker | Joker]]'s role mean his character ultimately does not develop the film's central theme of [[theme_of_control_in_suicide_squad | control]] in any meaningful way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. This is a common point in the [[criticisms_of_suicide_squads_execution | criticisms of Suicide Squad's execution]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

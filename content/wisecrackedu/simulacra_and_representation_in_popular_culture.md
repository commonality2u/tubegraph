*The Big Bang Theory*, a television show that deals with science, comics, and other elements of [[representation_of_geek_culture_in_media | geek culture]], is critically analyzed for its profound shortcomings, particularly its reliance on superficial references <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. The show's approach to humor and character depiction is argued to demonstrate a "death of meaning," aligning with philosophical concepts of simulacra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

## The Problem of Referentiality in *The Big Bang Theory*

*The Big Bang Theory* extensively uses referentiality, incorporating elements from [[representation_of_geek_culture_in_media | nerd culture]] such as *Star Trek* and *Battlestar Galactica*, as well as scientific facts and mathematical formulas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. These references are used to reinforce that characters like Leonard and Sheldon are "diehard nerds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

However, the show's jokes often rely on the *fact* that characters are discussing science or obscure topics, rather than the content or meaning of the reference itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. For example, a joke about friction or a dislocated humerus is funny because it's a scientific reference, not because the science itself is inherently humorous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. This contrasts with shows like *Futurama*, where references, such as to "aleph null" (the mathematical symbol for an infinite set of countable numbers), imbue the joke with additional meaning related to the subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. In *The Big Bang Theory*, the details of the science are often irrelevant; the show simply requires recognition that a scientific reference has been made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. This approach is described as "lazy writing" and a step toward the "annihilation of reality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

## Jean Baudrillard and the Death of Meaning

The philosopher Jean Baudrillard's concerns about references lacking a subject are applied to *The Big Bang Theory*'s use of references <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. Baudrillard believed that society is moving towards a state where reality is "obliterated" due to increasingly detached forms of representation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

Baudrillard's four levels of representation:
1.  **First Level**: A perfectly accurate representation of reality, like a picture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
2.  **Second Level**: An unfaithful copy that obscures reality, such as a filter that makes one look prettier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
3.  **Third Level**: A representation that deliberately hides the fact that no reality is being represented, like an artist rendering a person they've never seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
4.  **Fourth Level**: Signs and representations begin to reference other signs and representations, leading to a complete loss of any sense of original reality, exemplified by photoshopping a photoshopped image or making memes of other memes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. Baudrillard argued that society is already living in a world controlled by this system of "fourth-order simulacra," where reference to original reality is lost, leading him to consider reality itself a simulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

### *The Big Bang Theory* as Simulacra

From an optimistic perspective, *The Big Bang Theory* could be seen as a "second-order representation," a distorted view of real [[representation_of_geek_culture_in_media | nerd culture]] that gets details wrong but is still *about* real nerd culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. However, a more pessimistic view suggests it is a "third-order representation": a show about [[representation_of_geek_culture_in_media | nerd culture]] with no relation to reality, effectively a copy of something that never existed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

*The Big Bang Theory* is accused of presenting "science without actual science" and [[representation_of_geek_culture_in_media | "nerd culture without real nerds"]], instead portraying caricatures based on external perceptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. The jokes are "references for the sake of references," not requiring any understanding of the subject matter, but only the recognition that it is a scientific reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

This progression of copies, divorced from reality, signals the "death of meaning," making all ideas interchangeable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. The show's jokes, being "apropos of nothing," allow characters to "spew meaningless nonsense under the guise of a meaningful joke" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. An example is the fictional game "Mystic Warlords of Ka’a," which starts as a parody of *Magic the Gathering* but quickly devolves into "utter nonsense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. The joke's effectiveness doesn't rely on the specific words used, because the show functions by selling "an empty joke under the guise of a meaningful one" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.

## Humor at the Expense of Characters

If the references are meaningless, the question arises: what are audiences laughing at <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>? The answer suggested is that the show "basically just sh*ts on its characters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. Examples include jokes about Leonard's academic achievements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>, discussions of buying a prostitute for Howard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>, and Sheldon's defense of Amy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.

This aligns with the **Superiority Theory of Humor**, an early Western philosophy of humor. Plato suggested laughter is a form of scorn, directed at those unaware of their own flaws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. Thomas Hobbes modified this, proposing laughter stems from our competitive nature and either triumphing over others or witnessing their downfall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. René Descartes also contributed, defining laughter as scorn derived from perceiving "some small evil in a person whom we consider to be deserving of it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. These philosophers generally agree that laughter often comes at the expense of others, making the laugher feel good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.

However, unlike shows where characters might be deemed "horrible people deserving our scorn," *The Big Bang Theory*'s showrunner, Chuck Lorre, stated the show is "not about geeks or nerds, [but] about extraordinary people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. This raises the question of why these "extraordinary" characters are consistently belittled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.

Ultimately, the show's superficial engagement with [[representation_of_geek_culture_in_media | nerd culture]], where references are mechanically inserted for their own sake, reveals a "contempt for real nerds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. The specifics of [[representation_of_geek_culture_in_media | nerd culture]] become irrelevant, as long as the characters appear to be "wanky assholes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. This disservice means that instead of seeing themselves reflected on screen, actual [[representation_of_geek_culture_in_media | nerds]] are presented with caricatures that are "dumped on" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

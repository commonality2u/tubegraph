George Orwell's "1984" explores a totalitarian regime known as "The Party," led by "Big Brother" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. A key method of control for The Party is the manipulation of [[Perception of Reality | reality]] through a concept called "doublethink" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

## Doublethink

Doublethink is a core method of control employed by Big Brother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. It requires an individual to simultaneously hold two contradictory beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

This process involves two steps:
1.  **Conscious Belief in Falsehoods** Individuals make the conscious decision to believe something that is "obvious bullsh*t" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
2.  **Denial of the Lie** Simultaneously, they must deny that the accepted belief is a [[concept_of_real_vs_fake | lie]] in the first place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

The ultimate outcome is an individual who believes nonsense with the full conviction of it being the [[concept_of_real_vs_fake | truth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. As stated in O'Brien's book, "Doublethink goes on forever. With the lie always one step ahead of the truth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

## Reality Manipulation

Beyond overt surveillance, The Party's ability to twist [[Perception of Reality | reality]] is crucial to its power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. A totalitarian dictator cannot simply destroy the [[concept_of_real_vs_fake | truth]], like Hitler, who burned books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Instead, they must actively rebuild it, much like Stalin, who rewrote texts to align with his ideology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. Orwell's Oceania reflects Stalin's more effective methods of controlling his populace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

Through this constant recreation of [[Perception of Reality | reality]], individual qualities are eradicated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. Individuals lose their sense of self, existing only as what the government dictates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

> [!WARNING] A Universal Warning
> "1984" is not merely a critique of Stalinism, but a broader warning for all of humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. Orwell suggests that without fundamental societal change, people risk becoming "soulless robots" without even realizing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

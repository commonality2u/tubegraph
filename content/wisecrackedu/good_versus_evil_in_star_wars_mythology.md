Rian Johnson's *The Last Jedi* aimed to revolutionize the Star Wars franchise, a goal that included redefining the long-established [[concept_of_good_and_evil_in_pop_culture | concept of good and evil]] within its mythology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. This approach led to significant [[star_wars_fan_backlash_and_criticism | fan backlash]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Subverting the Traditional Narrative

Johnson sought a "radical subversion of the Star Wars formula" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>, believing that "For the new Star Wars to live, the old Star Wars must die" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. This desire for progress involved abrasively undermining tropes that characterized previous films <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

Changes included:
*   **Heroic Lineage** Rey's parents are revealed to be "degenerate winos" and "filthy junk traders" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>, a stark contrast to Luke Skywalker's noble lineage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. Heroes are janitors and mechanics, not politicians and princesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
*   **Redefinition of Heroes** Luke Skywalker is depicted not as an idealistic hero, but a "failed nephew murder/slovenian philosopher" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. Yoda transforms from a symbol of Jedi piety to a "would-be book burner" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
*   **Critique of the Jedi Order** *The Last Jedi* suggests that the Jedi Order "kinda sucks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>, portraying their legacy as "failure. Hypocrisy. Hubris" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. Luke blames them for allowing Darth Sidious to rise and for the creation of Darth Vader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
*   **Cyclical Nature of Conflict** The film posits that previous events did not lead to true progress, as a nearly identical fascist order (the First Order) arose after the Empire's collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. Johnson seems to suggest this re-emergence of evil stems from an "inadequate conception of good and evil" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

## Jungian Archetypes and the Force

Star Wars mythology is largely built around stark divisions between good and evil, exemplified by "the Dark SIDE not the Dark 'nuance'" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. The original trilogy was crafted around Joseph Campbell's "The Hero with a Thousand Faces," which sets forth a "universal story structure" known as the monomyth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. Campbell's monomyth draws from Carl Jung's psychological concepts, particularly "archetypes" and the "collective unconscious" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

### The Shadow Archetype
Jung's concept of the "shadow" refers to the primal, repressed "dark side" of the unconscious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. In the monomyth, this dark side is often embodied by a character representing the protagonist's fears and shortcomings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. Darth Vader serves as Luke Skywalker's shadow, reminding Luke of what he could become if he doesn't conquer fear and master his passions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. Confronting Vader is not just physical, but emotional and psychological <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

*The Last Jedi*, however, offers a different perspective on confronting inner demons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.

### Balance in the Force
Traditionally, "balance in the force is desirable for the good of the galaxy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. *The Last Jedi* suggests that the Force inherently promotes balance: "When the darkness rises, the force amplifies the light to balance it out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. This implies an inverse: a powerful Jedi order would be met by an equally powerful dark side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.

Luke's criticism of the Jedi Order hints that they are partly to blame for the cyclical rise and fall of fascist empires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. He suggests that the Force does not belong to the Jedi, and to say the light dies if the Jedi die is vanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. The film argues that conquering the dark side with the light causes the Force to "overcorrect" for balance, leading to more amplifications of evil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.

Jungian analyst Robert A. Johnson (not Rian Johnson) argues that repressing one's "dark sides" causes "ego split" and leads to projecting "ugliness" onto others, resulting in perpetual conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. This is seen in the original *Star Wars*, where Luke's inner demons are projected onto Darth Vader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. Rian Johnson attempts to complicate the classic distinction between good and bad both within characters and the plot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

## Moral Ambiguity and Systemic Critique

The movie implies that conquering evil with good has failed the galaxy, as the Empire essentially returns as the First Order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>. To progress, Johnson tweaks the Jungian formula: the galaxy needs to reconcile its dark side with the larger order of things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

The character DJ, a cynical mercenary, explores how "even the good guys can get caught up with the darker elements of the universe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. He sees through the "false divisions of 'good' and evil,'" stating, "Good guys? Bad guys? Made up words" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. DJ reveals that arms dealers sell weapons to both the "bad guys" and "the good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>, marking a morally ambiguous moment that complicates the Rebellion's infallible good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.

Robert Johnson argues that an inability to reconcile with one's shadow leads to scapegoating, violence, war, and racism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. *The Last Jedi* suggests that a "system at play" is responsible, explicitly critiquing the galaxy's military economy and the exploitation inherent within it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

## The Retreat from Revolution

Despite establishing the need to "kill the past"—whether the past structure of *Star Wars* films or its moral lens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>—the film ultimately backpedals on its own radical ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.

Kylo Ren offers Rey a chance to end the dogmatism by joining him, urging to "Let the past die. Kill it if you have to" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. Rey, however, refuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.

The movie then reaffirms elements it had seemingly torn down:
*   Luke's legend is preserved, inspiring the galaxy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>.
*   The Jedi Order, despite Luke's earlier declaration that "It’s time for the Jedi to die" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>, is reaffirmed by Rey's statement, "And I will not be the last Jedi" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>.
*   The narrative structure of the original trilogy is referenced, with Luke echoing Obi-Wan's line: "Strike me down in anger, and I’ll always be with you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>.
*   The Jedi past, including its ancient texts, is preserved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.

This ideological shift occurs without clear plot-driven reasons, with Luke's change attributed vaguely to his love for his sister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.

### Rey and Ren: Conflicting Moral Codes
*The Last Jedi* builds a "psychologically sophisticated case for why Rey should team up with Ren" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>, arguing that "the old way doesn’t work" and that Jedis are "repressed as hell" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>. Ren arguably comes closer to Jungian balance, recognizing that ego and shadow are intertwined and cannot exist without each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. He represents a "realist" who understands the folly of false divisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>.

In contrast, Rey represents the "old moral code of Star Wars" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>, choosing to be the "good Jedi," a "morally-pure, infallible hero who definitely isn’t suppressing a lifetime’s supply of darkness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>.

The film's ultimate choice to subvert established ideas only to revert to them is seen as a missed opportunity, failing to fully commit to its proposed revolution of the *Star Wars* conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>.

*Billions* is a drama that chronicles the intense rivalry between a ruthless billionaire and an equally ruthless US Attorney [00:00:18]. Beyond its surface-level conflict, the show explores how games structure our lives and how the "gamification" of goals can have a corrosive effect on morality [00:00:28]. This phenomenon is framed through the lens of [[game_theory_in_billions | game theory]] [00:00:42].

## What is Game Theory?

[[game_theory_in_billions | Game theory]] is broadly defined as the study of how people make strategic decisions [00:03:02]. It can be applied to various real-world scenarios, such as negotiating a raise, online dating, selecting a jury, running for office, or playing the stock market [00:03:07]. The show *Billions* explicitly references [[game_theory_in_billions | game theory]] [00:03:37].

In the world of Axe Capital, [[game_theory_in_billions | game theory]] is primarily used to make more money by employing strategies like hedging bets, leveraging positions, taking short-term losses for long-term gains, misleading competitors, and managing information flow [00:03:46]. For Chuck Rhoades' office, [[game_theory_in_billions | game theory]] is applied in crafting plea deals, political maneuvering, and determining investigative tactics [00:04:12].

## The Prisoner's Dilemma

A core principle of [[game_theory_in_billions | game theory]] highlighted in *Billions* is the [[Prisoners dilemma explained | Prisoner's Dilemma]] [00:04:34].

### Explanation of the Dilemma
The [[Prisoners dilemma explained | Prisoner's Dilemma]] is a thought experiment from 1950s [[game_theory_in_billions | game theory]] [00:04:41]. It involves two people who commit a crime, for example, robbing a bank, but prosecutors only have enough evidence for a lesser charge, like trespassing [00:04:49]. Separated and unable to communicate, they are presented with a deal:
*   If both remain silent, they each receive 1 year in jail for trespassing [00:05:05].
*   If one rats on the other, the snitch goes free, and the other gets 10 years [00:05:10].
*   If both rat on each other, they receive 8 years due to leniency for confessing to the bank robbery [00:05:18].

The "ideal" way to play, if solely rational and self-interested, is to rat on the other person to go free [00:05:25]. However, if both adopt this rational strategy, they both end up worse off with 8 years, compared to the 1 year they would have received if they had both cooperated and remained silent [00:05:30].

### Application in Billions
Chuck Rhoades' office attempts to use the [[Prisoners dilemma explained | Prisoner's Dilemma]] to get Pete Decker to testify against Bobby Axelrod for insider trading [00:05:38]. Chuck's team creates a false impression that another investor is willing to snitch, attempting to make Decker believe he's in a [[Prisoners dilemma explained | Prisoner's Dilemma]] and thus coerce him into cooperating [00:05:52]. This illustrates how strategic deception is part of the game [00:06:04].

### Broader Societal Implications
The [[Prisoners dilemma explained | Prisoner's Dilemma]] can describe any situation where there's an incentive to betray others, but where collective betrayal makes everyone worse off [00:06:22]. An example given is waiting in line: if one person cuts, they benefit, but if everyone cuts, the line devolves into anarchy and everyone waits longer [00:06:31]. This multi-person version is known as the "free rider's dilemma" [00:06:47]. Chuck Rhoades himself demonstrates understanding of this when confronting someone for not cleaning up after their dog, arguing that such individual non-cooperation would lead to widespread negative consequences [00:06:51].

According to author William Poundstone, the [[Prisoners dilemma explained | Prisoner's Dilemma]] serves as a compelling metaphor for how society functions:
*   If everyone cooperates, everyone wins [00:07:15].
*   If almost everyone cooperates, "cheaters" win, but society is mostly alright [00:07:21].
*   If everyone cheats, it leads to anarchy and everyone loses [00:07:25].
Civilization, therefore, promotes cooperation [00:07:31].

## Loyalty and the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma

The [[Prisoners dilemma explained | Prisoner's Dilemma]] helps explain why loyalty is paramount at Axe Capital [00:07:36]. In an environment where employees could be caught by authorities and bring down Axe's business, Axe demands unflinching loyalty and cuts loose anyone who is disloyal [00:07:41]. Axe's right-hand man, Wags, emphasizes this, stating that an employee's disloyalty (seeking outside offers for a bonus) is worse than their competence, because "Donnie's loyal - good soldier" [00:07:52].

In the context of Axe Capital, the "game" is not played once but "over and over again" [00:08:37]. If someone "defects" (e.g., testifies to the feds), there are consequences from everyone else in the office [00:08:43]. Axe's strict demand for loyalty aims to remove doubt in such situations, ensuring "nobody defects to the feds, and everyone's better off in the end" [00:08:51]. This creates a sense of "honor among thieves" [00:08:56].

## The Chuck and Axe Rivalry: A Tit-for-Tat Game

The relationship between Chuck and Axe can be viewed as an iterated [[Prisoners dilemma explained | Prisoner's Dilemma]], where their actions escalate to further extremes to hurt each other [00:09:16]. This often involves psychological warfare, public humiliation, and financial sabotage [00:09:29].

Game theorists have studied strategies for the iterated [[Prisoners dilemma explained | Prisoner's Dilemma]], and one of the most effective is "tit for tat" [00:10:49]. This strategy, pioneered by Robert Axelrod (a coincidence given the show's character) in a 1980 computer tournament, is simple: cooperate, and only defect *after* your opponent has [00:10:57]. If they return to cooperating, you cooperate; if not, you don't [00:11:17]. It follows a basic moral principle: "Play nice, unless you’re wronged, then seek justice" [00:11:22].

However, the problem with both parties abiding by "tit for tat" is that it can lead to a spiral of revenge, as seen between Axe and Chuck, where one wrongdoing begets another [00:11:38].

The rivalry can be illustrated using a payoff matrix:
*   **Cooperation (50 points each)**: If Chuck and Axe leave each other alone, they are both somewhat happy, though neither fully achieves their goals [00:11:51].
*   **Chuck Defects / Axe Cooperates (Chuck 100, Axe -500)**: If Chuck pursues Axe while Axe leaves him alone, Axe could go to jail, and Chuck would advance his career [00:12:11].
*   **Axe Defects / Chuck Cooperates (Axe 100, Chuck -500)**: If Axe seeks revenge while Chuck leaves him alone, Chuck could go to jail, and Axe's ego would be satisfied [00:12:20].
*   **Both Defect (-100 points each)**: If both continually sabotage each other, they may get occasional satisfaction from revenge, but neither is happy, leading to a "downward spiral" [00:12:35].

Indeed, both Axe and Chuck repeatedly choose to "defect" rather than "cooperate," leading to personal losses: Wendy kicks Chuck out, Axe loses Lara, Axe loses his trading ability, and Chuck faces potential jail time [00:12:46].

The cycle of mutual destruction is only broken during the "Ice Juice scandal" [00:13:07]. Chuck manipulates Axe into faking a listeria outbreak to tank a stock, which subsequently implicates Chuck's wife, Wendy, who shorted the stock [00:13:14]. With Chuck having evidence against Axe, and Wendy's actions implicating both, they reach an impasse where further revenge means both go to jail [00:13:46]. This forces them to a "cooperative conclusion" through Wendy's mediation, where they set aside their egos to avoid jail time [00:13:52].

## Ethical Erosion

*Billions* illustrates the shortcomings of living life as a hyper-rational game [00:14:06]. As Sacker's father notes, "Principle doesn't usually go away all at once. It's a - uh - creeping erosion" [00:14:17]. For hyper-rational decision-makers or game theorists, life becomes a series of strategic decisions aimed at "winning the game" or optimizing outcomes [00:14:21]. However, this approach can lead to a slow loss of principle [00:14:31].

> [!QUOTE] "This business makes liars of all eventually.” <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[14:37]</a>

Taylor, an intern who becomes Axe's protégé, exemplifies this ethical erosion [00:14:40]. Initially possessing an acute understanding of [[game_theory_in_billions | game theory]], Taylor realizes that their love of winning and empathy are incompatible [00:14:49]. While Axe values Taylor's "outsider" perspective [00:15:10], once Taylor joins full-time, a person who was once involved in Occupy Wall Street [00:15:28] becomes as cruel and manipulative as Axe [00:15:32]. Taylor eventually betrays Axe, because loyalty simply "didn't just add up in their long-term calculus" [00:15:51].

## Breaking the Game

The show suggests escaping "the game" by going "meta" [00:15:57]. This concept comes to the forefront with Wendy Rhoades [00:16:02]. When faced with a "classic double bind" where any choice leads to disaster, Wendy is advised, "If the situation is untenable... you break that f*****g stick" [00:16:11]. Instead of remaining stuck in the revenge spiral between Chuck and Axe, Wendy reframes the situation not as a zero-sum game between rivals, but as a cooperative game where she mediates [00:16:49].

*Billions* ultimately poses a question: is [[game_theory_in_billions | game theory]] a tool to hack our lives and get what we want, or should we be cautious of how such "games" can fundamentally change us [00:17:07]?

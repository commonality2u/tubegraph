The effectiveness of action sequences in a narrative can be understood by distinguishing between "over the top fight scenes" and "dramatic action" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. While the former may offer spectacle, the latter is crucial for advancing the plot and engaging the audience.

## Dramatic Action

Dramatic action refers to any choice a character makes to advance their goal and the overall plot of a film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>. These choices don't necessarily have to be large; for instance, Luke deciding to follow R2D2 to find Obi-Wan in *Star Wars* is considered a small but significant dramatic action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>.

In effective storytelling, dramatic action drives the narrative forward. For example, in *Star Wars*, Luke receives Leia’s message about twenty minutes into the film, initiating his quest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>.

## The Problem of Excessive Non-Dramatic Action in *The Matrix Reloaded*

*The Matrix Reloaded*, despite having many "over the top fight scenes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>, is criticized for its severe lack of dramatic action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>. This absence is exacerbated by the film's philosophical exploration of determinism, which suggests that Neo's "choices" are merely illusions within a larger system of control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>. This thematic choice effectively negates any potential dramatic action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.

The film's opening scene, for instance, shows Neo dreaming of Trinity being shot, implying predetermined events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>. The first actual point of dramatic action—where a character makes a decision to advance goals and plot—does not occur until 39 minutes into the film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>, when Neo finally locates the Oracle after 44 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19:00">[05:19:00]</a>. Even this moment is undermined by the Oracle reminding Neo that he has already made his choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:45:00">[05:45:00]</a>, signaling his lack of agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:00">[06:06:00]</a>.

### Action Sequences That Fail to Advance the Plot

Several prominent action sequences in *The Matrix Reloaded* are noted for not advancing the narrative:
*   **Agent Smith Fight** The scene featuring Neo's fight with Agent Smith does not advance the plot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35:00">[07:35:00]</a>. This sequence, lasting over six minutes, is described as resembling a *Dynasty Warriors* game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41:00">[07:41:00]</a>.
*   **The Key Maker Chase** The movie's largest action sequence, taking up 22 minutes (the length of an entire television show), involves Agents chasing the Key Maker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:28:00">[09:28:00]</a>. However, this chase lacks logical purpose within the film's deterministic framework. If Neo is merely playing into the Architect's plan, it makes little sense for Agents to try and delete the Key Maker, as this would prevent Neo from reaching the Source and reintegrating his code, thereby "screwing" the Matrix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:00">[09:37:00]</a>.

These two major action set pieces ultimately serve no purpose in the narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:58:00">[09:58:00]</a>. The film spends significant time on determinism and these non-advancing action scenes, leaving less than twenty minutes dedicated to actual plot progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:03:00">[10:03:00]</a>.

### Consequences for Storytelling

The abundance of non-dramatic action and lengthy philosophical exposition in *The Matrix Reloaded* leads to a narrative where "nothing actually happened" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:17:00">[12:17:00]</a>. The film has only four main plot points: Neo finding the Oracle, Neo finding the Key Maker, Neo reaching the Source, and Neo saving Trinity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:24:00">[12:24:00]</a>. These moments are diluted by "unnecessary sermons on determinism" and long, unneeded fight scenes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:32:00">[12:32:00]</a>. Without meaningful dramatic action, it becomes difficult for the audience to root for Neo or care about what happens to him, as his choices appear predetermined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:45:00">[12:45:00]</a>. The film leaves the audience questioning whether Neo can truly make choices or break free from the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:53:00">[12:53:00]</a>.

*Watchmen* is recognized as a work of self-aware humor, along with media like *Deadpool* and *Cabin in the Woods*, that critiques the very genres they inhabit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This analysis explores *Watchmen*'s role as a satire, distinguishing it from parody and delving into its critical observations of the superhero genre and society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Premise and Twisted Archetypes

*Watchmen* poses the question: what if superheroes were just "a**holes" like regular people? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a> Both *Watchmen* and [[one_punch_man_as_a_parodic_work | One Punch Man]] take archetypes from their respective genres and twist them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. *Watchmen* features an "army of superhero knock-offs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

Its characters are distillations of elements from established superheroes:
*   **Ozymandias** embodies the charismatic, rich, and hyper-intelligent aspects of Batman, seen as a "force of good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
*   **Rorschach** represents the detective side of Batman, pursuing "Truth with a capital T," though his quest dangerously verges on "horrifying obsession" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. He is depicted as an "ugly version of Frank Miller’s take on the Caped Crusader" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
*   **Nite Owl** is a recreation of the nerdy, inventor version of Batman, akin to Adam West's portrayal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

Through these twisted versions, *Watchmen* makes observations about what audiences take for granted in superhero stories, such as the types of heroes, expected actions, and motivations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. This contrast explores a more "realistic version of superhero power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

## The Reality of Omnipotence: Dr. Manhattan

*Watchmen* explores the question of "what is having god-like power really like?" through Dr. Manhattan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. While characters like Dr. Manhattan aren't realistic, their reactions to immense power are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. Both Dr. Manhattan and Saitama from [[one_punch_man_as_a_parodic_work | One Punch Man]] confront the boredom that comes with omnipotence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. Dr. Manhattan spends his time on Mars, contemplating the nature of time and having "weird sex" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

Unlike traditional protagonists who struggle, Dr. Manhattan "literally knows everything" and physical confrontations are over before they begin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. He single-handedly won the Vietnam War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. This portrayal is ultimately a "grim joke about Superman," questioning why an all-powerful being would worry about humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. Unlike Superman, who evokes American values with his costume, Dr. Manhattan strips himself of ideology and gets naked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

## Satire and its Purpose

The critical [[distinction_between_satire_and_parody | difference between Watchmen and One Punch Man]] is that *Watchmen* is a satire, while [[one_punch_man_as_a_parodic_work | One Punch Man]] is a parody <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

According to Dustin Griffin's *Satire: A Critical Reintroduction*:
> "A work of satire is designed to attack vice or folly… it seeks to persuade an audience that something or someone is reprehensible or ridiculous… When it takes over another literary structure, it tends not just to borrow it… but to subvert it or… direct it’s energies towards alien ends." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>

*Watchmen* aligns with this definition by not only attacking societal vices and the superhero genre, but specifically assaulting the idea of anyone possessing powers comparable to a nuclear weapon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

### Focus on Nuclear Fear
*Watchmen* is largely about nuclear fear, personified by the "blue-skinned super being," Dr. Manhattan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.
*   Jon Osterman becomes Dr. Manhattan after a nuclear accident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.
*   He is used as a weapon to win the Vietnam War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.
*   His name is a "far from subtle reference to the Manhattan Project" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.
*   The narrative frequently references clocks counting down to "undesirable outcomes," symbolizing impending nuclear conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.
*   The graphic novel makes this clearer by constantly referencing nuclear security and depicting fear of nukes driving conflict, such as the Vietnam War being a response to fear of "nuke-wielding Russians" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.
*   The USSR and USA require a "fabricated attack on the earth" to resolve their differences, highlighting the extreme measures taken to de-escalate nuclear stand-offs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

### The Corrupting Influence of Power
*Watchmen* also explicitly points out the corrupting influence of power through **The Comedian** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. Superhero stories often suggest that "good guys" deserve power, but *Watchmen* refutes this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. The Comedian, despite being a "hyper-capable, super soldier" in the mold of Captain America or Wolverine, is also a "sadist and a psychopath" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.

## Watchmen's Persuasive Function

*Watchmen* uses the form and content of the superhero genre, including "Batman clones and all-powerful beings," to persuade its audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. It aims to prove that "something or someone is reprehensible or ridiculous," and in this case, that "something is the very idea of superheroes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

The work is dedicated to making the case that "the very existence of superheroes is a dangerous fantasy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. This is comparable to Jonathan Swift’s "A Modest Proposal," where Swift used the form of a political essay to expose the indifference to suffering among those in power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. Similarly, *Watchmen* uses the superhero narrative form to depict superheroes as "dangerous and sh*tty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.

It posits that superheroes create an "asymmetry of power that defies regulation," allowing them to "violate the rules and commit acts of violence at their own discretion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. This unchecked power inevitably becomes dangerous when different ethical frameworks, like those of Rorschach and Ozymandias, clash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. Whether it's superpowers or nuclear powers, such a degree of power "will inevitably lead to some f**ked up sh*t" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.

Every aspect of *Watchmen* is dedicated to "turning the traits we love about superheroes against themselves" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. Ultimately, *Watchmen* "condemns superhero fiction as a genre because it promotes a dangerous fantasy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>. This contrasts with [[one_punch_man_as_a_parodic_work | One Punch Man]], which seeks to improve and expand the genre rather than demolish it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>.

*Watchmen* is categorized as satire alongside works like *Team America*, *Dr. Strangelove*, and *Heathers* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>.

## Critique of Charity and Moralism in Modern Society

South Park often analyzes, parodies, and dissects current events, with its satire made poignant by its topicality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. While the show may contain humor like dick and fart jokes, its core references can be profound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

### "Scause for Applause" â€“ A Satire of Modern Charity

The episode "Scause for Applause" targets childhood heroes and criticizes the general population's approach to moralism and charity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

#### Parody of Public Figures and Moral Statements
The episode features Jesus and Stan as stand-ins for public figures like Lance Armstrong, twisting the moral center of Dr. Seuss stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.
When it's revealed that Jesus used pain killers and HGH and didn't genuinely suffer for sins, people line up to cut off their "What Would Jesus Do" bracelets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. This scene references the Lance Armstrong doping scandal and the public's reaction to the Livestrong bandwagon after his cheating was exposed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. Stan's stance in a Nike commercial also parodies their "What am I on?" ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.

#### The "Pityet" Economy and Cultural Capital
The episode adopts the animation and rhyme scheme of Dr. Seuss's "The Sneeches," where Sylvester McMonkey McBean preys on the Sneeches' desire to feel special by adding or removing stars from their bellies for profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. Similarly, in "Scause for Applause," Stan and Jesus visit "Doctor P.F. Pityet Bracelets and Factory" to make new bracelets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.

The name "Pityet" directly refers to an economic system that exploits pity and self-congratulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. South Park ridicules "raising awareness" as a form of "sick pity," where the person giving gains more self-gratification than the recipient of aid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.

> In the Sneeches, Dr. Seuss preaches kindness and focuses on commonalities as a way to bring people together. While South Park suggests that todays kindness and love of difference is likely no more than a way for people build their cultural capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

The episode lampoons individuals like Cartman who wear charities as a fashion statement, highlighting how people prefer causes that demand little to no effort over genuinely helping others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. South Park strips the Dr. Seuss story of its moralistic content, revealing the "perverted narcissism" prevalent in acts of charity and "consciousness raising" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

### Broader Critiques in South Park
South Park consistently "disembowels popular culture" and "cannibalizes the tropes and references that circulate through American discourse," re-presenting them to create new understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. This extends to its commentary on [[celebrity_culture_and_media_critique | celebrity culture]], where it exposes the "cruel sacrificial economy of celebrity reporting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

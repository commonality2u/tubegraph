[[philosophy_of_attack_on_titan | Attack on Titan]] is a colossal series known for its fight scenes and exploration of death's visceral reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Titans are presented as the physical personification of death, serving as walking reminders of human mortality and an existential confrontation with the inevitability of demise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. However, the darkest element of the series is not the introspective confrontations with death or the Titans themselves, but the construction of the society behind the walls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Societal Structure and Carl Schmitt's Influence

The setting of [[philosophy_of_attack_on_titan | Attack on Titan]] is an anachronistic, quasi-Germanic society, featuring German architecture, war cries, and character names <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. The political ideology of this society closely aligns with the beliefs of [[carl_schmitts_influence_and_theory_in_attack_on_titan | Carl Schmitt]], a notorious Nazi philosopher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. It is important to note that the show explores Schmitt's ideas without endorsing them, highlighting how a society facing a horrific enemy maintains stability while reflecting Nazi ideology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. The series provocatively asks if a controversial philosophy might be the only thing preventing a [[philosophical_themes_in_postapocalyptic_fiction | dystopian society]] from collapsing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

Central to [[carl_schmitts_influence_and_theory_in_attack_on_titan | Schmitt]]'s philosophy and the civilization in [[philosophy_of_attack_on_titan | Attack on Titan]] is the concept of "the political" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. For [[carl_schmitts_influence_and_theory_in_attack_on_titan | Schmitt]], three concepts are crucial for a stable society:
1.  Conflict and inequality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>
2.  [[friendenemy_distinction_and_sovereignty_in_attack_on_titan | Clear distinctions between friends and enemies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>
3.  [[friendenemy_distinction_and_sovereignty_in_attack_on_titan | Sovereignty]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>

### Conflict, Division, and Inequality

[[carl_schmitts_influence_and_theory_in_attack_on_titan | Schmitt]] emphasizes the inevitability of conflict, division, and inequality among human beings, rooted in an understanding of humanity's savage and hellish basic nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. This perspective is mirrored in the characters of Mikasa, Armin, and Eren, where the theme of a "dog eat dog world" and the necessity to fight for survival is constant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. This idea aligns with Thomas Hobbes' view that humanity is inherently monstrous, and [[social_commentary_on_violence_and_societal_structure | social structures]] are required to keep people in check <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. [[carl_schmitts_influence_and_theory_in_attack_on_titan | Schmitt]] further argues that hostility is unavoidable and inequality is inevitable, with politics not being tasked to fix it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. Instead, a strong sovereign should focus on maintaining order and control, rather than attempting to eliminate antagonism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

In [[philosophy_of_attack_on_titan | Attack on Titan]], this is evident in the societal stratification by literal walls, where each section represents its own caste system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. People within Wall Maria are less safe than those in Walls Rose and Sina <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. While those in Trost face danger, inner-city inhabitants live leisurely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. The scouts risk their lives, unlike the MP's in the inner walls who are largely inept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. For [[carl_schmitts_influence_and_theory_in_attack_on_titan | Schmitt]], attempting to alleviate inequality is a distraction from the true focus of "the political": nationalism and survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. This nationalistic duty is highlighted in the theme song for Season 1, which resembles "triumph of the will" level propaganda, depicting a fighting spirit against defeat and a will like starving wolves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

### [[friendenemy_distinction_and_sovereignty_in_attack_on_titan | Friend-Enemy Distinction]]

[[carl_schmitts_influence_and_theory_in_attack_on_titan | Schmitt]]'s second element of the political is a [[friendenemy_distinction_and_sovereignty_in_attack_on_titan | clear distinction between friend and enemy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. Effective governments, according to [[carl_schmitts_influence_and_theory_in_attack_on_titan | Schmitt]], require an enemy to struggle against to prevent human nature from driving an unending civil war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. The Titans serve as this external enemy, impeding constant infighting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. Both Erwin and Pyxis acknowledge the necessity of the Titans as an enemy, worrying that humanity itself is the real threat, and the Titans merely keep people in line by providing a common goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

It is speculated within the show that the Titans might be tools of the elite to lower the population, break people out of their "cages," or simply be evil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. If rogue Titans or figures like Annie are part of an inside conspiracy, it would reveal a government-fabricated enemyâ€”a [[carl_schmitts_influence_and_theory_in_attack_on_titan | Schmitt-ean]] ideal for maintaining social cohesion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. The Titans could be an allegory for the perfect scapegoat, mobilizing the population and empowering those in control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.

The theme of freedom in the show also reflects [[carl_schmitts_influence_and_theory_in_attack_on_titan | Schmitt]]'s [[friendenemy_distinction_and_sovereignty_in_attack_on_titan | friend-enemy distinction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. The Scouts' badge, the "wings of freedom," and Eren and Armin's longing for a life beyond the walls, liken humanity to "penned in cattle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. For [[carl_schmitts_influence_and_theory_in_attack_on_titan | Schmitt]], freedom and community are defined by denying cowardice in the face of death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. Joining the Scouts becomes a liberation from the fear of living inside the wall and waiting to die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. This desire for shared purpose transforms Eren's class into a political community, finding purpose on the battlefield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. A political community, for [[carl_schmitts_influence_and_theory_in_attack_on_titan | Schmitt]], is defined by the ability to kill enemies for friends or die at their hands for friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>. The Scouts, like the troops in Alfred Tennyson's "The Charge of the Light Brigade," embody this camaraderie, binding humanity's remnants together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

However, the [[friendenemy_distinction_and_sovereignty_in_attack_on_titan | friend-enemy distinction]] blurs as the show progresses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. Eren and Annie being Titans erodes the clear lines between a foreign enemy and a domestic friend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. Eren's partial transformation scene, saving Mikasa and Armin, demonstrates how a lack of clear division between human and Titan blurs the lines of who needs protection, making securing the population nearly impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.

### [[friendenemy_distinction_and_sovereignty_in_attack_on_titan | Sovereignty]]

The final element of [[carl_schmitts_influence_and_theory_in_attack_on_titan | Schmitt]]'s political theory is the power of the [[friendenemy_distlction_and_sovereignty_in_attack_on_titan | sovereign]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. A [[friendenemy_distinction_and_sovereignty_in_attack_on_titan | sovereign]] entity has the ability to declare states of emergency, justifying the sacrifice of populations for the greater good, such as sending a battalion to reclaim Wall Maria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. This power is crucial for long-term societal stability, preventing political bickering from hindering efforts against existential threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. The [[friendenemy_distinction_and_sovereignty_in_attack_on_titan | sovereign]] can also make legal exceptions, like granting special citizen status to those living inside Wall Sina <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.

In [[philosophy_of_attack_on_titan | Attack on Titan]], the leadership structure appears to be based on martial law and military rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>. While Premiere Dhalis Zachary leads the military tribunal with the power to execute Eren, and wall cultists have gained influence, the precise structure outside of military control remains largely unrevealed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. The leaders are shown to send millions to their death to ensure the safety of the rest of the population within the walls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. Pyxis reveals that the retaking of Wall Maria was a disguised purge to ease refugee stress, an act of sacrificing part of the population for the greater good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. [[carl_schmitts_influence_and_theory_in_attack_on_titan | Schmitt]] believed that the [[friendenemy_distinction_and_sovereignty_in_attack_on_titan | sovereign]] must retain the ability to perform such "horrendous things" to maintain order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>.

## Broader Implications and Future Questions

The series prompts contemplation on the potential consequences if the Titans were to disappear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. Would society devolve into anarchy or a civil war more brutal than Titan attacks, or would it lead to liberation and greater peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>? [[carl_schmitts_influence_and_theory_in_attack_on_titan | Schmitt]] posited that eradicating an enemy is not an option due to an inherent drive for warfare, suggesting that eliminating one enemy merely leads to the emergence of another until people are left to kill their own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.

Despite the problematic association with the Nazi Party, [[carl_schmitts_influence_and_theory_in_attack_on_titan | Schmitt]]'s work remains a subject of robust academic debate for understanding international conflict, executive power, systemic pitfalls, and even the War on Terror <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. [[philosophy_of_attack_on_titan | Attack on Titan]] has the potential to either become a scathing criticism of [[carl_schmitts_influence_and_theory_in_attack_on_titan | Schmitt-style]] politics or simply complicate them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.

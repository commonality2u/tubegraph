*The Big Bang Theory* is presented as a case study for analyzing humor, particularly its reliance on [[Referentiality and humor in television | referentiality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. The show is described as "profoundly bad" and requires [[Philosophical influences in media | philosophy]] to understand the extent of its shortcomings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

## The Problem with *The Big Bang Theory*'s Humor

*The Big Bang Theory* frequently uses [[Referentiality and humor in television | referentiality]], incorporating elements from nerd culture like *Star Trek* and *Battlestar Galactica*, as well as scientific facts and mathematical formulas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. These references are used to establish characters like Leonard and Sheldon as "diehard nerds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

However, the core issue identified is that the joke in *The Big Bang Theory* is often simply the *fact* that a reference is made, rather than the content or subject of the reference itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. For example, Sheldon defining "friction" or stating medical terms like "humerus" and "glenoid socket" is intended to be funny merely because he's talking about science, not because the scientific concept itself is humorous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. The actual science could often be replaced with gibberish without losing the intended comedic effect for many viewers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

This approach contrasts with shows like *Futurama*, where a reference (e.g., to aleph-null, the mathematical symbol for an infinite set of countable numbers) provides an "easter egg" for the knowledgeable viewer, but the joke's humor stems from the *impossibility* of the subject itself (an infinite number of movie screens), rather than just the recognition of the symbol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. In *Futurama*, the reference "imbues the joke with additional meaning," whereas *The Big Bang Theory* achieves the opposite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

The humor in *The Big Bang Theory* is characterized as "lazy writing" that relies on characters "cramming in whatever scientific explanation is relevant to the action" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. These jokes do not require an audience to understand the underlying science; instead, they rely on the simple recognition that a scientific reference has been made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

### Baudrillard's Philosophy and *The Big Bang Theory*

This form of [[Referentiality and humor in television | referentiality]] with no subject is linked to the ideas of French philosopher Jean Baudrillard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. Baudrillard believed that reality could be obliterated through different levels of representation, or simulacra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>:
*   **First Level:** A perfectly accurate representation of reality, like a picture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
*   **Second Level:** An unfaithful copy that obscures reality, like a filter making someone look prettier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
*   **Third Level:** A representation that deliberately hides the fact that no reality is being represented, such as an artist's rendering of a person they've never seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
*   **Fourth Level:** Signs and representations referencing other signs and representations, where all sense of reality is lost, like photoshopping a photoshopped image or making memes of other memes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. Baudrillard argued we are already living in a world controlled by this "fourth-order simulacra," where reference to original reality is lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

Applying this framework to *The Big Bang Theory*:
*   **Optimistic View:** The show is a distorted view of real nerd culture, fitting the **second order of representation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.
*   **Pessimistic View:** The show is about nerd culture but has no relation to reality, representing the **third order of representation** – "a copy of something that never existed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. It presents "science without actual science" and "nerd culture without real nerds," portraying characters more like what someone who has never met a nerd imagines them to be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.

For Baudrillard, these "copies divorced from reality" signify the "death of meaning" and make all ideas interchangeable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. The show's jokes, being "apropos of nothing," allow characters to "spew meaningless nonsense under the guise of a meaningful joke" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. The example of the in-show game "Mystic Warlords of Ka’a" demonstrates this, quickly devolving into interchangeable, meaningless terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. The joke functions regardless of the specific content because the show sells an "empty joke under the guise of a meaningful one" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

## Superiority Theory of Humor

If *The Big Bang Theory*'s humor doesn't derive from meaningful references, then what is the audience laughing at <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>? The analysis suggests the show "basically just sh*ts on its characters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. This aligns with the earliest theory of humor in the West: the **Superiority Theory** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.

*   **Plato** suggested laughter was a form of scorn, directed at those unaware of their own perceived awful nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.
*   **Thomas Hobbes** modified this, proposing laughter resulted from our competitive nature, a triumph over others or witnessing their downfall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.
*   **Descartes** viewed laughter as "scorn, which proceeds from our perceiving some small evil in a person whom we consider to be deserving of it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.

All three philosophers agreed that laughter is often at the expense of others, making oneself feel good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.

However, unlike *Seinfeld*, where characters are intentionally "horrible people deserving our scorn," *The Big Bang Theory* is presented as being about "extraordinary people," according to showrunner Chuck Lorre <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. The analysis questions why these "extraordinary" characters would be subjected to such ridicule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.

### Tearing Down Nerd Culture

The show's use of [[Referentiality and humor in television | referentiality]] for its own sake and its contemptuous portrayal of characters ultimately tears down nerd culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. By mechanically inserting references and not caring about the actual details, *The Big Bang Theory* shows "contempt for real nerds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. Instead of reflecting actual fans, the show presents caricatures that are simply "dumped on" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.

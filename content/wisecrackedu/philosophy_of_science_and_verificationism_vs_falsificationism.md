The rise of groups like Flat Earthers highlights a modern "crisis of knowing shit," where trust in experts has rapidly eroded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This phenomenon underscores a broader societal problem rooted in a poor understanding of how science itself operates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## What is the Philosophy of Science?

The [[scientific_inquiry_and_the_nature_of_evidence | philosophy of science]] is a field that grapples with fundamental questions about scientific knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. It asks:
*   How do we distinguish science from non-science? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>
*   How should evidence be weighed when testing a hypothesis? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>
*   What constitutes acceptable evidence? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>

While the scientific method is a part of this, the philosophy of science delves much deeper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. Understanding various philosophical frameworks, including their strengths and weaknesses, is crucial to recognizing the misuse of scientific language, as seen in Flat Earth claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

## Verificationism

In the early 1900s, a scientific doctrine called **verificationism** was proposed by a group known as logical positivists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. This model posited that science is defined by what can be *verified* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. If something cannot be verified, it is not considered science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. For example, a philosophical statement like "The meaning of life is 'be excellent to each other'" is not science because it cannot be verified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

A simple example of verification is observing a white swan; if multiple people can replicate the observation, the statement "this swan is white" can be considered a meaningful scientific statement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. Flat Earthers sometimes allude to this idea, suggesting that since an individual hasn't "been up there in your Jetsons car" to verify the Earth's shape with their own eyes, it's not verified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.

However, verificationism faced a significant problem with *universal statements*, such as "All swans are white" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. Even if thousands of swans observed are white, one can never truly verify such a universal statement, as demonstrated by the European discovery of black swans in Australia in the 1690s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. If applied strictly, this approach would be severely limiting for scientific inquiry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

## Falsificationism

To address the crisis of verificationism, philosopher Karl Popper proposed **falsificationism** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. For Popper, good science does not focus on *verifying* a hypothesis, but rather on trying "REALLY hard to prove it wrong" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. If a hypothesis cannot be proven wrong, confidence in it increases, but it remains open to future falsification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. If a statement cannot theoretically be falsified, it is not considered science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.

Under falsificationism, if one believes the Earth is flat, they should design experiments specifically to prove it *isn't* flat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. Proving the Earth is not flat does not, however, automatically prove it is round, nor does proving it is not round prove it is flat; it could be, for example, "a doughnut balanced on a giant turtle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

### Flat Earthers and Falsificationism

Flat Earthers claim to "test everything" and offer "contrary evidence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. However, their approach often misinterprets falsificationism in two key ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>:
1.  **Bad Evidence**: Their experiments often suffer from poor design and confounding variables. The Bedford Level Experiment, for instance, failed to account for atmospheric refraction, which bends light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. When Alfred Russel Wallace corrected for this, evidence supported a round Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.
2.  **Lack of Self-Falsification**: A crucial part of Popper's model is trying to prove one's *own* theory wrong, not just proving someone else's wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. Flat Earthers, even when their own experiments (like a laser gyroscope showing a 15° per hour drift or a flashlight experiment failing to align) produce results contradicting a flat Earth, they tend to tweak their model with unverified claims (e.g., "heavenly energies" messing with data) rather than abandoning their hypothesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. The problem with "woo-woo" theories is that proponents rarely define what evidence would cause them to renounce their theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.

## Paradigms and Scientific Progress (Thomas Kuhn)

A significant criticism of strict falsificationism is that hypotheses and tests don't exist in isolation; they are part of larger, systematized theories or "paradigms" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. Thomas Kuhn argued that science works within these paradigms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>.

Consider Isaac Newton's physics, which accurately predicted much about the solar system and terrestrial mechanics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. When Newton's model failed to accurately predict Mercury's orbit, scientists didn't immediately discard his entire theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. Instead, they "tweaked the model" (e.g., suggesting an undiscovered planet) for as long as possible because Newton's laws were so widely applicable and successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.

According to Kuhn, a paradigm isn't overturned until a "bigger badder paradigm" emerges that can explain everything the old one could, plus the anomalies it couldn't. This was the case with Albert Einstein's theory of relativity, which accounted for Mercury's orbit and much more, leading to a "paradigm shift" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. Scientific progress involves scientists debating and arguing over the [[philosophical_exploration_of_truth | truth]] until a new paradigm gains consensus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>.

Flat Earthers, while "tweaking" their model with concepts like "heavenly energies," do not operate as real scientists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. Their "tweaks" are not subjected to further experimentation or evidence. The Flat Earth model cannot provide the basis for practical applications like building long bridges, global positioning systems, or navigating airplanes, which are all predicated on a round Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>.

## The Problem of "Just Asking Questions" (JAQing Off)

A modern challenge to rational discourse, exemplified by Flat Earthers, is "Just Asking Questions" (JAQing off) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>. This involves dumping the burden of proof on others by raising numerous, easily asked questions that may take significant time and research to answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>.

For instance, the question "Why aren’t oil companies drilling in Antarctica?" takes moments to ask but requires explaining international treaties and logistical challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>. Similarly, questions about flight patterns often ignore how projecting a sphere onto a flat map distorts images, or simply commercial considerations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>.

In science, questions are meant to start conversations and build consensus to collectively figure things out, not to "win" a debate or draw doubt on established knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>. The appeal of such arguments lies in the surface-level appearance that unanswered questions imply being wrong or hiding something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>.

## Conclusion

Understanding how science operates, how scientific consensus is reached, and how to critically evaluate scientific claims (even identifying "bad science") is vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>. The phenomenon of Flat Earthers and other conspiracy theories often appeals to those who feel powerless, offering a sense that the world is rational and predictable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>.

This erosion of faith in expertise is not harmless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:36">[00:19:36]</a>. It enables conspiratorial thinking that can lead to dangerous outcomes, such as the resurgence of almost extinct diseases due to anti-vaccine sentiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>. It's not about blind faith in scientists, but about understanding the conventions and practices that lead to their conclusions, including experiment design, confidence levels, and how contrary evidence is addressed in complex fields like quantum physics or climate science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>.

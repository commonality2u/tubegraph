F. Scott Fitzgerald's "The Great Gatsby" features several recurring elements and ideas that function as motifs, reinforcing its central themes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Dreams vs. Reality

One significant motif in "The Great Gatsby" is the contrast between dreams and reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. Jay Gatsby harbors "big ass delusions about the future" with Daisy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. He believes "you can repeat the past" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>, but the narrative suggests that "nobody can recover past time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

Fitzgerald subtly embodies this motif through various details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. For instance, Gatsby owns a large collection of books, most of which he has never read <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. This detail suggests Gatsby is "frontin’ trying to look all intelligent," but it doesn't align with his true reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

## The Green Light

The [[symbolism_of_the_green_light_in_the_great_gatsby | symbol of the green light]] is a prominent motif, often interpreted as symbolizing "the fading optimism of Gatsby’s dream" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. Early in the book, the green light possesses a "burning quality that gets Gatsby all riled up about shackin up with his bitch" (Daisy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. However, by the end of the book, it transforms into "just another lame ass green light," losing its special significance, much like his "fake ass dreams" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

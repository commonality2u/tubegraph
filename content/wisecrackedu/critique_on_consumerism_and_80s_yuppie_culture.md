*American Psycho*, both the book by Bret Easton Ellis and the film adaptation, has been a significant source of controversy since its initial publication due to its explicit depictions of violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Much of the debate surrounding the film centers on its interpretation: is it a critique of 1980s yuppie culture's consumerism and superficiality, or does its excess inadvertently glorify this lifestyle? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a> This article focuses specifically on the film's portrayal and critique of consumerism and the yuppie phenomenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## Setting the Scene: 1980s Yuppie Culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>

The film *American Psycho* is set in 1988, a period characterized as the "heyday of the rich yuppie Wall Streeter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. Patrick Bateman, the film's protagonist, embodies this stereotype as a handsome, wealthy businessman more preoccupied with dining at the trendiest restaurants than with actual work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. His life is defined by artifice; beneath a facade of a beautiful fiancée and a close-knit group of friends lies a deep hatred for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. The film uses satire to expose the shallow consumer lifestyle of the 1980s, reveling in its extravagance, from elaborate dinners to Bateman's meticulous, over-indulgent morning routine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

Patrick Bateman's obsession with his status among wealthy Wall Streeters is evident in his quest for a reservation at Dorsia, the "hippest restaurant of the moment," and his detailed grooming habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. The recurring mention of the Trump name, particularly Ivana Trump, is not coincidental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. In the 1980s, Donald Trump symbolized excess, representing the ultimate yuppie: a billionaire tycoon with an extravagant lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. His 1985 apartment, described as shimmering with liquid gold, mirrored Bateman's focus on material minutiae that defined elite status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

## Conspicuous Consumption and Social Status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>

*American Psycho* presents class as a competition, a "sport" that reflects Thorstein Veblen's theories on the "leisure class," particularly "conspicuous consumption" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. Veblen defined conspicuous consumption as the use of goods to demonstrate financial strength and gain repute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. In this context, individuals must exhibit their superiority through possessions like larger houses, fancier clothes, or shinier jewelry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.

Patrick Bateman constantly defines himself in relation to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. He despises Paul Allen for his ability to secure reservations at more exclusive restaurants and for having a "nicer" business card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. Conversely, he believes he surpasses his doppelganger, Marcus, due to a "slightly better haircut" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. Bateman flaunts his wealth and trivial knowledge, such as the meaning behind Genesis and Whitney Houston songs, to assert his superiority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

> "Everything in Patrick Bateman's life is commodified and rated, used as tokens of his perceived superiority to others" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

The film's portrayal of this lifestyle serves as a [[critique_of_consumer_capitalism_in_fight_club | critique of consumer capitalism]], highlighting how material objects are used to comment on the characters' superficiality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

## Superficiality and Disregard for Real-World Issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>

The characters in *American Psycho* are depicted as vapid and self-absorbed, prioritizing their appearance and others' perception of them over actual global conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. Dinner conversations are punctuated by brief mentions of world events, such as massacres in Sri Lanka <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. Patrick Bateman's feigned concern for issues like apartheid, the nuclear arms race, and world hunger is merely a tactic for "one-upsmanship" against his peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. His true feelings about these "worldly conflicts" are encapsulated by his dismissive "whatever" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

In this society, preoccupied with acquiring goods at all costs, individuals become interchangeable; "nobody cares much about any of the other people around them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. What truly matters are the suits, jewels, yachts, and exclusive restaurants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.

## Consumer Capitalism as a Bloodsport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>

*American Psycho* suggests that beneath Bateman's desire for luxury items lies a "literal bloodlust" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. His murderous inclinations are presented as the underlying truth hidden by his superficial lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. At the film's outset, Patrick claims to be an empty "shell of a person" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>:

> "There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman, some kind of abstraction, but there is no real me: only an entity, something illusory" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.

However, by the end of the film, after succumbing to murder, he states he is "in touch with humanity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. This suggests that acknowledging his "baser desire to kill," rather than just money, allows him to become "self-actualized" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. Ostensibly, the film signifies that the true nature of the consumer capitalist is a "cold-blooded serial killer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

## Controversy and Misinterpretation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>

Despite being a "savage critique on consumerism," *American Psycho* has faced a tendency for audiences to find Patrick Bateman's lifestyle seductive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. This attraction is evident in fashion lines, grooming replication guides, and tours of Bateman's apartment, showcasing a pervasive influence of the "Patrick Bateman lifestyle" in culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

Parody, by its nature, can offer competing interpretations, simultaneously legitimizing and subverting its subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. *American Psycho*, despite its subversive merits, revels in excess, portraying Patrick as handsome, successful with women, and possessing a beautiful apartment and a well-paying job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. The film often plays Bateman's monstrous acts as comedic or entirely cuts away from them, such as Paul Allen's murder being set to Huey Lewis and the News, or the aftermath of Christine's death being shown without the moment of impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. By indulging in Bateman's luxurious lifestyle at the expense of his violence, the film may undermine its own satirical depth, allowing audiences to identify more with the "glitz and glamour" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.

The film's director, Mary Harron, stated that *American Psycho* is a "great parody of masculinity" and an "attack and satire of sexism and of male ego" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. The film criticizes the "cavalier attitudes many men have for women," showcasing Patrick's belief that he owns women's bodies and can act as he pleases with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. The cynical truth presented is that Patrick "can and does get away with it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>.

Despite its satirical intent, the film's impact often seems to uphold the very "surface value lifestyle" it aims to critique, leading to Patrick Bateman being lauded as an "anti-establishment antihero" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. This metatextual aspect suggests that the film itself becomes subject to the same misinterpretations and dismissals it portrays within its narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. Just as Patrick confesses his crimes and is either misheard or dismissed as joking, the film itself is misinterpreted as misogynistic or pro-consumer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.

The issues *American Psycho* critiques—a status-obsessed society, sexism, and wealth inequality—remain relevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>. The film cynically and truthfully ridicules a society run amok, concluding with Patrick Bateman's sentiment: "this confession has meant nothing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>. This implies that the film's own critique, like Bateman's confession, might ultimately mean nothing in the face of pervasive societal issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>.

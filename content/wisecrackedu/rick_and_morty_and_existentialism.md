*Rick and Morty*, particularly in its third season premiere, *The Rickshank Redemption*, delves into profound [[philosophical_themes_in_rick_and_morty | philosophical themes]], including [[existentialism_and_nihilism_in_rick_and_morty | existentialism]] and [[philosophy_and_absurdism_in_rick_and_morty | Absurdism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. The show has a history of exploring [[existentialism_and_nihilism_in_rick_and_morty | existential themes]] through elements such as Rick's creations despairing over their existence, resentment towards creators, and Morty's unique life philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Absurdism in *Rick and Morty*

The show also explores [[philosophy_and_absurdism_in_rick_and_morty | Absurdism]], a concept related to [[existentialism_and_nihilism_in_rick_and_morty | existentialism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. According to French philosopher Albert Camus, humans are cursed with seeking meaning in a universe that remains silent, viewing existence as cruel and absurd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Camus uses the metaphor of a person pushing a boulder up a mountain for eternity to represent the human condition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

In this spirit, *Rick and Morty* portrays an [[philosophy_and_absurdism_in_rick_and_morty | absurd]], meaningless multi-verse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. Rick consistently trivializes everything, rejecting concepts like love or tradition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. His companionship with Morty is even alleged to be a means to hide his genius brain waves from the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:52]</a>. *The Rickshank Redemption* further emphasizes the arbitrary nature of social systems, mocks sentimentality, and highlights the overall pointlessness of existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:02:07]</a>.

### Doubling Down on the Absurd

While both [[philosophy_and_absurdism_in_rick_and_morty | Absurdism]] and [[existentialism_and_nihilism_in_rick_and_morty | existentialism]] suggest that we live in a meaningless world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:16]</a>, the transition from Season 2 to Season 3 firmly establishes *Rick and Morty* as an [[philosophy_and_absurdism_in_rick_and_morty | absurd]] work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:23]</a>. The show achieves this by offering the prospect of meaning or hope, only to brutally dismantle it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:32]</a>.

At the end of Season 2, Rick shows a moment of genuine emotion at Birdperson's wedding, which is immediately undercut by Tammy's revelation as a spy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:54]</a>. Crucially, this subversion of Rick's "normal" behavior comes from an external force, not his own cynicism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:03:00]</a>. Later, after hearing of his family's hardships due to the Galactic Federation, Rick seemingly sacrifices himself, implying he might be grappling with living a life of meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:30]</a>. This cliffhanger hinted at a potential shift towards creating meaning in a meaningless world, an idea championed by many [[existentialism_and_nihilism_in_rick_and_morty | existentialists]] but rejected by Camus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:49]</a>.

### Camus's Critique and *Rick and Morty*'s Adherence

Camus criticized authors like Fyodor Dostoevsky for proposing absurd worlds where characters understand life's frivolity, only to "chicken out" and retreat to the comfort of meaning, often through religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:11]</a>. For Camus, an [[philosophy_and_absurdism_in_rick_and_morty | absurd]] work "does not provide a reply" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:19]</a>. He argued that [[existentialism_and_nihilism_in_rick_and_morty | existentialists]] like Jean-Paul Sartre and Dostoevsky, while recognizing existence's absurdity, fail by resorting to hope or attempts to create meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:29]</a>, effectively "deifying what crushes them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:37]</a>.

While Season 2 suggested *Rick and Morty* might make a similar retreat into meaning and sentimentality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:44]</a>, *The Rickshank Redemption* proved otherwise, instead doubling down on the absurd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:51]</a>. Not only was Rick's imprisonment a ploy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:05:05]</a>, but the show responded to the prospect of a humanized Rick with a promise of a darker journey ahead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:07]</a>.

## Subverting Meaning

Much of the comedy in *The Rickshank Redemption* comes not from joking about life's meaninglessness, but from mocking the audience's *attempt* to draw meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:23]</a>.

*   **The Portal Gun Origin Story**: When Rick explores a fabricated memory of him creating the portal gun, it depicts Beth and Diane's brutal murder, transforming Rick into a tragic anti-hero seeking revenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:39]</a>. This baits the audience to empathize and find meaning in his madness, but it's revealed to be a complete ruse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:56]</a>.
*   **Saving Earth**: Rick saves Earth from the Brave New World-inspired Galactic Federation, which might seem like an act for a greater good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:13]</a>. However, Summer's comment suggests the new world order isn't much better, removing any sense of heroic meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:22]</a>.
*   **Caring for Family**: The idea that Rick cares about Morty and Summer is consistently played with. He rushes to rescue them from the Council of Ricks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:40]</a>, then exhibits casual disregard for Summer's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:48]</a>, only for it to be part of a strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:55]</a>. Ultimately, he reveals he only saved them so Beth wouldn't kick him out of the house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:07:00]</a>.

## The Philosophy of Szechuan Sauce

The ultimate symbol of this subversion is the Szechuan dipping sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:09]</a>. Rick explicitly states he is not motivated by family, justice, or love, but only by the forgotten Mulan McNugget sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:16]</a>. The show undermines any attempt to give Rick a sense of morality by suggesting his entire series arc will be a quest for a random promotional food item <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:24]</a>.

However, Rick's love of Szechuan sauce itself means nothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:42]</a>. The quest for it does not create meaning; rather, it reflects the [[philosophy_and_absurdism_in_rick_and_morty | absurdity]] of being driven by *anything* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:47]</a>. In a world devoid of meaning, dedicating oneself to an [[philosophy_and_absurdism_in_rick_and_morty | absurd]] quest for plum-flavored McNugget sauce is as valid as any other pursuit, highlighting that its "meaning" is derived purely from its meaninglessness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:08:00]</a>.

## Rick as an Absurd Hero

Camus defines an "Absurd hero" as a figure who understands and finds happiness in life's pointlessness, comprehending the cosmic indifference that surrounds them with "lucid indifference" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:18]</a>. This description strongly aligns with Rick Sanchez, a man whose knowledge of the vast multiverse, where all possibilities have occurred, defines his existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:31]</a>. He reduces basic morals to genetic programming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:39]</a> and, despite being able to accomplish anything, yearns only for Szechuan sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:44]</a>.

However, there is a key difference: Camus's [[philosophy_and_absurdism_in_rick_and_morty | absurd]] heroes find happiness, whereas Rick is clearly in great pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:52]</a>. This suggests Rick's actual arc might not be to become more caring, but to learn to enjoy the [[philosophy_and_absurdism_in_rick_and_morty | absurdity]] of it all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:06]</a>.

The ultimate joke *Rick and Morty* plays on its audience is the prospect of Rick finding meaning, such as the Szechuan sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:23]</a>. If one believed Rick's self-sacrifice indicated a belief in family, justice, or anything else, they were mistaken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:29]</a>.

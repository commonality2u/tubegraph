*Neon Genesis Evangelion* deeply incorporates Freudian terms, ideas, and [[freudian_analysis_of_themes_and_symbols | Freudian analysis]] into its narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>.

## Core Freudian Concepts

### Introjection
"Introjection" is a [[freudian_analysis_of_themes_and_symbols | Freudian term]] used in *Evangelion* to explain how individuals adopt characteristics of those around them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>. Episode nineteen of the series is titled "Introjection" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.

### The Oral Stage
Episode twenty is titled "Weaving a Story 2: Oral Stage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>. The Oral Stage in [[freudian_analysis_of_themes_and_symbols | Freudian psychology]] refers to a child's weaning from breastfeeding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>. Freud's theory suggests that weaning too soon can lead to sociopathic tendencies, while weaning too late can result in neurotic dependency on the mother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>.

In *Evangelion*, all Eva pilots are "motherless children" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>. Shinji's mother's soul is in Unit-01, and part of Asuka's mother's soul is in Unit-02 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. The Evas bond with their pilots through these infused souls, and the pilot's reaction to their mother's presence within the Eva reflects their general disposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>. This represents the pilots mourning the lost love object that is their mother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

### Mourning vs. Melancholia
Rei, as an artificial being, experiences melancholia rather than mourning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>. Freud posited that mourning occurs when the lost object is known, while melancholia is a more severe condition where the individual senses a profound sadness without knowing what is missing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>.

### Psychotherapy and Shinji
The final two episodes of the original series depict a psychotherapy session taking place inside Shinji's mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. This session addresses his reliance on the Eva for identity and value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>.

> "But if you depend only on the Eva, then the Eva will become your only identifier.” <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>
> “Eva will become your only value.” <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>
> “Without that value you —\hthe real you — will be erased from this existence.” <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>

### The Magi System and the Unconscious
The Magi supercomputer network that runs NERV incorporates the mind of Dr. Naoko Akagi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. It reflects Freud's tri-part model of the human unconscious:
*   The controlling scientist represents the **ego** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>.
*   The mother represents the punishing and guilt-inducing **superego** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>.
*   The woman represents the sexual **id** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>.

### Ambivalence
Episode eighteen is titled "Ambivalence," a [[freudian_analysis_of_themes_and_symbols | Freudian concept]] highlighting the human capacity to passionately love and hate at the same time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>. Shinji's relationship with his father, Gendo, exemplifies this, as he states, "However, I really hated my father," <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a> yet he repeatedly pilots the Eva to gain his father's praise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>. He also runs away from his responsibilities but consistently returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>.

> "I think I finally understood the good part about being praised by someone when I heard my father's words, today. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a> And, I also realized that the reason I pilot my eva is to hear those words from him." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>
> "I mustn't run away. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a> I mustn't not run away." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>

### Eros and Thanatos (Life Drive and Death Drive)
Freud's concepts of Eros (the life drive) and Thanatos (the death drive) are central to understanding motivations in *Evangelion* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>.

#### Pleasure Principle
Freud argued that beings are driven by the pleasure principle, an inclination to avoid pain and maximize pleasure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>. When Shinji laments, "This world is filled with too much pain and suffering to keep going on," after falling into a Dirac sea, he is expressing this desire to minimize suffering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>. This aligns with [[The Hedgehogs Dilemma and its role in Evangelion | Schopenhauer's ideas]] about will and struggle, questioning how one can avoid suffering when sharing a world with others whose desires may conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>.

#### The Death Drive
The death drive is a desire to return to a state of tranquility, peace, and harmony, akin to the womb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. This drive is manifested in *Evangelion* through the goal of "instrumentalization," where all human consciousness is combined into a primordial soup called LCL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>. This desire to join a unified whole and escape the issues of the individual self is a manifestation of the death drive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>.

Episode 25 directly addresses this with the text: “the case of Shinji Ikari, the boy who wished for death of his own will" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>. Gendo describes instrumentality as:

> "It is merely a return to the state of beginning. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a> It is no less than a return to the primal womb that we lost so long ago. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a> Souls and minds will become one, attaining eternal balance.” <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>

Both Seele and NERV are depicted as working towards the death drive, with Shinji intended to be the vessel for humanity's return to a world free from loneliness and isolation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>. This ties into the concept of Tikkun ha-Olam, the restoration of the world through reunification with the primordial being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>.

### Lack (Lacanian Influence)
The overarching themes of [[philosophy_of_neon_genesis_evangelion | *Evangelion*]], including the theological, psychological, and philosophical, deal with "lack" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:52">[00:19:52]</a>. As explored by Freud-inspired psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan, "lack" is the missing center at the heart of existence, the void between representation and the world itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:19:59]</a>. This is manifested in the show through scarcities of friends, failing relationships, and emotional distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:12">[00:20:12]</a>.

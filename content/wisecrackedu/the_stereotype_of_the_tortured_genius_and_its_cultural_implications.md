The stereotype of the tortured genius is deeply ingrained in popular culture, often making it seem as though suffering and brilliance are prerequisites for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>. This idea suggests a "brilliance-madness link" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>.

In *Rick and Morty*, Rick Sanchez, despite being the smartest man in the universe, is depicted as profoundly miserable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>. He exhibits self-loathing and self-destructive behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>, including a notable suicide attempt in Season 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. His catchphrase, "wubblubbdubdub," translates to "I am in great pain, please help me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>.

Contrastingly, Jerry, who is less intelligent and often "discombobulated," does not suffer to the same degree as Rick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>. He doesn't question his place in the universe or turn to alcohol like Rick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>. This dynamic poses the question: Is it better to be unhappy with knowledge, as Fyodor Dostoevsky suggested, or to be happy in a "fool's paradise"? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>

### The Psychological Link Between Intelligence and Misery

While the stereotype of the tortured genius might be "overblown Hollywood BS," some research suggests a connection between high intelligence and mental health struggles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.

*   **Mensa Study (Dr. Ruth Karpinski, 2017)**: A study of 3,700 Mensa members found that over a third reported being depressed, which is five times the national average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>. However, caveats include self-reporting and potential lack of representativeness for all intelligent individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>.
*   **"Hyper Brains" Theory**: Dr. Karpinski asserted that individuals with IQs of 130-plus possess "hyper brains," enabling them to comprehend the world's problems and uncertainties more easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>.
*   **Overexcitability (Dr. Kazimierz Dabrowski)**: Psychiatrist Dr. Kazimierz Dabrowski observed that exceptionally smart patients tended to overly contemplate everything, especially negative aspects, and experienced deeper depression compared to average individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:00">[04:33:00]</a>. He termed these traits "overexcitability," which he considered predictive of achieving one's ideal self <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.
    *   **Five Forms of Overexcitability**:
        1.  Excessive energy or nervousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:00">[05:14:00]</a>.
        2.  Deep appreciation for art or music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>.
        3.  Extreme curiosity or an active mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19:00">[05:19:00]</a>.
        4.  Vivid imagination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>.
        5.  Extreme and complex emotional experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>.
    *   Rick exemplifies all these traits, from slaying aliens at 70 to his complex feelings for his family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>.

### [[existential_depression_among_highly_intelligent_individuals | Existential Depression]]

Some psychologists suggest that people with "hyper brains" are more prone to [[existential_depression_among_highly_intelligent_individuals | existential depression]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>. This condition involves feelings of hopelessness stemming from the belief that life is ultimately meaningless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:00]</a>. While it can affect anyone after a crisis, Dr. James Webb notes it's more likely to occur spontaneously in individuals with above-average intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:00">[06:08:00]</a>. Rick's worldview, where "nothing matters," strongly reflects this perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:00">[06:28:00]</a>.

### Social Isolation and Eccentricity

Highly intelligent individuals, like Rick, are often characterized by eccentricity and intensity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29:00">[08:29:00]</a>. This can lead to social isolation, as their unique traits might "freak out" less eccentric people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:46:00">[08:46:00]</a>. Trying to conform to "normies" can result in a "crisis of self," making them feel lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52:00">[08:52:00]</a>. Rick's perpetual "crisis of self" is evident in his struggles to compromise his nature for his family, even in therapy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03:00">[09:03:00]</a>.

### Intelligence, Wealth, and Happiness

Despite potential links to depression, other studies suggest that intelligence can lead to better health and happiness through greater wealth and opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:36:00">[07:36:00]</a>. Being smarter is associated with higher-paying jobs, which can alleviate the stresses of poverty and allow for better healthcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>. Some research, such as a UK study of over 6,800 people, found a positive correlation between IQ and self-reported happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:00">[08:21:00]</a>.

### Conclusion

Ultimately, psychology doesn't provide a definitive answer to whether it's better to be a "Rick" or a "Jerry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:58:00">[10:58:00]</a>. While a "Jerry" might be less prone to [[existential_depression_among_highly_intelligent_individuals | existential depression]], a "Rick" is more likely to live a better life overall due to the practical benefits of intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:06:00">[11:06:00]</a>.

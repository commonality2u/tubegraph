*Lord of the Flies* by William Golding is presented as an [[allegory_of_class_struggle_and_modern_society | allegorical effort]] to trace the origin of societal issues back to [[human_nature_and_belief_systems | human nature]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. The narrative highlights humanity's capacity for evil and suggests that man-made moral systems are superficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

## Plot Summary

The story begins with a G5 plane carrying British boys crashing on a remote Pacific island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Among the survivors are Ralph, Piggy, Jack, and Simon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. Ralph is appointed leader, and Jack becomes the head hunter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Initially, Jack hesitates to kill, but soon he hunts a pig <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

The younger boys become scared, believing they saw a monster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. Jack later claims to have seen the beast and challenges Ralph's leadership, forming his own group focused on hunting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. Jack's group impales a pig's head on a stick as an offering to the beast, which is referred to as "The Lord of the Flies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Simon has a vision where this pig head speaks to him, revealing that the "beast" is not something external but the violence inherent in the boys' hearts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

Upon returning to camp to share this revelation, Simon is mistaken for the beast and killed by the other boys, including Ralph and Piggy, in a frenzied attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. Jack's group later steals Piggy's glasses, the only means to make fire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. Ralph confronts Jack, leading to a brawl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. During the conflict, Piggy is thrown off a cliff, and the conch shell (a symbol of order and communication) shatters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. Ralph flees but is eventually rescued by a Naval officer who is in the midst of a war himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. The boys are taken back to civilization, but their innocence is gone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

## Allegorical Elements

### The Superficiality of Civilization

The arrival of the Naval officer at the end of the novel highlights a "wackest irony" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. Although adult life may appear righteous, the soldier is himself engaged in a war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. This suggests that there is no one to save "civilized humanity" from its own violent nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. The boys' loss of innocence on the island mirrors the broader human condition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

### The Lord of the Flies: The Id and Evil

The pig's head on a stick, known as "The Lord of the Flies," is a central symbol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. This name is an alternate for Beelzebub, the prince of demons, also known as the Devil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. It represents the destruction, decay, and demoralization of mankind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.

From a Freudian perspective, "The Lord of the Flies" can be seen as representing "the id" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. The id functions solely to ensure survival, rendering laws, moral codes, and even intelligence meaningless when it is in control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

### Motifs of Falling

Throughout the book, recurring patterns of "falling" emphasize the "fall of human kind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. Examples include:
*   Piggy falling off the cliff, with the conch shattering alongside him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.
*   The falling parachutist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
*   Ralph falling at the Navy man's feet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

### The Fall of Reason

The loss of Piggy's sight, symbolized by Jack stealing Piggy's glasses to make fire, signifies the fall of reason <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. This act directly indicates a transition from the "reign of reason" to the "reign of savagery" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

*American Psycho*, both the book by Bret Easton Ellis and the film adaptation, has always been a lightning rod for [[controversy_surrounding_american_psycho | controversy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Much of this [[controversy_surrounding_american_psycho | controversy]] stems from its perception: is it a critique on the consumerism and superficiality of 80s yuppie culture, or does its excess glorify this lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>?

## Satire of 1980s Consumerism

*American Psycho* is set in 1988, during the height of the affluent Wall Street yuppie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. The film explicitly satirizes the shallow consumer lifestyle prevalent in the 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. It revels in showing the excess, from extravagant dinners featuring items like grilled free-range rabbit to Patrick Bateman's indulgent morning routine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

Patrick Bateman's life is a facade; on the surface, he has a beautiful fiancée and a close-knit group of friends, but he secretly despises them all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. He is portrayed as a wealthy businessman who is more preoccupied with dining at the trendiest restaurants than with his actual work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

### Status and Materialism
Bateman's obsession revolves around maintaining his status among wealthy Wall Streeters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. This includes:
*   His ability to secure reservations at exclusive restaurants like Dorsia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.
*   His meticulous grooming and skincare routine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.
*   His focus on the minutia that defines his elite status, such as his bedsheets and, notably, his business cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. Christian Bale's performance as Bateman highlights the absurdity of this preoccupation with trivial details, making something like a business card's font seem like the end of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

The film repeatedly uses the Trump name, particularly Ivana Trump, as a symbol of the 1980s' excess, with Donald Trump himself embodying the "ultimate yuppie" as a billionaire Wall Street tycoon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

### Commodification of Life
"Everything in Patrick Bateman's life is commodified and rated, used as tokens of his perceived superiority to others" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. *American Psycho* uses material objects to comment on the superficiality of its characters, who are vapid and self-absorbed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. They are more concerned with their appearance and how others perceive them than with actual conflicts happening in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

Dinner conversations are punctuated by mentions of global issues like the massacres in Sri Lanka, which Bateman uses as a form of one-upsmanship rather than genuine concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. His true feelings about worldly conflicts are revealed when he dismisses the Iran-Contra scandal with a simple "Whatever" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

### Conspicuous Consumption
In *American Psycho*, social class is presented as a competition or a sport, reflecting Thorstein Veblen's theories on [[conspicuous_consumption | conspicuous consumption]] within the leisure class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. Veblen defined [[conspicuous_consumption | conspicuous consumption]] as the act of consuming goods to demonstrate one's financial strength and achieve reputability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. To prove superiority, one must display it through a larger house, fancier clothes, or shinier jewelry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.

Patrick Bateman constantly defines himself in relation to others, hating Paul Allen for having access to fancier restaurants and a nicer business card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. He flaunts his wealth and trivial knowledge, such as his expertise on Genesis and Whitney Houston, to assert his superiority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

The film suggests that beneath Bateman's desire for luxury items lies a "literal bloodlust," portraying consumer capitalism as a "blood sport" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. Bateman's murderous inclinations are the hidden truth beneath his superficial lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. At the film's beginning, he describes himself as a hollow "shell of a person" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. By the end, after succumbing to his murderous desires, he feels "self actualized," albeit as a serial killer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. Ostensibly, *American Psycho* suggests that the true nature of the consumer capitalist is that of a cold-blooded serial killer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

## Undermining its Own Critique?

Despite being a savage critique on consumerism, *American Psycho* often leaves viewers infatuated with the very lifestyle it satirizes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. There's an undeniable allure to Patrick Bateman's lifestyle, evidenced by real-world instances of clothing lines, grooming guides, and apartment tours inspired by the film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.

Parody, by its nature, can offer competing interpretations, simultaneously legitimizing and subverting its subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. While subversive, *American Psycho* does revel in excess, presenting Bateman as handsome, successful with women, having a beautiful apartment, and a well-paying job—elements that many would desire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.

The film frequently plays Bateman's monstrous acts for comedy or cuts away from them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. For example, Paul Allen's murder is set to Huey Lewis and the News, and Christine's death only shows the aftermath without the moment of impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. This approach allows the audience to identify more with the "glitz and glamour" while letting Bateman "off the hook" for his gruesome deeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>. This raises the question of whether the film undermines its own satirical depth by indulging in Bateman's lifestyle at the expense of his violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.

### A Cynical Conclusion
*American Psycho* presents a cold, cynical truth: Patrick Bateman gets away with his monstrous acts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>. The film's impact often seems to uphold the surface-value lifestyle it seeks to critique, potentially making it a "failure" despite its deep intentions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>.

In a metatextual turn, this outcome may be precisely the film's point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. Just as Bateman confesses his crimes and is either misheard or dismissed as joking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>, *American Psycho* the film is often misinterpreted as pro-consumer or treated as a joke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. The issues it rails against—status-obsessed society, sexism, and wealth inequality—remain relevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>. As Patrick Bateman cynically states at the film's end, "This confession has meant nothing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>. *American Psycho* ridicules a society run amok, but knows "deep down that this confession too will mean nothing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>.

From: [[wisecrackedu]] <br/> 

*Deadpool* gained unprecedented mainstream popularity, becoming the highest-grossing R-rated movie ever and the biggest opening for Ryan Reynolds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This [[deadpools_success_and_popularity | success]] is notable because it shirks the traditional superhero formula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Unlike typical superheroes, Deadpool does not fight for the greater good, is not selfless, and is not family-friendly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. As a Marvel character who is an overt ripoff of a DC competitor, Deadpool constantly makes fun of the medium he inhabits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Achieving "Fuck It": Deadpool as a Postmodern Work

Deadpool distinguishes himself within the Marvel universe through several defining features: he is an inveterate wiseass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>, he knows he is a superhero, and he constantly breaks the fourth wall to comment on comic book tropes and culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Deadpool takes nothing seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>, extending this attitude to the film's ad campaign, which trolled partners with Valentine's Day ads and even created a Tinder profile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

The film is best described as a [[postmodernism_in_comedy | postmodern]] work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a> "[[postmodernism_in_comedy | Postmodernism]] is a movement in the arts and philosophy that typically rejects the kind of grand narratives used to make sense of the world in the good old days."

These grand narratives include concepts like the battle of good against evil, democracy versus communism, or the inherent promise of technological progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. [[postmodernism_in_comedy | Postmodern]] works often reject tradition, embracing "meta" elements and self-reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

Deadpool exemplifies these traits by being hyper-aware of himself and his place in the superhero genre <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. The film is replete with Ryan Reynolds jokes, referencing his role in *The Green Lantern* and his "Sexiest Man Alive" status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. While the grand narrative of superhero films is often the triumph of good over evil, Deadpool, in a [[postmodernism_in_comedy | postmodern]] fashion, rejects this, focusing instead on personal revenge and love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

This tension between old world narratives and [[postmodernism_in_comedy | postmodernism]] is explored throughout the film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>:
*   **Colossus:** Constantly tries to rope Deadpool into the role of a good, family-friendly superhero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
*   **Dopinder subplot:** Subverts classic narratives of courtly love by having him kidnap his beloved's current lover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
*   **Blind Al:** A deranged version of the benevolent blind benefactor trope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
*   **Vanessa:** The hero's love interest is a prostitute turned stripper, not a "fair maiden" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

## Don Quixote: A Proto-Postmodern Predecessor

Deadpool can be seen as a spiritual successor to *Don Quixote*, a 400-year-old novel that also satirized the heroes of its era and employed meta-narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. *Don Quixote* is considered by some a proto-[[postmodernism_in_comedy | postmodern]] work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. The story itself is a meta-narrative, with a fictional author discovering fictional accounts of Don Quixote, and Don Quixote understanding he is being written about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. The fictional author constantly breaks the fourth wall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

*Don Quixote* was written during a period when radical skepticism of the existing order began to emerge in society, just before the Enlightenment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. While the Enlightenment responded with rationality and science, *Don Quixote* aimed to simply poke fun at Spanish society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. Deadpool signals a similar disenchantment with "old righteous narratives" in contemporary society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

## Ironic Distance and Cynicism in Modern Media

Joss Whedon critiques modern culture's excessive self-awareness, using an example from *Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom* where a self-referential joke about a previous film falls flat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. Whedon believes this "self-reference for the sake of self-reference" has engulfed modern film, television, and literature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

This self-awareness often takes a cynical tone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. Examples include:
*   The *Tarzan* trailer, where Jane overtly references her tired role as a damsel in distress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. The film acknowledges its recycled tropes but apologizes for them instead of creating something new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.
*   *Star Trek Into Darkness*, which features an inverse of a famous cinematic scene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.
*   *22 Jump Street*, which has the same plot as its predecessor, excused by characters calling out the repetition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.

Hollywood acknowledges its lazy clichés with a "wink and a nod" or employs irony to undercut dramatic moments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. Deadpool employs both of these tactics, breaking the fourth wall and avoiding serious drama <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. This approach uses familiar structures and tropes but distances the audience from sincerity to make it feel new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

Deadpool's humor is largely driven by cynicism and ironic distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. He remains unphased in high-stakes situations, and even combat scenes are undercut by self-aware humor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. Deadpool is immune to criticism because his identity is defined by cynicism; he deconstructs any trope that would give meaning to film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. His quest is shallow—to become "hot again" and reclaim his lost love/lust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. He has no moral scruples or values to defend, purely reactionary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

The film openly points out its flaws, such as overuse of superhero tropes and budgetary constraints, by labeling Negasonic Teenage Warhead as the "Walmart bargain bin DVD" equivalent of a Marvel character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. While this self-reflective commentary is enjoyable and charming, the film essentially functions like an "Honest Trailer" for other comic book movies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

A danger of this trend is that it never creates anything new, devolving into an "endless spiral of meta" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. Deadpool, in this regard, is similar to hipsters, who ironically love clichés, endlessly recycle culture, and position themselves against the mainstream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. Douglas Haddow notes that the danger of the hipster is "a culture lost in the superficiality of its past and unable to create any new meaning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. Deadpool does not reinvent the superhero genre; it merely exists to make fun of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.

The "bashing the system" approach, while entertaining, is ultimately powerless and does not change the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. As Slavoj Zizek notes, "cynical distance, laughter, irony, are, so to speak, part of the game. The ruling ideology is not meant to be taken seriously or literally" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. Like hipsters who adopt ironic countercultural symbols, *Deadpool* fancies itself countercultural by celebrating its own played-out clichés and overused storyline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

This cultural impasse reflects a society unsure of what to do with itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. Deadpool's "Fuck it" attitude stems from his immunity to death and consequences, making life seem limitless and not sacred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. The comic book's own "fuck it" attitude originated from the creators believing it would be cancelled at any minute, leading them to write as if nothing mattered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.

Whether *Deadpool* simply puts a shiny makeover on old tropes, or if it achieves something truly new, remains a subject of debate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.

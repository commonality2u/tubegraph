[[Character arcs of Thor Iron Man and Captain America in Avengers Endgame | Captain America]], one of Marvel's central trinity alongside Thor and Iron Man, embodies a unique approach to character development, where his core remains steadfast despite the changing world around him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

## An Unchanging Moral Compass

Unlike characters who undergo significant internal transformations, [[Character arcs of Thor Iron Man and Captain America in Avengers Endgame | Captain America]] exhibits virtually no character arc, with his inner life and outer appearance remaining consistent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. This unwavering nature, though sometimes perceived as predictable by audiences and even by Steve himself, is a defining characteristic that contributes to his enduring appeal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

His moral integrity is rooted in a simple yet profound desire: to stand up to bullies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. This principle guides his actions, whether confronting Project Insight's surveillance and executions or opposing the Sokovia Accords which he viewed as restricting the Avengers' ability to help those in need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. This inner strength persists throughout all films, as he continually gets up and stands alone against overwhelming odds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. His iconic line, "I could do this all day," first seen in *Captain America: The First Avenger* and later referenced in *Captain America: Civil War* and *Avengers: Endgame*, symbolizes his inexhaustible resolve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>.

Steve Rogers' personal philosophy is equally unbending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. As famously quoted by Agent Sharon Carter in *Captain America: Civil War*, his duty is "to plant yourself like a tree, look them in the eye and say 'No, you move'" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. This steadfast commitment to moral duties is exemplified in *Avengers: Infinity War*, where he refuses to sacrifice Vision, stating, "We don't trade lives," despite the compelling utilitarian calculus to save trillions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.

## History as Unchanging

[[Character arcs of Thor Iron Man and Captain America in Avengers Endgame | Captain America]] represents a belief that certain moral truths are eternal, enduring regardless of time or circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. This perspective aligns with philosophical views found in texts like Ecclesiastes, which suggests, "what has been is what will be, and what has been done is what will be done, and there is nothing new under the sun" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.

Both Steve Rogers and the author of Ecclesiastes would agree that a fixed moral law and unchanging human nature persist through the ages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. Consequently, the problems faced by humanity remain the same, whether it's Thanos, Hitler, or a Pharaoh â€“ all are manifestations of the same unchanging human nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. Conversely, this unchanging nature is also responsible for the courage displayed by individuals who defend their homes, from the plains of Wakanda to the beaches of Normandy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>.

Despite being a "man out of time," [[Character arcs of Thor Iron Man and Captain America in Avengers Endgame | Captain America]] remains perpetually relevant because he is a steadfast response to a world that continuously faces the same perennial problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. His unchanging stance is emphasized in the comics, particularly in Hickman's *Avengers* run, where even at the very end of time, he maintains his moral convictions, stating, "Well, it's too bad I've never really gotten over the past" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>.

While his moral integrity remains consistent, *Avengers: Endgame* does offer a subtle evolution, as Steve finally accepts his duty as a soldier and allows himself to pursue a personal life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>. However, this is presented as a deliberate exception to his otherwise consistent character arc, highlighting the power of his established pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>.

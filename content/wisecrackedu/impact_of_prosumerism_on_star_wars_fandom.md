The modern era has seen a significant shift in the relationship between media producers and consumers, giving rise to the concept of "prosumerism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. This term, coined in the 1980s by futurists Alvin and Heidi Toffler, describes the merging roles of producers and consumers in the age of modern technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>. This phenomenon has had a profound [[star_wars_fan_backlash_and_criticism | impact]] on the *Star Wars* fandom, contributing to the current [[philosophical_insights_into_the_star_wars_legitimation_crisis | legitimation crisis]] within the franchise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## The Rise of the Prosumer
In the contemporary media landscape, individuals are not merely passive consumers; they actively produce and disseminate content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. This differs from historical shifts, like the advent of the printing press, which enabled literacy and took interpretive power from a select few <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. Today, the age of the prosumer empowers many to criticize the "anointed successors" of creators like George Lucas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.

## Star Wars Fans as Prosumers
*Star Wars* fans are identified as "prosumers extraordinaire" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a> due to their active participation in shaping the universe's meaning. This involvement manifests in various ways:
*   Sharing YouTube videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>
*   Posting video essays or fan theories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>
*   Subscribing to communities like /r/empiredidnothingwrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>
*   Retweeting influential fan accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>

Every fan theory—whether about Luke Skywalker's whereabouts, the identity of Snoke, or lightsaber fighting styles—contributes to the *Star Wars* universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. This active engagement is a way for the community to "practice" *Star Wars* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>, forming a shared understanding and community identity (a "lifeworld" in philosophical terms) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

## Impact on Franchise Management
When [[Disneys_acquisition_and_changes_to_star_wars_canon | Disney acquired Lucasfilm]] in 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>, it marked a "regime change" from George Lucas to a new corporate authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. Without Lucas's original legitimacy, fans began to question the changes made to the *Star Wars* system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. The [[disneys_acquisition_and_changes_to_star_wars_canon | decision to decanonize]] numerous spin-off works, including radio dramas, video games, comics, and novels, further inflamed this tension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. Fans felt their identities, which were wrapped up in this expansive canon, were being disregarded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

The [[fan_reaction_to_the_last_jedi | fan backlash to The Last Jedi]] was a significant manifestation of this prosumer power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. Director [[rian_johnsons_approach_to_revolutionizing_star_wars | Rian Johnson's overt subversion]] of the canon, or "killing the past," which included revealing Rey's parents as "nobodies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>, Snoke's unceremonious death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>, and a controversial portrayal of Luke Skywalker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>, was widely criticized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. This felt like a betrayal of the shared values and meanings of the *Star Wars* system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

Similar to how Martin Luther challenged the Catholic Church's authority with his 95 Theses in the 1500s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>, the current era sees "a million angry YouTubers and vloggers" posting their own critiques of Disney *Star Wars* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. This phenomenon has extended beyond *Star Wars*, with filmmakers like James Mangold, director of *Logan*, expressing concern that creative control over major franchises is becoming akin to writing a new religious text, risking backlash from prosumer fans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.

## Future Implications
While the *Star Wars* system faces a significant crisis, it doesn't necessarily mean collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. Systems can learn and adjust, as seen with the Catholic Church adapting after its own legitimation crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. The future of *Star Wars* depends on whether Disney can evolve to respect its fans and the universe they've helped create, and whether fans can grow with the system, finding new ways to interact with the material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. The alternative is a potential split, where Disney and fans diverge, creating their own distinct versions of the *Star Wars* "religion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.

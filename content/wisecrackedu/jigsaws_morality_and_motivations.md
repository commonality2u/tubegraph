Since 2004, the *Saw* franchise has been known for its "torture-porny" aesthetic, locking up morally dubious characters in gruesome steel contraptions and inventing creative places to hide keys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. The series' creepy puppet-master, Jigsaw, loves playing deadly games, forcing unconscious people to choose between certain death, self-mutilation, or disemboweling a stranger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. While many focus on Jigsaw's impressive body count <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>, the traps also conceal the grander meaning of his games, which lies in the [[philosophical_themes_in_the_saw_franchise | philosophy of Saw]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## Jigsaw's Core Motivation: Repentance and Rebirth

The core of Jigsaw's philosophy is that his torturous games offer victims an opportunity to repent for their sins and transform into better human beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. He believes that if they survive his tests—which they rarely do—they will emerge with a newfound appreciation for life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. This perspective aligns with a kind of extremist Christian morality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## The Origin Story of John Kramer

Before becoming Jigsaw, John Kramer was a civil engineer happily married to Jill, who owned a drug rehab clinic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. Their lives took a tragic turn when one of Jill's patients, Cecil Adams, robbed her clinic, accidentally injuring Jill and causing her to suffer a miscarriage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. John fell into a deep depression, which worsened when he was diagnosed with a brain tumor and terminal cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. After a particularly difficult year, John attempted suicide by driving off a cliff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. Miraculously, he survived, and this near-death experience led him to his new calling: dispensing morality through torture devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

## Philosophical Influences on Jigsaw

As John Kramer developed his new moral code, he drew inspiration from two key philosophical traditions:

### Early Christian Philosophy: Suffering as a Consequence of Sin

Jigsaw's view on suffering shares similarities with early Christian philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. Early Christian theologians rationalized suffering by attributing it to "no-good, lousy humans" rather than an all-good God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. They theorized that Adam's Original Sin separated humans from God, necessitating suffering and repentance for reunification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. Suffering, in this view, is a result of our own sins and an expression of pain over our separation from God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

Similarly, Jigsaw believes his victims deserve the suffering they endure in his traps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. He explicitly reminds each victim of the sins they've committed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. Jigsaw sees his victims as enslaved by their past immorality, much like theologians believed humanity was trapped by Adam and Eve's original sin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. The *Saw* series even features its own "Adams": Cecil Adams, whose actions led to Jill's miscarriage and John's transformation into Jigsaw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>, and Adam Stanheight, a photographer who spies on people, mirroring Adam's desire to eat from the Tree of Knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

### [[kierkegaards_influence_on_jigsaws_philosophy | Kierkegaard's Influence on Jigsaw's Philosophy]]: Suffering as Personal Growth

John Kramer also shares common ground with Christian theorist and father of Existentialism, Soren Kierkegaard, who viewed suffering as crucial for personal and spiritual growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. Both Kramer and Kierkegaard believed that suffering purifies the sufferer, teaches appreciation for life, and forces individuals to take responsibility for their actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

Kierkegaard proposed three distinct phases for an individual to become their "true self" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>:
1.  **The Aesthetic**: Driven by sensual pleasures and lacking morality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.
2.  **The Ethical**: Driven by morality and belief in individual responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
3.  **The Religious**: Driven by faith in God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

According to Kierkegaard, suffering is key to moving up to the next stage of human development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. While Kierkegaard focused on spiritual and existential suffering, Jigsaw's machines can be understood as tests for his victims, who are typically "aesthetes" driven by desires for sex, drugs, or money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. His tests present an ethical quandary, forcing them to make painful decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

Suffering, Kierkegaard argued, compels individuals to reflect on their situation, leading to "the first doubt" ("Why is this happening to me?") and an immediate desire to change circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. This opens a person up to "ethical self-understanding," as suffering "turns the single individual over to himself completely" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. At its most successful, this suffering can force repentance, responsibility, and a choice for survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

## Rebirth and Transformation

Both Kierkegaard and Kramer believe that as one progresses through development, a "false self" dies to make room for a "better, truer self" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. John Kramer himself interprets his car crash survival as a rebirth: "A different person crawled out through the wreckage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. Jigsaw demands this transformation from his followers, like Amanda, when she agrees to live by his ethical code, implying a complete death of her old self <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. Fans refer to this scene as "Amanda's baptism," fitting with the Christian tradition of spiritual cleansing and rebirth through suffering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. Jigsaw frequently references this concept of rebirth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>, even losing his "kidnapping virginity" during a Chinese New Year celebration, a literal celebration of rebirth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.

## Personal Responsibility and Choice

A central tenet shared by Kierkegaard and Jigsaw is the value of personal responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. Kierkegaard stated that becoming a "real man" involves becoming a "responsible individual before God" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. Kramer demands the same from his victims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. The key to taking responsibility, for both, is making a choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. Kramer spurs his victims into life-affirming action and is adamant that they "choose" their actions, ending each game with the refrain: "The decisions are up to them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. He maintains that the individual is responsible for the outcome within the confines of his game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

## [[Flaws in Jigsaws Moral Code and Legacy | Flaws in Jigsaw's Moral Code and Legacy]]

Despite his grand philosophical claims, Jigsaw is presented as a "seriously failed" God-like figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. His attempt to establish a moral order does not bring about the meaningful change he professes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.

Many victims fail his tests, crumbling under pressure or pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. Those who do pass are frequently traumatized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. A major indicator of Jigsaw's failure is his ill-fated quest for the right apprentice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>. Each of his contenders twists his philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. While Jigsaw's games are designed to be winnable if the rules are followed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>, his mentees create rigged, unwinnable death traps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. His disciples use the games for revenge, and they ultimately end up trapping and killing one another out of jealousy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. To them, the point is punishment, not renewal, eroding Jigsaw's legacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.

The films themselves highlight the [[moral_ambiguity_in_storytelling | flawed moral code]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. Jigsaw is the villain, and his morality lessons often sacrifice innocent lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>. His own death, where he offers a victim the chance to forgive him, results in his violent killing by that same victim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. Even Kramer's death is a result of one of his tests' ultimate failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.

Ultimately, the *Saw* series serves as a critique of this extreme version of traditional Christian morality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>, questioning whether "no pain, no gain" truly leads to self-improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>.

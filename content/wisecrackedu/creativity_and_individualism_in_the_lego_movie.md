*The Lego Movie*, based on the tiny choking hazards humans used to train child architects, is presented as a children's film and a brand advertisement, yet it functions as a [[the_satirical_elements_of_the_lego_movie | satirical jab]] at modern societal norms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. At its core, the film celebrates creativity and individualism in contrast to conformity and uniformity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

## Emmet's Conformist Existence

The protagonist, Emmet Brickowski, is a construction worker who is initially unpopular despite his charismatic voice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. He lives in a society as rigid as the Lego blocks themselves, where his individual will is stifled by instructions and a "terrifyingly catchy song" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. This societal structure is largely controlled by President Business, who symbolizes the [[the_role_of_corporate_and_political_power_in_the_lego_movie | intertwining of corporate and political power]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. President Business aims to maintain the status quo by gluing everyone in place with a weapon called the Kragle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. Citizens are subdued into complacency through means such as the allure of "Taco Tuesday" and the mind-numbing television show "Where Are My Pants" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

## The Journey to Becoming "The Special"

Emmet's journey begins when a "doohickey" called the Piece of Resistance gets stuck to his back, leading others to believe he is "the Special" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. He is introduced to the Master Builders, individuals who do not need instruction manuals to create <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Although Vitruvius later admits the prophecy of the Special was fabricated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>, Emmet's subsequent fall into a wormhole and awakening in another dimension reveals a deeper truth: his world is a toy story controlled by a "snot-nosed fleshmonster" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

This revelation marks Emmet's [[existential_themes_in_the_lego_movie | existential rebellion]], as he realizes free will is an illusion and refuses to let anyone define him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. His actions, such as wiggling off a table, symbolize his refusal to be a mere puppet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. Emmet's journey back to his world, symbolizing a "Christ-like resurrection," further solidifies his status as a religious figure (his name means "truth" in Hebrew) and a symbol of self-determination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

## Embracing Individuality

Ultimately, *The Lego Movie* champions the idea that to become "the Special," one must "embrace what is special about YOU" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. It encourages viewers not to settle for being "just another cog in some larger machine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. This message, emphasizing creativity and individualism over uniformity, reflects a core theme of the film, despite its commercial nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

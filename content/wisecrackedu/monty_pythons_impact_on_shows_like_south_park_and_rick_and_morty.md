Monty Python redefined comedy in the 1970s and remains a significant influence on modern comedies such as [[satirical_social_commentary_in_south_park|South Park]], [[satire_and_social_commentary_in_rick_and_morty|Rick and Morty]], and even *Deadpool* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Without Monty Python, these shows might not exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Monty Python paved the way for modern comedy by combining absurdity, satire, and postmodern-reflexivity, creating some of the most influential and quoted comedies ever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. This article explores [[influence_of_monty_python_on_modern_comedy|Monty Python's influence]] through its use of postmodernism, the comedy of the absurd, and social satire.

## Postmodernism and Self-Reflexivity
[[postmodernism_in_monty_pythons_work|Postmodernism]] is prevalent in modern media, with films and TV shows like *Jurassic World*, *Star Wars*, and *Family Guy* often referring back to themselves and commenting on narrative conventions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. The character *Deadpool* is a prime example of this movement, known for his rebellious self-awareness, mocking the superhero genre and winking at his own narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. This constant self-reflexivity encapsulates postmodernism, a term coined by French philosopher Jean-Francois Lyotard in 1979 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

Lyotard described "metanarratives" as grand mythologies that provide structure and universal insights, such as *The Wizard of Oz* teaching about finding "home" or *The Fast and The Furious* emphasizing family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. Postmodernism subverts these grand narratives, revealing chaos and disorder beneath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. While *Deadpool* lampoons the comic book metanarrative, Monty Python took deconstruction to another level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

### Monty Python and the Holy Grail
Monty Python's *Monty Python and the Holy Grail* is defined by breaking down multiple metanarratives, including Arthurian chivalry, Christianity, logic, and the film medium itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

*   **Deconstructing Arthurian Chivalry**: The film dismantles the idealized image of knights, portraying characters like Sir Robin as cowards and Arthur as power-hungry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. Sir Galahad is easily seduced, and Lancelot causes chaos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. The film uses postmodernism to illustrate how narratives can justify violent and oppressive acts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.
*   **Subverting Religious Metanarratives**: Even God is portrayed as a "cranky dick" with "crappily animated" form, questioning the traditional Christian metanarrative of an all-powerful, benevolent deity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.
*   **Distorting Logic**: The famous witch trial scene, where Sir Bedevere uses "foolproof" logic to determine if a woman is a witch, distorts formal logic, casting doubt on its fundamental trustworthiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.
*   **Breaking the Fourth Wall**: *The Holy Grail* constantly pokes fun at itself as a movie. Modern police arrest Arthur at the end, breaking the fourth wall and making the audience aware they are watching a film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. The film also uses coconuts for horse sounds due to budget constraints and acknowledges its own production issues, like the animator designing the Black Beast of Arghhh having a heart attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. This self-reflexivity reveals the film itself to be an artificial metanarrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

This multi-layered deconstruction of religion, logic, heroic tropes, and the film medium makes *Monty Python and the Holy Grail* "the 'Inception' of postmodern film" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.

## The Comedy of the Absurd
[[satire_and_social_commentary_in_rick_and_morty|Rick and Morty]] is popular for tying its absurd humor with thought-provoking insight, often addressing the meaninglessness of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. For example, in the "Get Schwifty" episode, people worship alien heads as gods, only for them to turn out to be judges for an *American Idol*-like reality show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. This style of humor is known as "The Comedy of the Absurd" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. It's an existential-based comedy that points out the broad humor in tragic insignificance rather than wallowing in despair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

### Monty Python's Life of Brian
This tragic absurdity is foundational to Monty Python's comedy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. In their film *Life of Brian*, Brian's entire existence is a series of absurd misunderstandings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. Born next to Jesus, he is mistakenly assumed to be the Messiah by the Three Wise Men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>. This projection of significance onto the insignificant is a hallmark of existential thought, particularly Albert Camus's philosophy of embracing "The Absurd" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.

Brian's attempts to deny his divinity are misinterpreted by his disciples, who attribute meaning to mundane actions, such as his losing a sandal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. This exact misappropriation of meaning is seen in [[rick_and_mortys_view_on_religion_and_atheism|Rick and Morty]]'s "Get Schwifty," where the cult mistakes alien heads for gods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. Absurdist comedies draw humor from this discrepancy between what is true and what people believe to be true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. Despite Brian's constant efforts to deny being the Messiah, his disciples grow in number, leading to his eventual crucifixion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>. However, even in the face of doom, Brian and his fellow crucifixion buddies sing "The Bright Side of Life," reflecting Camus's "Myth of Sisyphus" and the idea of finding humor in insignificance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.

## Satire and Social Commentary
Satire has become increasingly vital in modern comedy, from late-night talk shows to traditional half-hour comedies like [[satirical_social_commentary_in_south_park|South Park]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>. The last three seasons of [[impact_of_2016_presidential_election_on_south_park|South Park]] heavily focused on the 2016 election and the Trump presidency, deriving humor from revealing hypocrisy in established orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>.

Long before [[satirical_social_commentary_in_south_park|South Park]], Monty Python paved the way by subverting England's established political ideologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. [[satirical_social_commentary_in_south_park|South Park]] creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone often cite Monty Python as the single biggest influence on their show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.

### Monty Python's The Meaning of Life
In their final feature, [[social_and_political_satire_in_monty_pythons_the_meaning_of_life|The Meaning of Life]], Monty Python openly comments on English imperialism, economic disparity, and classicist social hierarchies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.

*   **Critique of Capitalism**: The opening mini-movie, "The Crimson Permanent Assurance," shows elderly workers rebelling against young American yuppies, destroying corporate buildings and the capitalist system that "anchored them to the ground" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>. The film questions the notion that self-interest leads to the greater good, illustrating doctors more concerned with expensive equipment than patients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>. The "Live Organ Transplants" sketch highlights bureaucratic absurdity and disregard for human life in the name of national good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>.
*   **Economic Disparity**: Britain's Yorkshire is ironically called a "Third World Country," and a poor man is forced to sell his children to science to make ends meet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>. The sketch "The Autumn Years" climaxes with the grotesquely obese Mr. Creosote exploding from overeating, implying the rich prosper at the expense of the starving lower class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>.
*   **British Imperialism and War**: The Pythons skewer British imperialism, depicting God striking down an officer who insists Britain needs an army to suppress differing ideologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>. A sergeant major drills his platoon on whether they have anything better to do than march, with soldiers confirming they do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>. The film suggests British imperialism is a threat to the meaning of life, juxtaposing the brutal reality of war with simple pleasures like celebrating a birthday <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>.
*   **Satire of Bureaucracy**: Their sketch show, *The Flying Circus*, often portrays bureaucrats as buffoons who constantly censor the show itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>. Christopher Hitchens observed that Monty Python's humor stemmed from "the bubbling magma of absurdity that lay beneath the fragile crust of British reserve" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>.

By merging social commentary, existential angst, and silliness, Monty Python defied convention, creating a singular brand of comedy so unique that the term "Pythonesque" was coined for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>.

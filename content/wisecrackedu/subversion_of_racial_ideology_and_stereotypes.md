*Django Unchained* offers a unique and nuanced criticism of slavery, blending typical Quentin Tarantino hallmarks with clever subversions of racial ideology and stereotypes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Beyond being a "revenge porn about a former slave burning down a Southern plantation," the film provides three subtle commentaries on slavery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

## You Can't Cover Ugly with Civilization

The film challenges the racist notion that white bodies represent culture and civilization, while Black bodies are seen as uncivilized and incapable of proper language or appreciation of culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

Dr. King Schultz, an eloquent German, speaks English so well it confounds native-speaking slavers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. His mastery of English vocabulary and rhetorical skills make the self-satisfied Southerners appear "wildly uncivilized" by comparison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. Schultz serves as a reminder that these self-styled "men of culture" are "full of shit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

This subversion directly counters historical justifications for slavery, such as Aristotle's idea that humans differed from animals based on "logos" (speech and reason), while slaves were only capable of "phonos" (base instincts) and thus lacked proper speech and reason <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. *Django Unchained* flips this dichotomy by portraying some of the cruelest slavers as mumbling incoherently, while the slaves speak clearly and intelligibly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

The film also contrasts how Schultz treats slaves versus other white characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. Schultz uses the honorific "Fraulein" when talking to Broomhilde, unlike the N-word used by others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. In contrast, Calvin Candie demands the French honorific "Monsieur" as a sign of mandatory submission, despite not speaking French <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

The use of beer similarly highlights this contrast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. Schultz buying Django a beer symbolizes a transition to a relationship of coworkers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>, representing shared humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. Candie, however, uses beer as a "sick sort of reward" for an enslaved man forced to murder another, symbolizing "cold blooded savagery" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.

Even Schultz, the "multilingual European man of culture," is not entirely civilized, being a bounty hunter who kills people for a job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. He buys Django out of self-interest and forces his help, though he at least acknowledges it's a pragmatic, not moral, act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

The film further critiques the superficiality of Southern "civilization" through Candie, who demands "Monsieur" despite not understanding French and whose attempt to show off German to Schultz fails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. Schultz's boiling point is reached when Beethoven, a product of his culture, is appropriated by those he sees as "truly savages" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

The film also exposes the "bloody hypocrisy" of using the Christian bible to justify savagery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. When a Brittle brother quotes Genesis 9:2 while preparing to whip a slave, Django shoots him through the page of the bible pinned to his shirt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. This verse, where God gives mankind power over beasts, was used to justify slavery by deeming slaves "less than human" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.

## Using the Symbols of Slavery to Make Slavery Look Stupid

*Django Unchained* uses fashion, music, and iconography to "flip the logic of slavery on its head" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

This approach mirrors Joseph Cinque, leader of the Amistad Rebellion, who was portrayed in media in the style of a noble from the culture that enslaved him, an act described as "egalitarian" and "subversive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. Similarly, Django's "Three Musketeers" attire and horseback riding are deliberately abrasive, intended to challenge those who would reserve such outfits and activities for "a white civilized man of culture" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.

Django's aesthetic choices embody "disidentification," a strategy theorized by José Esteban Muñoz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. This involves taking the cultural logic of, say, slavery, and mangling its symbols from within, rather than escaping or assimilating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. Django wears the attire of a Southern aristocrat not to become one, but "to abuse the very notion of the Southern Gentleman" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

Tarantino also plays with the soundtrack, incorporating rap music which might seem "out of sync" with a mid-nineteenth-century Western <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. This choice makes sense as rap has long been used by those facing racial and economic inequality to "fight the powers that be," addressing systemic white supremacy and fantasizing about changing circumstances and seeking revenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. The song "100 Black Coffins" explicitly features lyrics of revenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.

Music is also used to give context to Django's journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>. Schultz interprets Django's mission to rescue Broomhilde through Richard Wagner’s "Twilight of the Gods," making Django the "Siegfried of his own story of revenge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>. As a Nietzschean *ubermensch*, Django responds to the "nihilist values of slavery and white supremacy not with rational appeals for reform and dialogue, but by both metaphorically and literally burning the whole damn thing to the ground" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>. The fiery destruction of Candyland serves as a metaphorical call for the destruction of the institution of slavery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>.

Tarantino is also aware that Wagner's Ring Cycle was appropriated to support German nationalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>. By using a narrative once appropriated by Nazis to support white supremacy, he tells a slavery revenge story that destroys white supremacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.

Finally, the film uses the Western genre to frame this slave revenge fantasy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. Unlike traditional Westerns featuring "strong jawed white dudes" killing Native Americans, *Django Unchained* features a freed slave taking out white cowboy types, a subject largely ignored in the Western canon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>.

## Acting Out of Slavery

The film explores the role of "acting" as a primary means by which Django gains agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. This relates to the academic debate about the question of agency in slavery, with some believing slaves lacked all agency, while others explore the freedoms they could exert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.

Schultz prepares Django to "play a character" with a specific wardrobe for their mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>. Django's agency is expressed through the decisions he makes in this role, including berating other slaves, lashing out at Candie's crew, and passively observing a slave being ripped apart by dogs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>. These decisions, while not "good or bad," are made within the scope of his limited agency and out of necessity for survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>. He later uses acting and props to trick a gang of Australians and regain his freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>.

Perhaps the most striking example of agency through acting is Stephen, Candie’s head house slave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>. Stephen, who "really, really hates Django," likely out of envy for Django's freedom gained by breaking the system, also employs "dramatic arts for personal gain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>. Stephen performed his way into the "relative comfort of Candie’s home" and can even disagree with his master <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. He uses exaggerated laughter at Candie's jokes to gain trust and influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>. It is Stephen, not Candie, who realizes Schultz and Django are playing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>.

Stephen also uses "non-verbal acting," performing a fake limp with a fake cane to appear physically weak, disarming suspicions about his skill or power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>. While a villain who served his master's interests over fellow slaves, Stephen's villainy must be seen in the context of his limited choices to gain freedom under slavery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>. He is "simply trying to manifest his own power playing the cards he was dealt" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>.

Ultimately, *Django Unchained* is presented not merely as an "irreverent attempt to make a slavery western," but as "one of the sharpest criticisms of slavery, and of white supremacy, in recent cinema" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>.

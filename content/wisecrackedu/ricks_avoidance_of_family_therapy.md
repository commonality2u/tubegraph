In the *Rick and Morty* episode "Pickle Rick," the titular character [[ricks_transformation_into_pickle_rick | Rick's transformation into Pickle Rick]] is primarily a deliberate maneuver to evade [[themes_of_mental_health_in_rick_and_morty | family therapy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. While the initial idea for Rick to be a pickle originated from a writer's room brainstorm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>, the narrative justification centers on Rick's deep-seated avoidance of confronting his emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## The "Pickle Rick" Scenario

The episode revolves around Rick transforming himself into a pickle to avoid attending a [[themes_of_mental_health_in_rick_and_morty | family therapy]] session that Summer, Morty, and Beth are compelled to attend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. Rick's plan goes awry, leading him to fight his way through a sewer and a Russian embassy using a mech suit made of animal parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Meanwhile, Beth, Summer, and Morty are at their school-appointed therapist's office after Summer huffed pottery enamel and Morty peed his pants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

A parallel is drawn between Rick and Beth, as Beth also attempts to stonewall the therapist and maintain emotional distance, mirroring Rick's extreme measures to avoid baring his emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. The therapist, Dr. Wong, observes that the dynamic between Beth and her father, Rick, may punish emotion or vulnerability, eroding Beth's marriage and infecting her children with a tendency to misdirect feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

This season of *Rick and Morty* has shown an increased emphasis on serialized arcs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. In the previous episode, Rick avoided his daughter's divorce by staying in a Mad Max-like land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>, and in "Pickle Rick," he physically transforms to run away from reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. The children, Morty and Summer, appear increasingly damaged by their parents' divorce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

## Dr. Wong's Critique and the Theme of Freedom

One developing theme in the season is [[themes_of_freedom_and_choice_in_rick_and_morty | freedom]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Dr. Wong provides a pivotal quote that highlights Rick's core issue:
> "I think it's because the only truly unapproachable concept for you is that it's your mind within your control. You chose to come here. You chose to talk. To belittle my vocation, just as you chose to become a pickle. Each of us gets to choose." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>

This statement suggests that Rick's resistance stems from an inability to accept that his mind is under his own control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. Despite his god-like abilities and power to transform himself into a pickle, he struggles with the simple concept of personal choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

## Philosophical Underpinnings: Sartre and Infinite Choice

To understand Rick's predicament, existential philosopher Jean Paul Sartre's ideas on [[themes_of_freedom_and_choice_in_rick_and_morty | freedom]] are insightful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. Sartre posits that in a godless universe, humans are radically free to define their own existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. However, people often act in "bad faith" by making choices based on social pressures or a perceived identity, denying their fundamental [[themes_of_freedom_and_choice_in_rick_and_morty | freedom]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. Sartre also discusses "finitude," the fixed amount of choices available in mortal life, where each choice precludes others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. Denying the importance of these finite choices is another form of "bad faith," often manifesting as pretending to have no choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

Rick's situation is unique because he deals with infinitude rather than finitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. His access to infinite timelines means he doesn't need attachment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. Unlike Sartre's critique of those who shirk responsibility for their choices, Rick believes he doesn't have to take responsibility because he has already made all possible choices across infinite versions of himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. He has transcended the human condition of finite choices with science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

## The Paradox of Rick's Avoidance

Despite his vast intelligence and mastery over his universe, Rick paradoxically struggles to come to terms with his own choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. Dr. Wong points out that using intelligence or the multiverse to justify actions is not a solution, as the decision still ultimately has to be made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.
> "The only connection between your unquestionable intelligence and the sickness destroying your family, is that everyone in your family, you included, use intelligence to justify sickness." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>

No matter how many versions of Rick exist, his individual choices remain uniquely his own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. Rick's long-standing coping mechanism for infinite choice is to simply "don't think about it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. Since therapy inherently encourages thinking about things, Rick transforms into a pickle to avoid choice, or at least the appearance of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. As a "helpless, armless pickle," he can deny responsibility for not attending therapy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. This blatant disregard for his choices is, in Sartre's terms, acting in "bad faith" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

This theme of [[themes_of_freedom_and_choice_in_rick_and_morty | agency]] and responsibility is further highlighted by the contrast between Rick, an all-powerful "madman" who changes the world when he doesn't like it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>, and Jerry's powerlessness, which Morty resents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

### Speculation on Symbolism
There is a speculative connection between Rick's pickle form and the therapeutic setting, humorously suggesting that a writer in the *Rick and Morty* room might have played with the Freudian idea of "everything is a penis" by loosely connecting a phallic object (the pickle) to therapy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

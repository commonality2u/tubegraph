*The Walking Dead* is a series that transforms its characters from "coddled complainers" into "battle-tested zombie murdering badasses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. The show offers a rich [[social_commentary_in_the_walking_dead | social commentary]], utilizing the zombie figure as a metaphor for various societal fears, such as mindless consumers under capitalism (as seen in *Dawn of the Dead*) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>, public health crises (*28 Days Later*) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>, immigration (*World War Z*) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>, and mega-corporations (*Resident Evil*) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. It draws parallels to its predecessors, for example, survivors taking refuge in a shopping mall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. Beyond these, *The Walking Dead* delves into complex issues like politics, psychology, and humanity's relationship with death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## What Does it Mean to Live? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>

The terror inspired by zombies provides deep insights into how humans view their own lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. Zombies are unsettling because they are "like us, but not quite us," challenging the fundamental reasons humans believe they are special <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. The show explores philosophical boundaries, specifically:
*   What constitutes life? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>
*   What constitutes "living"? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>
*   What constitutes being human? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>

The series constantly interrogates the difference between life and death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>, often blurring the lines. The revelation that "everyone is infected" means the distinction between "walker" and human becomes vague <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. While walkers are biologically alive, capable of movement and basic functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>, the show pushes the philosophical question of "What constitutes a life worth living?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

Characters frequently struggle to let go of loved ones who have turned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>:
*   Morgan cannot shoot his reanimated wife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
*   Hershel collects zombies, convinced of their lingering humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
*   The Governor keeps his turned daughter captive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

Each character holds their own reasons for continuing life:
*   Dale views all life as sacred, unable to let go no matter the circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.
*   Carol prioritizes survival as an end in itself, displaying ruthless pragmatism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.
*   Rick believes being biologically alive is a means to an end—the chance to one day truly live, echoing his grandfather's sentiment of "pretending he was dead" to survive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

The show also touches upon [[Absurdism_and_Existentialism_in_the_series | existentialism]]. While Albert Camus posited that "there is but one truly philosophical problem, and that is suicide" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>, he argued that only life offers freedom, despite its meaninglessness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. This contrasts with characters like Dr. Jenner, Andrea, and Jacqui, who choose to end their lives at the CDC, seeing no point in a life devoid of meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

The question of "What makes us human?" is central <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. Initially, one might distinguish humans by their purpose and lack of hunger for flesh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. However, the introduction of cannibals and the aimless wandering of survivors blur this distinction, leading to the question of what truly differentiates humans from zombies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. This leads to a constant effort by survivors to distance themselves from walkers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>, desiring proper burials to avoid reanimation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.

The apocalypse strips away social distinctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>, with Rick declaring, "There are no 'niggers' anymore. No dumb as shit, inbred, white-trash fools either. Only dark meat and white meat. There's us and the dead" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. Yet, survivors desperately cling to symbols of their former humanity, such as Rick's sheriff's hat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>, Carol's missing Maytag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>, or the desire for hot showers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. Ultimately, what separates human from animal appears to be social status, material possessions, and creature comforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. Unlike Aristotle's view of reason and speech as defining human traits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>, in this world, losing these abilities warrants the claim that one is no longer human <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

## Moral Lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>

In *The Walking Dead*, zombies are not always the greatest threat; humanity's worst excesses are constantly on display, from abusive individuals to bandits and cannibals like those at Terminus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. Terminus, named after the Roman god of boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>, embodies the blurring of boundaries: human-zombie, human-animal, good-evil, and civilization-barbarism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. The residents of Terminus have lost their humanity but ironically exhibit "humanity's crowning achievement: Bureaucracy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

Terminus serves as a cautionary tale: its residents, originally victims of atrocities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>, resorted to cannibalism and inhumane practices in the name of survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. This highlights that "morality, along with a Maytag and a shower, is what separates us from animals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. Glenn argues that helping others is "essential to their identity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>, insisting that morality is a choice even in a broken world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>. Others, like Martin, suggest that being "a good guy" is a weakness that leads to death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>.

The show explores whether walkers retain any part of their former selves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>, but also whether morally contaminated survivors retain their past identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>. Morgan's character arc demonstrates that even those who lose themselves to grief and violence can be rehabilitated, refusing to kill even the most monstrous individuals like the Wolves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. This contributes to the broader [[moral_lines_and_human_nature_in_a_dystopian_world | exploration of moral lines and human nature in a dystopian world]].

## Dictatorship and the State of Exception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>

A recurring theme is the tension between dictatorship and democracy in a world where basic survival is complicated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. Rick's group often struggles with decision-making, with violence as an imminent backup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>. Rick openly declares a dictatorship at the end of Season 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>, mirroring the ancient Roman concept of absolute power granted during extreme emergencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>. Rick is likened to Cincinnatus, a Roman statesman who took absolute power to save Rome but immediately resigned when the threat passed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>. This Roman connection, also seen in The Governor's gladiator-like fights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a> and Terminus's name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>, allows the show to comment on politics and sovereignty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>.

The show explores Carl Schmitt's idea that "the sovereign is whoever makes the exception"—the one who can discard the law during an emergency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>. Rick, Shane, and Carol all make exceptions to protect the group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>. Italian philosopher Giorgio Agamben's argument that "the state of exception has become the law of our time" is particularly relevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>. Agamben investigated how Nazi concentration camps could occur, finding the answer in the state of exception becoming the norm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>.

Rick is presented as a modern sovereign who suspends the law for the greater good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>. The terrifying implication is that the difference between Rick and Gareth (the cannibal leader of Terminus) is merely that for Gareth, "the suspension of law has become permanent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>. These atrocities are justified in the name of survival, echoing Nietzsche's "butcher or the cattle" philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>. Agamben states, "The camp is the space that opens up when the state of exception starts to become the rule" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>. This suggests that without the rule of law, the commitment of atrocities depends solely on the sovereign's discretion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>. This dynamic contributes to the show's exploration of [[moral_dilemmas_and_security_logic_in_apocalyptic_worlds | moral dilemmas and security logic in apocalyptic worlds]].

## Conclusion

*The Walking Dead* poses profound questions about what makes life worth living, what makes us human, and under what circumstances one might resort to extreme measures like cannibalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:42">[00:18:42]</a>. The show challenges viewers to consider whether Rick and his group will save the world or if the world will ultimately need saving from Rick himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>. These themes resonate deeply, even outside of a fictional [[postapocalyptic_themes_in_rick_and_morty | zombie apocalypse]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>.

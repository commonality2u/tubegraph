The *Rick and Morty* episode "The Vindicators 3: Return of the World Ender" serves as a critique of formulaic popular cinema, particularly superhero films, by deeply exploring concepts of [[moral_ambiguity_in_cinema | good and evil]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This episode cleverly and profoundly comments on the complexities of [[exploration_of_moral_themes_in_the_show | moral themes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Subverting Heroism

The episode's central [[narrative_structure_and_the_golden_rule_in_storytelling | arc]] involves Morty's optimistic worldview crumbling around him, similar to "Meeseeks and Destroy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Just as his wholesome view of fairy tales eroded in the previous episode, here his faith in the Vindicators erodes as the superhero genre is subverted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Beneath the superficial superhero jokes, the episode delves into the complexities of good and evil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. Rick plays a unique role in disintegrating Morty's worldview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

## Rick's "Saw"-Inspired Trials

After Rick drunkenly destroys the Worldender, he traps the Vindicators in a series of trials, effectively ruining them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. These trials are inspired by the *Saw* film series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Unlike [[jigsaws_morality_and_motivations | Jigsaw's morality and motivations]] which involve making people confront their demons, Drunk Rick's puzzles are "a drunken scheme to push people over a [[moral_lines_and_human_nature_in_a_dystopian_world | moral cliff]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. This scheme works, revealing the Vindicators' true colors: Vance shows his, Million Ants kills Allen Rails over a woman, and Crocubot exposes the Vindicators' secret <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. Rick's trials aim to create a [[moral_dilemmas_and_security_logic_in_apocalyptic_worlds | moral crisis]] for the Vindicators, proving to Morty that they are not heroes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

## The Joker's Influence on Moral Corruption

The episode also draws inspiration from unique villains in cinema, specifically The Joker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. Morty's carnival ride trip is reminiscent of Alan Moore's *The Killing Joke*, where Commissioner Gordon is tortured by the Joker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. Like [[jigsaws_morality_and_motivations | Jigsaw]], The Joker's motivation isn't senseless murder but to prove that "all it takes is a little push" for anyone to become as mad as him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

Rick's actions in the episode serve a similar purpose: to push the Vindicators to their breaking point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. Just as The Joker infects Harvey Dent with his nihilistic philosophy, Rick turns the benevolent Vindicators into violent backstabbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. This act upends Morty's simplistic understanding of good and evil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.

## Critique of Simplistic Good vs. Evil Narratives

The show argues that narratives that "spoon-feed" simple understandings of good and evil are problematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. Philosopher Jacques Ranciere's ideas are introduced to highlight the issue with "Evil" (with a capital E) as portrayed in superhero movies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. This portrayal transforms any conflict into an ultimate struggle between Good and Evil, making the value of victory seem infinite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. This logic suggests that even the worst actions are justified if they lead to destroying "ultimate evil" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. The episode illustrates this with the Vindicators' decision to exterminate an entire planet, Dorian 5, to kill a shapeshifter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

### "Infinite Evil" and "Infinite Justice"

Ranciere's philosophy posits that "infinite" evil, whether embodied by world-destroyers or humans, warrants "infinite justice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. This kind of justice often disregards morals, the lives of innocent people (like those on Dorian 5), and even the concept of "justice" itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

## The "Noble Lie"

By the end of the episode, Supernova is infected with Rick's nihilistic philosophy, no longer believing in a real division between good and evil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. However, she recognizes that this simplistic division *must* be upheld for the galaxy's security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. She is willing to kill Rick, Morty, and even her lover to protect the *perception* that the Vindicators are good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

This concept is a clear shoutout to *The Dark Knight*, which is presented as an example of [[moral_ambiguity_in_cinema | moral greyness]] in a comic book movie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. In *The Dark Knight*, Batman lies about Harvey Dent's "goodness" to maintain peace in Gotham <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. Similarly, Supernova advocates for a "noble lie," the idea, famously proposed by Plato, that societies can be built on a myth to maintain order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. *Rick and Morty* has used this concept before, as seen in the episode where a symbol of King Jellybean is preserved rather than revealing his true nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

### Deconstruction vs. Celebration

While *The Dark Knight* celebrates this "noble lie," *Rick and Morty* uses it to deconstruct the myth of superheroes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

## The Dangers of Nihilism

Beyond deconstructing good and evil as arbitrary concepts, the episode also suggests that the complete absence of these concepts is problematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. This is reinforced by Dr. Wong's previous confrontation with Rick, where she states that Rick uses his intelligence to justify his "sickness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. While the Vindicators fail to critically engage with their methods, Rick refuses to engage with his decisions because he believes "nothing matters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. If good and evil are just social constructs, he can't consider his actions evil and can continue to do whatever he wants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

## Conclusion

The episode presents two dismal perspectives on [[moral_dilemmas_and_security_logic_in_apocalyptic_worlds | good and evil]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>:
*   **Zero conviction**: Leading to nihilism where actions don't matter, as exemplified by Rick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
*   **Complete conviction**: Leading to extreme actions for the sake of "good," such as blowing up an entire planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.

As typical for *Rick and Morty*, there are no "right answers" presented, "only wrong ones" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. The show challenges viewers to consider the complex and often dark implications of [[moral_ambiguity_in_cinema | moral choices]] and perceptions in [[the_role_of_conflict_in_storytelling_and_human_experience | storytelling]].

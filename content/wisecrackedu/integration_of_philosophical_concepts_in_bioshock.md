The *Bioshock* trilogy is recognized not only as a pioneer in gameplay, mixing survival horror, RPG, and FPS elements, but also for its intellectual sophistication, effectively integrating philosophical concepts into its plot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Objectivism in Rapture (Bioshock 1)

The original *Bioshock* takes place in [[comparison_between_rapture_and_columbia_as_philosophical_constructs | Rapture]], an undersea city founded by Andrew Ryan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Ryan's name is effectively an anagram for Ayn Rand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>, a Russian-born thinker whose most famous book, *Atlas Shrugged*, poses the cryptic question, "Who is John Galt?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. This is mirrored in Rapture with "Who is Atlas?" posters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Galt's Gulch
> In *Atlas Shrugged*, John Galt encourages a "strike of the mind," urging industrialists to leave their roles in an increasingly controlled world, frustrated with the inefficiency of socialism and its disregard for the individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Galt retreats to Galt's Gulch to shut down the world's industrial motor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. [[comparison_between_rapture_and_columbia_as_philosophical_constructs | Rapture]] is a digital homage to Galt's Gulch, bringing together the world's best minds undersea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

### Ayn Rand's Objectivism

Andrew Ryan's political philosophy is directly derived from [[ayn_rands_objectivism_and_its_influence_on_bioshock | Ayn Rand's concept of objectivism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. [[ayn_rands_objectivism_and_its_influence_on_bioshock | Objectivism]] is a guide to living a worthy life, primarily based on:
*   **Reality**: Belief that reality is concrete and objective, rejecting mystical or divine guiding forces for humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. Actions should be determined solely by intellect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Ayn Rand was an atheist, and so was Andrew Ryan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
    > [!QUOTE] Andrew Ryan
    > "I believe in no God â€“ no invisible man in the sky. But there is something more powerful than each of us: a combination of our efforts, a Great Chain of industry that unites us." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>
*   **Reason**: Emphasizing intellectual thought as the basis for action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
*   **Self-interest**: An ethics of egoism, holding that people should work hard to achieve happiness in their own lives and not treat others as mere means to an end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. Ryan's monologues reflect this:
    > [!QUOTE] Andrew Ryan
    > "Though my physical defenses fall, you'll not defeat me. My strength is not in steel and fire, but in my intellect and will. You hear me, Atlas? Andrew Ryan offers you nothing but ashes! In the end, all that matters to me is me. And all that matters to you is you. It is the nature of things." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>
*   **Capitalism**: Specifically, laissez-faire capitalism, where government's role is limited to protecting individual rights and staying out of personal lives and the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

### The Downfall of Rapture
[[comparison_between_rapture_and_columbia_as_philosophical_constructs | Rapture]] was founded on the belief that "communist parasites" in the world above "stole, violated, and unjustly took from the captains of industry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. Ryan, like Galt, was tired of working without getting what he deserved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

> [!QUOTE] Andrew Ryan
> "No," says the man in Washington, "It belongs to the poor." "No," says the man in the Vatican, "It belongs to God." "No," says the man in Moscow, "It belongs to everyone." I rejected those answers." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>

In Rapture, the plasmid market was severely under-regulated, driven by the belief that an unfettered market provides the best options for consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. Despite "tremendous pressure" and side effects like blindness, insanity, and death, Ryan insisted on testing their ideology through the market's patience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

The ruinous state of Rapture suggests that a society run by these tenets is doomed to fail, or that Ryan perverted Rand's beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. The resource ADAM led to civil war, and its complete deregulation resulted in a population of addicts, rampant chaos, and instability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. The use of Little Sisters as "mules for magical sea slugs" to create ADAM treats them as mere tools, an action [[ayn_rands_objectivism_and_its_influence_on_bioshock | Ayn Rand]] would disapprove of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

## American Exceptionalism in Columbia (Bioshock Infinite)

*Bioshock Infinite* shifts the setting from undersea [[comparison_between_rapture_and_columbia_as_philosophical_constructs | Rapture]] to the floating city of [[comparison_between_rapture_and_columbia_as_philosophical_constructs | Columbia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. [[comparison_between_rapture_and_columbia_as_philosophical_constructs | Columbia]], a play on the United States Capital, is a floating Eden founded by Zachary Hale Comstock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. Comstock is a fictional stand-in for 19th-century New York political figure Anthony Comstock, known for his fight against obscenity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

Comstock founded [[comparison_between_rapture_and_columbia_as_philosophical_constructs | Columbia]] as a place for "God's people," separate from the "world of sinners" below <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. This image of [[comparison_between_rapture_and_columbia_as_philosophical_constructs | Columbia]] as a shining beacon in the sky is philosophically justified by the concept of [[american_exceptionalism_and_its_critique_in_bioshock_infinite | American Exceptionalism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

### Critique of American Exceptionalism

[[american_exceptionalism_and_its_critique_in_bioshock_infinite | American Exceptionalism]] is the belief that the New World was promised to God's chosen people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. *Bioshock Infinite* satirizes America's historical landscape through this philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. The game explores the dark side of this philosophy, which justifies a particular lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. Like America, [[comparison_between_rapture_and_columbia_as_philosophical_constructs | Columbia]] is considered "God's country," with themes of forgiveness, salvation, and baptism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

The expansion into new frontiers was justified as a mission from God to prevent the new world from backsliding like the "old world sinners of Europe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. America was meant to be populated by "exceptional, chosen people," exempt from and above the rest of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. This ideology, secularized as Manifest Destiny, justified the extermination of indigenous people ("Native Americans") for the sake of securing the national identity of Christian settlers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. Those unwilling to accept Christianity were forcibly moved or eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

[[american_exceptionalism_and_its_critique_in_bioshock_infinite | American Exceptionalism]] is deeply woven into history, justifying events like slavery, labor strikes, and the abuse of Irish and Chinese workers who built the American Railroad system, all for the "lofty goal of a promised city for God's people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. [[comparison_between_rapture_and_columbia_as_philosophical_constructs | Columbia]] is a paranoid place, fearful of the anarchist Vox Populi, Irish and Chinese threats, and racial mixing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.

*Infinite* explores America's haunted past:
*   The Battle of Wounded Knee is heralded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.
*   Laws enforcing racial segregation in relationships and marriage are commonplace, as are lynchings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.
*   Enemies in the game are robotic George Washingtons called "Patriots" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

*Bioshock Infinite* challenges the conception of good guys and bad guys, freedom fighters and dictators, by revealing that the hero, Booker DeWitt, is simultaneously the villain, Comstock, in another dimension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. This exposes the paranoia of an "us versus them" dichotomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

## The Illusion of Choice and Free Will

One of the essential dilemmas explored throughout *Bioshock* is the [[the_illusion_of_choice_and_free_will_in_the_bioshock_series | freedom of action, choice, and free will]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. As stated in the first game: "Andrew Ryan reminds us â€“ we all make choices, but, in the end, our choices make us" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. This leads to the question: If our choices make us, how can we be free to make them? Is [[the_illusion_of_choice_and_free_will_in_the_bioshock_series | free will]] even possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>?

### Hard Determinism

Hard Determinists believe that there is no such thing as [[the_illusion_of_choice_and_free_will_in_the_bioshock_series | free will]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. If all action can be boiled down to cause and effect, then all actions are bound by an external force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. Our "choice" in our actions is merely an illusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

Andrew Ryan reinforces this with the phrase, "A man chooses. A slave obeys" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. In a brilliant meta-commentary, Ryan states that as a gamer, you are destined to mindlessly follow the fixed path of the game's narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. "Interactivity," or the idea that the gamer has any bearing on the game's outcome, is merely an illusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

### The Illusion of Choice in Bioshock Infinite

*Bioshock Infinite* presents the multiverse as a possible way out of the problem of [[the_illusion_of_choice_and_free_will_in_the_bioshock_series | free will]], with an infinite number of worlds to choose from <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. Booker's ability to go back and choose not to be baptized, or to "smother baby Comstock," seems to offer an escape from a deterministic universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. However, even this choice is not a real possibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.

The game continually hints at the problem of [[the_illusion_of_choice_and_free_will_in_the_bioshock_series | free will]], even when presenting apparent choices to the player:

*   **The Coin Flip**: Players are prompted to press "X" to flip a coin, but if they don't, the game doesn't progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. Furthermore, it always lands on heads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.
*   **Handing Over Elizabeth**: Booker is presented with the choice to "Bring [them] the girl and wipe away the debt," and the game offers an option to press "X" to hand Elizabeth over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. However, the only way to progress is to press "square" and pick up baby Elizabeth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.

These instances demonstrate that the "choice" is an illusion; the player is fated to perform certain actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. While most games would use a cut scene, *Bioshock* forces the player to press buttons, making them recognize their lack of freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. Perhaps the only way to truly assert one's freedom in the world of *Bioshock* is to simply turn off the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.

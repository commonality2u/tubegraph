*Attack on Titan* is a "colossal series" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a> that profoundly explores the "visceral reality" of death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, a theme rarely delved into with such depth by other anime properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Titans as the Embodiment of Death
The Titans in *Attack on Titan* serve as a "physical personification of death" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. They are described as "walking reminders of human mortality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>, presenting an "existential confrontation with the inevitability of demise" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, which is portrayed as "pretty horrifying" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. While the series features "eerily introspective confrontations with death" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>, the true "darkest element" is considered to be the societal structure behind the walls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## Death, Freedom, and Community
The concept of freedom and community within the show, particularly through the lens of [[Nazi Ideology and Carl Schmitts Influence on Attack on Titan | Carl Schmitt]]'s philosophy, is tied to the denial of "cowardice in the face of impending death" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. Joining the Scouts is presented as a "liberation from the fear of living inside the wall waiting to die" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.

For Schmitt, a political community is defined by the willingness to kill enemies for friends or die at their hands for friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>. This idea is echoed in the Scouts, who risk their lives, similar to the soldiers in Alfred Tennyson's "The Charge of the Light Brigade," which is referenced in the show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. This poem, an "exemplar war poem about dying with your comrades in battle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>, resonates particularly given the number of Scouts who die fighting Annie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. This sense of camaraderie forms the core of the political community, binding humanity together rather than allowing internal conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

## Sovereign Power and Sacrifice
The leadership within *Attack on Titan* demonstrates the power of the [[Role of Sovereignty and State of Emergency in Attack on Titan | sovereign]] to declare "states of emergencies" that justify sacrificing populations for the greater good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. An example of this is the decision to send a battalion to reclaim Wall Maria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. The leaders "send millions to their death" to ensure the safety of the remaining population inside the walls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. Pyxis reveals that the retaking of Wall Maria was a "thinly disguised purge" to alleviate stress from the influx of refugees, a deliberate decision to "kill off part of the population for the greater good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. This grim reality aligns with Schmitt's view that a sovereign must retain the ability to perform "even the most horrendous of things if order is to be maintained" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>.

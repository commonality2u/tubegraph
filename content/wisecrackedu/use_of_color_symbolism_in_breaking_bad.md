*Breaking Bad* Season Number One is rich with [[themes_and_symbols_in_breaking_bad_season_1 | themes and symbols]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

## Yellow Symbolism

Throughout Season Number One, the color yellow is frequently used to foreshadow threats and dangers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. Examples of yellow appearing in potentially ominous contexts include yellow mustard stains, bright yellow "hoopties," broken yellow plates, and certain visual elements related to a woman's mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. Some dangers, however, are more subtle and challenging to identify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

## Other Color Mentions

While not explicitly defined in terms of symbolism, the color "blue" is mentioned in the context of taking a "hit of blue," suggesting an effect that blurs the line between the [[american_dream_and_moral_decline_in_breaking_bad | American Dream]] and a "waking nightmare" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.

The 2006 film *Idiocracy* has become a cult classic, known for its [[cultural_prescience_and_criticism_in_idiocracy | political prescience]] and [[cultural_commentary_in_idiocracy | cultural commentary]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. Beyond its satire of [[political_satire_and_antiintellectualism_in_idiocracy | anti-intellectualism]] and corporate influence, the movie's central premise regarding societal degeneration is deeply rooted in a specific, debunked pseudoscientific theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## The Film's Premise: Declining Intelligence

*Idiocracy* depicts a future America where the population has become profoundly unintelligent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. The film attributes this decline to a specific theory: "Dumb, irresponsible people have tons of dumb, irresponsible kids at rates that vastly exceed that of your 'upstanding' citizens" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. Without natural selection, the general populace is portrayed as continually getting dumber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. The opening sequence of the film illustrates this through contrasting families, one highly educated delaying children and another uneducated having many <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

## Historical Basis: The Kallikak Family and Eugenics

This central idea within *Idiocracy* was notably explored by Henry Herbert Goddard in his influential 1912 book, *The Kallikak Family* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. Goddard's study focused on the family of a pseudonymously named Deborah Kallikak, tracing generations of individuals he deemed "idiots" back to an "upstanding revolutionary soldier" who had a fling with a "tavern girl" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. In contrast, the same soldier, Martin Kallikak, married a "nice Quaker girl" and begat a long line of "upstanding citizens" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. The family tree depicted in *Idiocracy* visually resembles Goddard's charts, with "bad" people outnumbering "good" people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

Goddard's work was based on the concept of "feeble-mindedness" – a term he popularized and even coined the word "moron" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. His theory posited that "feeble-mindedness" was spreading like a disease and needed to be stopped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. While Goddard did not invent the movement, he significantly popularized Eugenics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.

Despite its influence, Goddard later renounced his work, acknowledging it was "riddled with errors and inaccuracies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. However, the Eugenics movement, based on these now-debunked ideas about genetics, spread rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. This led to forced sterilization programs across America and a Supreme Court case that upheld sterilization laws, infamously stating, "three generations of imbeciles are enough" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>.

## Mike Judge's Stance and Real-World Counterarguments

Director Mike Judge has directly addressed the criticism that *Idiocracy* is pro-eugenics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. He stated that the film's opening aims to cover both nature and nurture, indicating that the irresponsible parenting shown contributes to the issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. Judge explicitly said, "I obviously don’t believe in eugenics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.

Contrary to the film's depiction of declining IQ scores, real-world data shows the opposite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. IQ scores have been increasing on average by 3 points every decade, a phenomenon known as the Flynn Effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>. This suggests that if a character like Joe Bauers were to take an IQ test 500 years in the future, his score would appear comparatively low by future standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.

Furthermore, the general complaint of "[[cultural_commentary_in_idiocracy | cultural deterioration]]" – that language, cinema, or TV are getting worse – is a common and historical lament, rarely proving true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. Critics have decried perceived declines in culture for centuries, yet language continues to evolve and new forms of expression emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>.

While *Idiocracy* offers a "hilarious snapshot of early 2000's paranoia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a> and functions as a cautionary tale against ceding critical thinking for mindless consumerism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>, its specific premise regarding the world getting "dumber" due to reproductive patterns is considered inaccurate and based on debunked pseudoscientific ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.

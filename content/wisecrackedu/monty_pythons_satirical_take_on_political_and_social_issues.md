Monty Python, a group of "wily Brits," redefined comedy in the 1970s and remain hugely influential today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Their comedy combines absurdity, satire, and postmodern-reflexivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. They are known for constantly keeping the audience on their toes by merging social commentary, existential angst, and silliness, defying convention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>.

## Satire of British Society and Imperialism

Monty Python openly commented on English imperialism, economic disparity, and the classist social hierarchies prevalent in the country, particularly in their final feature, *The Meaning of Life* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.

### Economic Disparity and Capitalism

*   **The Crimson Permanent Assurance**: This mini-movie depicts poor, elderly workers forced into a "pirate-like frenzy" by young American "yuppies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>. The old workers rebel, destroying corporate buildings and "bringing down the capitalist system that literally anchored them to the ground" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>.
*   **Self-Interest in Capitalism**: The Pythons questioned the economic notion that self-interest leads to the greater good, often showing the opposite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>.
    *   In the "Miracle of Birth" sketch, doctors are more concerned with expensive equipment and impressing administrators than the patient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>.
    *   In "Live Organ Transplants," bureaucrats forcefully remove an impoverished man's liver for the country's benefit, with nonsensical reasoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>.
*   **Consequences of the System**:
    *   Britain's Yorkshire is ironically called a "Third World Country" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>.
    *   A poor man is forced to sell his children to science to make ends meet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>.
*   **The Autumn Years (Mr. Creosote)**: This sketch culminates in the "grotesquely obese and rich Mr. Creosote" eating until he literally explodes, implying that the rich get richer and fatter at the expense of the starving lower class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>.

### Imperialism and Military Themes

*   **British Imperialism**: The Pythons skewered the entire notion of British imperialism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>.
    *   A hand of God strikes down a military officer who insists Britain always needs an army to suppress differing ideologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>.
    *   A Sergeant Major drills his platoon on whether they have anything better to do than "march up and down the town square," revealing they do, like reading or going to the movies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>.
*   **War Depictions**: In their war depictions, soldiers celebrating a birthday are gunned down one by one, juxtaposing the brutal reality of war and "imperial conquest" against the simple pleasure of enjoying a birthday cake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>. For the Pythons, British imperialism was a threat to the meaning of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>.

### Bureaucracy and British Reserve

In *The Flying Circus* sketch show, bureaucrats are often portrayed as buffoons or "sticks-in-the-mud" who constantly censor the show itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>. Christopher Hitchens observed that [[monty_pythons_deconstruction_of_classical_narratives|Monty Python's]] "essential founding gag" was "the bubbling magma of absurdity that lay beneath the fragile crust of British reserve," where a seemingly ordinary man could become a "raging cross-dresser or barking sadist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>.

## Influence on Modern Satire

[[influence_of_monty_python_on_modern_comedy|Monty Python]] "paved the way" for comedy as we know it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Modern comedies like [[analysis_of_south_parks_approach_to_satire_and_internet_culture|South Park]], *Rick and Morty*, and *Deadpool* probably would not exist without them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. [[analysis_of_south_parks_approach_to_satire_and_internet_culture|South Park]]'s creators, Trey Parker and Matt Stone, often cite [[influence_of_monty_python_on_modern_comedy|Monty Python]] as the single biggest influence on their show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. Political satires, like [[social_satire_in_south_park|South Park]], derive humor by revealing hypocrisy in established rules and orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. Before [[analysis_of_south_parks_approach_to_satire_and_internet_culture|South Park]], [[influence_of_monty_python_on_modern_comedy|Monty Python]] subverted established political ideologies in England <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.

*Mob Psycho 100*, created by ONE, the Japanese manga artist behind *One-Punch Man*, explores the meaning of a fulfilling life through the unique challenges of an overpowered protagonist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Unlike Saitama from *One-Punch Man*, Shigeo Kageyama, known as Mob, manages to find satisfaction and peace with his abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. The series, particularly its first season, delves into philosophical concepts, especially drawing parallels with Edmund Burke's idea of the sublime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## The Problem of Overpowered Protagonists

Mob, a middle schooler, possesses near-godlike psychic powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. His mentor, Reigen Arataka, advises him never to use his powers against humans, warning that misusing such great power can lead to self-destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. Mob strives to live a normal life, repressing the rage that fuels his abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

In contrast, other superpowered individuals, known as 'espers', often use their abilities to bully or assert dominance, becoming profoundly egocentric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. They view themselves as "main characters" of an unfolding story, rather than regular people with limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. This entitlement, however, leads to deep dissatisfaction and misery, as the real world often fails to meet their exaggerated sense of self-worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. Mob observes that if their psychic powers were removed, these espers would be "empty," lacking any real substance or identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

## Edmund Burke and the Sublime

Mob's reluctance to rely solely on his powers and his desire for an earned, fulfilling existence aligns with the philosophy of Irish philosopher Edmund Burke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. Burke is renowned for his description of "the sublime," an experience of feeling infinitesimally small in the face of vast, uncontrollable forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. This experience, such as witnessing a mountain range or a thunderstorm, is meant to suspend or destroy egocentricity by utterly overwhelming one's own capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

Burke believed that experiences of the sublime are crucial for a healthy life. They compel individuals to use mental and spiritual capacities that might otherwise be ignored, specifically those that remind us we are not the center of the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. Avoiding challenging scenarios that facilitate the sublime can quickly lead to an unhealthy state, resulting in "Melancholy, dejection, despair, and often self-murder" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. This "relaxed state of body" from avoiding difficult "labour" weakens the mind, making it susceptible to such negative emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

## The Need for "Labour" and "Difficulties"

For Burke, the "best remedy" for these ailments is "exercise or labour," which is fundamentally about "surmounting of difficulties" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. He argued that both mind and body require "shaking and working to a proper degree" to function optimally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. This concept directly contrasts with the espers' approach in *Mob Psycho 100*, who avoid difficulties by relying on their psychic powers for social status and a false sense of self-worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

## Applying the Sublime in *Mob Psycho 100*

### Teru's Transformation

Teru, the "shadow leader" of a rival middle school gang, uses his powers to bully others, believing he deserves attention, respect, and power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. He exemplifies the egocentric esper, collapsing when Mob refuses to fight back, perceiving it as a "rejection" and an assault on his self-perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. Mob points out Teru's lack of self-confidence beneath his powerful facade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

Mob, through his overwhelming power, forces Teru into an experience of the sublime. During their fight, Mob's runaway psychic powers strip Teru naked, shave his hair, and hoist him into the sky, inducing terror—a key component of the sublime according to Burke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. This moment of utter helplessness, dwarfed by clouds and an endless vista, mirrors classical Romantic art influenced by Burke's ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. The realization that he is not the most powerful being brings Teru genuine peace: "I guess...I’m just an average person after all…" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

### Reigen and the "Scars"

Reigen similarly exposes the "Scars" (a group of powerful espers) to the sublime. He shatters their delusions of grandeur through Mob's transferred powers and his own rhetoric, reminding them that their powers don't make them special; they are still "commoners" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. By demonstrating their utter insignificance, Reigen puts them on a path toward a healthier, more mature mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. The show's theme song reinforces this: "If everyone is not special," then "Maybe you can be what you want to be…" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.

### Mob's Own Delusion

Even Mob, despite his humility, harbors a more benevolent delusion: that he must be in total control and is profoundly responsible for everything that happens, especially during his unconscious psychic episodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>. This leads him to repress his emotions, ironically giving him less control over his explosions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. The weight of this responsibility causes him immense pain and a feeling of powerlessness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.

It is Reigen, whom Mob respects, who provides Mob's experience of the sublime. By telling Mob it's "okay to run away" and that he doesn't always have to bear the world's weight, Reigen shatters Mob's delusion of ultimate responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. This "astonishes" Mob, allowing him to feel his own insignificance and temporarily transfer his powers to Reigen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>. This moment enables Mob to finally come to terms with his abilities and pursue a good life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>.

## Conclusion

Both *One-Punch Man* and *Mob Psycho 100* explore what constitutes a good life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>. Saitama's and Mob's struggles with their immense powers reveal that a fulfilling existence is not simply about getting whatever you want <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>. Instead, in the ONE-iverse, happiness stems from deliberate struggle and growth, echoing Burke's emphasis on confronting difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>. Mob's journey highlights that embracing limitations and experiencing the sublime—even as an overpowered being—is key to integrating into the world and finding true satisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

The *Rick and Morty* episode "The Vindicators 3: Return of the World Ender" serves as a direct jab at Marvel movies, with "The Vindicators" explicitly standing in for "The Avengers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Rick acts as a mouthpiece for audiences disillusioned with the formulaic nature of popular cinema <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

> "They’re the writers of their own press releases, Morty. They’re a bunch of drama queens who spend an hour talking and 20 minutes jumping around while shit blows up. They’re a phase. We did one. It was the big event of that summer. Let it die.” <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>

## Subversion of Superhero Archetypes

Superhero films are critiqued for their clumsy handling of concepts like good and evil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. "The Vindicators 3" comments on this in "clever, and even profound ways" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. The core arc of the episode involves Morty’s optimistic worldview crumbling, similar to other "Morty adventure" episodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. In this instance, Morty’s faith in the Vindicators erodes as the superhero genre itself is subverted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. This contributes to the broader [[criticism_of_superhero_archetypes | criticism of superhero archetypes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## Complexity of Good and Evil

Beyond superhero jokes, the episode delves into the complexities of good and evil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Rick plays a unique role in shattering Morty's worldview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. After effortlessly defeating the Worldender while blackout drunk, Rick traps the Vindicators in a series of "Saw-inspired" trials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. These trials are described as a "drunken scheme to push people over a moral cliff," leading to the Vindicators revealing their true, less heroic, natures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

### Influence of The Joker

The episode draws inspiration from unique villains in popular cinema, particularly Jigsaw and The Joker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. Like Jigsaw, Drunk Rick's trials are not primarily meant to kill the Vindicators but to create a moral crisis and prove to Morty they are not heroes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

A less obvious, but significant, inspiration is The Joker, particularly from Alan Moore’s *The Killing Joke* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. The Joker, like Jigsaw, is not motivated solely by murder; he aims to prove that "all it takes is a little push" for someone to descend into madness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. Similarly, Rick's "shenanigans" are designed to push the Vindicators to reveal their worst sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. Rick infects the Vindicators with his nihilistic philosophy, turning them into "violent backstabbers" and upending Morty's simplistic understanding of good and evil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

> "Oh, I don't know, you managed to destroy just about everything today, the villains, the heroes, the lines between them... my childhood." "Thank youuuuu" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>

## Critique of Simplistic Narratives of Good and Evil

The episode argues that the way narratives of good and evil are often presented is "super bad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. Philosopher Jacques Ranciere's ideas are introduced to explain that when conflict becomes "the ultimate struggle of Good and Evil," the value of winning becomes infinite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. This "all or nothing" mentality can justify horrific actions for the sake of victory, such as the Vindicators exterminating an entire planet because a shapeshifting villain was hiding there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

The problem with "infinite evil" is that it seems to warrant "infinite justice," which often disregards morals or the lives of innocent people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. By the episode's end, Supernova has also been infected with Rick’s nihilistic philosophy, no longer believing in a clear division between good and evil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. However, she believes the simplistic division *must* be upheld for the galaxy's security, even if it means killing Rick and Morty or her lover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.

### The "Noble Lie"

This concept is connected to *The Dark Knight*, which is seen as a prime example of moral greyness in a comic book movie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. Just as Batman lies about Harvey Dent to maintain peace in Gotham, Supernova wants the galaxy to believe a similar lie about the Vindicators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. Both advocate for a "noble lie," an idea from Plato where societies are built on a myth to maintain order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. While *The Dark Knight* "celebrates this lie," *Rick and Morty* uses it to deconstruct the myth of superheroes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

## Two Dismal Perspectives

The episode deconstructs good and evil as arbitrary concepts, but also suggests that the complete absence of these concepts is problematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. Rick's nihilistic philosophy, where "nothing matters," allows him to justify any action, leading to him doing "whatever the f*** he wants" without considering it evil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.

The episode presents two "completely dismal" perspectives on good and evil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>:
1.  **Zero conviction**: Leads to Rick doing whatever he wants without consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
2.  **Complete conviction**: Leads to people committing "really messed up shit for the sake of good," like blowing up an entire planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

Ultimately, in *Rick and Morty*, there are "no right answers. Only wrong ones" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

Unlike traditional sitcoms that often feature "will they or won't they" romantic tension stretched across multiple seasons, *It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia* actively subverts these tropes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:19:19">[11:19:19]</a>. The show, which follows a group of narcissistic sociopaths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:26">[00:26:26]</a> known as 'the gang' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:53">[00:53:53]</a>, pushes romance to its most dysfunctional limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:21:21">[11:21:21]</a>. For the gang, any romantic achievement serves as a stark reminder of their fundamental inability to achieve true happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:26:26">[14:26:26]</a>.

### Subverting Sitcom Romance
While classic sitcoms like *Scrubs* with JD and Elliot, *Friends* with Ross and Rachel, or *How I Met Your Mother* with Ted and Robin, relied on prolonged romantic sagas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:00:00">[11:00:00]</a>, *It's Always Sunny* takes a different approach. The show consistently refuses to allow its characters to experience typical personal development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a> or romantic fulfillment.

### The Gang's Romantic Exploits

#### Frank Reynolds
Following his divorce from Dennis and Dee’s mother, Frank indulges in "pay-for-play" romance through prostitutes and strippers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:28:28">[11:28:28]</a>. He also has a recurring relationship with Artemis, who shares his "proclivities towards ‘getting weird’" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:36:36">[11:36:36]</a>. Frank's character embodies a nihilistic greed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:02">[02:02:02]</a> and demonstrates an [[exploration_of_hedonism_and_disillusionment | exploration of hedonism and disillusionment]] as he spirals into depravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:02">[04:02:02]</a>.

#### Ronald "Mac" McDonald
Mac's romantic journey is characterized by his attempts to assert a masculine, heterosexual image, despite the gang's open acknowledgment of his homosexuality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:43:43">[11:43:43]</a>. This journey includes a relationship with a transitioning woman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:59:59">[11:59:59]</a> and a non-sexual, PCP-fueled fling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:04:04">[12:04:04]</a>. Mac finally admits to being gay in a recent season, but it's not a cathartic moment; he comes out for the sake of a $10,000 scratch-off ticket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:18:18">[12:18:18]</a>.

#### Deandra "Dee" Reynolds
Dee's romantic exploits are consistently portrayed as pathetic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:25:25">[12:25:25]</a>, largely consisting of hookups that end with her being mocked by the gang <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:30:30">[12:30:30]</a>. These partners include "jean shorts guy, the mentally retarded white rapper, Bill Ponderosa, and the old Korean man from the back of Mr. Kim’s restaurant" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:34:34">[12:34:34]</a>. Her one brief flirtation with sitcom romance, a hookup with Charlie in "The Gang Misses the Boat", is quickly acknowledged as a huge mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:44:44">[12:44:44]</a>.

#### Dennis Reynolds
Dennis is the only member of the gang to experience any romantic "success," though this is measured by his own horrifying system of seduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:53:53">[12:53:53]</a>. His slightly less pathetic, yet significantly more criminal, romantic life stems from his absence of emotion and inability to love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:05:05">[13:05:05]</a>. While the season twelve finale hinted at him possibly giving up his system for a family life, the show's logic suggests a low possibility of actual growth for Dennis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:14:14">[13:14:14]</a>.

#### Charlie Kelly
Charlie is the sole member of the gang to flirt with monogamy, defined as a fifteen-year obsession with a waitress who has multiple restraining orders against him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:21:21">[13:21:21]</a>. While other sitcoms might portray this obsession as "sweet," *It's Always Sunny* exposes the dark side of rom-com love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:31:31">[13:31:31]</a>. Charlie's stalking is a full-time job, leading him to write and produce a musical to propose to her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:37:37">[13:37:37]</a>. Though his efforts seem doomed, the show surprisingly allows them to get together in a recent season <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:45:45">[13:45:45]</a>. However, Charlie quickly becomes annoyed with the waitress hours after consummating over a decade of desire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:52:52">[13:52:52]</a>, even accusing her of stalking him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:02:02">[14:02:02]</a>. This brutally subverts standard sitcom logic, offering a realistic take on what happens when obsessions become reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:10:10">[14:10:10]</a>.

### No "Happily Ever After"
The show explicitly states that "At Paddy’s, there is no happily ever after" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:23:23">[14:23:23]</a>. *It's Always Sunny* has consciously spent twelve seasons exploring the gang's lives without any positive character development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:31">[03:31:31]</a>, including in their romantic lives. The series continues to avoid reliance on classical sitcom tropes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:32:32">[14:32:32]</a>, letting the gang stay the same rather than "selling out to network style tropes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:56:56">[14:56:56]</a>. This consistent portrayal reinforces the idea that their [[selfimposed_limitations_and_struggles_for_personal_growth | self-imposed limitations and struggles for personal growth]] prevent them from achieving genuine connection or happiness.

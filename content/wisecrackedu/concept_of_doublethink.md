The concept of "doublethink" is presented as the most impactful method of [[themes_of_totalitarianism_and_control | control]] employed by "The Party" and "Big Brother" in George Orwell's *1984* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. It signifies a state where an individual thinks in two contradictory ways simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

## Defining Doublethink

Doublethink involves two distinct mental processes:
1.  **Conscious Belief in Falsehood** A person makes a conscious decision to believe something that is undeniably false <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
2.  **Denial of the Lie's Existence** Simultaneously, the individual denies that the belief is even a lie in the first place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

The outcome of doublethink is a person who believes nonsense with the full conviction of it being true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. As stated in O'Brien's book, "Doublethink goes on forever. With the lie always one step ahead of the truth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

## Manipulation of Reality

While "Big Brother" is commonly associated with surveillance through informants and telescreens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>, the Party's manipulation of reality is equally significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. A [[themes_of_totalitarianism_and_control | totalitarian]] dictator, rather than merely destroying the truth like Hitler, who burned books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>, must reconstruct it, similar to Stalin, who rewrote books to align with his agenda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. Orwell's Oceania reflects Stalin's methods of controlling his populace, which were more effective than Hitler's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

Through this constant recreation of reality, individual qualities are systematically eradicated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. A person's very existence and sense of self become entirely dependent on what the government dictates they are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

## A Universal Warning

*1984* is not solely a critique of Stalinism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. It serves as a broader warning to all of humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. Orwell suggests that if society does not alter its course, humanity risks becoming "soulless robots" without even realizing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

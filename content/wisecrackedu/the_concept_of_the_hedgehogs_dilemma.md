*Neon Genesis Evangelion* is a complex story that, beneath its surface narrative of giant biomechanical monsters fighting alien-angel-robot entities, delves into human psychology, motivation, and the inherent difficulty of being a person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. At its core, the series explores the profound philosophical concept known as the Hedgehog's Dilemma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Origin and Definition

The Hedgehog's Dilemma is a short parable detailed by the preeminent philosophical pessimist Arthur Schopenhauer in his book, *Parega and Paralipomena: Short Philosophical Essays. Volume 2* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. Schopenhauer explains the human condition by comparing humans to hedgehogs huddled together for warmth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. While hedgehogs crave warmth, they cannot get too close due to their quills, which would injure each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. Consequently, they either keep their distance and remain cold, or they learn to live without the warmth of others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

## The Dilemma in *Neon Genesis Evangelion*

The Hedgehog's Dilemma serves as a guiding theme throughout *Neon Genesis Evangelion* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. In episode three, Ritsuko explicitly explains the parable to Mitsado, stating, "Even though a headgehog may wanna become close with another hedgehog, the closer they get the more they injure each other with their spines. It's the same with some humans" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. Episode four of the series is even titled "The Hedgehog’s Dilemma" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

The desire to avoid being hurt drives a wedge between people, creating a world of despair within the series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. The world, already a sad place after losing half its population in the Second Impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>, further reflects this isolation through its characters' miserable lives and intimacy problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

## Philosophical Underpinnings

The themes of suffering and loneliness explored through the Hedgehog's Dilemma are further reinforced by other philosophical ideas:

### Schopenhauer's Will and Representation
In *The World as Will and Representation*, Schopenhauer argues that life is suffering because the world consists of will and representation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. For Schopenhauer, reality's true nature is unity, and peace would be achieved without the struggle to communicate between individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. Suffering results from individuality; the struggle to connect, perceive, and understand perfectly is the source of human pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. Each individual's will or ego can only perceive the world from its own vantage point, leading to anguish, fragmentation, alienation, and isolation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. This disconnect between desire and reality is echoed by Kaworu, who states, "This is mankind's fate. The thread of human hope is spun with the flax of sorrow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.

### AT-Fields as Ego Boundaries
The show represents this separation of wills as "AT-fields," which symbolize the unique human soul or life force that separates each person's ego <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. These AT-fields act as a barrier preventing true connection between individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. Characters often reflect on what it means to have an ego and a body, particularly when their consciousness is slipping away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. The fear of lacking something basic and the desire to become one with others to fill this void is explicitly discussed as the purpose of "instrumentality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.

### Kierkegaard's Despair
The world of *Evangelion* is deeply depressing, filled with depressed people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. Episode sixteen, "Sickness Unto Death," directly references Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard's concept of despair, which he defined as a terrible existential loneliness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. This aligns neatly with Schopenhauer's hedgehogs and the pervasive sense of isolation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

## Character Manifestations of The Dilemma

The characters in *Evangelion* vividly demonstrate the Hedgehog's Dilemma:
*   **Asuka**: She pilots her Eva to find meaning and fears being alone, using her role to draw people toward her and expand her world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. She remarks, "Everybody’s so nice to me now! I don’t feel lonely anymore!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
*   **Gendo**: Shinji's father, Gendo struggles with showing love and doesn't know how to be a father <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. He admits, "When Shinji is near me, all I ever do is cause him pain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>, and later reveals, "I never deserved to be loved" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>, having rejected the world to avoid pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.
*   **Shinji**: Shinji embodies the dilemma through his ambivalence—a Freudian idea of passionately hating and loving at the same time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. He constantly expresses hatred for his father <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>, yet repeatedly pilots the Eva to gain his father's praise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>. Despite running away from his responsibilities, he keeps returning, trapped in the oscillation of wanting connection but fearing the pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>.

## Seeking a Solution: Acceptance over Escape

The struggle with isolation and the pain of rejection defines *Evangelion* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. The human reaction to the Hedgehog's Dilemma is often to seek tranquility by returning to a primordial state, like the womb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>. This desire to join a unified whole, where individuality and issues of self no longer exist, is tied to Freud's concept of the Death Drive—a desire to return to the peace and harmony of the womb, or the end of everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>. Instrumentality, the process of combining all human consciousness into LCL, represents this ultimate return to a state of beginning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>.

However, the series presents an alternative through Kaworu, a non-human character, who demonstrates the path of accepting vulnerability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>. Kaworu gives up his individual desires for Shinji's life, showing unguarded love and advising that while keeping others at a distance prevents betrayal, it also leads to enduring loneliness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>. He asserts that humans are fundamentally alone, and pain is something that must be endured in the heart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>.

Ultimately, Shinji, after initially accepting instrumentality, has a change of heart when he realizes he would lose himself in the unified consciousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>. He recognizes that "you cannot see yourself without the presence of others" and that being alone in an empty world would render his existence meaningless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>.

Shinji rejects instrumentality, asserting, "I am me. I want to be myself. I want to continue existing in this world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>. He chooses a world where people can be hurt, where separation and individual selves exist, and where pain is inevitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>. By confronting the drive to inorganic existence and accepting suffering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>, he opens the door for hope and joy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:36">[00:19:36]</a>. His final act of choking Asuka, followed by her gentle touch, symbolizes that the chosen world encompasses both violence and pain, as well as love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a>.

The Hedgehog's Dilemma, in *Neon Genesis Evangelion*, highlights the inherent human "lack"—the missing piece between representation and the world in itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>. The series consistently weaves a plot that delves deep into the visceral reality of humanity’s disappointing existence, ultimately suggesting that true existence lies in embracing individuality and the pain that comes with it, rather than seeking solace in a unified, pain-free non-existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:18">[00:20:18]</a>.

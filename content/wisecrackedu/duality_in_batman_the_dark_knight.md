*The Dark Knight*, co-written by Jonathan Nolan and directed by his brother, Christopher Nolan, tells the story of Bruce Wayne, who uses his wealth to become Batman [00:00:12]. The film is deeply permeated by themes of duality [00:01:28].

## Characters as Dualities

### Batman and Harvey Dent
Batman, also known as the Dark Knight, desires a world where he can be replaced by [[symbolism_of_harvey_dent_in_the_dark_knight | Harvey Dent]], envisioned as the White Knight [00:01:30]. This aspiration highlights Batman's hope for Gotham to no longer need his shadowed vigilante persona [00:01:30].

### Harvey Dent / Two-Face
[[symbolism_of_harvey_dent_in_the_dark_knight | Harvey Dent]] undergoes a significant transformation, embodying duality after becoming Two-Face [00:01:37]. This is physically represented by the two sides of his face and the two sides of his coin [00:01:40]. His double-sided coin initially represents his rigid adherence to justice, morality, and order, leaving nothing to chance [00:03:22]. However, after his transformation, one side of the coin becomes scarred, making it a regular 50/50 coin [00:03:36]. This change signifies that Dent has been infected by [[the_jokers_relationship_with_batman | the Joker's]] vision, where reality is ruled by cosmic anarchy and "the only morality in a cruel world is chance" [00:03:45].

## Ideological Dualities

### [[chaos_versus_order_in_the_dark_knight | Order versus Chaos]]
A central duality explored in the film is [[chaos_versus_order_in_the_dark_knight | order versus chaos]] [00:01:49]. [[the_jokers_relationship_with_batman | The Joker]] aims to expose that beneath the facade of an orderly society lies existential anarchy [00:01:54]. As a nihilist, [[the_jokers_relationship_with_batman | the Joker]] believes in nothing, not even the concept of nihilism itself [00:02:04]. His actions, though seemingly random, are deliberate attempts to prove that [[the_concept_of_justice_and_morality_in_the_dark_knight | morality is a sham]] [00:02:41]. He seeks to demonstrate that if people's physical comforts or safety are removed, they will revert to wild animals [00:02:45]. [[the_jokers_relationship_with_batman | The Joker]] exploits humanity's innate lawlessness [00:02:53], orchestrating scenarios where individuals betray each other for gain or turn to violence [00:02:58].

## Justice and Morality

### The Nature of Justice
At the beginning of the film, [[symbolism_of_harvey_dent_in_the_dark_knight | Harvey Dent]] is portrayed as a Christ figure, with his campaign slogan "I believe in [[symbolism_of_harvey_dent_in_the_dark_knight | Harvey Dent]]" carrying religious connotations [00:03:53]. However, *The Dark Knight* presents a modern interpretation of this image: a Christ without resurrection [00:04:05]. [[symbolism_of_harvey_dent_in_the_dark_knight | Dent]] becomes a false ideal that must be upheld as a beacon of hope for humanity [00:04:14].

Batman takes on the burden of maintaining this facade, thereby preserving order [00:04:20]. While [[symbolism_of_harvey_dent_in_the_dark_knight | Dent]] represents order through idealism, Batman embodies order through force [00:04:27]. He is depicted as a "necessary evil" to control the beastly side of mankind [00:04:34]. The ferry scene in the film illustrates that democratic methods are insufficient; a vote would lead to an amoral outcome, highlighting the need for tyrannical power to uphold [[the_concept_of_justice_and_morality_in_the_dark_knight | justice]] [00:04:37]. Batman's creation of a sonar machine, which is a significant violation of privacy, is justified by Alfred Pennyworth as a necessary, morally questionable action to achieve a greater good [00:04:54].

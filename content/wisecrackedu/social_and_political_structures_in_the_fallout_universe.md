The *Fallout* series, set in a post-apocalyptic [[alternate_history_and_societal_commentary_in_the_fallout_series | alternate reality]] of the 23rd century, offers a rich landscape for philosophical analysis of society and governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. The world was devastated in 2077 by a global nuclear conflict, born from dwindling oil supplies in the 2050s and a persistent Cold War mentality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. This catastrophic event plunged the world into a new dark age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## Pre-War Society and Propaganda

The pre-war *Fallout* society, technologically advanced but with a different development path (atomic power proliferated without the transistor's influence) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>, was deeply influenced by the culture of the 1950s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. This era was characterized by an extreme optimism about atomic energy and technological progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>, even alongside giant anti-communist death robots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

### The Vaults and Cognitive Dissonance

The Vaults, designed as shelters from nuclear annihilation, exemplify the human capacity for cognitive dissonance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Despite the grim reality of being locked underground indefinitely, they were advertised as exciting social opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. This concept echoes real-life luxury bomb shelters of the Cold War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

Philosopher Herbert Marcuse, during the Cold War, described how pleasant appearances could be "plastered over modern day nightmares" to destroy criticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. He argued that capitalism's marketing prowess makes even horrific realities seem "dandy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>, citing "deluxe fallout shelters" as an "obscene merger" between luxury and a terrible situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

### Humor and [[critique_of_government_and_propaganda_in_a_dystopian_setting | Propaganda Critique]]

The humor in *Fallout* stems from the constant juxtaposition of a quaint, cheerful 1950s culture with the hellish Wasteland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. This is seen in radio stations playing chipper jazz tunes while players fight irradiated remnants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>, or the ironic use of "I Don't Want to Set the World on Fire" over images of a burnt Washington D.C. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. These "marriages between positive and negative" serve as a [[critique_of_government_and_propaganda_in_a_dystopian_setting | criticism of government propaganda]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

Marcuse's concept of "one-dimensional thought" suggests that society is told [[technology_and_its_moral_dilemmas_in_fallout | technology]] is always good, allowing no room for "negative thought" or ideas that undermine this positivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

## Post-War Political Structures and Ideologies

The Wasteland sees the emergence of various forms of governance, from cruel tyranny to liberal democracies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

### The Enclave: Autocracy and Control

The Enclave, remnants of the United States government, aims to purge the Wasteland's inhabitants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. Their president, John Henry Eden, is a computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. Eden understands the importance of "fun and leisure" in maintaining an obedient society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>, praising baseball as a symbol of the American dream to distract the populace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. This reflects a society distracted by comforts, which the narrative suggests contributed to the pre-war collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.

### Brotherhood of Steel: [[technology_and_its_moral_dilemmas_in_fallout | Technological Control]]

The Brotherhood of Steel, a secretive order, hoards advanced [[technology_and_its_moral_dilemmas_in_fallout | technology]] in heavily armored bases to prevent it from falling into "wrong hands" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. They go to war with factions possessing advanced tech, believing no one else can be trusted with it <a class="yt_timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

### Caesar's Legion: Totalitarianism and Anti-[[technology_and_its_moral_dilemmas_in_fallout | Technology]]

Caesar's Legion is a brutal, totalitarian state that largely forswears [[technology_and_its_moral_dilemmas_in_fallout | technology]] (except for combat enhancement), believing it makes people weak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. Despite this, the Legion still manages to inflict immense suffering, demonstrating that brutality doesn't require advanced [[technology_and_its_moral_dilemmas_in_fallout | technology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

### International Relations and Hegemony

*Fallout* explores modern theories of international relations. Caesar, aiming to unite humanity under his banner as slaves and Roman cosplayers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>, embodies the "hegemonic stability theory." This theory posits that peace is achieved when a single superpower (like Caesar's Legion) instills fear, causing others to behave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. Traders in Legion territory experience greater safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.

Alternatively, a "balance of power" can make war too costly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. The New California Republic (NCR) avoids invading New Vegas due to the high cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. The Boomers, like a post-apocalyptic Switzerland, maintain neutrality by aggressively defending their borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.

The "realist" model suggests each faction acts solely for self-preservation, viewing power as a zero-sum game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. Alliances are fleeting, forming only to combat more powerful threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>. This model highlights how wars are often fought over control and precludes true trust among factions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.

## Moral Dilemmas and Security Logic

The game constantly presents players with moral dilemmas, forcing choices about [[technology_and_its_moral_dilemmas_in_fallout | technology's]] use, political approaches, and the lengths to which one will go for security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.

Daniel Callahan's "security logic" argues there's no limit to the terrible actions humans might take in the name of survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. This is exemplified by the Enclave's willingness to exterminate "mutated riff raff" to save "real" humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. Similarly, Mr. House in New Vegas creates a despotic, orderly, and cold society by explicitly rejecting personal freedoms and democracy in favor of his "technological and economic visionary" control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.

> "If you want to see the fate of democracies, look out the windows. But autocracy? Firm control in the hands of a technological and economic visionary? Yes, that Vegas shall have." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>

This echoes historical patterns where crises are manufactured or exaggerated to justify repressive laws and increased state control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>.

## Conclusion: "War Never Changes"

The *Fallout* series' constant interrogation of human society and government reinforces the refrain that "War never changes," which could also imply "humanity never changes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. The most terrifying aspects of the Wasteland are often just a "rehashing of our own regrettable history" – slavery-obsessed Romans, Orwellian [[dictatorship_and_politics_in_postapocalyptic_settings | dictatorships]], and genocidal governments – suggesting that history is prone to repeating itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>.

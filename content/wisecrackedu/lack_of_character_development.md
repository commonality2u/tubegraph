From: [[wisecrackedu]] <br/> 

*It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia* distinguishes itself from traditional sitcoms by actively subverting common tropes, particularly regarding [[character_development_in_rick_and_morty | character development]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. While classic sitcoms often depict broken individuals evolving into "loveable grown-ups," *It's Always Sunny* focuses on a group of narcissistic sociopaths who believe personal development is "for quitters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. This deliberate avoidance of growth makes it the "perfect anti-sitcom" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## The Gang's Stagnation

Throughout its twelve seasons, "the gang"—Charlie, Mac, Dennis, Dee, and Frank—show minimal positive [[character_development_in_rick_and_morty | character development]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. Their personalities remain shaped by a mix of functional alcoholism, narcissistic personality disorder, and occasional crack binges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

*   **Frank's Descent**
    When Frank first joins the gang, he is a recent divorcee attempting to reconnect with his children and donate his wealth to charity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. However, within hours, he pretends to be a wheelchair-bound quadriplegic to get attention from strippers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. Frank quickly spirals into "the depths of depravity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
*   **Dee's Pregnancy Ploy**
    In season six, Dee's fake pregnancy leads the gang to briefly reconsider their lives, with Dennis showing genuine care and Charlie and Mac contemplating raising a child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. However, this period of potential growth quickly ends when Dee reveals none of them are the father <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. The show subverts the traditional trope of a baby magically changing people, ensuring the gang remains unchanged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.
*   **Mac's Physical "Growth"**
    By season seven, the show humorously addresses its lack of emotional [[character_development_in_rick_and_morty | growth]] by focusing on Mac's physical "growth" (gaining significant weight) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. This also satirizes the sitcom model where characters maintain the same appearance despite aging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. Instead of remaining an "ageless sitcom trope," Mac "eats his way to disease" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.
*   **Acknowledging Stagnation**
    The season ten episode "The Gang Misses the Boat" explicitly confronts this lack of [[character_development_in_rick_and_morty | development]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. The gang's failure to attend an exclusive boat party prompts them to reflect on how they've missed out in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

## Negative Impact on Others

The gang's inability to grow not only defines their own lives but also leads to dire consequences for their friends and associates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. Anyone who flirts with the gang is "irrevocably changed for the worse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

*   **Rickety Cricket:** Transforms from a handsome young priest to homeless, disfigured, and a "Paddy’s bathroom regular" due to the gang's exploitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.
*   **Bill Ponderosa:** His affair with Dee sets him on a downward spiral, leading him to ask Frank to let him drink himself to death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. Even his son becomes a goth cocaine dealer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.
*   **The Lawyer:** Even a character who typically outsmarts the gang ends up having his right eyeball devoured by a bird, becoming a "Cyclops" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.

## Subverting Sitcom Tropes

*It's Always Sunny* consistently subverts common sitcom tropes, reinforcing its theme of [[character_development_and_anticharacter_development_in_rick_and_ Morty | anti-character development]].

### Morality and Ethics

Unlike sitcoms that often incorporate moral messages, *It's Always Sunny* portrays a gang with a "collective moral code" akin to Bernie Madoff's financial principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. Any appearance of morality usually serves "nefarious ends" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

*   **Abortion Issue:** Mac's pro-life crusade in season one is primarily a means to "get laid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.
*   **Dennis's Search for Meaning:** Dennis's search for meaning, seemingly born from a "God-shaped hole in his heart," culminates in a bogus eulogy at Dee's baby's funeral (which was actually for a dead dog) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. He accepts his "moral nihilism and lack of emotion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.
*   **Exploitation:** The gang consistently robs pertinent ethical issues of any "inherent goodness," such as exploiting welfare by becoming crack addicts, using a basketball coaching job to teach physical assault, or getting Mac's dad killed for their own gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.
*   **Christian Cruise:** On a "gay-friendly congregation" cruise, the gang commits various offenses: Dee breaks a woman's nose, Frank and Charlie get drunk on boat fuel, Dennis attempts to sexually entrap a girl, and Mac, upon realizing the hosts are gay, begs God for lightning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. Their "reckoning with God" turns out to be a meeting with insurance adjusters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.

### Romantic Relationships

The show pushes romantic tension to the "limits of dysfunction," contrasting with the classic "will they or won't they" trope of other sitcoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.

*   **Frank's Exploits:** Frank indulges in "pay-for-play romance" with prostitutes and strippers and has a recurring "getting weird" romance with Artemis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.
*   **Mac's Sexual Identity:** Mac's romantic journey involves attempts to assert his masculine heterosexual image against the gang's awareness of his homosexuality, including a relationship with a transitioning woman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>. He finally admits to being gay in a recent season, but only for a $10,000 scratch-off ticket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.
*   **Dee's Pathetic Hook-ups:** Dee's romantic exploits are largely a series of hook-ups that end with her being mocked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>. Her one flirtation with sitcom romance, hooking up with Charlie in "The Gang Misses the Boat," is quickly acknowledged as a "huge mistake" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.
*   **Dennis's "System":** Dennis experiences romantic "success" only through his "horrifying system of seduction," largely due to his "absence of emotion and inability to love" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.
*   **Charlie's Obsession:** Charlie's "monogamy" is a fifteen-year obsession with a waitress who has multiple restraining orders against him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. While a traditional sitcom would make this "sweet," *It's Always Sunny* shows the "darkside of rom-com love" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. Even when the "will they/won't they" trope seems fulfilled with them finally getting together, Charlie quickly becomes annoyed with her, brutally subverting standard sitcom logic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>.

## Conclusion: No Happily Ever After

Even when season twelve presents moments that seem to suggest the gang might finally "grow up," the show resists this traditional sitcom trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>. *It's Always Sunny* remains committed to critiquing the outside world while ensuring "the gang stay the same" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>. For the gang, any romantic or personal achievement is simply a reminder of their "fundamental lack of ability to ever be truly happy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>. The "logic of the Paddy’s universe seems to indicate a low possibility of actual [[character_development_in_rick_and_morty | growth]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>.

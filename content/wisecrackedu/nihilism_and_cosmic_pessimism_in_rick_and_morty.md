*Rick and Morty* is an acclaimed animated series that delves into profound philosophical and scientific concepts, often masked by humor and "dick jokes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The show follows the adventures of Rick, a mad scientist, and his grandson Morty, traveling through alternate dimensions rather than time, in a dynamic similar to *Back to the Future* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## [[Cosmic horror influences on Rick and Morty|Cosmic Horror]] and Insignificance

*Rick and Morty* is deeply rooted in the traditions of sci-fi horror, paying homage to works like *Ghostbusters*, David Cronenberg's films, *Nosferatu*, and Freddy Krueger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The show has a particular affinity for [[Cosmic horror influences on Rick and Morty|cosmic horror]], a genre pioneered by H.P. Lovecraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This genre emphasizes the terror of that which is beyond human comprehension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

Like Lovecraft, *Rick and Morty* uses the cosmos to explore deep [[Philosophy and existentialism in Rick and Morty|philosophical questions]] by imagining what lurks in the "black depths of space" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The show's opening even includes a visual reference to Lovecraft's Cthulhu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. [[Cosmic horror influences on Rick and Morty|Cosmic horror]] goes beyond cheap jump-scares, presenting the vast, unimaginable unknown and the dread felt when incomprehensible entities crash into reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Rick's portal gun constantly confronts viewers with this unknown, leading to horrifying, hilarious, or both, results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

In the episode "Get Schwifty," Earth faces a giant space-head (a Cromulon) that demands a hit song to avoid disintegration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This scenario directly relates to Lovecraft's "Great Old Ones" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This concept raises the question: Are we significant? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While most sci-fi places humanity at the center, [[Cosmic horror influences on Rick and Morty|cosmic horror]] inverts this, asking: "What if the universe doesn’t give a shit about us?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> For the Cromulons, humanity is mere entertainment; annihilating a planet is an indifferent act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These giant entities emphasize humanity's insignificance, a terrifying yet often darkly hilarious aspect of *Rick and Morty* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

Contemporary American philosopher Eugene Thacker, in his book "In the Dust of This Planet," describes this "Cosmic Pessimism" as prevalent in the horror genre, imagining a "world-without-us" that is "absolutely unhuman, and indifferent to the hopes, desires and struggles of human individuals and groups" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The show embodies this [[Cosmic nihilism and its depiction in Rick and Morty|cosmic pessimism]] almost perfectly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Even Rick and Morty themselves can die, only to be replaced by infinite other versions of themselves from alternate realities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This illustrates not only that humans are specks of dust in the cosmos but also that they are one of an infinite number of the exact same specks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. *Rick and Morty* encourages viewers to laugh at their own insignificance rather than be terrified by it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

In "The Ricks Must Be Crazy," it's revealed that Rick's car battery is powered by a micro-universe whose sole purpose is to produce energy, and within that universe, another mini-universe is invented, creating an endless chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Rick effectively becomes a cosmic deity to the denizens of these micro-verses, akin to Lovecraft's entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. In such a multiverse with infinite possibilities, "values and meanings start to slip away," leaving only pessimism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## [[Nihilism and existential themes in Rick and Morty|Existentialism]] and [[The concept of meaninglessness in Rick and Morty|Meaninglessness]]

*Rick and Morty* frequently addresses the question of existence, highlighting both the cosmic insignificance of humanity and the frivolity of individual human life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The show presents two contrasting responses to this "pathetic existence" through Rick and Jerry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

Jerry, oblivious to his own "soul-crushing mediocrity and pointlessness," appears content even in a poor simulation of reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. He is portrayed as a failure, but his ignorance allows him a certain contentment, toiling away for the sake of nothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. In contrast, Rick understands and accepts the [[The concept of meaninglessness in Rick and Morty|meaninglessness of life]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Despite his sarcastic and nonchalant attitude towards pain, Rick is an alcoholic whose catchphrase, "Wubba Lubba Dub Dub," translates to "I am in great pain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

The show suggests a paradox: while science provides formulas and theorems to make sense of the universe, humans are left confronting the bleak, arbitrary nature of their own existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Science can strip away sanctity and emotion, rendering the human experience meaningless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Rick, for instance, mathematically explains that Summer and Morty are "pieces of shit" and rationalizes his bond with Morty as merely a way to hide his genius brain waves from intergalactic authorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

In an episode where Morty experiences an entire life within the "Roy" video game, he briefly forgets his own existence upon losing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This forces the audience to question the difference between the "fake" reality of the game and Morty's "actual" life, especially since he experienced genuine emotions and sensations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. *Rick and Morty* constantly blurs the line between meaningless simulations and actual life, challenging the notion that our "waking life" inherently holds more meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The show highlights a "crisis of values," exemplified by the moral dilemma of killing memory parasites (who the family feels genuine emotion for) versus shooting Mr. Poopybutthole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## [[Nietzschean philosophy and its application in Rick and Morty|Nietzschean Philosophy]] and [[Nihilism and existential themes in Rick and Morty|Nihilism]]

The show's crisis of values and meaning in life echoes the ideas of [[Nietzschean philosophy and its application in Rick and Morty|Friedrich Nietzsche]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Nietzsche's parable of the madman screaming "God is dead!...And we have killed him!" signifies that after the Enlightenment and scientific revolution, a higher being no longer provides value to human lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This "death of God" in philosophy leads to [[nihilism_and_existential_themes_in_rick_and_morty|nihilism]], a "void of meaning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

Rick Sanchez's character is defined by this struggle against the lack of meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. He uses science to demystify everything, reducing love to chemical reactions and even defeating the devil, metaphorically enacting the "death of God" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The show constantly prompts the question: what does Rick care about, if anything? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

Rick's character embodies a tension between "active and passive [[nihilism_and_existential_themes_in_rick_and_morty|nihilism]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. A passive [[nihilism_and_existential_themes_in_rick_and_morty|nihilist]] is resigned to life's hopelessness, while an active [[nihilism_and_existential_themes_in_rick_and_morty|nihilist]] seeks to destroy old values to create new ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Though Rick is an intergalactic terrorist and sacrifices himself to save his family, his motivations remain unclear, suggesting he, too, struggles to find meaning in the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

The show also interrogates morality, refusing to draw clear lines between right and wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Morty's attempts to do good often have grim consequences, such as when freeing people from the body-snatching Unity leads to a "nipple-driven race war" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Summer's observation, "I didn’t know freedom meant people doing stuff that sucks," highlights another existential question: what is biological life without "living?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> The show suggests that an "irrational attachment to freedom" might allow people to live in a "terribly fucked up" world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Albert Camus and Absurdism

Another lens through which to view the existential questions in *Rick and Morty* is the work of Albert Camus, particularly in the episode "Meeseeks and Destroy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Camus' "absurdism" posits that life consists of two irreconcilable facets: humanity's tendency to find meaning and the universe's complete indifference to its existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

The Meeseeks illustrate the opposite of this human struggle: "Meeseeks are not born into this world fumbling for meaning, Jerry! We are created to serve a singular purpose for which we will go to any lengths to fulfill!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> Human life, for Camus, is like the myth of Sisyphus, eternally pushing a boulder up a hill only for it to fall back down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. For Jerry, this translates to his endlessly frustrating golf swing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

Many characters in the show, instead of seeking meaning, resent their creators, a "Frankenstein-complex" seen in the Meeseeks, Abradolf Lincler, Morty Jr., and Frankenstein's monster himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Camus suggests that instead of being perpetually frustrated by the inability to find purpose, one should embrace the emptiness of the absurd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This sentiment is echoed by Rick, who says, "The answer is: Don't think about it," and by Morty: "Nobody exists on purpose. Nobody belongs anywhere. Everybody's gonna die. Come watch TV?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>

## Science as a Tool for Demystification and Humor

The fictional and "almost-real" science in *Rick and Morty* serves to explore how, despite admiration for Rick, human lives can be as "sad and pathetic as Jerry’s" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Science in the show also provides an excuse for "nerdy jokes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

Examples include:
*   An episode loosely based on the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which states it's impossible to know both a particle's location and momentum, leading to humor from a superficial reading that quantum uncertainty can split realities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.
*   A sea of Schrödinger's cats floating around outside, referencing the 1935 thought experiment about a cat being simultaneously alive and dead in a quantum world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

This "tenuous relationship to scientific truth" can be seen as a jab at the sci-fi genre's tendency to invent "scientific mumbo-jumbo" to justify unlikely plot points, such as brainwaves canceling each other out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The show also pokes fun at the trust placed in TV narratives through jokes about forced perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

Furthermore, *Rick and Morty* exhibits a unique atheism, consistently invalidating religious figures by reducing them to pure science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It also acknowledges the misuse of science by those with religious agendas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. In "Something Ricked This Way Comes," Jerry's "personal" interpretation of science leads him to crusade for Pluto's planet-hood, encountering Plutonians with cross-shaped eyes, drawing a comparison to religious fundamentalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This, however, is revealed to be a ploy by corporate overlords to manipulate the Plutonians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

*Rick and Morty* is a show that holds nothing sacred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. By exploring the absurdities of a purely rational universe and pushing the boundaries of decency within a sci-fi horror setting, it prompts viewers to ask fundamental, often depressing questions like, "Why am I here?" and "What’s the point of it all?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> The show leaves the audience contemplating Rick's character, wondering if his actions will ever serve a greater good, or if they are just another "bleak self-serving ploy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

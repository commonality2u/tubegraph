*Django Unchained*, a film by [[quentin_tarantinos_filmography_and_style | Quentin Tarantino]], goes beyond typical [[quentin_tarantinos_filmography_and_style | Tarantino hallmarks]] to offer a clever and nuanced criticism of slavery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. While the film delivers on the expectation of action—such as a former slave burning down a Southern plantation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>—it also provides subtle commentary through its use of language and culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

The film follows Django, a captured runaway slave rescued by German bounty hunter King Schultz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Schultz teaches Django his trade before accompanying him on a mission to rescue his wife, Broomhilde, from the vile plantation owner Calvin Candie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

## Language and Civilization: A Subversion of Racism

### The Racist Binary of Language
In the worldview of white slavers like Big Daddy and Calvin Candie, white bodies symbolize culture and civilization, while black bodies are perceived as uncivilized and incapable of proper language use or cultural appreciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

King Schultz challenges this racist binary. His eloquent German accent and mastery of English, spoken as a second language, confound the native-speaking slavers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. He frequently uses complex vocabulary and rhetorical skills that leave the "simpletons of the American South" bewildered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. Schultz, an "emblem of the mythical European civilization," serves as a constant reminder that these "self-styled men of culture" are, in fact, "full of shit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

Historically, the idea that slaves were incapable of proper language traces back to Aristotle, who distinguished humans from animals based on "logos" (speech and reason) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. He argued that slaves could only receive "logos" but not possess it, thus justifying slavery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. *Django Unchained* directly [[django_unchaineds_commentary_on_slavery_and_racism | flips this dichotomy]] by showcasing incoherent slavers alongside clearly intelligible enslaved characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

### Respectful Language vs. Demanded Submission
The film contrasts how Schultz treats enslaved people with how other white characters do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. Schultz uses the honorific "Fraulein" when addressing Broomhilde, unlike the prevalent use of racial slurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. Conversely, Calvin Candie demands the French honorific "Monsieur" as a sign of mandatory submission, despite not speaking French himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. Schultz uses titles as a form of voluntary respect, while Candie uses them to enforce submission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

### Cultural Symbols: Beer and Beethoven
The use of beer in the film further illustrates these contrasting values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. When Schultz buys Django a beer, it symbolizes a transition from a master-slave relationship to one of shared humanity and camaraderie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. In contrast, Candie offering beer to his victorious fighter after a brutal match serves as a "sick sort of reward" for an enslaved man forced to murder another for entertainment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. One represents shared humanity, the other "cold-blooded savagery" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

A peak moment of contrast occurs when Schultz, a cultured European, reaches his boiling point after witnessing the brutal practice of "Mandingo fighting." When a woman begins playing Beethoven on the harp, Schultz can no longer tolerate his culture being [[symbolic_subversion_and_cultural_appropriation_in_django_unchained | appropriated]] by "savages" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

### The Bible and Hypocrisy
The film also highlights how the Christian Bible, meant to signify proper European religion, was used to justify slavery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. On Big Daddy's plantation, one of the Brittle brothers quotes Genesis 9:2 while preparing to whip a slave, justifying his actions by equating slaves to animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. Django shoots him, literally putting a bullet through the page of the Bible pinned to his shirt, exposing the "bloody hypocrisy of using Christianity to justify savagery" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.

## [[symbolic_subversion_and_cultural_appropriation_in_django_unchained | Symbolic Subversion]] and Cultural Icons

### Fashion as Resistance
*Django Unchained* uses fashion, music, and iconography to [[django_unchaineds_commentary_on_slavery_and_racism | flip the logic of slavery]] on its head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. An analogy is drawn to Joseph Cinque, leader of the Amistad Rebellion, who was depicted in media in the style of the noble culture that enslaved him, an act historian Marcus Rediker described as "egalitarian" and "subversive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

Similarly, Django's "makeover" into a "three musketeers" outfit is deliberately abrasive to those who would reserve such attire for a white, civilized man <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. This, along with Django's horseback riding—an activity associated with the well-to-do—draws ire and surprise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. Django's aesthetic choices embody José Esteban Muñoz's concept of "disidentification," a strategy that "mangles symbols from within" a dominant ideology rather than escaping or assimilating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. Django does not adopt the attire of a Southern aristocrat to become one, but to "abuse the very notion of the Southern Gentleman" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

### Music as Commentary
The film's soundtrack employs rap music, which initially seems out of sync with a mid-19th-century Western <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. However, this choice is significant, as rap music has historically been used by those facing racial and economic inequality to "fight the powers that be," especially systemic white supremacy rooted in American slavery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. Songs like "100 Black Coffins" by Rick Ross and Jamie Foxx, with lyrics about revenge, perfectly align with Django's journey of seeking power and vengeance under oppression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.

Schultz also uses Richard Wagner's opera, "Twilight of the Gods," to frame Django's quest to save Broomhilde, portraying Django as a "Siegfried" figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>. This links Django to a Nietzschean "ubermensch" who responds to nihilistic values of slavery and white supremacy by powerfully creating new ones, culminating in the fiery destruction of Candyland as a metaphorical call for the destruction of slavery itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>. Given *[[the_role_of_film_in_inglourious_basterds | Tarantino's]]* awareness of Wagner's "Ring Cycle" being appropriated by German nationalism, using this narrative to dismantle white supremacy is a deliberate, powerful inversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>.

Finally, framing this slave revenge fantasy within the Western genre is a powerful [[symbolic_subversion_and_cultural_appropriation_in_django_unchained | symbolic subversion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. While traditional Westerns typically feature white cowboys eliminating villainized Native Americans, *Django Unchained* features a freed slave taking out white cowboy types, a subject largely ignored in the Western canon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>.

## [[agency_and_acting_as_forms_of_resistance_in_django_unchained | Acting Out of Slavery]]

The film also explores the concept of [[agency_and_acting_as_forms_of_resistance_in_django_unchained | agency]] through acting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>. While academic debates exist on the extent of agency enslaved people could exert, *Django Unchained* portrays acting as a primary means for Django to gain freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.

Django adopts a character for his mission to trick Candie, making decisions within the limited [[agency_and_acting_as_forms_of_resistance_in_django_unchained | agency]] he is granted, such as outwardly berating other slaves or sitting by as a runaway is ripped apart by dogs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>. These actions are driven by the necessity of his survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>. Later, his convincing performance, using props, allows him to outsmart a gang of Australians and regain his freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>.

Stephen, Candie's head house slave, also demonstrates [[agency_and_acting_as_forms_of_resistance_in_django_unchained | agency]] through dramatic performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>. He has "performed his way" out of harsh field labor into the relative comfort of Candie's home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. Stephen uses performed laughter to gain trust and influence over Candie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>, eventually being the one to discern Schultz and Django's true intentions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>. He even fakes a limp, requiring a cane, to appear physically weak and disarm suspicion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>. While Stephen is a villain, his villainy is framed within the context of the cards he was dealt, attempting to manifest power within the confines of slavery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>.

Ultimately, *Django Unchained* transcends mere entertainment to deliver one of cinema's sharpest criticisms of slavery and white supremacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>.

[[the_popularity_of_the_office_and_its_cultural_impact | *The Office*]] has maintained immense [[the_popularity_of_the_office_and_its_cultural_impact | popularity]], remaining one of the most streamed shows even years after it concluded its run in 2013 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Its enduring appeal is attributed not only to its lovable characters and great jokes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>, but also to its reflection on the prevalence of [[the_concept_of_nonsense_and_bs_jobs_within_the_office_and_real_life | "BS jobs"]] in professional life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

## Series Overview and Setup
*The Office* is a mockumentary-style series centered on the Scranton, Pennsylvania branch of Dunder Mifflin, a struggling paper company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. The office is managed by Michael Scott, whose antics frequently distract his employees from their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. Following Steve Carell's departure, equally incompetent managers continue this tradition of distraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. The show depicts individuals dealing with unsatisfying jobs while being made uncomfortable by their boss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

## Character Archetypes and Anxieties
*The Office* effectively mocks [[character_stereotypes_and_their_inversion | familiar office archetypes]], including <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>:
*   The uptight accountant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>
*   The chatterbox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>
*   The attractive receptionist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>
*   The person waiting for retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>
*   The unlovable HR representative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>
*   The lovable dunce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>
*   The guy who went to Cornell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>

Beyond humor, the show addresses anxieties related to the evolving American economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. While earlier generations contended with factory closures, the 2000s brought challenges like digitization, e-commerce, and retail consolidation, leading to a "[[the_concept_of_nonsense_and_bs_jobs_within_the_office_and_real_life | bullshitization]]" of the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

## The Concept of "BS Jobs"
Anthropologist David Graeber defines a "[[the_concept_of_nonsense_and_bs_jobs_within_the_office_and_real_life | BS job]]" as paid employment "that is so completely pointless, unnecessary or pernicious that even the employee cannot justify its existence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. Life at Dunder Mifflin exemplifies this, with characters engaging in useless meetings, following random directives, and trying to find meaning in an obsolescent job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

It's important to distinguish between a "sucky job" (like cleaning toilets for minimum wage) and a "[[the_concept_of_nonsense_and_bs_jobs_within_the_office_and_real_life | BS job]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. While some employees at Dunder Mifflin (like accountants Oscar and Angela) do perform actual work, the company fits many of Graeber's criteria for a [[the_concept_of_nonsense_and_bs_jobs_within_the_office_and_real_life | BS job]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>:
*   Employees are aware of the general pointlessness of their work, as Dunder Mifflin struggles to compete with modern chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
*   The branch could close at any moment, with clients easily supplied by larger, more cost-effective competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
*   Despite threats of downsizing, much of the workday is spent on [[the_concept_of_nonsense_and_bs_jobs_within_the_office_and_real_life | nonsense]] activities like party planning, "flonkerton," and office romance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

Most employees dislike their jobs and fill their time with distractions:
*   **Jim Halpert** engages in elaborate pranks on Dwight, despite being praised for competence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. He even spends a whole day moving his desk an inch at a time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.
*   **Pam Beesly** spends her time planning her wedding, conspiring with Jim, and even invents a job for herself as "office administrator" to avoid being fired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
*   **Kevin Malone**, an accountant who can barely do math, remains employed for years because firing him would be uncomfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.
*   **Dwight Schrute** revels in bureaucracy, obsessing over rules, titles, and inventing pointless structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.
*   **Gabe Lewis** holds a "director" title but wields no actual power, unable to fire anyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.
*   **Andy Bernard**, as manager, spends months away on a boat without anyone noticing, and the office even excels in his absence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

The show highlights Dunder Mifflin's parasitic nature; when asked if they cut and dye their own paper, Michael explains they buy it cut and dyed from a manufacturer and sell it for more, leading children to question why the manufacturer doesn't sell directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. This points to the paradox of [[the_concept_of_nonsense_and_bs_jobs_within_the_office_and_real_life | BS jobs]] in a free market, which theoretically should eliminate such waste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. Despite layoffs, mergers, and sales, the Scranton branch survives, riddled with inefficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

## Perpetuation of BS Jobs and Their Impact
According to Graeber, many [[the_concept_of_nonsense_and_bs_jobs_within_the_office_and_real_life | BS jobs]] might involve minimal real work, but societal expectations of a 40-hour workweek lead to a "culture of looking busy" and managers creating pointless tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. Employees often publicly declare their jobs important to justify their existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

Graeber argues that if you're not suffering at your job, it's not deemed worthy of fair compensation, leading to an optimization of suffering over efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. This cultural norm is reinforced by hiring more "useless people who exist to make sure people who have nothing to do can look busy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. Michael Scott embodies this, as his behavior often impedes productivity, yet he convinces himself his job is to alleviate monotony for his staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.

### Categories of BS Jobs
Graeber categorizes [[the_concept_of_nonsense_and_bs_jobs_within_the_office_and_real_life | BS jobs]] into several types, all of which proliferate within the service economy:
*   **Flunkies**: Employees who exist solely to justify a manager's position or inflate their prestige <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>.
*   **Goons**: Roles that exist because other companies have them (e.g., legal or marketing departments) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>.
*   **Duct Tapers**: Those who clean up inefficient systems' messes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>. Michael Scott sees himself as the "toilet of this office," flushing away problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>.
*   **Box Takers**: Employees who verify that some other actual work is being done, even if it's not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>.
*   **Task Masters**: Those who create [[the_concept_of_nonsense_and_bs_jobs_within_the_office_and_real_life | bullshit]] work for other [[the_concept_of_nonsense_and_bs_jobs_within_the_office_and_real_life | bullshit]] employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>.

Dunder Mifflin, as a company that doesn't manufacture paper but justifies its higher prices through customer service, fits squarely within this service economy model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>.

## Psychological Impact and Character Responses
Pointless jobs are not just wasteful; they are harmful to the psyche, leading to depression, anxiety, and guilt, even for those with generous perks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. Graeber suggests people find pleasure in "being the cause," or having an effect on the world, even in a small way, which pointless jobs deny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>. He references Dostoevsky's theory that forcing someone to perform endlessly pointless tasks would be the worst torture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. The employees of Dunder Mifflin are often thwarted from being the cause by managers, bureaucracy, or the sheer inanity of their tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.

The show explores how characters cope with their pointless professional lives, often by "becoming the cause" in other ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>:
*   **Jim**, bored by his job, finds agency and "being the cause" through pranking Dwight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.
*   **Pam** copes through distraction and eventually finding love and family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.
*   **Stanley Hudson** endures by focusing on retirement and the simple pleasure of "Pretzel Day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.
*   **Oscar Martinez** ends the show running for state senate, a role with potential for real change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.
*   **Kevin** finds happiness and competence running a bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>.
*   **Michael** denies the superfluous nature of his job by believing in its paramount importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. His hatred of Toby stems from Toby infringing on his ability to be the cause in his own office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>. Michael's deep-seated need to be loved and respected, stemming from a lonesome childhood, drives his narcissism and demands for attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. He grasps for meaning by framing his job in grandiose terms, emulating figures like Abraham Lincoln or Wayne Gretzky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>. The mockumentary format further emphasizes Michael's posturing for the cameras to appear as an admired leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>.
*   **Dwight** embraces the inanity and clings to pomp and circumstance, even with his successful beet farm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>. He fixates on bureaucratic titles and the appearance of authority, aspiring to be a petty dictator with ultimate say in his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>.

## Resonance and Coping
*The Office* resonates because [[the_concept_of_nonsense_and_bs_jobs_within_the_office_and_real_life | BS jobs]] are common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>. A 2013 Harvard Business Review survey found that half of 12,000 professionals felt their job had no meaning, and a poll showed 37% of British workers thought their jobs were useless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. Graeber suggests these jobs persist partly because their existence seems antithetical to capitalism, and society is reluctant to admit such a possibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>. The show offers an escapist fantasy where characters aren't fired for minimal work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>. By the finale, most characters have endured the [[the_concept_of_nonsense_and_bs_jobs_within_the_office_and_real_life | BS]], often by finding love or simply leaving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:33">[00:18:33]</a>. This suggests a common hope for a better job or a happy domestic life to offset professional dissatisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:42">[00:18:42]</a>.

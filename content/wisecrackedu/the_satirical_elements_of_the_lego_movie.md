*The Lego Movie*, based on the tiny choking hazards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>, is presented as a film for children and "brandwhores" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>, but it functions as a satirical jab at the 21st-century American political, economic, and social landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. The film tells the story of Emmet Brickowski, a construction worker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a> who becomes "the Special" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a> and must confront President Business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## [[the_role_of_corporate_and_political_power_in_the_lego_movie | Critique of Corporate and Political Power]]

The film satirizes the effect money has over politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a> and the increasingly blurred line between [[the_role_of_corporate_and_political_power_in_the_lego_movie | corporate and political power]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

*   **President Business**: As his name suggests, President Business is both a government official and focused on the "bottle line" (bottom line) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. He is depicted as a "corporate despot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a> who aims to maintain the status quo by gluing everyone in place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. He uses his control of the economy to subjugate citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>, even using a coin as a weapon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
*   **Corporate Control**: In a prime example of crony capitalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>, all media, business, government, and interpersonal interactions are controlled by a single corporation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
    *   **Octan Energy Corp**: This entity serves as a sly reference to real-world "behemoths that controlled life on Earth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>, such as Google Plus, Bing, and Tidal laundry detergent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
*   **Subjugation of the Proletariat**: The citizens are subdued into silence and complacency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a> through methods like:
    *   **"Taco Tuesday"**: The allure of "Taco Tuesday" proves humans are powerless to resist alliteration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.
    *   **"Where Are My Pants"**: Citizens are dulled into submission by watching "Where Are My Pants," a show that pokes fun at an era of mindless television and its "cheap, short-form, internet-only facsimiles" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

## [[literary_allusions_within_the_lego_movie | Literary Allusions]]

The film incorporates numerous [[literary_allusions_within_the_lego_movie | literary allusions]] that contribute to its satirical and thematic depth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>:

*   An "I've got my eye on you" poster and surveillance camera call to mind George Orwell's *1984* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
*   Cloud Cuckoo Land is a reference to a chaotic realm of the same name from Aristophanes' play *The Birds* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
*   The character Vitruvius is named after a Roman author who wrote a ten-volume work on architecture, which later inspired Da Vinci's "Vitruvian Guy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

## [[existential_themes_in_the_lego_movie | Existential Undertones]]

The film features bizarre [[existential_themes_in_the_lego_movie | existential undertones]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. After his "death trip into oblivion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>, Emmet enters a "heightened reality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a> where he realizes free will is an illusion and he is nothing more than a puppet controlled by a "snot-nosed fleshmonster" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. Emmet's act of wiggling off the table is portrayed as an [[existential_themes_in_the_lego_movie | existential rebellion]], as he refuses to let anyone define himâ€”whether societal overlords, his God, or even Fred Savage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.

Emmet becomes a religious figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>, fitting given his name means "truth" in Hebrew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. His entry into the "real world" symbolizes death, making his return a "Christ-like resurrection" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

## [[creativity_and_individualism_in_the_lego_movie | Celebration of Creativity and Individualism]]

Ultimately, *The Lego Movie* is a celebration of [[creativity_and_individualism_in_the_lego_movie | creativity and individualism]] over uniformity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. Emmet lives in a society as rigid as the blocks themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>, with his individual will smothered by instructions and a "terrifyingly catchy song" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. Emmet learns that to become "the Special," one must "embrace what is special about YOU" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>, advocating against being "just another cog in some larger machine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

Despite being a "glorified two-hour toy commercial" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>, the film delivers a harsh indictment of corporations, showcasing what the narrator calls Earth's "greatest export... hypocrisy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

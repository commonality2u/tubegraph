*Rick and Morty* is renowned for its extensive use of references to [[significance_of_science_fiction_and_horror_references_in_rick_and_morty | sci-fi, horror, and fantasy]], which are integrated into its aliens, premises, and gadgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. While some references are mere jokes or homages, others are thought-provoking and insightful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. By inverting common clichés and tropes, the show provides a deeper understanding of its narrative and appeal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Deconstructing the "Deal with the Devil" Trope

In the episode "Something Ricked This Way Comes," *Rick and Morty* uses the arrival of Satan to subvert the traditional "deal with the devil" narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

*   **Literary Inspirations**: The episode title is a direct reference to Ray Bradbury's novel "Something Wicked This Way Comes," which features carnies with a magical carousel that grants wishes with sinister catches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. The theme of making deals with creepy strangers is also central to Stephen King’s "Needful Things," which is the name of the Devil’s shop in *Rick and Morty* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. In King's book, people are tricked into buying worthless items for low prices, in exchange for playing pranks that lead to civil war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   **Rick's Inversion**: Unlike these stories, where deals result in hidden consequences and thwarting the natural order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>, the Devil's shop in *Rick and Morty* offers free items that creatively ruin the intended benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. Rick receives a microscope that makes him too stupid to use it, and Morty's teacher gets aftershave that attracts women but causes impotence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
*   **Science Over Supernatural**: *Rick and Morty* dismisses the traditional moral refrain of these stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. Rick's science allows for desires to be fulfilled without selling one's soul or facing debilitating curses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. This approach demystifies religion by portraying magic and miracles as mere coincidences or sleight of hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. The show implies that "too good to be true" is often just a euphemism for "don't circumvent God's rules" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. With science, Rick renders the devil obsolete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
*   **A New Horror**: The true lesson conveyed is that evil itself should no longer be horrifying; karmic retribution is comforting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. A world without cosmic justice is scarier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. The show suggests that genuine terror lies not in evil, but in pure, disinterested science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

## Critiquing Conformity and Individualism

In "Auto Erotic Assimilation," *Rick and Morty* critiques basic values and explores Rick's psyche through popular fears of conformity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

*   **"Invasion of the Body Snatchers" Reference**: Rick encounters Unity, a hivemind collective that assimilates alien races <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. This is a clear reference to the 1956 film "Invasion of the Body Snatchers," where aliens replace people with emotionless replicas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. The film has been interpreted as a commentary on the threat of the Soviet Union and the loss of individualism under Communism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
*   **Inversion of Individualism**: *Rick and Morty* inverts this by showing that the "freedom" associated with individualism can be undesirable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. While "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" expressed anxiety about communism destroying individualism, *Rick and Morty* exposes the non-fictional horrors of our own freedoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. For example, the denizens of Unity's planet, when freed from the hivemind, revert to being sex offenders and drug addicts, leading to a race war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.
*   **Rick's Egotism**: This tension between individual [[themes_of_freedom_and_choice_in_rick_and_morty | freedom]] and collective existence further develops Rick's character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. The show highlights how compromising individual freedoms is essential for family or relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. Rick's rampant egotism repeatedly impedes his relationships, destroying his bond with Unity and her society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. In fact, Unity's letter reveals that Rick made *her* lose her sense of self <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
*   **Community Cameo**: As an Easter egg, the TV show visible in the episode is a recreation of *Community*, Dan Harmon's previous show, featuring its main character Jeff Winger, who, like Rick, is an egotistical individual struggling with interpersonal connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

## Atheism and the Deconstruction of God

The 1974 film *Zardoz* is a more obscure but prominent reference in the episode "Raising Gazorpazorp" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

*   **Zardoz Reference**: *Zardoz* is known for its imagery, including Sean Connery's attire and a giant floating head that vomits guns, proclaiming, "The gun is good, the penis is evil" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. The film features a giant-floating-head-god commanding chosen savages to murder others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. The protagonist, Zed, discovers this god is a lie, a convoluted plan to enslave savages for immortal aristocrats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.
*   **Thematic Parallels**: "Raising Gazorpazorp" adapts this plot, replacing the conflict between immortals and savages with one between men and women, while retaining the "penis is evil" concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. The episode is precipitated by Morty's desire for a sex doll <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.
*   **Atheistic Themes**: The *Zardoz* reference underscores a general theme of atheism in *Rick and Morty* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. While *Zardoz* shows a character discovering and killing a false god <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>, *Rick and Morty* consistently reminds viewers that either God doesn't exist or isn't particularly benevolent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

## Subverting Animal Rebellion and Dystopia

The episode "Lawnmower Dog" draws its title from the 1992 film "Lawnmower Man," about a gardener transformed into a genius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

*   **"Lawnmower Man" and "Animal Farm"**: In "Lawnmower Dog," Rick makes the family dog, Snuffles, intelligent enough to subjugate humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. Snuffles renames himself "Snowball," a direct reference to the pig and Leon Trotsky stand-in from George Orwell’s "Animal Farm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. "Snowball" is also the name of the antagonist in "Secret Life of Pets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. The interspecies war in *Rick and Morty* mirrors the animals' rebellion against human masters in "Animal Farm," but Snuffles rebels against the "lazy life of pethood" instead of labor exploitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
*   **Averted Dystopia**: Unlike "Animal Farm," where the rebellious animals slowly become like their former oppressors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>, *Rick and Morty* averts this [[postapocalyptic_themes_in_rick_and_morty | dystopian nightmare]] with the help of "Inception" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. Snowball realizes he is turning into everything he hated about humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.
*   **"Dogworld" Concept**: The episode also references "Dogworld," a series concept by show co-creator Justin Roiland, about a family transported to a dog-ruled dimension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. Rick even mistakenly calls the pet human "Ruffles" (from "Dogworld") "Snuffles" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>, and later pitches "Dogworld" as its own show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.

## Trivializing Fantasy and Horror

A central theme in *Rick and Morty* is disillusionment, often achieved by deconstructing mysticism with science or by subjecting fantasies to the mundanity of everyday life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.

*   **Fairy Tale Realism**: "Meeseeks and Destroy" is a prime example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. Morty embarks on a clichéd fairy tale adventure, akin to "Jack and the Beanstalk" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. However, the show "normalizes" the fairy tale by introducing realism omitted from children's stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. Instead of a happy ending, Morty is put on trial for murder and confronts the giant's emotionally devastated widow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. Furthermore, the village king is revealed to be a sexual predator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.
*   **Banal Horror**: The show introduces Scary Terry, a "legally safe knockoff" of Freddy Krueger from "A Nightmare on Elm Street" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. While terrifying in concept, Scary Terry's life is utterly banal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>. This deconstructs the horror of Freddy Krueger by showing that the tormentor of dreams has the same "shitty home life" and "lame dreams" as everyone else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. This approach contributes to the [[cosmic_horror_influences_on_rick_and_morty | cosmic horror influences]] by showing the indifferent, mundane nature of seemingly terrifying entities.
*   **Gross-Out Sci-Fi**: "Anatomy Park" references "Jurassic Park" and "Fantastic Voyage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. While movies often portray the human body as a natural wonder, *Rick and Morty* depicts it as a "gonorrhea infested nightmare" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.

*Rick and Morty*'s signature humorous device is robbing fantasy of its magic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. This trivializes not only fairy tales but also fundamental concepts such as family, love, and life itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>, often linking to [[nihilism_and_existential_themes_in_rick_and_morty | nihilistic]] or [[cosmic_nihilism_and_its_depiction_in_rick_and_morty | cosmic nihilism]] themes by highlighting the meaninglessness of existence.

Throughout William Shakespeare's *Hamlet*, the titular character is deeply conflicted about the task of avenging his father by killing Claudius, leading to significant delays in his actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>. This procrastination is one of the most widely debated aspects of the play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>.

## Reasons for Hamlet's Delay

Several interpretations attempt to explain Hamlet's hesitation and internal struggle:
*   **Sensitivity vs. Violence** Some argue that Hamlet is too sensitive to engage in the brutal actions required in a world of violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>.
*   **Oedipal Complex** Another theory suggests Hamlet suffers from an Oedipal Complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. This perspective posits that Hamlet is subconsciously drawn to his mother and cannot bring himself to kill Claudius, who has done what Hamlet secretly desires: eliminated his father and become intimate with his mother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>.
*   **Rebellion Against Corruption** Some believe Hamlet's delay is a deliberate attempt to dismantle a kingdom steeped in [[themes_of_corruption_and_treachery_in_hamlet | lies and treachery]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>.

## Ambiguity and Modernity

The play is seen as capturing the "ambiguity of modernity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>. Hamlet, like the modern individual, lacks a clear moral code and is troubled by a "divided mind and will" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>, grappling with "ethical and metaphysical uncertainties" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>.

### "To Be or Not to Be"

This profound uncertainty is evident in Hamlet's famous "to be or not to be" soliloquy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>.
*   Some scholars interpret this speech as Hamlet's deliberation on whether to live or die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>.
*   Others propose he is choosing between the Christian principle of self-denial and the violent act of shedding blood to reclaim his throne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>.

## Universal Uncertainty

Ultimately, Shakespeare suggests that uncertainty is a pervasive element of human existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>. The play leaves many questions unanswered, fostering a sense of doubt for the audience as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>.
*   Can Hamlet's ghost-father be trusted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>?
*   Was Gertrude involved in the conspiracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>?
*   Why is the ghost visible to everyone in Act 1 but only Hamlet in Act 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>?
*   Is Hamlet feigning madness, or has his pretense become reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>?

These unresolved questions imply that Shakespeare has made "Hamlets of us all" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>, reflecting the universal human struggle with internal conflict and uncertainty.

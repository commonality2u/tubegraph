Released in 2015, the Disney/Pixar film *Inside Out* received critical acclaim for its entertainment value and its light-hearted approach to how our brains work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The film's creators consulted heavily with psychologists to ensure its whimsical world was rooted in actual science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. For a brief primer on the film's scientific basis, refer to [[psychological_insights_in_inside_out | Psychological insights in Inside Out]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Initial Perception: The Hero of the Story

When asked who the good guy in *Inside Out* is, most people would likely picture Joy, the ostensible hero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. The most obvious way to interpret the film is as Joy's journey to recover a core memory from the depths of Riley's mind before Riley's inner psyche is permanently damaged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. In this view, Joy learns a valuable lesson by the end: sometimes, sadness needs to be allowed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

## A Reinterpretation: Joy as the Villain

However, an alternative perspective suggests that Joy is, in fact, the villain of *Inside Out* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. This interpretation frames the story as that of a gleeful egomaniac who has tampered with and irreparably harmed an innocent girl’s brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

### Joy's Actions and Harmful Impact

Joy is presented as the source of many problems within Riley's mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. She initiated the tampering with the core memories, and her subsequent journey to recover them only exacerbated the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. Her actions even inadvertently lead to the "death" of Riley's imaginary best friend, Bing Bong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

### Authoritarian Behavior

Joy's character is described as a "fascist" who bosses around and organizes the other emotions like a "petty dictator" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. For instance, when Sadness touches a memory, Joy immediately determines it to be a negative event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. From the very first scene, Joy is shown actively pushing Sadness out of the way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

### Embodiment of Compulsory Happiness

This reinterpretation of Joy positions *Inside Out* as a commentary on the "compulsory happiness of 20th-century society" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. In modern society, there's a pervasive societal expectation that "not being happy simply isn’t an option" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. Various professionals and institutions mandate maintaining a positive outlook, even suggesting medication if one struggles to achieve it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

The film, through Joy, embodies the logic that happiness is a personal responsibility, a struggle confined to one's own mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. Joy's relentless pursuit of happiness for Riley, even in the face of hardship, sets Riley on a downward spiral of depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

### A Tool of Neoliberal Capitalism

Economic sociologist William Davies, in his book *The Happiness Industry*, argues that this compulsory happiness is a central component of neoliberal capitalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. He suggests that happiness is manipulated by corporations, managers, and advertisers to encourage people to work harder and consume more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. Society, Davies posits, aims to place Joy in control of our minds, suppressing emotions like Anger, which can make individuals acutely aware of injustice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

The film's focus on internal psychological drama rather than external societal factors, such as the "impersonal machinations of capitalism" driving Riley's father to relocate for wealth, is a critique of this mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. Davies states that a "relentless fascination with quantities of subjective feeling" diverts critical attention from broader political and economic problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>, essentially turning critique inwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. Joy embodies this logic, prioritizing an internal state of happiness over acknowledging external causes of distress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

## The Importance of All Emotions

The film's climax, ironically, demonstrates the necessity of all emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. It is only when Anger, Disgust, Fear, and Sadness work together that Riley begins to achieve a better mental state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. This suggests that emotions like sadness and anger contribute to making us better people and foster a more robust form of happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. This aligns with the Ancient Greek concept of Eudaimonia, which emphasizes virtue and justice over mere pleasure as the path to happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

Through a careful viewing, *Inside Out* implicitly criticizes the logic embodied by Joy, suggesting that happiness isn't merely the pursuit of pleasure, but a complex interplay of all emotions, including those often deemed negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

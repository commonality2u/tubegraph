The success of *The Matrix* was partly due to its ability to couple deep philosophical themes with a tight [[narrative structure and the golden rule in storytelling | narrative structure]], heavily influenced by Joseph Campbell's concept of the Monomyth or the Hero's Journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## Joseph Campbell's Monomyth

In his work, *The Hero with a Thousand Faces*, Campbell breaks down a hero's journey into three main phases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>:
1.  "Separation from the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>
2.  "A penetration to some source of power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>
3.  "A life-enhancing return" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>

This classic [[narrative structure and the golden rule in storytelling | structure]] is widely used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. Dan Harmon, writer of *Rick and Morty*, describes this model as "hardwired into [our] nervous system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>, suggesting that even if raised by wolves, our stories would naturally follow this pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

## The Challenge of a Completed Hero's Journey

A significant challenge arises once this cycle is complete and the protagonist has become, in Campbell's words, "Master of Two Worlds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. For Neo in *The Matrix*, this meant becoming "freakin Superman" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. The Wachowskis faced this problem when writing *The Matrix Reloaded*: how to craft a meaningful story arc with believable internal and external conflict when the character is already all-powerful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

Their theoretical solution was to tweak the prophecy that gives Neo his powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. This forms the central plot of *The Matrix Reloaded*, where Neo and the audience gradually realize that the prophecy itself is just another form of control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. Neo's powers aren't a sign of him transcending the system, but rather an inherent part of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. He isn't breaking free from the Matrix but is playing a predetermined role in a larger system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

> [00:02:21] "You are the eventuality of an anomaly, that despite my sincerest efforts, I have been unable to eliminate from what is otherwise a harmony of mathematical precision. While it remains a burden assiduously avoided, it is not unexpected and thus, not beyond a measure of control."
> â€” The Architect, *The Matrix Reloaded*

## The Problem of Dramatic Action and Determinism

The core issue in *The Matrix Reloaded* is the lack of "dramatic action" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. Dramatic action refers to any choice a character makes to advance their goal and the overall plot of the film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. These don't have to be major choices; for example, Luke deciding to follow R2D2 to find Obi-Wan in *Star Wars* is a small but significant dramatic action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

In *The Matrix Reloaded*, there is little to no dramatic action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. This is exacerbated by the film's philosophical deep dive into determinism, the belief that "every moment in the future is dictated by a moment in the past" through cause and effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. The film hammers home this philosophy through various means:

*   **Pre-determined Opening Scene:** The opening scene, a dream of Trinity getting shot, is actually a moment from the film's closing, showing that events are already cemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
*   **The Loop:** The Matrix has restarted six times before, implying that the entire world is stuck in a loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
*   **Symbolism of Time and Pi:** A punch clock striking midnight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a> and the Key Maker's exact 314-second countdown to the Architect (the first three digits of pi, which also appears as graffiti) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a> reinforce the idea of a predetermined, cyclical reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.

These elements constantly remind the audience that Neo isn't forging a new path but "retreading a circle for the 6th time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

### Lack of Agency and Plot Progression in *The Matrix Reloaded*

The film struggles with plot progression because Neo, as the protagonist, has little agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>:

*   **Delayed Inciting Incident:** The first moment a character makes a decision to advance their goals and the plot doesn't occur until 44 minutes into the movie, when Neo finally locates the Oracle and is given his quest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. This is significantly later than *Star Wars*, where Luke receives Leia's message around the twenty-minute mark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
*   **Philosophical Exposition vs. Choice:** Even when Neo finds the Oracle, the conversation is filled with philosophical exposition about determinism, reminding viewers that Neo's choice has already been made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. The "inciting incident" is effectively a "bunch of philosophical exposition that reminds us that Neo has no agency at all" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.
*   **"Fetch Quest" Narrative:** Neo's journey is reduced to a "glorified fetch quest" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>, with vague instructions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.
*   **Monologues Over Action:** The film frequently relies on lengthy, philosophically confused monologues about determinism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. Characters like Agent Smith and the Merovingian deliver speeches that explicitly state Neo is bound by a larger system of cause and effect, rather than this theme growing organically through Neo's actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.
*   **Purposeless Action Sequences:** The film's biggest action sequences, such as the lengthy chase scene for the Key Maker, serve no clear purpose in the [[Narrative structure and the golden rule in storytelling | narrative]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>. If Neo is merely playing into the Architect's hands, then the Agents' actions (e.g., trying to delete the Key Maker) contradict the established deterministic plot where the Key Maker is essential for Neo to reach the Source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

As a result of this lack of dramatic action and overreliance on deterministic exposition, *The Matrix Reloaded* leaves the audience wondering what they just watched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>. Despite more fight scenes, characters, and plot twists than the original, it feels like nothing actually happened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. The film's core purpose seems to be to make the audience ask if Neo can truly make choices and break free from the system of control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>, leaving the answer to *The Matrix Revolutions* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.

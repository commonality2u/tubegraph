*Rick and Morty*, a popular animated series, explores profound philosophical questions through its blend of science fiction and dark humor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The show, created by Dan Harmon and Justin Roiland, chronicles the adventures of mad scientist Rick Sanchez and his naive grandson Morty Smith, often drawing inspiration from classic sci-fi horror and *Back to the Future* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Cosmic Horror and Cosmic Pessimism

*Rick and Morty* demonstrates an affinity for cosmic horror, a genre pioneered by H.P. Lovecraft, which emphasizes the terror of that which is beyond human comprehension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The series uses the cosmos to explore deep philosophical questions by imagining hidden entities in the black depths of space, even featuring a visual reference to Lovecraft’s Cthulhu in its opening sequence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

[[Cosmic nihilism and its depiction in Rick and Morty | Cosmic horror]] presents the vast, unimaginable unknown, evoking feelings of fright, disgust, and dread when incomprehensible realities collide with our own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Rick's portal gun frequently introduces this unknown, leading to outcomes that are sometimes horrifying, sometimes hilarious, and often both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

The episode "[[Philosophy in Rick and Morty episode Get Schwifty | Get Schwifty]]" serves as a prime example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Earth is confronted by a giant space-head, a Cromulon, which demands a hit song to avoid the planet's disintegration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This scenario, reminiscent of Lovecraft's "Great Old Ones," begs the question: "Are we significant?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While most science fiction places humanity at the center of the universe, [[Cosmic nihilism and its depiction in Rick and Morty | cosmic horror]] inverts this, asking: "What if the universe doesn’t give a shit about us?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. For the Cromulons, humanity is merely entertainment; annihilating a planet is an indifferent act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

This concept aligns with [[nihilism and cosmic pessimism in Rick and Morty | cosmic pessimism]], as described by contemporary American philosopher Eugene Thacker in “In the Dust of This Planet” <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Thacker describes a "world-without-us," where the universe is "absolutely unhuman, and indifferent to the hopes, desires and struggles of human individuals and groups" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. *Rick and Morty* embodies this pessimism, such as when Rick and Morty die and are simply replaced by infinite alternate versions of themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The show doesn't aim to terrify with insignificance but rather to make us laugh at it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

### Cosmic Inception

The series further explores this by showing that even humans can be "cosmic horrors" to smaller beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. In “The Ricks Must Be Crazy,” Rick's car battery is powered by a micro-universe whose sole purpose is to produce energy, which then contains another mini-universe, and so on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Rick, in this context, becomes a cosmic deity to the denizens of these micro-verses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This multi-verse concept, with infinite possibilities, leads to values and meanings slipping away, leaving only pessimism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Existentialism and Meaninglessness

*Rick and Morty* consistently addresses the question of existence, highlighting both the cosmic insignificance of humanity and the frivolity of individual human life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The show presents two contrasting responses to this "pathetic existence" through Rick and Jerry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

### Jerry vs. Rick

Jerry is largely oblivious to the "soul-crushing mediocrity and pointlessness of his own life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. He finds contentment in ignorance, even preferring a poor simulation of reality to his actual life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. His seemingly content existence, despite being a failure, contrasts with Rick’s conscious awareness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

Rick, on the other hand, understands and accepts the meaninglessness of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Despite his sarcasm and nonchalant attitude, Rick is an alcoholic whose catchphrase, "Wubba lubba dub dub," translates to "I am in great pain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

### [[Science and rationalism in Rick and Morty | Science]] and the Bleakness of Existence

The show suggests that the pure rationalism of the universe amplifies feelings of insignificance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While [[Science and rationalism in Rick and Morty | science]] helps make sense of the universe, it leaves humans to confront the bleak, arbitrary nature of their existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. [[Science and rationalism in Rick and Morty | Science]] can strip away sanctity and emotion, rendering the human experience meaningless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. For example, Rick mathematically explains Summer and Morty's insignificance and rationalizes his bond with Morty as merely a way to hide his genius brain waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

### Reality vs. Simulation

*Rick and Morty* frequently blurs the lines between meaningless simulations and actual life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. In one instance, Morty experiences a full life and death within a video game, "Roy: A Life Well Lived," momentarily forgetting his own existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This prompts the audience to question the difference between a "fake" reality and one's own existence, especially if the simulated experience evokes genuine emotions and sensations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The show challenges the notion that our waking life possesses inherent authenticity or meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, as seen when characters feel genuine emotion for memory parasites, then casually shoot Mr. Poopybutthole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

### [[Nietzschean philosophy and its application in Rick and Morty | Nietzsche]] and [[Nihilism and existential themes in Rick and Morty | Nihilism]]

The show's crisis of values and meaning aligns with the ideas of [[Nietzschean philosophy and its application in Rick and Morty | Friedrich Nietzsche]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Nietzsche’s parable of the madman, proclaiming "God is dead," signifies that after the Enlightenment and scientific revolution, traditional sources of meaning (like a divine being) are no longer relevant, leading to a void of meaning – [[Nihilism and existential themes in Rick and Morty | nihilism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

This struggle with meaninglessness defines Rick Sanchez <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Rick uses [[Science and rationalism in Rick and Morty | science]] to demystify everything, reducing love to chemical reactions and even "beating the devil," metaphorically playing out the death of God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Rick's character embodies a tension between passive and active [[Nihilism and existential themes in Rick and Morty | nihilism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While a passive nihilist is resigned to hopelessness, an active nihilist seeks to destroy old values to create new ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Despite his nihilistic tendencies, Rick's actions, such as fighting as an "intergalactic terrorist" or giving himself up to save his family, suggest an underlying struggle to find meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

### Morality and Freedom

The show interrogates traditional morality, refusing to draw clear lines between right and wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Morty's attempts to "do good" often backfire, leading to grim consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. For instance, freeing people from the body-snatching Unity results in a "nipple-driven race war" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Summer's observation, "I didn’t know freedom meant people doing stuff that sucks," highlights the paradox of freedom allowing for terrible outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The show forces viewers to consider whether an "irrational attachment to freedom" leads to a "terribly fucked up" world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

### Absurdism and The Frankenstein Complex

[[Nihilism and existential themes in Rick and Morty | Existentialism]] in *Rick and Morty* can also be viewed through the lens of [[Albert Camus]]'s absurdism, particularly in the episode "Meeseeks and Destroy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Camus's absurdism posits that life consists of the human tendency to find meaning, irreconcilable with the universe's complete indifference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The Meeseeks, who are "not born into this world fumbling for meaning" but "created to serve a singular purpose," represent the opposite of Camus's view of human life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

Camus illustrates human absurdity with the Myth of Sisyphus, who is doomed to eternally push a boulder up a hill only for it to fall back down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. For Jerry, this eternal, pointless struggle is represented by his golf swing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

Many characters in the show exhibit a "Frankenstein-complex," resenting their creators for bringing them into existence rather than seeking meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This is seen in the Meeseeks, Abradolf Lincler, Morty Jr., and even Frankenstein’s monster himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Camus suggests embracing the emptiness of the absurd in the face of our perpetual frustration in finding meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Rick's advice, "Don't think about it," and Morty's blunt observation, "Nobody exists on purpose. Nobody belongs anywhere. Everybody’s gonna die. Come watch TV?" encapsulate this absurdist acceptance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

*Rick and Morty* uses its unique blend of speculative [[Science and rationalism in Rick and Morty | science]] and sci-fi horror to explore the "absurdities of a purely rational universe," posing fun yet depressing questions about purpose and existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The show consistently challenges viewers to confront the bleakness of existence, leaving open whether Rick will ever act for a greater good or if his actions remain self-serving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

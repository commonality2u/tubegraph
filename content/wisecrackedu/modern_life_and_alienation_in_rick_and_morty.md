The third season of *Rick and Morty* explores the concept of modern alienation, an idea previously touched upon but not as thoroughly developed as other popular themes like "existence is pain" or "everything you believe is bullshit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Specifically, the episode "Rickmancing the Stone" delves into the depressing notion that society may be slowly destroying our souls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## Exploring Alienation

*Rick and Morty* tackles alienation on both a micro and macro level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
*   **Micro Level**: This refers to the family kind of alienation experienced by characters like Summer and Morty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Summer's tension with Jerry, for example, makes her feel disillusioned, leading her to believe that only a place where civilization has crumbled can make her feel alive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
*   **Macro Level**: The show also explores the alienation of society as a whole, framing how individuals lose agency in their everyday lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

## Jerry: The "Everyman" of Modern Alienation

Jerry is presented as a prime example of modern alienation and powerlessness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. Rick's assessment of Jerry highlights his complete lack of personal resolve, power, or agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

> Rick: "Jerry, you are a sad, strange little man. And you have my pity." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>

This powerlessness fuels much of Morty's resentment towards Jerry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. Jerry embodies the modern "everyman" who, since the Industrial Revolution, has complained about a loss of control, often toiling away at monotonous jobs instead of having personal trades or farms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. He is portrayed as the "pinnacle of modern stoogery" and a "cog in a meaningless machine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. This is further emphasized in "The Rickshank Redemption," where the Galactic Federation keeps people compliant through pharmaceuticals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. Essentially, Jerry is so inept at being a person that he thrives in a society devoid of freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

### The Cronenberg Earth Counterpart

A stark contrast to the main timeline Jerry is the Jerry from Cronenberg Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. When stripped of "the trappings of modern society," Cronenberg Jerry transforms from a "useless hack in a loveless marriage" into a "total badass" who seems to be maintaining his marriage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. This suggests that modern societal structures are inherently alienating and contribute to the creation of "Jerrys" out of everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

## The Post-Apocalyptic Society as a Critique

In "Rickmancing the Stone," Rick, Summer, and Morty traverse a [[postapocalyptic_themes_in_rick_and_morty | Mad Max-inspired post-apocalypse]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. After Rick introduces electricity to this Wasteland, it quickly begins to resemble a modern industrialized society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.
*   Summer's violent life is replaced with everyday banalities, such as grocery shopping for human bits instead of murdering mutants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.
*   The savagery of the Death Stalkers is reduced to complaining about recycling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
*   Hemorrhage, a former murderer, becomes a "good-for-nothing couch potato" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

The implication is that modern comforts contribute to "banal, terrible lives" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. With no mutants to fight, people resort to bickering over trivialities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>, and violent blood sport is replaced by watching it on screens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

Unlike most [[postapocalyptic_themes_in_rick_and_morty | post-apocalyptic fiction]] that serves as a cautionary tale for how awful life could become, *Rick and Morty* argues that modern life is its own unique form of "soul crushing" misery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. Modern comforts ultimately alienate people from meaning, leading to different kinds of suffering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

## Future Speculation for Jerry

There is speculation that while Rick's character may remain unchanged, Jerry's character could experience significant growth throughout Season 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. This potential growth could involve a "Tyler Durden moment" where Jerry, like Edward Norton's character in *Fight Club*, transforms from a "disaffected modern buffoon" into a man of action, perhaps inspired by his Cronenberg Earth counterpart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

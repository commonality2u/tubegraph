*Neon Genesis Evangelion* (often referred to as *Eva*) is recognized as a phenomenally complex story that goes beyond its surface plot of the end of the world, teenagers, and giant biomechanical monsters fighting alien-angel-robot entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. It delves into an investigation of psychosexual development, intimacy, unconscious human motivation, and the inherent difficulties of being a person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. At its core, the series explores profound ideas, often summarized by the "Hedgehog's Dilemma" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

The analysis below focuses on the original twenty-six-episode series and the films (*End of Evangelion*, and *Death and Rebirth*) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## Series Overview

Set in the distant future of 2015, Earth faces attacks from unearthly beings known as Angels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. To combat them, humanity created "Evas," ass-kicking robots that synchronize with their pilots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. These Evas are not merely robots; they are former Angels infused with human souls, specifically the souls of the pilots' mothers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Shinji, Asuka, and Rei (a clone) pilot these Evas to save the world and confront their inner demons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. A key plot point involves Rei bonding the DNA of original angels Adam and Lilith, becoming a being that contains the consciousness of all humanity, and portending the end of existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

## Eschatology and Mysticism

The title *Neon Genesis Evangelion* itself holds significant meaning: "Neon" from the Greek "neos" meaning "new," "Genesis" referring to a beginning and the opening book of the Bible, and "Evangelion" meaning the Gospel or "good news" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. Thus, the title implies a "new telling of the gospel: genesis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>, or a re-imagining of the Book of Genesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

The series is replete with [[religious_symbolism_in_neon_genesis_evangelion | religious iconography]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>, including explicit references to the Dead Sea Scrolls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>, a 666-type firewall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>, and creatures named angels, two of which are Adam and Lilith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. Lilith, Adam’s female counterpart in Jewish folklore, is described as a mother of demons, and in *Eva*, humans are her descendants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. The Magi system, NERV's supercomputer network, is named after the three wise men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

The majority of the [[religious_symbolism_in_neon_genesis_evangelion | religious imagery]] in *Eva* is based on Jewish mysticism and the Kabbalah <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. Kabbalah is an investigative practice seeking religious revelation and sacred knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. Many Angels in *Eva* are drawn from texts like the Zohar, the Talmud, and the Book of Enoch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>, or use the "el" suffix found in eltheosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

Key Kabbalistic concepts present in the series include:
*   **Adam Kadmon** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>: The first being in Kabbalistic tradition, a being of light, similar to *Eva*'s first angel, Adam, who explodes in the Second Impact, killing half the planet's population and turning oceans red <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.
*   **Shevirat ha-Kelim (the breaking of vessels)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>: This event, described as a theological Big Bang where an initial universal unity broke apart, leaving everything separate, mirrors the destruction seen in *Eva* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.
*   **Tikkun ha-Olam (the restoration of the world)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>: Traditionally practiced through good deeds and prayer, in *Eva* it is taken literally as the reunification of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. This involves reuniting the fragmented parts of Adam, called the Sefirot, which are depicted as the Tree of Life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. The Sefirot's reunification of everything creates a complete whole, but destroys the individuality and separation that defines life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. Many characters pursue the goal of literally reunifying the world by combining all consciousnesses into one place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. This culminates when Adam and Lilith's DNA combine within Rei, leading to a reunification of the world's masculine and feminine aspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. This raises a central philosophical question: why does the world need to be reunited, and what does it mean for it to be broken? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>

## The Hedgehog's Dilemma

A core philosophical theme in *Neon Genesis Evangelion* is the Hedgehog's Dilemma, prominently featured and even named in Episode 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. This parable, detailed by philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer in *Parega and Paralipomena: Short Philosophical Essays. Volume 2* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>, compares humans to hedgehogs huddled for warmth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. Though they crave warmth, their quills prevent them from getting too close without injuring each other, forcing them to maintain distance and remain cold, or learn to live without the warmth of others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

In *Eva*, this dilemma illustrates the human condition: the desire to be unhurt creates a wedge between people, leading to a world of despair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. The characters' miserable lives and intimacy problems are a direct reflection of this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

*   **Loneliness and Despair**: Episode 16, "Sickness Unto Death," references Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard's concept of despair, an existential loneliness that aligns with Schopenhauer's hedgehogs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. Mitsado's remark, "Another phone that will never ring," following Kaji's death, epitomizes this lonesomeness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.
*   **Characters' Struggles**:
    *   Asuka pilots her Eva to find meaning, fearing being alone and seeking to draw people towards her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.
    *   Gendo struggles to show Shinji love, believing he doesn't deserve to be loved and rejecting the world to avoid pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.

Schopenhauer argues in *The World as Will and Representation* that life is suffering because the world is composed of will and representation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. For him, reality's nature is unity, and suffering arises from individuality and the struggle to communicate between individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. Each individual will or ego perceives the world from its own vantage point (representation), leading to anguish, fragmentation, alienation, and isolation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.

This separation of wills is manifested in the show as **AT-fields**, which represent the unique human soul that separates each person's ego and acts as a barrier to true connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. Characters like Rei reflect on what it means to be a human with a body recognized by others, noting that despite being fundamentally the same, minds "lack something basic" and fear that lack, hence the desire to become one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. This struggle with isolation and the pain of rejection defines *Eva* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.

## [[freudian_psychoanalysis_and_neon_genesis_evangelion | Psychoanalysis]]

*Eva* explicitly incorporates [[freudian_psychoanalysis_and_neon_genesis_evangelion | Freudian terms]], ideas, and analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>.

*   **Introjection**: Episode 19, "Introjection," uses this Freudian term, explaining how individuals adopt characteristics of those around them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.
*   **Oral Stage**: Episode 20, "Weaving a Story 2: Oral Stage," refers to Freud's oral stage of psychosexual development. The Eva pilots, being motherless children (or so they believe), show dispositions indicative of their reaction to their mothers, as Shinji’s mom is Unit 1’s soul and part of Asuka’s mother’s soul is in Unit 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>. They are all mourning the "lost love object" of their mother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. Rei, as an artificial being, experiences melancholia rather than mourning because she has no real loss to speak of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>. The final two episodes are a psychotherapy session inside Shinji's mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>.
*   **Magi Supercomputers**: The Magi supercomputers, which contain the imprinted mind of Dr. Naoko Akagi, reflect the tri-part model of the human unconscious: the controlling scientist as the ego, the mother as the punishing superego, and the woman as the sexual id <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.
*   **Ambivalence**: Episode 18, "Ambivalence," explores this Freudian concept of simultaneously holding passionate hate and love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>. Shinji exemplifies this by hating his father but piloting the Eva repeatedly to gain his praise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>, constantly running away from his responsibilities yet returning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>.
*   **Eros and Thanatos (Life Drive and Death Drive)**: Freud's pleasure principle, the inclination to avoid pain and maximize pleasure, is explored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>. Shinji's lament, "This world is filled with too much pain and suffering to keep going on," expresses his desire to minimize suffering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>. This aligns with Schopenhauer's ideas about will and struggle, highlighting the dilemma of avoiding suffering when sharing a world with others whose desires conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>.

The desire to join a unified whole, free from self-concerns, is linked to Freud's **Death Drive** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>. This drive is a desire to return to tranquility, the peace of the womb, or the end of everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. Seele and NERV's pursuit of **instrumentalization**, the process by which all human consciousness is combined into a primordial soup (LCL), aligns with this death drive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>. Instrumentalization is presented not as a return to nothingness but to a state of beginning, "the primal womb that we lost so long ago," where souls and minds become one, attaining eternal balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>. This is a return to Lilith and Tikkun ha-Olam, the reunification with the primordial being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>.

## Conclusion: Acceptance and Individuality

The human reaction to the Hedgehog's Dilemma—seeking tranquility in a return to the womb—is ultimately depicted as a desire for death, an escape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>. The series offers an alternative through Kaworu, a non-human character, who demonstrates acceptance of vulnerability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>. Kaworu sacrifices his individual desires for Shinji's life, showing unguarded, absolute love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>. He provides counsel, acknowledging that keeping others at a distance prevents hurt but enforces loneliness, as "all men are fundamentally alone" and "pain is something that man must endure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>.

In the final episodes and film, Shinji initially accepts instrumentalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>. However, upon realizing he would lose his individuality—his self-image defined by interaction with others—he has a change of heart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>. He recognizes that without others, there would be "no difference between me and nothing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>. Shinji ultimately rejects instrumentality, choosing to exist as himself in a world with individual selves, wills, desires, and pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>. He confronts the drive to inorganic existence and accepts the inevitability of suffering in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>. This choice also opens the door for hope and joy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:36">[00:19:36]</a>; his first act after rejecting instrumentalization is to choke Asuka, who responds by stroking his face, symbolizing a world of violence and pain, but also love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a>.

### The Concept of Lack

The theological, [[psychological_analysis_of_characters_in_evangelion | psychological]], and philosophical elements of *Eva* consistently address the concept of **lack** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:52">[00:19:52]</a>. As explored by the Freud-inspired psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan, lack is the "missing center at the heart of our existence," the gap between representation and the world in itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:19:59]</a>. This can manifest as scarcity of friends, failing relationships, or distance between family members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:12">[00:20:12]</a>. *Eva* consistently weaves a plot that delves deep into the visceral reality of humanity’s disappointing existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:18">[00:20:18]</a>.

The series concludes with Shinji and Asuka as a new Adam and Eve, signifying a new beginning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:44">[00:20:44]</a>, albeit one still fraught with the complexities of human interaction and individuality.

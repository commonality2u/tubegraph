From: [[wisecrackedu]] <br/> 

Self-aware humor, where media makes fun of itself and the genres it inhabits, is a growing trend, seen in works like *Deadpool*, *Cabin in the Woods*, and *Galaxy Quest* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This trend prompts an exploration into the complex nature of self-criticism, particularly the distinction between satire and parody <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Both satire and parody serve to criticize the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. To understand these concepts better, [[the_concept_of_reality_and_perception_in_promethea_and_watchmen | Watchmen]] and [[analysis_of_one_punch_man_as_parody | One Punch Man]] are used as primary examples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## Watchmen: A Deconstruction of Superheroes

[[the_concept_of_reality_and_perception_in_promethea_and_watchmen | Watchmen]] poses the question of what if superheroes were just ordinary, flawed people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. Both [[the_concept_of_reality_and_perception_in_promethea and_watchmen | Watchmen]] and [[parody_and_satirical_elements_in_one_punch_man | One Punch Man]] twist archetypes from their respective genres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

### Twisting Superhero Archetypes

[[the_concept_of_reality_and_perception_in_promethea_and_watchmen | Watchmen]] features an array of [[satire_of_superhero_films | superhero]] knock-offs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. Rorschach and Ozymandias are presented as distillations of Batman's elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>:
*   **Ozymandias** embodies the charismatic, wealthy, and hyper-intelligent Bruce Wayne, seen as a force of good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.
*   **Rorschach** represents the detective aspect of Batman, relentlessly fighting crime and searching for "Truth," though his quest borders on horrifying obsession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. He is depicted as an "ugly version" of Frank Miller's Caped Crusader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
*   **Nite Owl** is a recreation of the nerdy, inventor version of Batman, reminiscent of Adam West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

These distorted characters are used to make observations about common assumptions in [[satire_of_superhero_films | superhero]] stories, such as the types of heroes, their expected actions, and their motivations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

### The Reality of God-like Power

Both [[the_concept_of_reality_and_perception_in_promethea_and_watchmen | Watchmen]] and [[parody_and_satirical_elements_in_one_punch_man | One Punch Man]] explore a more "realistic" version of [[satire_of_superhero_films | superhero]] power, particularly the boredom that comes with omnipotence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. In [[the_concept_of_reality_and_perception_in_promethea_and_watchmen | Watchmen]], Dr. Manhattan, a character of galactic power, confronts this boredom by engaging in "weird sex," hanging out on Mars, and contemplating the nature of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. Unlike traditional protagonists like Batman or Goku, Dr. Manhattan doesn't struggle in a conventional way because he literally knows everything and physical confrontations are over instantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. For example, he single-handedly won the Vietnam War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

## Watchmen as Satire

The critical difference between [[the_concept_of_reality_and_perception_in_promethea_and_watchmen | Watchmen]] and [[parody_and_satirical_elements_in_one_punch_man | One Punch Man]] is that [[the_concept_of_reality_and_perception_in_promethea_and_watchmen | Watchmen]] is a satire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

According to Dustin Griffin’s 'Satire: A Critical Reintroduction':
> "A work of satire is designed to attack vice or folly… it seeks to persuade an audience that something or someone is reprehensible or ridiculous… When it takes over another literary structure, it tends not just to borrow it… but to subvert it or… direct it’s energies towards alien ends." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>

### Attacking Power and Nuclear Fear

[[the_concept_of_reality_and_perception_in_promethea_and_watchmen | Watchmen]], as a satire, directly attacks societal vices and follies within the [[satire_of_superhero_films | superhero]] genre <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. It specifically assaults the idea of anyone possessing powers comparable to a nuclear weapon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. The narrative is largely driven by nuclear fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

*   **Dr. Manhattan** is explicitly linked to nuclear power: Jon Osterman becomes Dr. Manhattan in a nuclear accident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>, is used as a weapon to win the Vietnam War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>, and his name is a clear reference to the Manhattan Project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.
*   The graphic novel frequently references nuclear security and depicts conflict driven by the fear of nukes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. Even riots and violence opposing [[satire_of_superhero_films | superheroes]] on the home front are tied to the nuclear threat symbolized by Dr. Manhattan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.
*   The USSR and USA require a fabricated attack to set aside their differences, highlighting the extreme measures taken to de-escalate nuclear stand-offs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

### The Indifference of Power

[[the_concept_of_reality_and_perception_in_promethea_and_watchmen | Watchmen]] illustrates not only the dangers of power but also its indifference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. Dr. Manhattan becomes bored with everything, leading to a profound conflict about his own existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. This serves as a grim joke about Superman: if an all-powerful being truly existed, why would they care about humanity? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a> Dr. Manhattan's choice to be naked, stripping himself of ideology, contrasts sharply with Superman's costume, which evokes American values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

### The Corrupting Influence of Superheroes

The Comedian in [[the_concept_of_reality_and_perception_in_promethea_and_watchmen | Watchmen]] further demonstrates the corrupting influence of power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. While [[satire_of_superhero_films | superhero]] stories often portray "good guys" as deserving of power, [[the_concept_of_reality_and_perception_in_promethea_and_watchmen | Watchmen]] challenges this notion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. The Comedian, a super soldier akin to Captain America or Wolverine, is also a sadist and psychopath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.

### Persuading the Audience

[[the_concept_of_reality_and_perception_in_promethea_and_watchmen | Watchmen]] uses the form of the [[satire_of_superhero_films | superhero]] genre (e.g., Batman clones, all-powerful beings) and its narrative content to persuade the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. It aims to prove that "something or someone is reprehensible or ridiculous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>, specifically the very idea of [[satire_of_superhero_films | superheroes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. [[the_concept_of_reality_and_perception_in_promethea_and_watchmen | Watchmen]] argues that the existence of [[satire_of_superhero_films | superheroes]] is a dangerous fantasy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

This is comparable to Jonathan Swift's "A Modest Proposal," where Swift suggests eating children to solve famine, not because he supported it, but to expose society's indifference to suffering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. Just as Swift used the form of a political essay to expose heartless politicians, [[the_concept_of_reality_and_perception_in_promethea_and_watchmen | Watchmen]] uses the [[satire_of_superhero_films | superhero]] narrative form to portray [[satire_of_superhero_films | superheroes]] as dangerous and problematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. It posits that [[satire_of_superhero_films | superheroes]] create an asymmetry of power, allowing them to violate rules and commit violence at their discretion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. This unchecked power, regardless of good intentions, becomes dangerous when differing ethical frameworks (like Rorschach and Ozymandias) clash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. Ultimately, both superpowers and nuclear powers inevitably lead to "f**ked up sh*t" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.

[[the_concept_of_reality_and_perception_in_promethea_and_watchmen | Watchmen]] effectively makes these arguments by subverting the very structures of [[satire_of_superhero_films | superhero]] stories, turning beloved traits against themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. It condemns [[satire_of_superhero_films | superhero]] fiction as a genre because it promotes a dangerous fantasy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.

## Satire vs. Parody: The Demolitionist Approach

Unlike parody, which ultimately affirms the genre it targets while exaggerating elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>, satire like [[the_concept_of_reality_and_perception_in_promethea_and_watchmen | Watchmen]] takes a "burn it all" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. While [[parody_and_satirical_elements_in_one_punch_man | One Punch Man]] critiques [[satire_of_superhero_films | superhero]] narratives to expand possibilities and improve the genre <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>, [[the_concept_of_reality_and_perception_in_promethea_and_watchmen | Watchmen]] aspires to demolish a flawed genre <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>.

In conclusion, [[the_concept_of_reality_and_perception_in_promethea_and_watchmen | Watchmen]] makes condemnations of social systems beyond just [[satire_of_superhero_films | superheroes]], directly condemning the [[satire_of_superhero_films | superhero]] genre itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>. Other examples of satire include *Team America*, *Dr. Strangelove*, and *Heathers* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>.

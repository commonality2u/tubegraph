Beyond its surface narrative of giant biomechanical monsters fighting alien-angel-robot entities, [[Philosophical themes in Neon Genesis Evangelion | Neon Genesis Evangelion]] delves into a complex investigation of psychosexual development, intimacy, unconscious human motivation, and the inherent difficulty of being a person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. The series explicitly incorporates [[Psychological analysis of characters in Evangelion | Freudian terms]], ideas, and analysis into its narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>.

## Explicit Freudian Concepts

[[Psychological analysis of characters in Evangelion | *Neon Genesis Evangelion*]] weaves several direct [[Psychological analysis of characters in Evangelion | Freudian concepts]] into its storyline:

*   **Introjection** Episode nineteen of the series is titled "Introjection" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>. This [[Psychological analysis of characters in Evangelion | Freudian term]] describes how individuals adopt the characteristics of those around them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.
*   **Oral Stage** Episode twenty, "Weaving a Story 2: Oral Stage," directly references the oral stage of psychosexual development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>. This stage corresponds to a child's weaning from breastfeeding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>. According to Freud, weaning a child too soon can lead to a lack of emotional connection and sociopathic tendencies, while weaning them too late can result in prolonged dependence on the mother and neurotic behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>.
    *   All of the Eva pilots are presented as motherless children, though Shinji's mother's soul is in Unit-01 and part of Asuka's mother's soul is in Unit-02 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>. These Evas use the souls within them to further bond with their pilots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>. How a pilot reacts to their mother's presence is indicative of their general disposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. They are all "mourning the lost love object that is their mother" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.
*   **Mourning vs. Melancholia** Rei, as an artificial being, is described as experiencing melancholia rather than mourning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>. For Freud, mourning occurs when the lost object is known, while melancholia is a more serious state where an individual is unaware of what is missing, experiencing deep sadness without a clear cause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>.
*   **Psychotherapy Session** The final two episodes of the series are explicitly structured as a psychotherapy session taking place within Shinji's mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>.
    <blockquote>"But if you depend only on the Eva, then the Eva will become your only identifier.” <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>
    “Eva will become your only value.” <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>
    “Without that value you —\hthe real you — will be erased from this existence.” <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a></blockquote>
*   **Magi System as Unconscious Model** The Magi supercomputer network, which runs NERV, is imprinted with the mind of Dr. Naoko Akagi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>. Its three parts are described as reflective of Freud's tri-part model of the human unconscious: the controlling scientist as the ego, the mother as the punishing and guilt-inducing superego, and the woman as the sexual id <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>.
*   **Ambivalence** Episode eighteen is titled "Ambivalence," another [[Psychological analysis of characters in Evangelion | Freudian idea]] that the series embraces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>. Ambivalence refers to the ability to intensely hate and love something or someone at the same time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>. For example, Shinji frequently expresses hatred for his father <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>, yet he repeatedly pilots his Eva in an effort to make his father proud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>. Shinji explains in episode twelve that he pilots the Eva to hear words of praise from Gendo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>. Despite running away from his father, NERV, and his responsibilities, he continuously returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>.

## Eros and Thanatos (Life and Death Drives)

A key [[Psychological analysis of characters in Evangelion | Freudian concept]] heavily explored in *Evangelion* is the interplay between Eros (the life drive) and Thanatos (the death drive) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>.

*   **Pleasure Principle** For Freud, beings are instilled with the pleasure principle, which is a general inclination to avoid pain and maximize pleasure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>. When Shinji finds himself in a Dirac sea (a pocket universe) in episode sixteen, he laments, "This world is filled with too much pain and suffering to keep going on" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>. This statement reflects his desire to minimize suffering in alignment with the pleasure principle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>. This struggle to avoid pain aligns with Arthur Schopenhauer's ideas about will and suffering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>, where the difficulty lies in sharing a world with others whose desires conflict with one's own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>.
*   **Death Drive** The desire for peace is central to *Evangelion*'s exploration of humanity's suffering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>. For characters like Gendo and Shinji, as well as organizations like Seele and NERV, the ultimate goal is instrumentalization: the process by which all human consciousness is combined into a primordial soup called LCL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>. This desire to join a unified whole and transcend individual concerns is a core concept in Freud's theory of the death drive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>. The death drive represents a desire to return to tranquility, the peace and harmony of the womb, where there is nothing to worry about because "the end of everything" has occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>.
    *   Episode 25 directly references this with the text: "the case of Shinji Ikari, the boy who wished for death of his own will" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>. Gendo, within Shinji's mind, explains instrumentalization:
        <blockquote>"is not a return to nothingness. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a> It is merely a return to the state of beginning. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a> It is no less than a return to the primal womb that we lost so long ago. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a> Souls and minds will become one, attaining eternal balance.” <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a></blockquote>
    *   This "return to Lilith" or "Tikkun ha-Olam" ([[Religious symbolism in Neon Genesis Evangelion | the restoration of the world]] or reunification with the primordial being) aligns with Seele and NERV's pursuit of the death drive, with Shinji as the conduit for humanity's return to a world without loneliness and isolation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>.

## Lacanian Lack

[[Philosophical themes in Neon Genesis Evangelion | Evangelion]] also touches upon the concept of "lack," as explored by the Freud-inspired psychoanalyst and philosopher Jacques Lacan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:19:59]</a>. Lack, in this context, refers to the "missing center at the heart of our existence," the gap between representation and the world in itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>. This idea manifests throughout the series as themes of scarcity of friends, failing relationships, and the distance between father and son <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:12">[00:20:12]</a>. The series consistently weaves a plot that delves into the "visceral reality of humanity’s disappointing existence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:18">[00:20:18]</a>, stemming from this inherent lack.

Harper Lee's *To Kill a Mockingbird* features three central young characters: Scout, Jem, and Dill, whose experiences drive much of the narrative and reveal themes of prejudice, justice, and maturation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Scout

Scout is one of the "three little homies" around whom the book focuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. Along with her companions, she spends a summer "harassing a nearby shut-in named Boo Radley" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. She attempts to pass Boo a note to see if he wants to socialize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

Scout faces direct confrontation when a "little punk" insults her father, Atticus, calling him a "Nigger lover" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. Later, during Halloween night, Bob Ewell attacks both Scout and Jem, but Boo Radley intervenes, saving Scout by killing Ewell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. Scout's insight, stating that punishing Boo would be like "Shootin' a mockingbird," plays a crucial role in why the town authorities decide to let Boo go "Scott free" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. This statement connects directly to [[the_significance_of_the_title_to_kill_a_mockingbird | the significance of the title]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. "Rattin' on Boo Radley wouldn't do no good," as it would only remove "one more true blue playa" from the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

Initially, Scout exhibits "Southern racism and ignorance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. However, through her interactions with Boo Radley and Tom Robinson, she matures, becoming "keepin' it real" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. A key theme of the book is "learning valuable lessons by being exposed to people of difference" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. By spending time with "a crazy cracka' like Boo Radley and a righteous black man like T. Robinson," Scout experiences "paradigm shiftin' moments" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>, realizing that these individuals are "just be tryin' to hustle like anybody else" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

## Jem

Jem is identified as Scout's "crippled brother" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Like Scout and Dill, he participates in "harassing a nearby shut-in named Boo Radley" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a> and tries to pass Boo a note <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. He is also attacked by Bob Ewell on Halloween night alongside Scout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

Jem's "crippled ass is a metaphor for America's jacked up justice system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. His arm being "f*ckin' up so young" serves as a synecdoche "for a country that was born with backward ass ideals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. Although his injury "might heal," it is destined to "leave a disabling scar on the nation" that no amount of effort can erase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

## Dill

Dill is introduced as a "homeboy" among the three main children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. He joins Scout and Jem in their summer pastime of "harassing a nearby shut-in named Boo Radley" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a> and is part of the crew that attempts to pass Boo a note <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

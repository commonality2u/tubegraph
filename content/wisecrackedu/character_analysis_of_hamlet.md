[[summary_of_hamlet_by_shakespeare | Hamlet]], the son of Queen Gertrude, becomes deeply distressed following his mother's marriage to his uncle Claudius, who quickly takes the throne after the death of the old King <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Initial Call to Action

His distress intensifies when guards inform him of his deceased father's ghost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. [[summary_of_hamlet_by_shakespeare | Hamlet]] confronts the ghost of his father, who reveals that Claudius murdered him to seize the crown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. The ghost instructs [[summary_of_hamlet_by_shakespeare | Hamlet]] to seek revenge and kill Claudius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Behavior and Actions

Initially, [[summary_of_hamlet_by_shakespeare | Hamlet]]'s agitated behavior, especially after ignoring his love interest Ophelia, leads others to believe he is merely lovesick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. However, [[summary_of_hamlet_by_shakespeare | Hamlet]] later orchestrates a play that reenacts his father's murder by Claudius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:16]</a>. When Claudius reacts by leaving the performance, [[summary_of_hamlet_by_shakespeare | Hamlet]] confirms the ghost's truthfulness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

During an argument with his mother, Gertrude, [[summary_of_hamlet_by_shakespeare | Hamlet]] mistakes Polonius, who is hiding and eavesdropping, for Claudius and stabs him through a curtain, killing him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:40]</a>. This act provokes Laertes, Polonius's son, to seek revenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

In the final confrontation, [[summary_of_hamlet_by_shakespeare | Hamlet]] engages in a duel with Laertes, using a poisoned blade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. During the duel, both [[summary_of_hamlet_by_shakespeare | Hamlet]] and Laertes are wounded by the poisoned blade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. Upon learning of Claudius's treachery from the dying Laertes, [[summary_of_hamlet_by_shakespeare | Hamlet]] stabs Claudius and forces him to drink from a poisoned cup, ultimately leading to the deaths of the royal family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:26]</a>. The kingdom is then passed to Fortinbras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

## [[hamlets_procrastination_and_motivations | Procrastination and Motivations]]

Throughout the play, [[summary_of_hamlet_by_shakespeare | Hamlet]] struggles with the task of killing Claudius, frequently delaying his actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. His [[hamlets_procrastination_and_motivations | procrastination]] is a highly debated aspect of his character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

Several theories attempt to explain [[summary_of_hamlet_by_shakespeare | Hamlet]]'s delay:
*   Some believe he is too sensitive to act violently in a corrupt world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:56]</a>.
*   Others suggest he suffers from an Oedipal complex, preventing him from killing Claudius who has done what [[summary_of_hamlet_by_shakespeare | Hamlet]] unconsciously desires: to kill his father and be with his mother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:10]</a>.
*   Another perspective is that [[summary_of_hamlet_by_shakespeare | Hamlet]] is trying to dismantle a corrupt kingdom filled with deceit and treachery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:15]</a>.

## Perception and Ambiguity

The play uses imagery of skin disease, such as "ulcerous places" and "blisters" when [[summary_of_hamlet_by_shakespeare | Hamlet]] confronts his mother, and "pocky corpses" by the gravediggers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:34]</a>. This imagery suggests that despite outward appearances of righteousness, there is underlying ruin and corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:40]</a>.

[[summary_of_hamlet_by_shakespeare | Hamlet]] is often seen as embodying the ambiguity of modernity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. Like a modern individual, [[summary_of_hamlet_by_shakespeare | Hamlet]] lacks a clear devotion to a single code and struggles with a divided mind and will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. He grapples with profound ethical and metaphysical uncertainties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:04:00]</a>.

His famous "to be or not to be" soliloquy exemplifies this [[existentialism_and_uncertainty_in_hamlet | uncertainty]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. Interpretations of this speech include:
*   [[summary_of_hamlet_by_shakespeare | Hamlet]] debating whether to live or die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:10]</a>.
*   [[summary_of_hamlet_by_shakespeare | Hamlet]] choosing between the Christian ideal of self-denial or taking violent action to claim his throne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:16]</a>.

The play itself casts the audience as characters of [[existentialism_and_uncertainty_in_hamlet | uncertainty]], raising questions such as:
*   The trustworthiness of [[summary_of_hamlet_by_shakespeare | Hamlet]]'s ghost father <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:28]</a>.
*   Gertrude's complicity in the murder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.
*   Whether the ghost is visible to everyone in Act 1 but only to [[summary_of_hamlet_by_shakespeare | Hamlet]] in Act 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:36]</a>.
*   Whether [[summary_of_hamlet_by_shakespeare | Hamlet]] is merely feigning madness or if his pretense has become reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:41]</a>. These unresolved questions suggest that the playwright has made "Hamlets of us all" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

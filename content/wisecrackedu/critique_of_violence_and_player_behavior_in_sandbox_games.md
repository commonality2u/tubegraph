Grand Theft Auto V: Critique of Violence and Player Behavior

[[satire_social_commentary_and_parody_in_grand_theft_auto_v | Grand Theft Auto V]] (GTA V) has been described as a satire, social commentary, and sarcasm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The game explores these concepts, particularly by focusing on its characters and the player's engagement with violence.

### Trevor Phillips: The ID and Player Personification

The game's opening scene in a therapist's office may not be a coincidence, as the main characters—Michael, Franklin, and Trevor—can be viewed as incarnations of Freud's model of the unconscious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. Through a [[freudian_analysis_of_video_games | Freudian analysis of video games]], Michael represents the punishing superego, Franklin the cool-headed ego, and Trevor Phillips embodies the ID, driven by desire and impulses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

Trevor, a "depraved psychopathic tweaker," fosters discussion on mental health and the war on drugs, but more pertinently, his character highlights the relationship to violence, torture, and the current state of gaming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. Trevor exhibits extreme behaviors, such as smashing a biker's face, eliminating an entire gang, or kidnapping and seducing someone's wife, showing "zero fucks to give" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

Trevor can be seen as the personification of the average GTA player – the "shit talking crazy person people become in sandbox worlds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. He reflects the sociopathic behavior often exhibited by players, thereby forcing the player to confront the "actual personification of their actions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

### Catharsis vs. Confrontation of Inner Violence

While many argue that the function of the GTA franchise is [[exploration_of_conflict_catharsis_and_human_experience_in_storytelling | catharsis]]—acting out in a virtual world to fulfill impulses before returning to peaceful existence—Trevor's deliberate psychotic nature suggests something else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. When given the choice to indulge in "debauchery" and "satiate their most violent urges," people tend to be "pretty messed up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. Trevor presents the "radical possibility" that "deep down inside we are all violent sickos" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. The "terror (and macabre pleasure)" derived from Trevor's actions compels players to confront this possibility, making Trevor a "meta-fictional element" that transforms the game into "Meta-gaming, games about games" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

### The Choice of Violence and Player Psyche

GTA V is not limited to killing, robbing, and prostituting; it also allows for mundane activities like yoga, tennis, golf, and darts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. The inclusion of these choices is not arbitrary; if mini-games like yoga are boring, the question arises: "why is massacring troves of people fun?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

Despite criticism that the game "empowers" random acts of violence, GTA V presents players with "viable, peaceful alternatives" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. Playing yoga is just as viable as performing drive-bys, yet players typically choose "to bask in destruction and chaos" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. This suggests that the game developers are making a statement about how players project their "OWN psyche and desire on to the game," rather than the developers empowering violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

### The Torture Scene: Sadism and Satire

The most controversial scene in GTA V, where Trevor tortures an informant for the FIB, clearly illustrates this point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. Trevor tortures someone without hesitation and appears to take "sick pleasure in it," with the tortured informant even screaming "sadist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. This raises the question: "who is the real sadist? Trevor? Or the gamer who enjoys acting out their psychopathic urges on fictional characters?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

This scene is not a passive acceptance of torture but "serves to over-identify with the sadistic desire to inflict harm on the threatening terrorist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. Over-identification, a "radical re-production of what is deemed taboo," is a performance tactic that undermines power through mimicry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. By forcing the player to violently enact "advanced interrogation techniques," the scene provokes a strong reaction, whether "disgust, thereby subverting the ideology of the war on terror, or even sadistic enjoyment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

This constitutes a form of satire, whose goal is "not to abuse so much as to provoke a response, ideally with some kind of reform" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. Trevor's breaking of the fourth wall creates a reflection for the gamer, forcing a confrontation with "our true psychic selves and our actual feelings about gruesome violence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

### Broader Societal Critique through Player Behavior

GTA V's depiction of violence is part of a larger critique of American culture and [[social_commentary_on_violence_and_societal_structure | social commentary on violence and societal structure]]. The game makes a statement about how players project their own psyches and desires onto the game, rather than simply being empowered by the developers to commit violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. The actions of the main characters destabilize the player's belief in the validity and seriousness of the game world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>.

Rather than being an opportunity to indulge in debauchery, Grand Theft Auto acts as "a mirror that shows America its true nature" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>. The game's creators may not be "vindictive sadists that profit off suffering," but "craftsmen that use the supposed glorification of sex, violence, and torture to create a masterful criticism of American culture" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>. To reduce GTA V to merely a game about "stealing cars and blowing stuff up" or glorifying "sex, violence, and drug use" is to miss the deeper, critical intent and the game's long string of "inside jokes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>.

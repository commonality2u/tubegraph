From: [[wisecrackedu]] <br/> 

The series *House of Cards* delves into the dark and scandalous world of politics, chronicling Frank and Claire Underwood’s quest for power and the presidency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. While many American political dramas offer a morally righteous character who triumphs over a broken system, *House of Cards* rejects this narrative, instead showing a process where raw power and cunning consistently win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:01">[00:48:01]</a>. The show poses the question: "Is there more to politics than pure [[spectacle_and_mediadriven_politics | spectacle]]?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:01">[01:01:01]</a>

## The Primacy of Appearance

In the cynical world of *House of Cards*, characters consistently maintain an image, both publicly and privately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:01">[01:11:01]</a>. The show's creators are notably "obsessed with [[the_use_of_aesthetics_and_theater_in_house_of_cards | aesthetics]]"—art and beauty—within the series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:01">[01:20:01]</a>. Important dealings often occur while reflecting on art, and Claire’s appearance is meticulously manicured, with her wardrobe frequently discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:01">[01:24:01]</a>. However, behind this carefully constructed [[the_use_of_aesthetics_and_theater_in_house_of_cards | aesthetic]] facade, the world of *House of Cards* is suggested to be "nothing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:01">[01:38:01]</a>.

The show's preoccupation with [[the_use_of_aesthetics_and_theater_in_house_of_cards | aesthetics]] also manifests in its frequent tributes to theater, particularly William Shakespeare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:01">[01:43:01]</a>. Frank Underwood often employs soliloquies and asides—theatrical devices heavily used by Shakespeare—to reveal his inner thoughts to the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:01">[01:51:01]</a>. The show's plot and characters are reminiscent of Shakespearean classics like *Macbeth* and *Richard III*, which influence Frank’s charming comments about his terrible behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:01">[01:59:01]</a>. Even Petrov, visiting the White House, quotes Richard III’s opening line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:01">[02:13:01]</a>.

[[the_use_of_aesthetics_and_theater_in_house_of_cards | Theater]] is a crucial facet of the [[the_political_philosophy_in_house_of_cards | political philosophy in House of Cards]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:01">[02:21:01]</a>. [[the_use_of_aesthetics_and_theater_in_house_of_cards | Theater]], [[the_use_of_aesthetics_and_theater_in_house_of_cards | aesthetics]], and art collectively underscore the concept that appearance drives politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:01">[02:25:01]</a>. "Politics is [[the_use_of_aesthetics_and_theater_in_house_of_cards | theater]], or, at the very least, its own kind of performance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:01">[02:31:01]</a>. For example, Frank visits his father to "seem more human" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:01">[02:35:01]</a>. Frank's breaking of the fourth wall, addressing the viewer directly, is not merely character development but a significant way to blur the distinction between the show, reality, and [[the_use_of_aesthetics_and_theater_in_house_of_cards | theater]] in politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:01">[02:47:01]</a>.

### Appearance vs. Reality

Contemporary commentators often lament that politics has devolved into entertainment, where catchphrases and slogans replace genuine political argument <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:01">[02:57:01]</a>. *House of Cards* illustrates this:
*   Frank uses the slogan "A vote for Frank Underwood is a vote for America Works!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:01">[03:06:01]</a>
*   Frank destroys Michael Kern’s career over an op-ed he didn’t write, and Kern self-destructs due to his inability to keep pace with media sensationalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:01">[03:10:01]</a>.
*   A brick through Frank’s window serves as a symbol against "out of control teachers," a fabrication by Frank himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:01">[03:18:01]</a>.

German philosopher Hannah Arendt argues that "the realm of appearances is the realm of politics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:01">[03:30:01]</a>. According to Arendt, stripping away appearances to find a core truth is pointless because "they’re the same" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:01">[03:35:01]</a>. This idea stems from the ancient Greek Polis, where politics meant engaging in the Agora, a public space where citizens’ words, rhetoric, and deeds were judged by peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:01">[03:40:01]</a>. In this context, one’s political life was identical to how they appeared to others, much like an actor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:01">[03:54:01]</a>. Arendt states that for humans, "appearance—something that can be seen or heard by others as well as ourselves, constitutes reality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:01">[04:03:01]</a>.

Frank Underwood demonstrates his understanding of this concept, stating, "We are nothing more or less than what we choose to reveal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:01">[04:10:01]</a>. This perspective challenges the traditional idea that [[the_role_of_appearance_and_reality_in_house_of_cards | appearances are deceptive and unreliable]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:01">[04:44:01]</a>. Philosophers from Plato (Allegory of the Cave) to Karl Marx (Theory of Ideology) and even modern works like *The Matrix* have explored the distinction between [[the_role_of_appearance_and_reality_in_house_of_cards | appearance and reality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:01">[04:48:01]</a>. However, Frank and Arendt undermine this tradition, asserting that for them, "appearance is reality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:01">[05:25:01]</a>.

If viewers struggle to hate Frank Underwood, it might be because "there is no stable identity to hate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:01">[05:28:01]</a>; he presents different personas to different people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:01">[05:32:01]</a>. Frank is the "epitome of a hypocrite," someone who acts inconsistently with their stated beliefs and "puts on 'false appearances'" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:01">[06:17:01]</a>. The term "hypocrite" itself originates from the Ancient Greek word for "playacting," reinforcing the notion that the politics of *House of Cards* is mere [[the_use_of_aesthetics_and_theater_in_house_of_cards | theater]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:01">[06:31:01]</a>. Frank openly admits, "The road to power is paved with hypocrisy... and casualties" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:39:01">[06:39:01]</a>.

Arendt argues that the "search for motives" and demanding that everyone display their "innermost motivation" transforms individuals into hypocrites, poisoning human relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:59:01">[06:59:01]</a>. Her solution is to recognize the inability to distinguish between "being and appearance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:01">[07:10:01]</a>. Claire Underwood, in contrast to Frank, seems to possess a suppressed authentic self that she must inhibit to continue her quest for power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:01">[07:33:01]</a>. Her love of art, like photography and origami, suggests a "yearning for authentic self-expression" and a desire to stop performing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:01">[07:54:01]</a>.

## Politics Reduced to Spectacle

In *House of Cards*, the American political system is notably devoid of its central tenet, democracy, being largely reduced to "backroom dealings and media" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:16:01">[11:16:01]</a>. Frank explicitly states, "Democracy is so overrated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:27:01">[11:27:01]</a>. Public opinion is merely a variable to be manipulated, and the media, despite its constitutional protection, is simply part of a larger political game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:34:01">[11:34:01]</a>. Examples include:
*   Zoe Barnes being fed information beneficial to Frank’s political machinations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:54:01">[11:54:01]</a>.
*   Tom Yates being hired to write what is essentially propaganda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:58:01">[11:58:01]</a>.

German philosopher Carl Schmitt posited that elements like debate and openness have become mere [[spectacle_and_mediadriven_politics | spectacle]] for the backroom dealings of party leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:06:01">[12:06:01]</a>. French philosopher Jean Baudrillard takes this further, arguing that in the modern media landscape, there is no truth behind the lies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:21:01">[12:21:01]</a>. Lies told by politicians and media take on lives of their own, circulating like commodities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:34:01">[12:34:01]</a>. Baudrillard states, "Where we think that information produces meaning, the opposite occurs. Information devours its own content" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:15:01">[13:15:01]</a>. This is exemplified when Frank tells Zoe, "It will be after you write it," regarding the truth of a statement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:24:01">[13:24:01]</a>.

This "circuit of information" is seductive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:25:01">[13:25:01]</a>. Frank Underwood himself is seductive, not only to characters within the show like Tom Yates and Meechum, but also to the viewer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:30:01">[13:30:01]</a>. Frank famously declares, "Great man once said, that everything in life is about sex... except sex. Sex is about power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:37:01">[13:37:01]</a>. The show leaves the viewer to ponder what it says about the political system if we, too, are seduced by Frank Underwood and "enjoy the performance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:50:01">[13:50:01]</a>.

Ultimately, *House of Cards* is a show about the politics of appearance, whether through art or [[the_use_of_aesthetics_and_theater_in_house_of_cards | theater]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:05:01">[14:05:01]</a>, and whether this is a negative phenomenon remains "up for debate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:09:01">[14:09:01]</a>.

### The Problem of Legacy in a Spectacle-Driven World

While Frank Underwood's ultimate drive is power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:01">[08:11:01]</a>, it is merely the foundation for his larger dream: to build a [[the_concept_of_legacy_in_house_of_cards | legacy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29:01">[08:29:01]</a>. He views his quest for power as an endeavor to create "a work of art in the form of his [[the_concept_of_legacy_in_house_of_cards | legacy]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:33:01">[08:33:01]</a>. This is contrasted with the Buddhist monks' sand painting in Season 3, a practice of meticulously creating and then destroying elaborate designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:38:01">[08:38:01]</a>. Frank is deeply annoyed by the sand mandalas, which represent the fleeting nature of existence, because he seeks immortality through power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:01">[08:48:01]</a>. He distinguishes between money (a "McMansion in Sarasota that starts falling apart after ten years") and power (an "old stone building that stands for centuries"), respecting only those who see this difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:01">[09:14:01]</a>.

Claire, however, does not detest the sand mandala, and its destruction foreshadows her departure from Frank, acknowledging that "nothing, not even her marriage, is permanent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:39:01">[09:39:01]</a>. Claire also struggles with [[the_concept_of_legacy_in_house_of_cards | legacy]], having discarded her own ambitions for Frank’s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:01">[10:00:01]</a>. A homeless person’s rejection of her money and subsequent folding of the bill into origami symbolizes her choice of "power and wealth over creation," leading her to take up origami as a hobby, representing a desire to create a [[the_concept_of_legacy_in_house_of_cards | legacy]] through family rather than power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:12:01">[10:12:01]</a>. This raises the question of whether Frank is building a lasting [[the_concept_of_legacy_in_house_of_cards | legacy]] or merely a "house of cards whose very existence is on the verge of collapse at any minute" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:34:01">[10:34:01]</a>.

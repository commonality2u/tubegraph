In William Golding's *[[summary_of_lord_of_the_flies | Lord of the Flies]]*, a group of British boys crash-land on a remote Pacific island, leading to a descent into savagery that highlights humanity's capacity for evil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Among the survivors are central figures whose actions and development drive the allegorical narrative: Ralph, Piggy, Jack, and Simon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Ralph
Ralph is one of the key survivors after a G5 plane crashes on a remote island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Early on, he and Piggy retrieve a large shell, known as "the conch," to gather the boys and conduct meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. The children quickly appoint Ralph as their leader, with Jack becoming the head hunter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. When concerns about a monster arise, Ralph attempts to reassure the younger boys, dismissing their fears as imaginary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

His leadership is challenged when Jack claims to have seen the beast and questions Ralph's courage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. Jack eventually forms his own group, encouraging others to leave Ralph's "posse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. During the frenzied attack on Simon, Ralph is also seen participating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. Later, Jack's group storms Ralph's camp, stealing Piggy's glasses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. Ralph confronts Jack, leading to a brawl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. Outnumbered after Piggy's death, Ralph flees to the shore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. He is eventually discovered by a Naval officer, who rescues the boys from their savage state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Ralph's "falling at the navy manâ€™s feet" is presented as a motif emphasizing the "fall of human kind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

## Piggy
Piggy is one of the initial survivors of the plane crash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. He works with Ralph to use the conch to gather the other boys and establish order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Despite his intelligence, he is also involved in the frenzied killing of Simon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. His glasses are the only means the boys have to make fire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. During a confrontation between Ralph and Jack, Piggy is tragically thrown off a cliff, leading to his death and the shattering of the conch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. The loss of Piggy's sight, symbolized by the theft of his glasses, is interpreted as a symbol for the "fall of reason," indicating a transition from rational order to savagery when Jack's gang steals them to make fire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

## Jack
Jack is among the survivors of the plane crash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Initially appointed as the head hunter, he struggles to kill for food but eventually overcomes his squeamishness to hunt a pig <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. Jack later blows the conch and claims to have seen the beast, challenging Ralph's leadership by suggesting Ralph lacks the courage to lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. He then invites boys to leave Ralph's "posse" and join his new crew, promising bacon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

Jack and his group kill another pig, impaling its head on a stick as an offering to the beast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. After a "whack ass dance," Jack and his "posse" storm Ralph's camp and steal Piggy's glasses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. Ralph confronts Jack, leading to a brawl where Piggy is killed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

## Simon
Simon is one of the initial survivors of the plane crash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. After Jack and his crew impale a pig's head on a stick as an offering to the beast, Simon has a vision where this pig head, referred to as "The Lord of the Flies," speaks to him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. The pig head reveals that the beast is not something to be hunted, but rather the inherent "violence in dem kids hearts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. When Simon attempts to return to camp, the other boys mistake him for the beast in a "cracked out frenzy" and kill him, with even Ralph and Piggy participating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. Simon's prophetic vision identifies the true evil on the island as originating from within human nature itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

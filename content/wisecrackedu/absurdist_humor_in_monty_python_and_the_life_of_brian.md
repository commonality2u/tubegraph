Monty Python, a group of "wily Brits," redefined comedy in the 1970s and remain highly influential today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Their work "paved the way for comedy as we know it," integrating absurdity, satire, and postmodern-reflexivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. Shows like [[satirical_social_commentary_in_south_park | South Park]] and [[Philosophy and Absurdism in Rick and Morty | Rick and Morty]] owe their existence in part to Monty Python's groundbreaking approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## The Comedy of the Absurd

The show [[Philosophy and Absurdism in Rick and Morty | Rick and Morty]] often links its "absurd humor with thought-provoking insight," particularly regarding the meaninglessness of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. This style of humor is known as "The Comedy of the Absurd" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. It is an existential-based comedy that focuses on the consequences of being confronted with a world devoid of meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. Rather than dwelling in despair, absurd comedy highlights the "broad humor in our own tragic insignificance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.

This concept of "tragic absurdity" is a foundational element of Monty Python's comedic style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.

## Absurdity in *The Life of Brian*

In Monty Python's third feature film, *The Life of Brian*, the protagonist Brian's entire existence is presented as "one big absurd misunderstanding" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.

### Projection of Significance

Brian, a humble peasant, is born in a stable next to Jesus, leading the Three Wise Men to mistakenly believe him to be the Messiah <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. This "projection of significance on the insignificant" is a core tenet of existential thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. The philosopher [[Albert Camus and Absurdism in BoJack Horseman | Albert Camus]] rejected the desperate search for meaning and instead embraced "The Absurd" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.

Examples of this misappropriation of meaning in the film include:
*   When Brian runs from his disciples, they believe he has "risen to heaven" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.
*   Later, when Brian loses a sandal, his disciples proclaim it as his "sign" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. Despite Brian's intention for it to be merely footwear, people attribute significance to it in their "desire for meaning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.
*   This is paralleled in [[Philosophy and Absurdism in Rick and Morty | Rick and Morty]]'s 'Get Schwifty' episode, where characters mistake alien heads for Gods, when they are merely reality TV show enthusiasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.

Comedies of the absurd draw humor from this "discrepancy, between what is and what isn’t, between what’s true and what people believe to be true" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

### Hopeless Situations and Fruitless Actions

Characters in absurd comedies are frequently "caught in hopeless situations, forced into repetitive and ultimately fruitless actions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. Brian exemplifies this as he "constantly tries to tell his disciples he’s not the Messiah to little avail" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>. No matter what he does, his disciples grow in number and fervor, leading to his "horrific and tragic conclusion: crucifixion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>.

Despite his impending doom, Brian finds comfort with his fellow crucifixion victims, who break out into the song "The Bright Side of Life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>. This cheerful lament reflects the Myth of Sisyphus, where Sisyphus is condemned to endlessly roll a rock up a mountain only for it to fall back down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>. [[Albert Camus and Absurdism in BoJack Horseman | Albert Camus]] famously applied this Greek myth to life itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. The key, as suggested in *The Life of Brian*, is not to let this meaninglessness "get you down" but to "Always look at the bright-side" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. When confronted with insignificance and impending doom, the only real option, however absurd, is "laughter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.

## Conclusion

The unique blend of postmodernism, political commentary, and the absurd distinguishes Monty Python from other comedy troupes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>. By merging "social commentary, existential angst and just plain ol’ silliness," The Pythons consistently defied convention, creating a brand of comedy so singular that the term "Pythonesque" was coined for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:49">[00:16:49]</a>.

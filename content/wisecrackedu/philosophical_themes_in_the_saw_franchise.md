The *Saw* franchise, initiated in 2004, is a popular Halloween horror series known for locking "morally-dubious characters" in gruesome steel contraptions and inventing creative ways to hide keys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. The series features Jigsaw, a "creepy puppet-master" who devises games where unconscious people are given 60 seconds to choose between certain death, self-mutilation, or disemboweling a stranger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. While many focus on Jigsaw's "impressive body count," his deadly traps conceal a "grander meaning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## Jigsaw's Core Motivation

The philosophy of *Saw* centers on Jigsaw's motivation: his torturous games serve as opportunities for victims to "repent for their sins" and, ostensibly, transform into "better human beings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. If they survive his tests, Jigsaw believes they will emerge with a "newfound ability to appreciate life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. He remarks, "Most people are so ungrateful to be alive. But not you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

## The Origin of Jigsaw: John Kramer's Story

Jigsaw, whose real name is John Kramer, once lived as a civil engineer married to Jill, who owned a drug rehab clinic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. Their lives took a tragic turn when Jill suffered a miscarriage after one of her patients, Cecil Adams, robbed her clinic and injured her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. John subsequently fell into a deep depression and was diagnosed with a brain tumor and terminal cancer, further deteriorating his relationship with Jill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. After a terrible year, John attempted suicide by driving off a cliff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. Miraculously, he survived, leading him to believe in a new calling: "dispensing morality, one torture device at a time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

## [[early_christian_philosophy_and_suffering_in_saw | Early Christian Philosophy and Suffering]]

John Kramer's new "code of morality" appears to be inspired by [[early_christian_philosophy_and_suffering_in_saw | early Christian philosophy]], particularly its views on suffering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

### Suffering as a Consequence of Sin
According to [[early_christian_philosophy_and_suffering_in_saw | Early Christian tradition]], God is good and created everything good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. Theologians rationalized suffering by theorizing it was the fault of "no-good, lousy humans" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. This perspective holds that when Adam committed the Original Sin by eating from the Tree of Knowledge, he separated humans from God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. Consequently, sinful humans must suffer and repent to be reunited with God, making suffering "the result of our own sins" and an "expression of the pain we feel over our separation from God" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

Similarly, Jigsaw believes his victims deserve the suffering they endure in his traps, reminding them of the sins that led them there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. He perceives his victims as "enslaved by their past immorality," not his torture devices, paralleling the theological belief that humanity is trapped by Adam and Eve's original sin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

The *Saw* series features its own "Adams":
*   In *Saw IV*, drug addict Cecil Adams is responsible for Jill's miscarriage, acting as the "original sin" that catalyzes John's transformation into Jigsaw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.
*   In the first film, Adam Stanheight, a photographer who spies on people, becomes a target, with his "professional quest for seedy 'knowledge'" mirroring Adam's desire to eat from the Tree of Knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

## Søren Kierkegaard and Personal Growth through Suffering

John Kramer also shares common ground with Søren Kierkegaard, a Christian theorist and "father of Existentialism," who viewed suffering as a critical part of "personal and spiritual growth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. Like Kramer, Kierkegaard faced personal hardships, including a lifelong physical deformity, the early deaths of family members, and a broken engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. Both believed that suffering "purifies the sufferer, teaches them to appreciate life, and forces them to take responsibility for their actions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

### Stages of Development and the Role of Suffering
Kierkegaard proposed that individuals must pass through three distinct phases to become their "true self" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>:
1.  **The Aesthetic:** Driven by sensual pleasures and lacking morality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.
2.  **The Ethical:** Driven by morality and a belief in individual responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
3.  **The Religious:** Driven by faith in God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

According to Kierkegaard, "suffering is key to moving up to the next stage of human development" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. While Kierkegaard primarily discussed spiritual and existential suffering, Jigsaw's machines can be seen as "a test for each of his victims," who are often "aesthetes driven by desires for sex, drugs, or money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. His tests present victims with "an ethical quandary that usually forces them to make a painful decision" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

Suffering, for Kierkegaard, forces individuals to reflect on their situation, leading to "the first doubt" – the thought, "Why is this happening to me; can it not be otherwise?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. This moment generates a desire to change circumstances, opening a person to "ethical self-understanding" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. Ultimately, suffering can compel a person to repent for past sins, take responsibility for guilt, and choose survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

### Rebirth and the Death of the "False Self"
As one progresses through the stages of development, a "piece of your old, ‘false self,’ dies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. John Kramer echoed this idea after his car crash, stating, "A different person crawled out through the wreckage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. For Kierkegaard, the goal of spiritual suffering is to "completely kill off your flawed, false self in order to make room for your recreation into a better, truer self" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.

Jigsaw demands this of his follower, Amanda, asking her to commit fully to his ethical code: "You will give everything to me. Every cell in your body... You leave that life behind. When you go down that corridor, there is no turning back, do you understand that?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. This scene is often called "Amanda's baptism" by fans, fitting Christian tradition where baptism represents spiritual cleansing and rebirth, much like Jesus rising from the dead to redeem humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. Jigsaw frequently references this concept of rebirth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. He even initiates his first "kidnapping" during a Chinese New Year celebration, a literal celebration of rebirth, where he acquires his trademark pig mask <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.

## Personal Responsibility and Choice

Kierkegaard and Jigsaw both highly value personal responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. Kierkegaard wrote that becoming "a real man" involves becoming a "responsible individual before God" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. Kramer imposes the same demand on his victims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.

Making a choice is seen as key to taking responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. Kramer pushes his victims towards "life-affirming action" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. Kierkegaard believed that "in the moment of making a choice," a man "becomes himself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. Kramer emphasizes this by ending each game with the refrain: "The decisions are up to them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. He maintains that the individual is responsible for the outcome of their decision within his game's confines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

## Critique of Jigsaw's Philosophy

Despite the philosophical underpinnings, *Saw* critiques this "extreme version of traditional Christian morality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. Kramer is often portrayed as a "god-like figure, monk, or even martyr," dressing in a black hooded cape, acquiring disciples, and performing "baptisms" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. He maintains "a quality of omniscience," watching victims through cameras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.

However, Jigsaw is presented as a "seriously failed" God-like figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. His attempts to establish a moral order do not bring about the "meaningful change that Kramer professes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. Most victims fail his tests, crumbling under pressure or pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>, and those who do pass are frequently traumatized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.

Jigsaw's "ill-fated quest for the right apprentice" further reveals his failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>. While Jigsaw's games are winnable if the rules are followed, his mentees twist his philosophy, creating "rigged games that are unwinnable death traps" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. His disciples use the games for revenge, leading to them trapping and killing one another out of jealousy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. To them, the point is "punishment, rather than renewal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.

The characters within the *Saw* films frequently highlight the flaws in Jigsaw's moral code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. Just before her death, Amanda denounces him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>. Despite being a God-like figure, Jigsaw's justice is "not dispensed fairly," and his morality lessons "frequently sacrifice innocent human lives" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>. His own death is the result of one of his tests' "ultimate failures," as Jeff violently kills him instead of offering forgiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.

Ultimately, the *Saw* franchise explores intense philosophical questions about suffering, responsibility, and rebirth, even as it critiques the extreme application of such beliefs.

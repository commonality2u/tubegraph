*Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood* explores complex philosophical questions surrounding the efficacy and application of science, or "Alchemy," and the role of faith in society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. The series challenges viewers to question blind adherence to any single ideology, whether scientific or religious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## Alchemy as Science

In *Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood*, alchemy is presented as a science that combines chemistry and biology, governed by its own unique laws and principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. Its most important law is "The Law of Equivalent Exchange," which dictates that to obtain something, something of equal value must be given <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. This law is central to the brothers' journey, as they use alchemy to try and restore their bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## Early Confrontations: Faith's Deception

The show immediately establishes a dynamic between science and faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. In Episode 3, Edward and Alphonse Elric encounter Father Cornello, a holy figure in the desert town of Liore who controls people through "miracles" and "Leto-ism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. The brothers' skepticism towards the divine is justified when they expose Cornello's miracles as clever applications of alchemy used to attract followers willing to die for him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. This initial portrayal suggests that science can expose the fraudulent nature of unquestioning faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

## The Dark Side of Science: A Critique of Scientism

However, the series quickly demonstrates that science, too, can be a source of atrocity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. Shou Tucker, known as the Sewing-Life Alchemist, brutally uses his family dog and his own daughter as components to create a talking chimera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. Tucker claims his actions are simply what "science demands," highlighting the amoral pursuit of scientific knowledge at any cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

This ethical vacuum leads the show to question the value of single-mindedly clinging to science and reducing all knowledge to scientific terms, a mode of thought known as [[critiques_of_scientism_through_anime | scientism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. Philosopher Paul Feyerabend, whose ideas are invoked, argues that science is merely one of many explanatory frameworks, not necessarily more rational or consistent than others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. He cautions against the unquestioning acceptance of science, much like any other ideology, as it can lead to "disastrous results" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.

"An education that does not make people capable of judging science and scientists but leaves this task to scientists only is a bad education." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>
</div>

Indeed, [[alchemy_as_science_and_its_moral_implications | alchemy]] creates monsters in *Brotherhood*, such as chimeras referred to as "ungodly experiments" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. The Law of Equivalent Exchange itself can be seen as dehumanizing, reducing objects, animals, and people to their physical components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. The Elrics' journey begins with their belief that they can revive their mother by transmuting the basic ingredients of a human being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

The most sought-after alchemic creation, "The Philosopher's Stone," further exemplifies this dehumanization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. The key ingredient for the stone is human life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. While the stone can restore bodies, the Elrics are unwilling to use it due to its origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. In contrast, the Homunculi, artificial humans powered by these stones, reduce the souls within them to mere alchemic principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

The brothers, however, demonstrate a moral distinction by respecting the autonomy of these souls when they do use the stones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. This aligns with philosopher Immanuel Kant's categorical imperative, which posits that people should never be used as a means to an end but rather always as a goal in themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

## Science Subservient to the State

A major problem with alchemy in *Brotherhood* is its subservience to the military <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. State Alchemists are bound by tenets that include explicit obedience to the military and are often referred to as "dogs of the military" or "human weapons" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.

Sociologist Stanley Aronowitz, in "Science Wars," notes that scientists often view themselves as independent but are reliant on funding from corporations or the state, thus losing control over the application of their discoveries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. This resonates with Ed's constant clashes with the militarization of science and his own complicity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.

The military's influence even distorts the basic principles of science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. The understanding of alchemy as understanding the "natural flow of energy," both deconstructing and reconstructing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>, is twisted into "Alchemic Rebirth" to justify the destruction of entire countries and populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

State alchemists become instruments of the series' chief antagonist, "Father," who controls the Amestrian state and desires to become God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. Father uses alchemy, military conflicts, and millions of lives to achieve his goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. The "Ishbalan War of Extermination," a brutal genocide, was fought solely to further Father's plan, with state alchemists making the largest military impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. The sanitizing nature of scientific language is used to describe this genocide in "sterile scientific terms" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.

The country of Amestris draws parallels to pre-World War II Germany, with its military expansion, blond-haired, blue-eyed army reminiscent of the SS, and a "Might is Right" motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. General Raven even invokes Social Darwinism to justify mass extermination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. The human experiments conducted in Amestris are compared to those of Dr. Josef Mengele at Auschwitz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. Having fought as a lieutenant in World War II, Feyerabend's call for a separation between science and state, with ultimate power resting in democracy, becomes especially poignant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>.

<div class="callout" data-callout="quote">
"A free society is a society in which all traditions have equal rights and equal access to the centers of power. The separation of church and state must therefore be complemented by the separation of science and state." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>
</div>

## Faith: Another Explanatory Model

While *Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood* presents a cautionary tale about the blind adherence to science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>, it also portrays faith as another explanatory model and source of truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>. Even in a show dominated by scientists, characters make appeals to faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>:
*   Ed and Al are awestruck by the delivery of a baby, recognizing the limitations of alchemy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>.
*   Dr. Marcoh calls it "fate" that he met Scar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.
*   Knox invokes God upon his family's return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>.
*   Even Homunculus King Bradley wonders if his death was "providence," referencing a prophecy from the Ishbalan people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>.

However, the show does not suggest that faith is inherently good or that science is inherently bad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. Feyerabend's main contention is against the "unreflective veneration of any ideology" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>. Just as blind adherence to science is harmful, so too is the blind following of faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>. Father Cornello uses Leto-ism to incite violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>, and Scar initially justifies his vengeance against alchemists through his God, "Ishvala" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>.

## Synthesis and Growth: Beyond Single Ideologies

Characters in *Brotherhood* grow when they recognize the limitations of adhering to any one ideology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. The Elric brothers, for instance, question the foundations of Western Alchemy when Father cancels it out, leading them to investigate Alkahestry, science's eastern equivalent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>. It is by bridging these two ideologies that the heroes ultimately triumph, combining them to create a reverse transmutation circle that saves Amestris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>.

Scar's transformation particularly embodies this development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>. Initially, a survivor of the Ishbalan war, he targets State Alchemists for revenge, viewing them as transgressors against God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>. However, as he learns more, he realizes the error of seeking vengeance and that no ideology can justify murder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>. Scar even breaks from his strict religious laws by using the very alchemy his God abhors to save the country he once hated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>.

## The Elrics vs. Father: The Ultimate Ideological Clash

The series' main antagonist, Father, stands in stark contrast to Scar's transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>. Father clings to a single-minded belief in science and becomes obsessed with the power of [[alchemy_as_science_and_its_moral_implications | alchemy]], viewing mankind as mere materials to achieve godhood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>. Blinded by [[critiques_of_scientism_through_anime | scientism]], he discards human emotions and souls, unable to understand their value or autonomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>. Ultimately, this conviction in the absolute supremacy of science undoes him, as the souls he dismissed as mere energy assert their will against him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>. When confronted by "Truth," a being representing God, Father still demands to know what he did wrong, unable to recognize wisdom beyond alchemy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a>.

In contrast, Edward and Alphonse Elric's special quality lies in their humble rejection of a single ideology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>. From the outset, they grapple with the nature of alchemy and their role as State Alchemists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>. Their core desire is to discover their "own truth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:28">[00:19:28]</a>. When faced with the choice to sacrifice the world's safety for their bodies through the Philosopher's Stone, Al rejects this "alchemic worldview" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>.

Ed's final act solidifies this philosophical stance: he sacrifices his ability to perform alchemy to bring Alphonse back from the portal of "Truth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>. He recognizes the arrogance in thinking that alchemy could explain everything or solve all his problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>. Unlike Father, who equated alchemy with power, Ed understands that true wisdom lies in seeking possibilities and contributing to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:40">[00:20:40]</a>.

The Elrics' journey ends not with a definitive answer but with a continued search for truth and new methods to discover it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:06">[00:21:06]</a>. They seek to "give back" to those who helped them, transforming the cold formula of "Equivalent Exchange" into a principle of mutual support and ongoing exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">[00:21:11]</a>. Al travels east and Ed west, symbolizing their commitment to gathering all knowledge and bridging different forms of understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:32">[00:21:32]</a>.

In conclusion, *Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood* serves as a powerful reminder that while science can be a tool for understanding and progress, its unquestioning adherence can lead to dehumanization and atrocity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:11">[00:22:11]</a>. Similarly, faith, while offering guidance, can also be manipulated for tyranny and violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>. The show advocates for a balanced approach, where knowledge is sought from diverse sources, and critical thought prevents the blind veneration of any single ideology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>.

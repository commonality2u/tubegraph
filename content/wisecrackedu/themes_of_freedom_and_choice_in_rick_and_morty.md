The *Rick and Morty* episode "Pickle Rick" provides a deep dive into the themes of freedom and choice, particularly through the lens of Rick's motivations and the philosophical concepts he embodies or defies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## Rick's Avoidance of Choice
Rick's decision to transform himself into a pickle is initially presented as a deliberate effort to evade family therapy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. He goes to extreme lengths to avoid confronting his emotions in therapy, paralleling Beth's own attempts to maintain emotional distance from her school-appointed therapist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. This act highlights a recurring theme in the season where Rick avoids dealing with personal realities, such as his daughter's divorce, by escaping to different realities or transforming himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

## Dr. Wong's Perspective on Control
Dr. Wong, the family therapist, challenges Rick's perception of control and choice during a session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. She asserts that the only concept truly unapproachable for Rick is that his mind is within his control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. She emphasizes that Rick *chose* to be there, *chose* to talk, *chose* to belittle her vocation, and *chose* to become a pickle, stating that "Each of us gets to choose" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. This directly contradicts Rick's belief that he can do anything because he could <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

## Philosophical Underpinnings: Sartre and Bad Faith
The episode delves into [[philosophy_and_existentialism_in_rick_and_morty | existential philosophy]], particularly the ideas of [[philosophy_and_existentialism_in_rick_and_morty | Jean Paul Sartre]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. For Sartre, the absence of God implies radical freedom, where individuals are free to define their own existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. However, people often act in "[[philosophy_and_existentialism_in_rick_and_morty | bad faith]]" by making choices based on social pressures or perceived obligations, denying their true freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

Sartre also introduced the concept of "finitude," referring to the fixed number of choices available in mortal life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. Each choice made prevents other choices; for instance, choosing to be a truck driver means choosing not to be a teacher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. Denying the importance of these finite choices is another form of [[philosophy_and_existentialism_in_rick_and_morty | bad faith]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

## Rick's Infinitude vs. Finitude
Rick, uniquely, does not deal with finitude but with "infinitude" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. His access to infinite timelines seemingly removes the necessity of attachment and the weight of singular choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. This contrasts sharply with Sartre's critique of individuals who refuse to take responsibility for their choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. Rick believes he doesn't have to take responsibility because he has already made all possible choices across infinite versions of himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

## The Paradox of Rick's Intelligence and Choices
Despite his "god-like intelligence" and mastery of the universe, Rick paradoxically struggles to come to terms with his own choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. Dr. Wong suggests that Rick, like his family, uses his intelligence to justify his sickness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. Regardless of the existence of infinite Ricks, his choices remain uniquely his own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. Rick's strategy for dealing with infinite choices, as he advised Morty in Season 1, is "don't think about it!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. His transformation into Pickle Rick is an attempt to avoid choice, or at least its appearance, by becoming seemingly helpless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. This blatant disregard for his choices is, in Sartre's terms, acting in [[philosophy_and_existentialism_in_rick_and_morty | bad faith]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

## Broader Themes of Agency
The episode, and the season as a whole, leans into broader ideas of [[critiques_of_individualism_and_conformity_in_rick_and_morty | agency]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. Rick's declaration that he doesn't respect therapy because he "invent[s], transform[s], create[s], and destroy[s] for a living" and changes the world when he dislikes something about it, highlights his extreme view of personal agency and control over reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

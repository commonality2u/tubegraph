## Characters and Their Religious Allusions

### Neo: The Christ Figure
Neo, whose name means "new" in Greek and is an anagram for "One," is presented as a Christ figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>. His civilian name, Thomas Anderson, contains further allusions:
*   **Thomas**: References the Apostle Thomas, also known as "doubting Thomas," who initially expressed skepticism about Jesus as a savior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>.
*   **Anderson**: Etymologically means "son of man," a nickname Jesus sometimes used among his mortal friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.

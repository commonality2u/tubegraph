Frank Miller's graphic novel, *The Dark Knight Returns*, serves as the "biggest inspiration" for the film *Batman v. Superman* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37">[01:37]</a>. The film draws heavily from this work, adopting numerous narrative and visual cues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43">[01:43]</a>.

## Direct Influences on *Batman v. Superman*

*   **An older, broken Bruce Wayne** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43">[01:43]</a>
*   **Superman being hit by a nuclear warhead and subsequently healed by the sun** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47">[01:47]</a>
*   **Robin's memorialized costume in Batman's lair** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51">[01:51]</a>
*   **The central fight between Batman and Superman**, where Superman attempts to reason with Batman, who refuses to listen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54">[01:54]</a>

## Ideological Foundation: Ayn Rand's *The Fountainhead*

Beneath the surface of *The Dark Knight Returns* lies an influential ideological inspiration: Ayn Rand's novel, *The Fountainhead* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02">[02:02]</a>. Frank Miller explicitly cites Rand as a significant influence on his work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34">[02:34]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Rand's "Ideal Man"
> Both Miller and Snyder are drawn to Rand's portrayal of male heroes, exemplified by Howard Roark in *The Fountainhead* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48">[02:48]</a>. Roark is depicted as the "IDEAL man" who achieves his goals without compromising his integrity, even if it leads to conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53">[02:53]</a>. This archetype is defined by "ethical egoism," the belief that pursuing one's best self-interest is the optimal course of action for happiness, a core tenet of Rand's philosophy, Objectivism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05">[03:05]</a>. Rand's male hero is a radical individualist: unyielding, intelligent, and physically appealing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22">[03:22]</a>.

This "Randian hero" concept perfectly aligns with Miller's portrayal of Batman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33">[03:33]</a>. Miller's Batman is a wealthy, attractive playboy with a genius intellect who refuses to submit to anyone else's will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37">[03:37]</a>.

## Ideological Conflict in *The Dark Knight Returns*

Batman's adherence to Randian egoism creates the core ideological conflict between him and Superman: individualism versus collectivism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44">[03:44]</a>.

In Miller's narrative:
*   **Batman** faces constant opposition from the U.S. Government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03">[04:03]</a>.
*   **Superman** is presented as the "anti-Rand figure" or a "Government Stooge," whose self-sacrificing moral righteousness and commitment to "good" mark him as a conformist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13">[04:13]</a>.

The drama in Miller's graphic novel arises from these contrasting ideologies: Batman's individualism against Superman's conformism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27">[04:27]</a>. Miller successfully integrates Rand's theories to forge a compelling internal conflict between the two characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35">[04:35]</a>.

## *Batman v. Superman*'s Interpretation

While *Batman v. Superman* adopts Miller's Randian Batman, its depiction of Superman muddles the ideological distinction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45">[04:45]</a>.

*   **Batman**: Ben Affleck's Batman largely aligns with Miller's Randian take, portraying him as handsome, unnaturally athletic, supremely intelligent, and a complete individualist who disobeys judicial processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56">[04:56]</a>. His concern about Superman's god-like status reflects Rand's atheism, as a god figure undermines ethical egoism and personal rational choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29">[05:29]</a>.
*   **Superman**: Unlike Miller's collectivist "stooge" portrayal, *BvS* attempts to make Superman relatable by emphasizing his vulnerabilities and doubts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59">[00:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58">[05:58]</a>. The film presents Superman as torn between being a benevolent savior ("The God," like Christopher Reeve's portrayal) and a Randian Objectivist ("The Man," who prioritizes personal interests like Lois over saving all innocents) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51">[06:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03">[07:03]</a>.

This dual portrayal, particularly influenced by Martha Kent's and Jonathan Kent's advice encouraging self-interest and rational choice, leads to Superman's ambiguous philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:26">[07:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:57">[07:57]</a>. He sacrifices himself in a "Messianic fashion" while also explicitly stating his actions are for Lois <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07">[09:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16">[09:16]</a>.

As a result, despite paying "lip service" to the differing beliefs between Batman (questioning a benevolent savior) and Superman (seeing Batman as a vigilante) similar to Miller's work, *Batman v. Superman* "immediately upends it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:38">[09:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00">[10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:08">[10:08]</a>. By making Superman more Randian for relatability, the film unintentionally eliminates the ideological difference between the two characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31">[10:31]</a>. This ultimately results in a muddled philosophical message, where the solution is simply "MORE HEROS" for the Justice League, rather than a clear preference for one type of heroism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:13">[11:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:16">[11:16]</a>.

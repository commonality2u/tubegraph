*Idiocracy*, released in 2006, has become a cult classic lauded not only for its humor but also for its [[political_satire_and_antiintellectualism_in_idiocracy | political prescience]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. While presented as the story of Joe Bauers, an unwitting time traveler, it is primarily regarded as a cultural artifact that reflects society's perceived gradual degeneration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Society in *Idiocracy*

The film depicts a future America where a pro-wrestler serves as president, politics has devolved into shouting matches, healthcare is determined by gambling, and corporations feign concern for consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. The language has deteriorated to a mix of hillbilly, valley-girl, inner-city slang, and grunts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. Even basic terms like "tortillas" have been forgotten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. The world is plagued by mountains of trash, and a sports drink called Brawndo has replaced water for irrigation, leading to famine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. Entertainment primarily consists of retail HJs, porn, ball-kicking, and farts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

Joe Bauers, chosen for a military freezing experiment, wakes up 500 years later to discover he is the smartest man alive in a world full of "imbeciles" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. He is appointed Secretary of Interior by President Dwayne Elizondo Mountain Dew Herbert Camacho <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

Leading up to the 2016 U.S. election, screenwriter Etan Cohen humorously remarked that *Idiocracy* had become a documentary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. *Fast Company* similarly highlighted the "undeniable" parallels between President Camacho and Donald Trump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. The film's uncanny similarities to modern society extend to phenomena like fully automated fast food and seemingly inoffensive content compared to "Ow my balls" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

## Roots in the Bush Era

Released during the Bush era, *Idiocracy* is "saturated with jabs at Bush's base of supporters," particularly those from the Southern U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. It includes a swipe at Fox News <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>, and depicts characters whose clothing resembles NASCAR uniforms due to corporate sponsors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. The portrayal of judges and politicians appealing to "folk wisdom" also invokes the image of a Texas governor who seemed like "a guy you could have a beer with" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

## Anti-Intellectualism vs. Pseudo-Intellectualism

One core commentary in *Idiocracy* concerns anti-intellectualism, evident in characters calling intelligent speech "fag talk" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a> and a pervasive inability to count or read <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. The justice system is depicted as a "farce" based on "non-sensical appeals to common sense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>, resembling a mix of a gladiator fight and a monster truck rally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. Director Mike Judge seemed to suggest that "illiterate yokels were ruining democracy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

However, a counter-argument posits that contemporary society is not anti-intellectual but "pseudo-intellectual" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. While anti-intellectualism involves dismissing those who appreciate books and art, pseudo-intellectualism involves individuals "gallivanting around, as if they appreciate scholarship and information, but are largely full of shit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

Examples like Flat Earthers and anti-vaxxers illustrate this, as they present seemingly "real arguments" with "evidence" and "complicated formulas," even if debunked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. This phenomenon suggests that the issue isn't an "aversion to logic and information" but rather "the embracing of a different kind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. Even highly educated areas like Silicon Valley have seen the spread of anti-vaxxerism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. Therefore, the film's take on [[political_satire_and_antiintellectualism_in_idiocracy | anti-intellectualism]] may not be as prophetic as some believe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.

## [[Pseudoscience and the Theme of Too Many Babies in Idiocracy | The "Too Many Babies" Theory and Eugenics]]

*Idiocracy* proposes that the world became unintelligent because "dumb, irresponsible people have tons of dumb, irresponsible kids at rates that vastly exceeds that of your 'upstanding' citizens" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. This concept mirrors Henry Herbert Goddard's influential 1912 book, *The Kallikak Family*, which studied a family line alleged to beget "generations of idiots" due to a soldier's fling with a "tavern girl" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. Goddard's work popularized the idea of "feeble-mindedness" and contributed to the Eugenics movement, which led to widespread forced sterilization programs across America and a Supreme Court case upholding such laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.

Mike Judge has addressed criticism that *Idiocracy* is pro-eugenics, stating that the opening sequence explicitly covers both "nature and nurture," highlighting the irresponsible parenting of the "dumb" characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. He affirmed, "I obviously don't believe in eugenics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.

Despite the film's depiction of declining IQ scores, the opposite has been observed in reality: IQ scores have been increasing by an average of 3 points annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. The idea of "cultural deterioration" is also an "old complaint" that has "never really true" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>. Historically, perceived declines in language and culture (e.g., Andrew Jackson's chaotic inauguration, Theodor Adorno's critique of Jazz, persistent complaints about youth language) have always been present but ultimately unfounded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. In fact, language "deterioration" leads to the creation of new languages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.

## Corporate Culture and Spectacle

One of Judge's most accurate observations is the increasing "infiltration of corporate culture into our personal lives" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>. The film features:
*   Pervasive corporate greetings like "Welcome to Costco, I love you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>.
*   Characters named after brands (Frito, Dr. Lexus, Formica, Velveeta, Hormel, and President Dwayne Elizondo Mountain Dew Herbert Camacho) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>.
*   Corporate mergers with government, such as "AOL, Time Warner, Taco Bell, US Government Long distance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.
*   Corporations having legal custody of children, as exemplified by Carl's Jr. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.
*   Government bodies like "The House of Representin’" being sponsored by companies like "Uhmerican EXXXPress" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>.
*   Politicians openly declaring their corporate sponsorship, like the Secretary of State stating, "I'm the Secretary of state, brought to you by Carl’s Jr. Why do you keep saying that? Because they pay me every time I do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>.

Judge's depiction of corporate influence was not invented "out of thin air" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>. It reflects concerns about corporate lobbying and figures like former Vice President Dick Cheney, a former oil company CEO, or officials with ties to Goldman Sachs and Verizon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>. The idea of a sports drink company buying regulatory bodies like the FDA and FCC to promote its agenda is seen as "on-the-nose hyperbole about how politics already works" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>. The rise of branded content further blurs the lines between public discourse and private companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>.

This diminishing gap between corporations, media, and government has also led to the "spectacle-ization of politics," where "only sex and violence can capture the public imagination" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>.

## Conclusion

*Idiocracy* serves as a "hilarious snapshot of early 2000's paranoia" about the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>. While some of its fears regarding cultural decline and intelligence may be "misdirected," it functions as a cautionary tale about the consequences of individuals ceding their ability to think critically and becoming "mindless consumers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>.

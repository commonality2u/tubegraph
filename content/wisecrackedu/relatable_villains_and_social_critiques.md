Villains are often considered the best part of a movie, figures audiences love to hate or fear, sometimes with a touch of empathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. In recent years, audiences have found themselves nodding along to diabolical plots or feeling more empathetic than usual towards antagonists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Today's villains, such as Killmonger in *Black Panther* and Screenslaver in *The Incredibles 2*, have become "weirdly relatable," each presenting "cogent critiques of the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. Villainy has always reflected the value systems and fears of its time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Evolution of Villain Archetypes

To understand the emergence of relatable villains, it's essential to explore how film villains have embodied the spirit and anxieties of different eras, acknowledging that trends are not absolute but represent noticeable shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

### From "The Other" to Systemic Corruption (1950s-1970s)

In the 1950s and early 1960s, a period defined by the Cold War, villains were often simple, black-and-white representations of "the other" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. These included "bad Russian people, bad Asian people, and very bad aliens," designed as inherent, inexplicable evils threatening American values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. Examples range from the amorphous, "red-for-commie Blob" to aliens in *The Invasion of the Body Snatchers*, which some critics interpreted as fears of Communist brainwashing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. Biblical sagas also portrayed villains as cruel despots of non-monotheistic religions, representing larger groups threatening "Judeo-Christian" values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

By the late 1960s and 1970s, a definitive shift occurred in the portrayal of villains, fitting a time of major social turbulence, including the Civil Rights Movement and the Vietnam War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. Public trust in government significantly dropped, leading to movies that "shined a light on the corrupt social systems" Americans were disillusioned with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. Evil politicians and public officials became prominent, seen in films like *All the President’s Men* and *Jaws*, where a crooked mayor prioritized tourism over public safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. This era also introduced the idea that "circumstances of power make the villain, rather than any innate nature," as suggested in *Chinatown* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

Corrupt institutions and their enforcers were also depicted as villains, such as Nurse Ratched in *One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest*, who turned a benevolent profession into one that broke individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. Similarly, wardens in films like *East from Alcatraz* and *Cool Hand Luke* were recast as antagonists against sympathetic prisoners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. The 1970s blurred the lines between hero and villain, portraying protagonists as conflicted, heavily-flawed, and sometimes villains of circumstance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. Characters like Travis Bickle in *Taxi Driver* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a> and Sonny Wortzik in *Dog Day Afternoon* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a> were driven by complex motivations, with Sonny’s bank robbery intended to fund his wife’s sexual reassignment surgery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.

### Philosophical Undertones and Domestic Threats (1980s-1990s)

While the 1980s saw a return to more cartoonish villains reflecting fears like the War on Drugs and the Cold War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>, there were hints of the 70s skepticism towards institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>. Villains like Gordon "Greed is Good" Gekko exploited corrupt financial industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. Hans Gruber in *Die Hard* presented himself as a terrorist exacting revenge on a corrupt corporation, though his true motive was wealth, mirroring Gekko <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.

The 1990s introduced "disgruntled middle class dudes" and "bombers next door," marking an era for complex anti-villains fighting localized battles with radical methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. Howard Payne from *Speed*, a former bomb squad officer, was motivated not just by money but by a sense of superiority and a philosophical desire for "meaning" and "purpose" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>. Similarly, John Doe in *Se7en* saw himself as a "chosen" warrior against everyday sin, aiming to "set the example" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>. By the end of the decade, villains like the one in *Arlington Road* posed as ordinary neighbors, carrying out deadly bombings while criticizing government and the perceived niceties of Clinton-era prosperity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>. These villains often felt victimized by the system and sought justice on their own terms, sometimes even having "genuinely noble causes" as they railed against systems that had wronged them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>. General Hummel in *The Rock*, for example, held San Francisco hostage to demand compensation for slain Marines' families <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>, raising the question of whether noble ends justify violent means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>.

## Contemporary Villains: Radical Solutions to Broken Systems

After the nihilistic villains of the 2000s, who often operated without rules or believed life was meaningless (like the Joker in *The Dark Knight* or Anton Chigurh in *No Country For Old Men*) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>, contemporary villains have undergone a significant shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>. They are a product of an increasingly divided America with low trust in government, media, and religious faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>.

These modern villains embody radical and often violent solutions to what they perceive as "objectively evil systems" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>. Unlike 1950s villains who sought to corrupt an inherently good system, today's antagonists aim to effect good change within corrupt institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>. Their villainy stems from their extreme methods, rather than their underlying critique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>.

Key examples include:

*   **Killmonger (*Black Panther*)**: He presents a legitimate critique of global treatment of black citizens and Wakanda’s passivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>. His radical plan to arm a militant uprising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a> ultimately leads to positive policy changes in Wakanda, such as ending its isolationism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:36">[00:19:36]</a>.
*   **August Walker/John Lark (*Mission Impossible 6*)**: This utilitarian villain seeks to destroy one-third of the world's population, believing "the greater the suffering, the greater the peace" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:43">[00:19:43]</a>.
*   **Thanos (*Infinity War*)**: He aims to eliminate half the universe's population to solve resource scarcities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:03">[00:20:03]</a>.
*   **Screenslaver (*The Incredibles 2*)**: Her "personal beef with the system" is that endless media consumption has made people passive and that superheroes perpetuate this docility. Her plan is to mind-control heroes to ruin their public approval, forcing people to protect themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>.

These villains share a desire to dismantle systems they see as beyond repair, appealing to a growing fear that the world is inherently flawed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:33">[00:20:33]</a>. Audiences can empathize with their critiques and their desire for change, even if their methods are extreme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:44">[00:20:44]</a>. In this "through the looking glass" reinterpretation, heroes are often cast as slightly flawed protectors of an undesirable status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:52">[00:20:52]</a>.

Contemporary villains represent a complex evolution, merging the nuanced motivations of 1990s villains with the broader [[social_commentary_in_horror_films|social critiques]] of the 1970s, while standing in opposition to the nihilism of the 2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:14">[00:21:14]</a>. They believe in a cause worth fighting for, suggesting that with different methods for social change, they might even re-emerge as "complex heroes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a>.

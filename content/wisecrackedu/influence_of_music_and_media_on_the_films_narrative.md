Quentin Tarantino's *Django Unchained* offers a "clever, nuanced, and dare we say fun, criticism of slavery" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a> by employing a comprehensive subversion of the logic of slavery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Beyond its plot, the film utilizes various forms of media, from language and fashion to music and established genres, to critique white supremacy and the institution of slavery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

## Subverting Language and Cultural Precepts

The film gives language a profound purpose beyond typical Tarantino-isms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. Historically, white slavers like Big Daddy and Calvin Candie viewed white bodies as representing culture and civilization, while black bodies were deemed uncivilized and incapable of proper language or cultural appreciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. This belief echoed Aristotle's concept of "logos" (speech and reason) distinguishing humans from animals, which was used to justify slavery by claiming slaves lacked "logos" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

The film disrupts this racist binary through King Schultz, an eloquent German whose mastery of English confounds native-speaking slavers and makes self-satisfied Southerners appear "wildly uncivilized" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. He uses honorifics like "Fraulein" for Broomhilde, contrasting with the derogatory language of other white characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. Conversely, the film depicts cruel slavers as mumbling incoherently, while enslaved characters speak clearly and intelligibly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

The film also critiques how religious texts were appropriated to justify savagery. The Brittle brother quotes Genesis 9:2—a verse about God giving mankind power over beasts—while preparing to whip a slave, symbolically demonstrating how Christianity was used to justify slavery by dehumanizing enslaved people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. Django's bullet through the biblical page pinned to Brittle's shirt highlights this "bloody hypocrisy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.

## Using Symbols of Slavery to Make Slavery Look Stupid

*Django Unchained* uses fashion, music, and iconography to flip the logic of slavery on its head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.

### Fashion as Disidentification

Django's attire, particularly his "three musketeers" outfit, is deliberately abrasive, challenging the notion that such clothing is reserved for "white civilized man of culture" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. His horseback riding, historically associated with the well-to-do, also draws ire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. This resonates with the historical depiction of Joseph Cinque, leader of the Amistad Rebellion, who was portrayed in media dressed as a noble from the culture that enslaved him, a depiction historians described as "egalitarian" and "subversive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

Django's aesthetic choices embody "disidentification," a strategy theorized by José Esteban Muñoz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. Instead of escaping or assimilating into dominant ideology, disidentification "mangles its symbols from within" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. Django's donning of Southern aristocratic attire isn't to become one, but "to abuse the very notion of the Southern Gentleman" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

### Soundtrack and Musical Allusions

Tarantino intentionally incorporates music that might seem anachronistic for a mid-19th century Western, such as rap music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. This choice is meaningful, as rap has historically been used by those facing racial and economic inequality to "fight the powers that be" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a> and fantasize about changing circumstances and seeking revenge against systemic white supremacy rooted in slavery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. The song "100 Black Coffins," written for the film by Rick Ross and Jamie Foxx, directly reflects this theme of revenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.

Schultz also uses Richard Wagner's opera "Twilight of the Gods" to contextualize Django's mission to save his wife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. By interpreting Django as the Siegfried of his own revenge story, Schultz elevates Django's quest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. This reading connects Django to Friedrich Nietzsche's concept of the *ubermensch*, someone who powerfully creates new values in response to a nihilistic lack of values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>. Django, as a sort of *ubermensch*, confronts the nihilistic values of slavery not through rational appeals but by metaphorically and literally burning everything to the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>. The fiery destruction of Candyland mirrors Wagner's motif of a world burning down to start anew, symbolizing a call for the general destruction of slavery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>.

Furthermore, Tarantino intentionally uses Wagner's "Ring Cycle"—a narrative appropriated by the Nazis to support white supremacy—to tell a slavery revenge story that actively destroys white supremacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.

### Subverting the Western Genre

Finally, Tarantino uses the Western genre, typically featuring "strong jawed white dudes like John Wayne killing off villainized Native Americans" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>, to frame this slave revenge fantasy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. In *Django Unchained*, white cowboy types are instead eliminated by a freed slave, a subject largely ignored in the traditional Western canon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>. This provides another layer of [[cultural_critique_in_cinema | cultural critique]] and subversion.

One of the significant challenges for the architects of the DC Extended Universe (DCEU) was making Superman a relatable character, given his indestructible, selfless, and god-like nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. The chosen solution was to take a benevolent messiah figure and emphasize his vulnerabilities, flaws, and, most importantly, doubts, aiming to make him more human <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. This approach aimed to show Superman's internal struggle between being a benevolent savior and focusing on personal matters, particularly Lois <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

However, this character choice inadvertently [[batman_v_superman_ideological_conflicts | botches a fundamental part]] of a film centered on the rivalry between Batman and Superman: their embodiment of different ideologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

## Influence of The Dark Knight Returns and [[ayn_rands_philosophy_in_batman_v_superman | Ayn Rand]]

*Batman v Superman* draws heavily from Frank Miller’s graphic novel *The Dark Knight Returns*, incorporating elements like an older Bruce Wayne, Superman's nuclear warhead incident, Robin's memorialized costume, and the central fight between the two heroes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. Beneath these superficial similarities, *The Dark Knight Returns* solidified the ideological distinction between Batman and Superman through the unlikely inspiration of [[ayn_rands_philosophy_in_batman_v_superman | Ayn Rand's *The Fountainhead*]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. Frank Miller cites Rand as a significant influence on his work, and Zack Snyder has long expressed interest in making a *Fountainhead* film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

Miller and Snyder were particularly drawn to Rand's depiction of male heroes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. Rand's "ideal man," exemplified by Howard Roark in *The Fountainhead*, is defined by "ethical egoism"—the belief that the best course of action is always what's in one's best interest, pursuing self-happiness through self-interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. This concept, central to [[ayn_rands_philosophy_in_batman_v_superman | Ayn Rand's philosophy]] of Objectivism, posits a hero as a radical individualist, unwilling to bend to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

In Miller's *The Dark Knight Returns*, Batman perfectly embodies this Randian "Ideal Man": super-rich, handsome, intelligent, and unyielding to anyone else's will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. This adherence to Randian egoism enables the [[comparison_of_batman_and_supermans_ideologies | ideological conflict]] with Superman, representing individualism versus collectivism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. Miller's Superman is portrayed as the anti-Rand figure—a self-sacrificing, morally righteous character committed to "good," which leads him to be seen as a "Government Stooge" by Batman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. The drama in Miller’s work stems from these sharply contrasting ideologies: Batman's individualism versus Superman's conformism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

## Superman's Portrayal in *Batman v Superman*

While *Batman v Superman* successfully captures Miller’s Randian take on Batman, with Affleck's portrayal aligning as a handsome, intelligent, individualistic figure who defies authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>, the depiction of Superman becomes muddled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

The filmmakers faced a dilemma: a purely benevolent, do-gooder Superman would be boring and unrelatable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. Conversely, making him the "collectivist stooge" as Miller did would alienate the audience, especially with *Justice League* films planned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

In contrast to Christopher Reeve’s iconic Superman, who saves people simply because it's the right thing to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>, the Superman in *Batman v Superman* often appears burdened and reluctant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. The film constantly undercuts the perception of Superman as a purely benevolent, Christ-like hero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>, with Batman even stating, "You were never a god, you were never even a man" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.

Superman’s crisis manifests as two warring identities: the classic "The God" benevolent hero and "The Man," which Snyder interprets as a Randian Objectivist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. This is exemplified by his action of saving Lois in the Middle East while leaving other innocents to die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.

### Influence of Family

This internal conflict is voiced by his mother, Martha Kent, who states that there's no difference between choosing to be a Benevolent Messiah or a Self-Involved Objectivist; both are equally valid, and the important thing is that it's Clark's rational choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. This aligns with the Randian hero concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

Later, the ghost of Jonathan Kent offers Clark advice, recounting a story where his selfless act of saving his farm from a flood inadvertently flooded another nearby farm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. Jonathan Kent's ghost dismantles the notion of selfless heroism, suggesting that being a "classic selfless do-gooder Superman" is pointless because there will always be another problem he couldn't stop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. His advice emphasizes that true moral righteousness comes from bettering oneself, pursuing self-interest, and protecting loved ones who bring happiness—essentially ethical egoism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.

### Ambiguous Choice

Ultimately, Superman doesn't make a clear choice between being a Messiah or a Randian Hero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. He initially seems to embrace Objectivism by returning to Metropolis to save Lois and Martha <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. However, he then sacrifices himself in a highly Messianic fashion, with arms spread out and a makeshift cross behind his corpse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. This ambiguous philosophy becomes problematic because *Batman v Superman* is framed as an [[comparison_of_batman_and_supermans_ideologies | ideological conflict]] between Batman and Superman, yet no true conflict exists due to Superman's muddled stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.

## Impact on Ideological Conflict

The film pays lip service to the supposed ideological differences, with Bruce questioning Superman as a "superhuman benevolent savior" and Clark viewing Batman as a vigilante <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. However, the film immediately undermines this dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. By using Objectivism to make Superman more relatable, the film ends up shooting itself in the foot, as there's almost no ideological difference between Batman and Superman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

Instead of exploring a true ideological divide as seen in *The Dark Knight Returns*, *Batman v Superman* becomes a conflict between a "Randian Hero" (Batman) and "A Maybe Sort-of Randian Hero who can’t decide if he wants to be the divine savior the world wants him to be" (Superman) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.

The film ultimately presents no preference for heroics, suggesting that whether one sacrifices for the greater good or pursues self-interest is immaterial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>. The message shifts to simply advocating for "MORE HEROES," leading to the formation of the Justice League <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. This results in a muddled philosophy rather than a clear stance, making the film, though ambitious, a "mess" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.

The *Fallout* series is set in an alternate reality during the 23rd century, where 1950s culture persisted but most of humanity perished [00:00:13]. After nations depleted oil reserves in the 2050s, the world descended into a global conflict that culminated in 2077 with a nuclear exchange, ushering in a new dark age [00:00:28]. Apocalyptic fiction, like *Fallout*, serves as a rich source for [[philosophical_themes_in_the_walking_dead | philosophical analysis]] [00:00:41].

## The Allure of Propaganda and One-Dimensional Thought

*Fallout*'s pre-war society is technologically advanced but distinct from our own, featuring bulky technology and primitive computers alongside power armor and laser guns [00:01:21]. This era was marked by immense optimism, fueled by atomic energy and the belief that ingenuity could achieve anything, even with "giant anti-communist death robots" [00:01:46].

Nowhere is this optimism more evident than in the Vaults, massive underground bunkers designed to protect humanity [00:01:59]. Despite the looming nuclear annihilation, Vault advertisements maintain a cheerful demeanor [00:02:03]. Many Vaults, however, were secretly used by the government for "insane experiments" on their residents [00:02:08]. This phenomenon exemplifies the human capacity for cognitive dissonance, where being locked away indefinitely is presented as an "exciting foray" for making friends and raising a family [00:02:17].

The German-American philosopher Herbert Marcuse explored similar "mental gymnastics" during the Cold War [00:02:37]. He argued that pleasant facades plastered over modern "nightmares" demonstrated society's ability to stifle criticism [00:02:41]. Marcuse contended that capitalism's marketing prowess can make even the most terrible situations seem "dandy," citing real-life "deluxe fallout shelters" with televisions and Scrabble boards as an "obscene merger" of luxury appearance and dire reality [00:02:58].

This profound disparity between appearance and reality is a cornerstone of *Fallout*'s humor [00:03:23]. Players are constantly confronted with contrasting images: a quaint, *Leave-it-to-Beaver*-esque culture set against a hellish wasteland [00:03:30]. This contrast is reinforced by the game's radio stations, which play "chipper jazz tunes" while the player battles irradiated remnants of humanity [00:03:35]. For instance, the prominent use of "I Don’t Want to Set the World on Fire" in the game's trailer ironically juxtaposes the song's innocent romanticism with the literal destruction of Washington D.C. [00:03:49]. Similarly, Cole Porter’s upbeat “Anything Goes,” a song about lax morals, serves as a nod to the anarchy of the Wasteland, where even cannibalism is fair game [00:04:09].

These ironic pairings are not merely comedic; they highlight how society often celebrates the very culture and technology that pushes it to the brink of annihilation [00:04:23]. Marcuse further argued that this merging of positive and negative fosters "one-dimensional thought," where rationality and technology are perceived to only move "forward" [00:04:44]. In this view, technology is always inherently good, leaving no room for "negative thought" or ideas that challenge society's "inane positivity" [00:04:54]. This concept is vividly illustrated at the beginning of *Fallout 3*, where the player is forced to have fun at their own birthday party until a "sufficient amount" is achieved [00:05:17].

Another mechanism for ensuring acceptance of a "twisted reality" is by making people "too happy to care" [00:05:27]. This is seen with The Enclave, the remnants of the U.S. government seeking to purge the Wasteland [00:05:34]. Their president, John Henry Eden, a computer, understands the importance of "fun and leisure in an obedient society" [00:05:51]. In his radio addresses, Eden praises baseball as a "savior to the American dream," offering comfort and recreation reminiscent of pre-war society's excesses [00:06:02]. These comforts serve as an easy coping mechanism for the horrific reality, enabling the resurrection of a "distracted society" that might not object to its own extermination [00:06:58].

## Technology as a Double-Edged Sword

*Fallout* consistently presents technology as a double-edged sword, capable of both good and evil [00:07:20]. From the Great War to government experiments that created Super Mutants, the game frequently reminds players of "technology run amok" [00:07:20]. This leads to profound moral dilemmas for the player, such as whether to use technology for clean water or a devastating virus, or who should control Mr. House’s robotic army [00:07:34].

The notion that humans are ill-equipped to handle technology is ancient, with *Fallout* drawing inspiration from the Greek myth of Phaethon [00:07:59]. In the myth, Phaethon recklessly drives his father Helios's sun chariot, burning vast portions of the Earth [00:08:05]. In *Fallout: New Vegas*, the solar plant capable of harnessing the sun's energy is called Helios One, allowing the player to similarly unleash its destructive power [00:08:29].

Different factions in *Fallout* offer varying responses to this technological dilemma:
*   **The Brotherhood of Steel**: This secretive order collects and hoards advanced technology in heavily armored bases, believing that only they can be trusted with it [00:08:45]. They will even go to war with any faction possessing advanced tech, driven by the belief that "nobody can be trusted with technology but themselves" [00:09:02].
*   **Caesar’s Legion**: This faction largely renounces technology, except for what enhances combat effectiveness [00:09:17]. Caesar believes technology makes people "weak and dependent" [00:09:26]. However, even without advanced tech, Caesar’s brutal, totalitarian state demonstrates that human wrongdoing does not require supercomputers or power armor [00:09:30]. This suggests that technology itself may not be solely to blame for society's ills [00:09:40].

## Governance and International Relations

The Wasteland's denizens establish diverse forms of government, ranging from "cruel tyranny fueled slavery" to "liberal democracies" [00:09:47]. *Fallout* also explores modern theories of international relations.

### Hegemonic Stability Theory
In *New Vegas*, Caesar's Legion aims to unite humanity under a "dystopian nightmare" of slavery and Roman cosplay [00:10:03]. Caesar's foreign policy reflects the "hegemonic stability theory," which posits that peace is achieved when a single, dominant superpower intimidates others into behaving [00:10:18]. In the game, this theory holds some truth: traders prefer Legion territory due to its safety, as raiders are eliminated and laws strictly enforced [00:10:44]. If Caesar were to eliminate rival factions like the NCR, a form of "peace" would likely emerge across the Wasteland [00:11:09].

### Balance of Power Theory
Alternatively, a "balance of power" among factions can make war too costly [00:11:16]. For example, the NCR has not invaded New Vegas not out of benevolence, but because the cost of such a conflict would be prohibitive [00:11:20]. The Boomers exemplify this, maintaining their neutrality like a "post-apocalyptic Switzerland" by fiercely protecting their borders with artillery [00:11:30].

### Realist Model
Adherents to a "realist" model of international relations believe that each faction or state acts solely to secure its own survival, viewing power as a zero-sum game [00:11:41]. Security, in this view, is attained by possessing more power than rivals, and peace is merely an "uncertain ceasefire" [00:11:47]. Alliances are fleeting, forming only to combat more powerful threats [00:12:00]. This model, however, precludes cooperation and trust, the very absence of which might have led to the nuclear holocaust in the first place [00:12:13].

The stakes of diplomatic relationships in *Fallout* are exceptionally high, as every issue is a "life and death struggle for the soul of humanity" [00:12:20]. Players face choices like whether the NCR should resort to bullying and corruption for peace and democracy, or if they should murder obstacles or seek diplomatic solutions to bring clean water to the Wasteland [00:12:32].

### The Perils of Security Logic
Some philosophers, like Daniel Callahan, argue against the "totalizing logic" of "security logic," which suggests there is no limit to the "terrible, grotesque things" one is willing to do in the name of survival [00:13:06]. As Benjamin Franklin famously stated, "Those who surrender freedom for security will not have, nor do they deserve, either one" [00:13:17].

Enclave President John Henry Eden's radio declarations, such as his inability to discuss election details "in the interest of national security," exemplify how security can be invoked to justify authoritarianism [00:13:25]. The Enclave is willing to "exterminate all the mutated riff raff" to save "real" humanity [00:13:41].

A similar, though less genocidal, despotism is seen with Mr. House in *New Vegas* [00:13:48]. His ending depicts a "despotic vision of pre-War glory" where the streets are "orderly, efficient, cold," but personal freedoms and democracy are sacrificed [00:13:55]. Mr. House explicitly disdains freedom, believing that "autocracy" under a "technological and economic visionary" is the path to progress [00:14:10]. Historically, dictators have often manufactured crises and exaggerated threats to justify repressive laws, and *Fallout*'s world offers no shortage of such crises to exploit [00:14:33].

*Fallout*'s constant interrogation of human society and government is a core element [00:14:50]. The game's refrain, "War never changes," could easily be interpreted as "humanity never changes" [00:14:54]. Beyond the mutated creatures, the most terrifying aspects of the Wasteland are reflections of humanity's own regrettable history: "slavery obsessed Romans, Orwellian dictatorships, and genocidal governments" [00:15:03]. Indeed, history, it seems, "does repeat itself" [00:15:14].

*Macbeth* by William Shakespeare is a classical tragedy about a character who falls from grace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:07">[02:41:07]</a>.

## Plot Summary

After defeating their enemies, the king's generals Macbeth and Banquo encounter three witches who deliver prophecies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. The witches predict that Macbeth will become king, and that Banquo's descendants will also become kings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

Macbeth's wife, [[character_analysis_of_macbeth_and_lady_macbeth | Lady Macbeth]], encourages him to take the crown immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>. [[character_analysis_of_macbeth_and_lady_macbeth | Lady Macbeth]] convinces Macbeth to kill King Duncan while he is asleep, and then to place the blame on the two chamberlains who are passed out from drinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>. After Macbeth commits the murder, he becomes distressed, so [[character_analysis_of_macbeth_and_lady_macbeth | Lady Macbeth]] takes the bloody knife and places it on the chamberlains as evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:00">[00:53:00]</a>.

When Macduff discovers the king's dead body, Macbeth kills the chamberlains to prevent them from speaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. King Duncan's sons, Malcolm and Donalbain, leave town out of fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>. With them gone, Macbeth becomes king <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.

Due to the [[role_of_the_witches_in_macbeth | witches']] prophecy about Banquo's descendants, Macbeth becomes paranoid and sends assassins to kill Banquo and his son Fleance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>. Banquo is killed, but Fleance escapes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>.

Macbeth later consults the [[role_of_the_witches_in_macbeth | three witches]] again, who give him new prophecies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>:
*   An armored head warns him to beware of Macduff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>.
*   A bloody child tells him that no one born of a woman can harm him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>.
*   A crowned child holding a tree says he is safe until Great Birnam Wood moves to the castle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>.

Upon learning that Macduff has gone to England, Macbeth brutally kills Macduff's entire family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>.

Later, Macbeth discovers that [[character_analysis_of_macbeth_and_lady_macbeth | Lady Macbeth]] has committed suicide because she could not cope with her guilt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>. Macbeth is initially unconcerned by Malcolm's return with a large army approaching the castle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>. However, he realizes the army's shields are made from the wood the [[role_of_the_witches_in_macbeth | witches]] warned him about, indicating the prophecy's fulfillment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>.

Macduff, enraged by the slaughter of his family, confronts Macbeth on the battlefield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>. Macbeth boasts that Macduff cannot harm him because he was "born of a woman" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>. Macduff reveals that he was delivered by C-section, meaning he was not "born" in the traditional sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>. Macduff then beheads Macbeth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>. Malcolm reclaims his throne, ending Macbeth's tyranny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>.

## Themes and Analysis

*Macbeth* is a tragedy about a once righteous man who falls due to his own actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:07">[02:41:07]</a>. His downfall is primarily caused by [[themes_of_ambition_and_power_in_macbeth | unchecked ambition and lust for power]], which makes him his own antagonist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:11">[02:47:11]</a>.

However, Macbeth's fate can be attributed to multiple factors:
*   **[[character_analysis_of_macbeth_and_lady_macbeth | Lady Macbeth]]**: She actively instigates him to murder the king <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.
*   **The [[role_of_the_witches_in_macbeth | Witches]]**: Their prophecies feed his ambition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:10">[03:00:10]</a>.
*   **Scottish Society**: At the time, society valued seizing power by any means necessary, including murder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>. Macbeth was initially praised for his brutality in defeating enemies at the beginning of the play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>.

Some interpretations suggest that Macbeth is not entirely to blame, but is instead manipulated by [[fate_and_free_will_in_macbeth | fate]], acting as a puppet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. If Macbeth truly has no choice, then his actions are meaningless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>.

Shakespeare uses imagery of ill-fitting clothes to symbolize how Macbeth is living beyond his depth, overwhelmed by the pressures of [[fate_and_free_will_in_macbeth | fate]], society, and his own ambition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>.

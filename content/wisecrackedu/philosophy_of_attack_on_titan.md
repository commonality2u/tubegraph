*Attack on Titan* is a colossal series known for its fight scenes and exploration of death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Few anime ruminate on the visceral reality of death quite like it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. The Titans serve as a physical personification of death, walking reminders of human mortality, and an existential confrontation with the inevitability of demise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

However, the series' darkest element isn't the confrontations with death or the Titans themselves, but the construction of the society behind the walls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## German Influences and [[carl_schmitts_influence_and_theory_in_attack_on_titan | Carl Schmitt]]

The show is set in an anachronistic quasi-Germanic society, evident in its architecture, war cries, and character names <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. The political ideology of this society aligns with the beliefs of [[carl_schmitts_influence_and_theory_in_attack_on_titan | Carl Schmitt]], a notorious Nazi philosopher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Disclaimer
> [[carl_schmitts_influence_and_theory_in_attack_on_titan | Schmitt]] was a "card carrying Nazi, unrepentant to the end" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. The show is not endorsing his ideas, but rather exploring them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

What makes *Attack on Titan* so dark is its presentation of a society, faced with a horrific enemy, that maintains stability by reflecting Nazi ideology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. The series provocatively asks if, in this dystopian society, a controversial philosophy might be the only thing preventing societal collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

Central to [[carl_schmitts_influence_and_theory_in_attack_on_titan | Schmitt's]] philosophy and the civilization in *Attack on Titan* is the concept of "the political" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. For [[carl_schmitts_influence_and_theory_in_attack_on_titan | Schmitt]], three core concepts create a stable society: conflict and inequality, clear [[friendenemy_distinction_and_sovereignty_in_attack_on_titan | distinctions between friends and enemies]], and sovereignty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

## Inevitable Conflict and Inequality

[[carl_schmitts_influence_and_theory_in_attack_on_titan | Schmitt]] emphasizes that conflict, division, and inequality among human beings are inevitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. This stems from an understanding that humanity's most basic nature is "savage and hellish" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. Characters like Mikasa, Armin, and Eren reflect this thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. The show constantly reinforces the theme that "it’s a dog eat dog world and you have to fight to survive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

This view aligns with Thomas Hobbes' understanding of humanity's basic nature, where social structures are the only thing that can keep humanity's inherent monstrousness at bay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. [[carl_schmitts_influence_and_theory_in_attack_on_titan | Schmitt]] takes this further, asserting that hostility is unavoidable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. He believed inequality is inevitable, with people always being smarter, fitter, or more attractive, and it's not the role of politics to fix this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. Instead, a strong sovereign should focus on maintaining order and control, as attempting to eliminate antagonism or inequality is futile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

In *Attack on Titan*, this is seen directly:
*   Classes are separated by literal walls, forming a caste system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
*   People in Wall Maria are less safe than those in Wall Rose and Sina <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
*   While people in Trost are being eaten, those in the inner city are "chillin in castles, playing chess" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.
*   The Scouts risk their lives beyond the wall, while the Military Police (MP's) in the inner walls are largely incompetent and "get drunk all day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

The show, unlike most media narratives, does not present severe inequality as something to be repaired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. For [[carl_schmitts_influence_and_theory_in_attack_on_titan | Schmitt]], alleviating inequality is a distraction from the true purpose of "the political": nationalism and survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. This nationalistic focus is highlighted in the season one theme song, which is reminiscent of "Triumph of the Will"-level propaganda, with lyrics about fighting past defeat and having the will of "starving wolves" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

## [[friendenemy_distinction_and_sovereignty_in_attack_on_titan | Friend-Enemy Distinction]]

[[carl_schmitts_influence_and_theory_in_attack_on_titan | Schmitt's]] second element of "the political" is a clear [[friendenemy_distinction_and_sovereignty_in_attack_on_titan | distinction between friend and enemy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. Good governments need an enemy to struggle against without completely dominating them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. The Titans serve this purpose, acting as a check against total conquest beyond the wall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

Without a clear enemy, human nature would lead to "war against all," resulting in an unending civil war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. The existence of a clear enemy prevents this constant infighting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. Both Erwin and Pyxis recognize the necessity of the Titans as an enemy to maintain order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. They worry that the Titans aren't the real threat, but merely keep humanity in line by providing a common goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

> [!NOTE] The Titans' Purpose
> The true purpose of the Titans is not fully revealed in the show, but there are hints of a "face in the wall" and abnormal Titans controlled by people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. If rogue Titans are part of an inside conspiracy, it would imply a "government-fabricated enemy" – an intelligent, strong enemy that prevents humanity from fighting itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. In this interpretation, the Titans could be an allegory for the perfect scapegoat, mobilizing the population and empowering those in control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.

The theme of freedom in the show also reflects [[carl_schmitts_influence_and_theory_in_attack_on_titan | Schmitt's]] friend-enemy distinction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. The Scouts' badge is the "wings of freedom," and characters like Eren and Armin constantly long for a life beyond the walls, likening humanity to "penned in cattle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:08:05]</a>. For [[carl_schmitts_influence_and_theory_in_attack_on_titan | Schmitt]], freedom and community are defined by denying cowardice in the face of impending death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. Joining the Scouts becomes a liberation from the fear of waiting to die inside the walls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.

This desire to join the Scouts forges Eren's class into a political community, finding purpose on the battlefield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. For [[carl_schmitts_influence_and_theory_in_attack_on_titan | Schmitt]], a political community is defined by the ability to kill enemies for friends or die for friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>. The Scouts embody this, risking their lives like the troops in Alfred Tennyson's "The Charge of the Light Brigade," which is even quoted in the show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. This camaraderie binds humanity together, preventing internal strife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

However, the [[friendenemy_distinction_and_sovereignty_in_attack_on_titan | friend-enemy distinction]] blurs as the show progresses, particularly with Eren and Annie being Titans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. The partial transformation scene, where Eren saves Mikasa and Armin, highlights the danger when the line between human and Titan blurs, making it difficult to determine who needs protection and from what <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:10:09]</a>.

## Sovereignty

The final element of [[carl_schmitts_influence_and_theory_in_attack_on_titan | Schmitt's]] "the political" is the power of the sovereign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. Sovereign entities can declare states of emergency, justifying the sacrifice of populations for the greater good, such as sending a battalion to reclaim Wall Maria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:21]</a>. This ability is crucial for long-term societal stability, preventing political bickering from hindering the fight against existential threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:48]</a>. The sovereign can also make exceptions to the law, like granting special citizen status to those living inside Wall Sina <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:57]</a>.

In *Attack on Titan*, the current leadership structure appears to be based on martial law and military rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:07]</a>. Premiere Dhalis Zachary leads the military tribunal with the power to execute Eren, and wall cultists have gained influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:17]</a>. The leaders send millions to their death to ensure the safety of the remaining population inside the walls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:33]</a>. Pixis explicitly states that the retaking of Wall Maria was a "thinly disguised purge" to ease the stress from massive refugee influx, a decision to kill off part of the population for the greater good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:47]</a>. For [[carl_schmitts_influence_and_theory_in_attack_on_titan | Schmitt]], the sovereign must maintain this ability to perform even "the most horrendous of things" to preserve order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:12:03]</a>.

## Conclusion

Considering these philosophical underpinnings, a key question arises: what would happen if all the Titans suddenly disappeared? Would society devolve into anarchy or civil war, or would it lead to liberation and greater peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:22]</a>? For [[carl_schmitts_influence_and_theory_in_attack_on_titan | Schmitt]], eradicating an enemy is not an option because warfare is an inherent drive, and another enemy will always be found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:30]</a>.

It is important to be wary of a theorist who warned about unending war while being a principal theorist for the Nazi Party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:44]</a>. [[carl_schmitts_influence_and_theory_in_attack_on_titan | Schmitt's]] work remains a subject of debate in academia regarding its redeemability and use for understanding international conflict, with his ideas still invoked in discussions of executive power, systemic pitfalls, and even the War on Terror <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:13:01]</a>. *Attack on Titan* could potentially criticize or further complicate [[carl_schmitts_influence_and_theory_in_attack_on_titan | Schmitt-style politics]] in future seasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:08]</a>.

*Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice* is critiqued for its "ideological failings," particularly in its portrayal of its central characters and the supposed conflict between them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. While the film was widely criticized for its "shameless franchise plugging" and "slow plotting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, this analysis focuses on the inconsistencies in its philosophical underpinnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Superman's Characterization and Relatability
A significant challenge for the architects of the DCEU was making Superman a relatable character, given his indestructible, selfless, and god-like nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. Their solution was to emphasize his vulnerabilities, flaws, and doubts, akin to how *The Last Temptation of Christ* approached a benevolent messiah figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This approach aimed to make him more "human" by showing him grappling with the burden of divine status and choosing between being a savior or focusing on personal matters like Lois <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. However, this strategy ultimately "botches a fundamental part" of a Batman and Superman rivalry: having them embody distinct ideologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. This muddled approach to [[supermans_characterization_in_batman_v_superman]] undermines the core conflict.

## Influence of Frank Miller's *The Dark Knight Returns*
*Batman v Superman* draws heavily from Frank Miller's graphic novel *The Dark Knight Returns* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. Shared elements include:
*   An older, "broken" Bruce Wayne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
*   Superman being hit by a nuclear warhead and healed by the sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
*   Robin's memorialized costume in Batman's lair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
*   The central fight between Batman and Superman, with Superman attempting to reason with Batman, who refuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

### Ayn Rand's Philosophy and Ideological Distinction
Beneath the surface of *The Dark Knight Returns* lies an influential ideological distinction rooted in Ayn Rand's *The Fountainhead* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. Zack Snyder has reportedly wanted to make *The Fountainhead* into a movie for years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>, and Frank Miller explicitly cites Rand as a major influence on his work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

Rand's novel features Howard Roark, an experimental architect who faces constant opposition from the establishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. Miller and Snyder are particularly drawn to Rand's depiction of male heroes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

A Randian hero, like Roark, is an "ideal man" who achieves goals and never compromises integrity, even if it leads to conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. This hero is defined by "ethical egoism"—the belief that the best course of action is always what is in one's own best interest, leading to happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. This is a central tenet of [[ayn_rands_philosophy_in_superhero_narratives]]: Objectivism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. Rand's male hero is a "radical individualist," unwilling to bend, intelligent, and physically appealing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

In *The Dark Knight Returns*, Miller's Batman embodies this "Randian egoism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. He is a super-rich, handsome playboy with a genius intellect who refuses to bend his will to anyone else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. This adherence enables the [[ideological_conflict_between_batman_and_superman]]: individualism versus collectivism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. Batman faces obstruction from the US Government, which tasks Superman, the "ultimate ‘conformist’," to stop him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. Miller's Superman is the anti-Rand figure, a "Government Stooge" whose self-sacrificing moral righteousness marks him as committing to "good" for others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. The drama in Miller's work stems from these differing ideologies: Batman's individualism versus Superman's conformism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. Miller successfully instilled the spirit of Rand's theories to create a compelling conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

## Where *Batman v Superman* Goes Wrong

### Batman's Consistent Portrayal
*Batman v Superman* successfully portrays Batman in line with Miller's Randian take <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. Ben Affleck's Batman is handsome, "almost supernaturally athletic," smarter than others, and a "complete individualist" who refuses to bend his will, even to the judicial process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. His decision to fight Superman can be seen as a nod to Rand's atheism, as a "God-like Superman" ruins the ethical egoism principle, making it impossible to make choices based solely on one's own rationality when something "objectively greater" exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

### Superman's Muddled Ideology
While Batman's Randian depiction is consistent, Superman's characterization in *BvS* becomes "muddled" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. The filmmakers avoided a purely benevolent, do-gooder Superman (deemed "boring" and unrelatable) and also shied away from Miller's collectivist "stooge" portrayal, as the audience needed to like him for future *Justice League* films <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.

Unlike Christopher Reeve's iconic Superman, who saves people selflessly simply because it's right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>, the *BvS* Superman appears "stuck performing the most tiresome 9-5 job imaginable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. The film constantly undercuts his perception as a purely benevolent, Christ-like hero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>, with Batman even telling him, "You were never a god, you were never even a man" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.

Superman's crisis manifests as two warring identities: "Superman 'The God'" (benevolent and Christ-like) and "Superman 'The Man'" (a Randian Objectivist) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. This Objectivist side is exemplified by him saving Lois in the Middle East but leaving other innocents to die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.

#### Parental Advice and Objectivism
Martha Kent bluntly states that there's no difference between choosing to be a "Benevolent Messiah" or a "Self Involved Objectivist"; both are "equally valid" as long as it's Clark's rational choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. This aligns with a Randian hero's definition by rational choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

Later, Jonathan Kent's ghost further advises Clark by recounting a selfless act of saving his farm from a flood that, unbeknownst to him, caused another nearby farm to flood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. Jonathan then dismantles the notion of selfless heroism, suggesting there's "no point" to being a "classic selfless do-gooder Superman" because one can't stop every problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. He implies that "true moral righteousness comes from bettering yourself, pursuing your own self-interest, and protecting the ones you love," which is "ethical egoism in a nutshell" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.

Despite these influences, Superman doesn't ultimately choose between being a Messiah or a Randian hero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. He initially embraces Jonathan's Objectivism by focusing on Lois and Martha <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>, even echoing Jonathan's parting words to Lois <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. However, moments later, he sacrifices himself in a "Messianic fashion" with arms spread out and a makeshift cross behind his corpse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. He both takes responsibility for the planet as a benevolent savior and acts for Lois as an objectivist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

## Lack of Ideological Conflict
Superman's ambiguous philosophy creates a significant problem because *Batman v Superman* is framed as an [[ideological_conflict_between_batman_and_superman]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. While the film initially hints at differing beliefs (Bruce dislikes Superman being blindly trusted as a savior, questioning the possibility of a "superhuman benevolent savior" given his history with "freaks dressed like clowns" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>; Clark sees Batman as a vigilante who needs checking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>), this dynamic is "immediately upended" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. The world turns against Superman because, like Batman, he acts on his own accord <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. By using Objectivism to make Superman relatable, the film "shoots itself in the foot" as "almost no ideological difference" remains between the two heroes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

The film, which requires a conflict based on ideals and draws from source material showcasing this divide, instead becomes a conflict between a "Randian Hero" (Batman) and "A Maybe Sort-of Randian Hero who can’t decide if he wants to be the divine savior the world wants him to be" (Superman) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.

Ultimately, the film presents "no preference of heroics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>. The question of whether one should sacrifice for the greater good or prioritize self-interest becomes "immaterial" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. Instead of promoting one type of hero over another, the overarching message becomes "MORE HEROS" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a> to form the [[justice_league_film_series|Justice League]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. This Muddled philosophy results in a "mess" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a> regarding the [[thematic_discussions_in_dc_universe_films]] and character ideologies. However, it is recognized as an "ambitious mess" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.

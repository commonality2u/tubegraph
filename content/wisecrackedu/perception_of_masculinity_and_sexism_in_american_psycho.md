The film *American Psycho* has consistently been a lightning rod for [[controversy_surrounding_american_psycho | controversy]] since its release, with much of the debate revolving around how it is perceived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. Key questions include whether the film is a critique of 80s yuppie consumerism and superficiality, or if its excess glorifies this lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Specifically, its portrayal of violence, particularly towards women, has led some to proclaim it a feminist masterpiece while others label it misogynistic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## Patrick Bateman: A Study in Hyper-Masculinity and Status

Patrick Bateman, set in 1988's Wall Street heyday, embodies the wealthy yuppie stereotype <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. His life is defined by artifice, obsessed with trendy restaurants and his perceived status among other affluent Wall Streeters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. This focus on meticulous details like reservations at Dorsia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>, skincare routines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>, and especially business cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>, highlights a male world where everything is commodified and used as a token of superiority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

The film satirizes the shallow consumer lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>, showcasing characters who are vapid, self-absorbed, and more concerned with appearances than actual conflicts in their periphery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. Discussions about global issues like massacres in Sri Lanka or the Iran-Contra scandal become mere tools for one-upsmanship, rather than genuine concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

### Class as Competition and the "Leisure Class"
*American Psycho* presents class as a sport, reflecting Thorstein Veblen's theories on the "leisure class" and "conspicuous consumption" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. Conspicuous consumption is defined as the consumption of goods to demonstrate financial strength and repute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. Patrick Bateman constantly defines himself in relation to others, hating Paul Allen for fancier restaurant access and a nicer business card, and believing he's superior to Marcus due to a "slightly better haircut" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. He lectures lower-class prostitutes on music trivialities to assert his dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

Veblen's ideas suggest that higher status in primitive societies was associated with "honorable duties" like hunting and killing, rather than productive work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. In a nod to this, Patrick uses his prestige to be unproductive and adopt murder as a hobby <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. The film posits that beneath the desire for fancy suits lies a literal bloodlust, presenting Bateman's murderous inclinations as the truth behind his superficial lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. He initially describes himself as a "shell of a person" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a> but becomes "whole" by indulging his baser desires to kill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. The film suggests that the true nature of the consumer capitalist is a "cold-blooded serial killer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

## Sexism and the Treatment of Women

Despite the film being a savage [[american_psycho_as_a_critique_on_consumerism | critique on consumerism]], there is an undeniable seduction to Patrick Bateman and his lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. The film's parody sometimes offers competing interpretations, both legitimizing and subverting its subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. The film's decision to play Patrick's monstrous acts as comedic or cut away from them entirely (e.g., the murder of Christine) allows the audience to identify with the "glitz and glamour" rather than his gruesome deeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. This raises the question of whether *American Psycho* undermines its own satirical depth by indulging Bateman's lifestyle at the expense of his violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.

Many have accused the violence in *American Psycho* of being explicitly targeted towards women and the lower class, glorifying their grotesque deaths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. It's noted that no one seems to care about the women Patrick kills; only the disappearance of Paul Allen prompts a detective's concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>.

However, screenwriter Guinevere Turner and director Mary Harron argue that the film is indeed a feminist work.
> "I very much think American Psycho is a feminist film," Turner stated in a 2015 interview with *Dayz*. "It's a satire about how men compete with each other and how in this hyper-real universe we created women are even less important than your tan or your suit or where you summer and to me even though the women are all sort of tragic it's about how men perceive and treat them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.
Harron further reiterated this, saying, "*American Psycho* is a great parody of masculinity. It's a send-up. It was accused of being sexist but to me it was always an attack and satire of sexism and of male ego" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.

The film vividly showcases the cavalier attitudes many men in this world have towards women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>, with Patrick stating, "there are no girls with good personalities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. He lords over women's bodies as if he owns them, dictating what his assistant wears and instructing paid women in bed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>. Patrick believes he can do as he pleases with a woman's body, including killing, mutilating, and even eating them, and the cold, cynical truth presented by the film is that he does get away with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.

## The Enduring Impact and Interpretation
Despite its satirical intent to critique male ego and consumer society, the film's impact seems to uphold the very "surface value lifestyle" it rails against <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>. Patrick Bateman, despite his monstrous acts, is still often lauded as an anti-establishment antihero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.

This phenomenon may be a metatextual commentary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. Just as Patrick Bateman confesses his crimes and people either mishear him (e.g., "murders and executions" mistaken for "mergers and acquisitions") or dismiss it as a joke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>, *American Psycho* the film itself has been misinterpreted as misogynistic or pro-consumer, or treated simply as a joke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. The issues the film critiques—status-obsessed society, sexism, and wealth inequality—remain relevant today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>. As Patrick Bateman cynically states at the film's end, "This confession has meant nothing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>, implying that the film's critical portrayal of society might also ultimately "mean nothing" in terms of changing perceptions or behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>.

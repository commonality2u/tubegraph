The film *Shrek* serves as a significant [[subversion_of_fantasy_genre_tropes_in_goblin_slayer | critique of traditional fairy tales]], particularly challenging the idealistic perfection often portrayed in such stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>. It specifically targets [[Disneys_adaptation_and_alteration_of_classic_stories | Disney's superficial and overly sentimental offerings]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>.

## Subversion of Fairy Tale Tropes

*Shrek* actively undermines classic fairy tale elements and characters associated with traditional Disney intellectual property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>:
*   **Robin Hood**: Depicted as "creepy Frenchmen" who kidnap young girls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>.
*   **Cinderella**: Presented as a "mentally abused shut-in" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>.
*   **Snow White**: Dismissed by Shrek as "just another piece of clutter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>.

The film's [[antidisney_themes_in_shrek | anti-Disney agenda]] is most evident in its central characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>:
*   **Shrek**: His initial actions, such as wiping his backside with a fairy tale page and not washing his hands, brushing his teeth with slime, and openly farting, starkly contrast the "glamorous entrance" typically afforded to "clenched-up Disney heroes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>.
*   **Princess Fiona**: Initially behaves like a stereotypical Disney princess, expecting chivalry, grand gestures, and to be "swept off her Sketchers" in a storybook manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>. However, the character who embodies these stereotypical characteristics, Lord Farquaad, is portrayed as the "most odious character in the film" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>.

## Critiques of Traditional Endings and Ideals

*Shrek* rejects the conventional fairy tale ending where the "lovely princess and handsome hero live 'happily ever after'" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>. Instead, it portrays both of its heroes as "ugly," suggesting that their marriage will be "rocky, and probably end in divorce" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>. This challenges the notion that beauty is directly linked to greater rewards or happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19:00">[05:19:00]</a>.

## Behind-the-Scenes Motivations

The numerous attacks on the Disney aesthetic within *Shrek* were reportedly a result of a feud between Disney CEO Michael Eisner and Jeffrey Katzenberg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>. Katzenberg, who ran Disney's movie and television division for a decade and was responsible for revitalizing Disney's animated film catalog with hits like *The Little Mermaid*, *Aladdin*, and *The Lion King* (referred to as "The Little Fish Lady," "Interracial Couple," and "The Genie Saves Hanukkah" respectively) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>, left to start DreamWorks out of "pure spite" after Disney refused to promote him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>.

It is believed that the character of Lord Farquaad (referred to as "Lord Facebook") was based on Michael Eisner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:00">[05:02:00]</a>. Furthermore, Lord Farquaad's kingdom is described as a "dead ringer for Disneyland," complete with employees in costumes and incessant singing about a "small and pitiful world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:00">[05:09:00]</a>. This historical context provides a direct link to the film's deliberate [[critiques_of_disneys_storytelling_methods | critique of Disney's storytelling methods]] and aesthetic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>.

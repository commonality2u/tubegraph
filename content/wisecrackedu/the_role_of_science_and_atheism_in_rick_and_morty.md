*Rick and Morty* is a show "chock full" of [[scifi_horror_and_fantasy_themes_in_rick_and_morty | sci-fi, horror, and fantasy]] [[significance_of_science_fiction_and_horror_references_in_rick_and_morty | references]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. While many of these are simple homage or "throwaway jokes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, others offer insightful and thought-provoking commentary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. The show often "inverts common cliches and tropes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>, particularly through its use of [[science_and_rationalism_in_rick_and_morty | science]] and its atheistic worldview.

## Science Demystifies the Supernatural

In *Rick and Morty*, [[science_and_rationalism_in_rick_and_morty | science]] is frequently used to undermine mystical or religious concepts, presenting a world where traditional sources of fear and morality are rendered obsolete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

### The Devil Made Me Do It... Or Did He?

The episode "Something Ricked This Way Comes" directly addresses the idea of a "deal with the devil" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. The episode's title is a reference to Ray Bradbury’s novel *Something Wicked This Way Comes* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>, which, like Stephen King’s *Needful Things* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, features themes of making deals with creepy strangers for personal gain with hidden consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. In *Rick and Morty*, the Devil opens a shop where items are free but "creatively ruin whatever benefit one hopes to receive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

However, Rick's [[science_and_rationalism_in_rick_and_morty | science]] provides a way to circumvent these mystical repercussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. The show "throws in the toilet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a> the moral refrain that warns against "thwarting the natural order of things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. Through [[science_and_rationalism_in_rick_and_morty | science]], characters can achieve their desires without selling their soul or suffering debilitating curses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>, effectively having their "cake and eat it too" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

[[science_and_rationalism_in_rick_and_morty | Science]] in *Rick and Morty* "demystifies religion by exposing magic and miracles as either sleight of hand or mere statistical coincidence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. Similarly, Rick "demystifies the 'deal with the devil' trope as nothing more than a paranoid fairy tale" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. What these stories portray as "too good to be true" is often "shorthand for 'don’t circumvent God’s rules'" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>, which is presented as "the preferred pastime of every scientist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

With [[science_and_rationalism_in_rick_and_morty | science]], Rick makes the devil obsolete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. The show suggests that "evil isn’t what should horrify us anymore" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>, as "karmic retribution is kind of calming" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. Instead, a world without such [[cosmic_nihilism_and_its_depiction_in_rick_and_morty | justice]] is scarier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. The true horror lies "beyond evil" in "pure, disinterested [[science_and_rationalism_in_rick_and_morty | science]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

## Atheism and the Nature of God

The show consistently presents a worldview where traditional notions of God are either absent or diminished.

### The Deconstruction of Deity

The episode "Raising Gazorpazorp" draws heavily from the 1974 film *Zardoz* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. *Zardoz* features a "giant-floating-head-god" that commands savages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>, but one of the savages, Zed, discovers this god is a lie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>, part of a convoluted plan to enslave the population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. This film is fundamentally "a movie about a guy who discovers his God is a lie and proceeds to kill that God" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

The *Zardoz* reference in "Raising Gazorpazorp" reinforces a general theme of atheism in *Rick and Morty* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. The show continually reminds the viewer "that either there is no God, or that God isn’t all that great" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

## Science, Deconstruction, and Disillusionment

Beyond specific religious or supernatural figures, *Rick and Morty* employs [[science_and_rationalism_in_rick_and_morty | science]] and a rationalistic perspective to deconstruct various tropes, leading to a pervasive sense of disillusionment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.

### Subverting Tropes

*   **Animal Uprising**: In "Lawnmower Dog," Rick's [[science_and_rationalism_in_rick_and_morty | science]] makes the family dog, Snuffles (later Snowball), intelligent enough to subjugate humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. This mirrors the animal rebellion in George Orwell’s *Animal Farm* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. Unlike *Animal Farm* where the animals eventually become their oppressors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>, Snowball realizes his error with the help of *Inception* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>, averting a dystopian outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.
*   **Fairy Tales**: "Meeseeks and Destroy" overtly deconstructs fairy tales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. Morty's "cliche fairytale adventure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>, based on *Jack and the Beanstalk* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>, is subjected to a "level of realism usually omitted from children’s stories" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. Morty is put on trial for murder and confronts the giant's grieving widow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>, and the king of the village turns out to be a "sexual predator" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. This dispels the "cheery optimism that comforted you as a child" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.

### The Banality of the Fantastic

The show uses "hard [[science_and_rationalism_in_rick_and_morty | science]]" to "deconstruct mysticism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>, and it also "deconstructs fantasies by subjecting them to the mundanity of everyday life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. This often results in "robbing fantasy of its magic" and "trivializing everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.

*   **Horror Villains**: Scary Terry, a character similar to Freddy Krueger from *A Nightmare on Elm Street* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>, is presented as terrifying due to his ability to murder in dreams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>. However, the show "dispels the horror" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a> by revealing his "utterly banal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a> and "shitty home life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>, making him relatable rather than purely fearsome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.
*   **The Human Body**: "Anatomy Park," referencing *Jurassic Park* and *Fantastic Voyage* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>, depicts the human body not as a "wonder of the natural world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a> but as a "gonorrhea infested nightmare" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.

This pervasive trivialization extends to "family, love, and even life" itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>, reinforcing the show's underlying [[cosmic_nihilism_and_its_depiction_in_rick_and_morty | disillusionment]].

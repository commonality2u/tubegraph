Director Ari Aster's 2019 film *Midsommar* has been described by contemporary horror director Jordan Peele as "the most idyllic horror film of all time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a>. This assessment prompts a deeper look into the film's [[symbolism_and_themes_in_the_film_midsommar|meaningful]] content beyond its horrifying events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:37">[00:35:37]</a>. *Midsommar* presents a stark comparison between modern, secular alienation and the unsettling, yet profoundly communal, life of the Hårga cult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:41">[00:41:41]</a>.

## Film Overview

*Midsommar* introduces Dani, a young woman in a failing relationship with her boyfriend Christian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:55">[00:54:55]</a>. After a horrific family tragedy, Dani unenthusiastically tags along with Christian and his anthropology graduate school friends on a trip to Sweden for a rare, once-every-96-years Midsummer festival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:09">[01:07:09]</a>. They arrive at an idyllic Swedish commune, the Hårga, where bizarre rituals quickly unfold, including two elders jumping off a cliff in a *harakiri*-esque ritual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:22">[01:20:22]</a>. As Christian's friends are systematically killed in increasingly horrifying ways, Dani finds herself embraced by the community, eventually winning a May Queen competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:43">[01:40:43]</a>. The film culminates in a human sacrifice where Dani selects Christian as the final victim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:03">[02:01:03]</a>.

## Aster's Depiction of Swedish Culture and Mythology

While *Midsommar* depicts Midsummer as a bloodbath with cliff jumps and human sacrifices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:30">[02:28:30]</a>, it is important to note that this is not anthropologically accurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:23">[02:23:23]</a>. Real Midsummer is a light and happy tradition celebrating summer, fertility, and involves dancing around maypoles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:38">[02:38:38]</a>. The death rituals and "weird sex stuff" are largely the [[ari_asters_portrayal_of_rituals_in_midsommar|twisted brainchild of Astor]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:10">[03:07:10]</a>.

However, Astor conducted extensive research, [[ari_asters_portrayal_of_rituals_in_midsommar|combining truth and fiction]] from [[influence_of_swedish_culture_and_mythology_in_midsommar|Swedish traditions and folklore]] and [[influence_of_swedish_culture_and_mythology_in_midsommar|Norse mythology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:32">[03:30:32]</a>. Much of the film's imagery, including the maypole and barn paintings, is consistent with [[influence_of_swedish_culture_and_mythology_in_midsommar|real Swedish Midsummer celebrations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:40">[03:40:40]</a>. Astor even learned the Scandinavian runic alphabet to decorate Hårga clothing with specific symbols, such as the Tiwaz symbol for Christian's robe, representing bravery and virility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:14">[04:12:14]</a>. Dani's dress features runes symbolizing "journey" and "new beginning" or "loss of hope" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:54">[04:54:54]</a>. The death elements, like Christian being burned inside a bear carcass, are inspired by [[influence_of_swedish_culture_and_mythology_in_midsommar|Norse mythology]] where bears were significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:10">[05:10:10]</a>. The "blood eagle" torture ritual, though its possibility is disputed by scholars, is also depicted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>. Some Hårga love rituals, like picking flowers to dream of a future mate, have real-life counterparts, though others, like the pubic hair in pie and menstrual blood in drinks, are more dubious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:14">[06:14:14]</a>.

The combination of authentic and invented elements creates a "creepy haven of cell phone-free agrarian life where [[ari_asters_portrayal_of_rituals_in_midsommar|ritualized human sacrifice]] is as normal as sourdough bread" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:02:04">[07:02:04]</a>.

## Dani's Search for Belonging

Dani begins the film firmly rooted in a cold, [[concept_of_alienation_and_the_simple_life|alienating secular society]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:40:41">[07:40:41]</a>. After losing her entire family, she experiences a profound [[the_theme_of_isolation_and_seeking_authenticity|lack of community and emotional support]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:52">[07:51:52]</a>. Her boyfriend Christian only stays with her out of guilt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:56">[07:54:56]</a>, and their conversations suggest a lack of true connection, as she talks to someone who "isn't fully present" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:14:14">[08:14:14]</a>. Dani's [[the_theme_of_isolation_and_seeking_authenticity|detachment]] is highlighted by her isolation at home and phone calls being her primary form of communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:01">[08:01:01]</a>. She is clearly [[the_theme_of_isolation_and_seeking_authenticity|lacking community]], love, and empathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:56:54">[08:56:54]</a>.

This is precisely what she finds in the Hårga <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:01">[09:01:01]</a>. Despite initial fear, Dani is seduced by the [[the_theme_of_isolation_and_seeking_authenticity|warmth of their community]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:08:10">[09:08:10]</a>. The Hårga move in tandem, behaving "like different parts of the same organism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:18:18">[09:18:18]</a>. The film emphasizes [[symbolism_and_themes_in_the_film_midsommar|shared catharsis]] in both pain and pleasure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:21:23">[09:21:23]</a>; when an elder survives a cliff jump, the tribe moans in unison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:25:25">[09:25:25]</a>, and similarly, women moan with Maya during Christian's sex ritual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:39:39">[09:39:39]</a>. As Astor states, their language is [[symbolism_and_themes_in_the_film_midsommar|empathy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:52">[09:51:52]</a>.

Dani's increasing immersion into the Hårga cult is visually represented by her changing attire, from dark, real-world clothing to the community's traditional apron, dress, and flower wreath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:37:37">[10:37:37]</a>. During the Maypole dance, her participation in the ritualized hallucinogen use leads to her first genuine smile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:46:46">[10:46:46]</a>, indicating her integration into the "singular Hårga organism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:03:03">[11:03:03]</a>. The pivotal moment comes when, after seeing Christian's infidelity, she cries uncontrollably, and the Hårga women cry in tandem with her, sharing her emotional load <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:18:18">[11:18:18]</a>. This shared experience contrasts sharply with her previous isolation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:23:23">[11:23:23]</a>.

Her [[symbolism_and_themes_in_the_film_midsommar|immersion into nature]] is also evident, starting with hallucinatory grass growing from her hands and feet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:32:32">[11:32:32]</a>, culminating in her being covered in flowers as May Queen, symbolizing her surrender to the [[concept_of_alienation_and_the_simple_life|agrarian society]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:47:47">[11:47:47]</a>. Her final act of choosing Christian as the ninth sacrifice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:57:58">[11:57:58]</a>, and her subsequent smile as he burns, signifies her freedom and acceptance into a community where she can finally belong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:10:10">[12:10:10]</a>.

## Christian and the "Dude Bros": Detached Observation

In contrast to Dani, Christian and his friends approach the Hårga with a [[analysis_of_audiences_complicity_and_enjoyment_in_excess|condescending distance]] typical of anthropology students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:27:28">[12:27:28]</a>. They sneak into temples and treat the rituals as if [[analysis_of_audiences_complicity_and_enjoyment_in_excess|surveilling animals at a zoo]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:37:38">[12:37:38]</a>. Mark, one of the friends, demonstrates utter disregard for Hårga beliefs by peeing on a sacred tree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:44:46">[12:44:46]</a>. Their reactions mirror that of an [[analysis_of_audiences_complicity_and_enjoyment_in_excess|audience so alienated]] from ancient rituals that they are willing to accept their horrific depiction for the sake of entertainment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:02:03">[13:02:03]</a>.

## The Reassertion of Ritual

Aster uses *Midsommar* to highlight and subvert modern society's [[ritualistic_festivals_and_societal_norms|aversion to mystical traditions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:16:16">[13:16:16]</a>. As theologian David Bentley Hart suggests, our modern religion is often one of "very comfortable nihilism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:24:25">[13:24:25]</a>. We tend to view ritualistic acts as primitive or barbaric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:28:28">[13:28:28]</a>. The film's choice of "very religious Swedes" as its "boogeyman" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:34:34">[13:34:34]</a> speaks volumes about societal fear and [[ritualistic_festivals_and_societal_norms|aversion to ritual]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:42:43">[13:42:43]</a>.

Paradoxically, Astor also presents the Hårga as the solution to Dani's problems, offering complete acceptance, genuine reciprocity, and total empathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:44:45">[13:44:45]</a>. *Midsommar* becomes a shocking reassertion of the value of ritual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:55:56">[13:55:56]</a>. Regardless of how irrational these acts may appear, they serve a rational purpose: to build community and foster a sense of belonging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:59:00">[13:59:00]</a>. This layered exploration of societal critique and the fundamental human need for connection makes *Midsommar* a compellingly deep film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:06:06">[14:06:06]</a>.

From: [[wisecrackedu]] <br/> 

Director Rian Johnson, particularly with *The Last Jedi*, openly aimed to subvert the established *Star Wars* canon, a process he referred to as "killing the past" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. This approach prioritized the specific story of his film over established fan expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

## Key Departures from Canon and Fan Expectations

Johnson's vision led to several significant decisions that diverged from previous *Star Wars* lore and fan theories:

*   **Rey's Parentage** Instead of revealing Rey to be a Skywalker, Kenobi, or another lineage from a prominent family, her parents were portrayed as "nobodies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. This directly defied the "mystery box" teasing established in *The Force Awakens* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
*   **Snoke's Untimely End** Supreme Leader Snoke, a new antagonist introduced in *The Force Awakens*, received no elaborate backstory or reveal of a pre-existing identity. Instead, he met an "unceremonious death" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
*   **Luke Skywalker's Portrayal** The film presented Luke Skywalker as a reclusive, disillusioned figure who had nearly killed his nephew, Ben Solo, leading to his fall to the dark side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. This depiction was a stark departure from the "wholesome hero" who previously saw light in the darkest of villains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. This [[critique_of_the_last_jedis_approach_to_star_wars_tropes | character subversion]] was met with significant fan disapproval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

## Impact on the Star Wars Universe

These narrative choices, particularly in [[impact_of_the_last_jedi_on_star_wars_mythology | *The Last Jedi*]], contributed to a perceived "crisis" in the *Star Wars* universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. The shift in "agreed upon values, meanings, and truths of the Star Wars system" by Disney and filmmakers like Johnson, without the established legitimacy of creator George Lucas, led to significant fan questioning and backlash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

The [[star_wars_fandom_backlash_and_disney_acquisition | fan backlash]] against *The Last Jedi* included issuing anti-Disney manifestos, crowdfunded remakes, and claims of responsibility for the box office failure of *Solo* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. This reaction reflects a "legitimation crisis" within the fandom, where the fundamental values and established canon of the *Star Wars* "social system" were perceived as being violated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

The controversy highlights a shift from traditional fan consumption to "prosumerism," where fans actively participate in creating and interpreting the universe, making them critical of departures from established lore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. The changes introduced in *The Last Jedi* are often cited as a primary example of this tension between creators and the "prosumer" fanbase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.

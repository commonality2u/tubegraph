The film *The Matrix* features characters whose names often carry significant [[religious_symbolism_and_christian_imagery_in_the_matrix | religious]], philosophical, or literary allusions, enriching the movie's themes.

## Neo / Thomas Anderson
The film's protagonist, Thomas Anderson, is a hacker known by the alias "Neo" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.
*   **Neo** – The name "Neo" means "new" in Greek <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. It is also an anagram for "One" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>, which is described as "the loneliest number" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. Neo is further presented as a "Christ figure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. His room number, 101, is a direct [[literary_allusions_and_references_in_the_matrix | literary allusion]] to Room 101, the torture chamber in George Orwell’s *1984*, where prisoners undergo brainwashing by reliving their worst nightmares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.
*   **Thomas Anderson** – His given name, "Thomas Anderson," [[religious_symbolism_and_christian_imagery_in_the_matrix | harks back]] to the Apostle Thomas, also known as "doubting Thomas," who initially expressed reservations about Jesus's role as a savior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. Etymologically, "Anderson" means "son of man" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>, a self-referential nickname Jesus occasionally used among his mortal companions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

## Morpheus
The character Morpheus is named after the God of Dreams in Ovid's *Metamorphoses* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

## Trinity
Trinity's name is a direct reference to the Christian Bible’s "Holy Trinity": the Father, the Son, and the Holy Grail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. Just as the Holy Trinity is purportedly responsible for bringing Jesus back to life, Trinity performs a similar act by bringing Neo back to life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. Additionally, Trinity begins the movie in room 303, a number containing "threes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

## Cypher
Cypher is depicted as Neo’s "Judas," betraying him for personal gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

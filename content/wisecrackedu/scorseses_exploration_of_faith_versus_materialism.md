In *The Wolf of Wall Street*, director Martin Scorsese, a devout Catholic, delves into themes of faith and materialism, a common thread throughout his filmography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. While many of his previous works explore religious faith directly, *The Wolf of Wall Street* presents a world where characters worship at the altar of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

## The Allure of Wealth

The film's final shot features a crowd intently staring at Jordan Belfort, reminiscent of a congregation hanging on every word <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. The camera focuses on their "painfully average faces," portraying them as desperate, plain-looking individuals seeking meaning and desiring something to elevate them beyond their mundane existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

Scorsese poses a cynical question: is he likening the transformative power of religious faith to the transformative power of money? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a> However, the crucial distinction is highlighted: "The Almighty never promised a million bucks in eight easy steps" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. This comparison draws parallels to broader critiques, such as [[south_parks_satire_on_religion_and_consumerism | South Park's satire on religion and consumerism]], where material desires often supplant spiritual ones.

## Willing Submission to Exploitation

The film also suggests a more sinister implication: that people might actually enjoy being taken advantage of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. The final image of the crowd worshiping Jordan, despite his detestable actions, could indicate the voluntary submission of the masses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. This perspective aligns with French philosopher Jean-Francois Lyotard's idea that individuals can find a perverse enjoyment in their "banal existence" under the heel of figures like Jordan Belfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. The film's absence of overt moralizing regarding Belfort's actions further supports this idea, as his prison sentence is depicted as a "cakewalk" with no significant change to his behavior or the public's desire for his "dream of getting rich quickly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

This exploration of a society that enables and even celebrates the actions of figures like Belfort adds layers to the film's [[exploration_of_moral_themes_in_the_show | moral themes]], making *The Wolf of Wall Street* a complex totem of a culture of excess that defies easy answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

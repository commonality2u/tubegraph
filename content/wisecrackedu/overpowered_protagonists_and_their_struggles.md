*Mob Psycho 100* and *One Punch Man*, both creations of the Japanese manga artist ONE, explore what it means to live a fulfilling life by examining the unique challenges faced by characters with overwhelming power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>. These narratives suggest that happiness is often the result of deliberate struggle and growth, rather than simply getting what one wants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>.

## Mob's Path to Fulfillment

Unlike Saitama from *One Punch Man*, Shigeo "Mob" Kageyama from *Mob Psycho 100* finds a way to make peace with his psychic abilities and achieve satisfaction in life despite them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. Mob, a middle schooler with near-godlike powers, works for a con man named Reigen Arataka, who advises him never to use his powers against other human beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. Reigen's philosophy is that misusing great power can lead to self-destruction, emphasizing the need for control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

Mob strives for a normal middle-school life, often repressing the rage that fuels his powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. His reluctance to use his abilities, even when attacked by other superpowered individuals known as 'espers,' stems from his promise not to harm others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

## The Pitfalls of Overpowering Abilities

Many espers in *Mob Psycho 100* are profoundly egocentric, seeing themselves as "main characters" in their own unfolding story rather than regular people with limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. For example, Teru, a rival psychic, uses his powers to bully schoolmates and appears to have everything a teenager could want: attention, respect, and power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. Dimple, a power-hungry ghost, even states that Teru "put his psychic powers to good life and live a fulfilling life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

However, Mob rejects this seemingly perfect life, preferring to earn a more fulfilling existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. He believes an easy life built solely on innate gifts would be "pointless," as the things he truly desires (like muscles, understanding girls, or reading social cues) must be worked for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

### The Problem of Entitlement

Many espers, like the Paradisers in *One Punch Man* or the leaders of Claw, harbor a massive sense of entitlement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. This entitlement, rather than bringing happiness, leaves them miserable when reality fails to meet their false expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. They believe they are inherently better than others and deserve special treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

Mob observes that these espers lack substance; if their psychic powers were removed, "there'll be nothing left. You'll be empty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. Their dependence on powers for identity makes them unable to tolerate attacks on their constructed self-image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. Teru exemplifies this fragility, breaking down when Mob's refusal to fight back challenges his self-perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

## The Philosophy of the Sublime

The series incorporates the ideas of Irish philosopher Edmund Burke, particularly his concept of "the sublime" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. The sublime is the feeling of being infinitesimally small in the face of vast, overwhelming forces beyond one's control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. It suspends or destroys egocentricity through a display of power or grandeur that overwhelms one's own capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

Burke believed that experiencing the sublime was vital for a healthy life, as it forces individuals to use mental and spiritual capacities that remind them they are not at the center of the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. A life spent avoiding challenging scenarios that evoke the sublime can become unhealthy, leading to "Melancholy, dejection, despair, and often self-murder" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. Just as a body weakens without exercise, a mind that never experiences its own insignificance remains weak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.

The solution, according to Burke, is "labour" or the "surmounting of difficulties," which "shake and work" the mind and body into proper order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

### Applying the Sublime to Espers

The espers in the show have fallen into the "relaxed state" trap, needing a "reality check" to remind them they are subject to the same rules as everyone else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. They must be "shaken and worked" by forces outside their control to find true fulfillment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.

Teru is a clear example; Mob's defeat overwhelms him with terrorâ€”a key component of the sublime for Burke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. This experience of helplessness and fear of death allows him to realize his insignificance, leading to real peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. Similarly, Reigen exposes other psychic groups, like the "Scars," to the sublime by crushing their delusions of grandeur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. He reminds them that even with their powers, they are "nothing more than a commoner" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. For the espers, freedom comes from realizing they are still human, small and vulnerable like everyone else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.

## Mob's Unique Delusion and Resolution

Mob differentiates himself by actively seeking to be a normal person, joining the Body Improvement Club to improve his physical and social skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. He admires his brother Ritsu, who achieves much without psychic powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.

Despite this, Mob is plagued by his own delusion: as a 14-year-old, he believes he must be in total control and is profoundly responsible for everything that happens, especially during his unconscious psychic episodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. This causes him to repress emotions, ironically giving him less control over his power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>. This self-imposed responsibility is a painful burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.

Reigen, whom Mob respects, ultimately provides the necessary "reality check" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. Reigen reminds Mob that he is just a kid and doesn't always have to bear the world's weight, telling him "When things go south, it's okay to run away" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>. This idea shocks Mob into an experience of the sublime, allowing him to feel his own insignificance and temporarily transfer his powers to Reigen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>. Through this, Mob comes to terms with his abilities and can pursue a good life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>.

Both *One Punch Man* and *Mob Psycho 100* suggest that a truly fulfilling existence is not simply about having whatever you want, but about embracing deliberate struggle and growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>.

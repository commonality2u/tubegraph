*The Incredibles*, a Pixar film [00:00:14], explores the societal implications of exceptional individuals and critiques concepts of equality and mediocrity [00:02:29].

## Premise and Plot Summary

The film is set fifteen years after superpowered humans (Supers) were forced into hiding by "lawyers" [00:00:20]. The protagonists are Bob and Helen Incredible, who have settled into a conventional suburban life with their children [00:00:25].

Bob experiences a midlife crisis [00:00:35], which leads to him losing his job [00:00:41]. He is then offered a new position destroying a robot in a volcano [00:00:45]. This new employer is revealed to be Buddy, who calls himself "Syndrome" [00:01:00]. Syndrome plans to unleash his robots upon the world, then publicly defeat them to gain superhero glory [00:01:05].

Meanwhile, Helen, suspecting Bob's activities, seeks help from Edna to find him [00:01:16]. She flies a jet to Syndrome's island, inadvertently bringing their children along [00:01:26]. The family initially helps Bob escape but is quickly re-captured [00:01:35]. A "hot old lady" assists them in escaping again, this time in an RV [00:01:46].

Back in the city, Syndrome's robot goes out of control [00:01:54]. The Incredibles demonstrate their inherent abilities to save the day [00:02:03]. Syndrome attempts to kidnap the Incredibaby for revenge, but the baby thwarts him, leading to Syndrome's demise [00:02:12]. The film concludes with the tease of a future villain, hinting at ongoing sequelization of intellectual property [00:02:22].

*The Incredibles* delves into how humanity responds to individuals exhibiting exceptional qualities [00:02:29]. The Supers are compelled to suppress their abilities to avoid persecution by a society of "inferior beings" [00:02:38]. This societal pressure reflects German philosopher Freddy Nietzchmeister's (a humorous misattribution of Nietzsche) concept of "herd morality" [00:02:50]. This concept suggests that society demonizes exceptional individuals in favor of appeasing the average [00:02:55].

The film illustrates the frustration of the Incredibles as society rewards non-achievements, such as celebrating a child moving from fourth to fifth grade [00:03:01]. Society insists that "everyone's special" [00:03:17], which is paradoxically interpreted as "no one is" [00:03:19]. This enforced equality imposes a psychological toll on exceptional individuals and ultimately harms society [00:03:26]. An example is young Buddy's interference, which allows a villain to escape and nearly kills a train full of "normies," demonstrating the consequences when "mediocrity gets in the way of excellence" [00:03:33].

### Inherent vs. Manufactured Greatness

Initially, Buddy's transformation into Syndrome might suggest that ordinary people can achieve greatness through determination and effort [00:03:48]. Syndrome builds an "empire of technological innovation" from humble beginnings [00:03:58]. However, the film quickly dismisses this idea, proving that Syndrome's "manufactured greatness" is inferior [00:04:04]. Instead, the Incredibles, whose superpowers are natural and require no effort, are the ones who save the day [00:04:09].

The film conveys the message that greatness cannot be merely aspired to; it must be innate [00:04:19]. As articulated, "It's in your blood" [00:04:23]. Ultimately, *The Incredibles* asserts that "great people deserve great things" [00:04:25]. The Supers reclaim their rightful place at the top of the societal hierarchy by virtue of their "god-given gifts" [00:04:29]. This is exemplified by Dash being allowed to dominate his school athletic program, albeit subtly [00:04:39], and Violet's social success after a new haircut [00:04:45].

The film concludes by highlighting the fate of Syndrome, who fought for equality in a world of superheroes [00:04:52]. He is "murdered" by The Incredibles [00:04:57], reinforcing the film's controversial stance on the deserving nature of inherent greatness.

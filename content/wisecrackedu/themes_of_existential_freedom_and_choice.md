The *Rick and Morty* episode "Pickle Rick" delves into profound [[existentialism_and_radical_freedom_in_bojack_horseman | themes of existential freedom]] and the burden of choice, as Rick's transformation into a pickle serves as a complex metaphor for avoiding personal responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. While the initial reason for his transformation was a brainstorm idea by Dan Harmon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>, and a simple way to avoid family therapy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>, the episode explores deeper philosophical implications.

## Plot Overview and Thematic Parallels

In "Pickle Rick," Rick turns himself into a pickle to get out of family therapy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. This plan goes awry, leading him to fight his way through a sewer and a Russian embassy using a mech suit made of roach and rat parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Meanwhile, Beth, Summer, and Morty attend therapy, with Beth mirroring Rick's avoidance of emotional vulnerability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

The season places increased emphasis on serialized arcs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. Rick's actions, such as staying in "Mad Max land" to avoid his daughter's divorce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a> and literally transforming into a pickle to "run away from reality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>, highlight a developing theme of freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

## Dr. Wong's Insights on Control and Choice

Dr. Wong, the family therapist, delivers a pivotal monologue challenging Rick's perception of control:
> [!quote] Dr. Wong
> "I think it's because the only truly unapproachable concept for you is that it's your mind within your control. You chose to come here. You chose to talk. To belittle my vocation, just as you chose to become a pickle. Each of us gets to choose." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>

This statement initially seems counterintuitive, as Rick appears to be the "master of his universe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>, capable of anything, including turning himself into a pickle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. However, Dr. Wong's words hint at a deeper philosophical struggle.

## Sartre, Bad Faith, and Finitude

The episode's philosophical underpinnings can be understood through the lens of Jean-Paul Sartre's existential philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. Rick, as an atheist who believes "There is no God" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>, embodies Sartre's premise that godlessness implies humans are "radically free to define our own existence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

Sartre's concept of "bad faith" refers to denying one's freedom and making choices based on social pressures or perceived roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. Furthermore, humans deal with "finitude," meaning a fixed amount of choices in life, where each choice precludes others (e.g., choosing to be a truck driver means not being a teacher) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. Denying the importance of these finite choices is another form of bad faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

An example of acting in bad faith is seen in *West Side Story*, where characters blame their upbringing for their behavior rather than taking responsibility for their choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. They "relinquish their choice and blame it on their negligent parents" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

## Rick's Infinitude vs. Sartre's Finitude

Rick's unique predicament is that he deals with "infinitude" rather than finitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. His access to "infinite timelines precludes a necessity of attachment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>, leading him to believe he doesn't need to take responsibility for his choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. If Sartre's human condition is one of finite choices, Rick has "transcended that human condition with science" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

However, Dr. Wong argues that justifying actions with the multiverse or intelligence is not a solution, as intelligence, while aiding decisions, does not eliminate the necessity of making the decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. Rick's intelligence, along with his family's, is used to "justify sickness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. Despite his god-like capabilities, Rick paradoxically struggles to "come to terms with his own choices" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>, as his choices remain uniquely his own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

## Avoiding Choice and Acting in Bad Faith

Rick's philosophy of dealing with infinite choice in the multiverse is to "don't think about it!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. Since therapy compels one to confront such thoughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>, Rick transforms into a pickle, a helpless, armless state, to avoid the appearance of choice and evade responsibility for therapy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. This "blatant disregard for his choices" is, as Sartre would describe it, acting in "bad faith" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

This season continues to explore themes of agency, contrasting Rick's all-powerful nature with Jerry's powerlessness and Morty's resentment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. Rick's declaration that he is a scientist who "invent[s], transform[s], create[s], and destroy[s] for a living, and when I don't like something about the world, I change it!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a> highlights his extreme sense of agency, yet his struggle to control his own mind remains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

## Further Speculation

A humorous, albeit speculative, connection is drawn between the common Freudian characterization of "everything is a penis" and Rick's transformation into a "phallic object" (a pickle) to avoid therapy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

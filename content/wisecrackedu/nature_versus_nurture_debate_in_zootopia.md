From: [[wisecrackedu]] <br/> 

At its core, the film *Zootopia* explores the question of [[themes_and_analysis_of_zootopia | nature versus nurture]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. Specifically, it asks whether identity is biologically determined, or if individuals can rise above their inherent traits through upbringing and environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

## Initial Premise and Stereotypes

Initially, the narrative suggests that the veneer of civilization is the primary force preventing predators from reverting to their wild instincts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. Characters like Nick Wilde, a fox, outwardly buck negative [[use_of_stereotypes_and_prejudice_in_zootopia | stereotypes]] associated with his species <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>, yet in private, his "sly nature" is still evident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

When predators in Zootopia inexplicably begin to regress to a primitive state, some characters quickly attribute this to biology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>, stating, "It may have something to do with... biology" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

## Reversal of Expectations

However, the film ultimately reveals that the "savage" behavior of predators is not due to inherent biological traits but rather the effect of an "obscure poison" derived from a specific flower called "night howlers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. This revelation leads the animals to understand that biology itself is not to blame for their societal issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

*Zootopia* illustrates the fallacy of relying on [[use_of_stereotypes_and_prejudice_in_zootopia | prejudice]] by inverting many of its previously established [[use_of_stereotypes_and_prejudice_in_zootopia | stereotypes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>:
*   Judy Hopps's fox bully from childhood is now a pacifist pastry chef <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
*   Flash, the famously slow sloth, is depicted as a "speed demon drag racer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
*   The "dumb bunny" (Judy) ultimately solves the case, while the "sly fox" (Nick) takes on an honest job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.
*   The "meek lamb" assistant mayor is unveiled as the ruthless mastermind behind the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

## Societal Parallels

The film's [[social_and_political_allegories_in_zootopia | narrative]] mirrors the social and political [[social_and_political_allegories_in_zootopia | landscape]] of 20th-century America, particularly in its efforts to address societal inequalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. The "Mammal Inclusion Initiative" within the film reflects real-world diversity and affirmative action programs designed to create a more equitable environment for minorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. This parallel is further emphasized through the use of language associated with "PC movement," such as Judy's declaration, "Sir, I'm not just some token bunny" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

The film suggests that societal ills can be resolved through collective effort and optimism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

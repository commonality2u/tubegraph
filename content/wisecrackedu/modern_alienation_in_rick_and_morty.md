The concept of modern [[alienation_and_societal_critique_in_rick_and_morty | alienation]] is a significant theme explored in *Rick and Morty*, particularly highlighted in "Rickmancing the Stone" from Season 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. While ideas like "existence is pain" and "everything you believe is bullshit" have been more fleshed out, the episode "Rickmancing the Stone" delves deeply into the depressing notion that "society may be slowly destroying our souls" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

The episode's plot involves Rick, Morty, and Summer infiltrating the Death Stalkers in a Mad Max-inspired post-apocalypse to steal a glowing rock for Rick's scientific endeavors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. Morty and Summer use this aggressive environment to process their emotions regarding their parents' divorce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Summer acts out, falls for a "swole dude" named Hemorrhage, and undergoes her own "divorce," helping her understand her parents' separation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. Morty vents his frustration through a revenge-driven arm before ultimately deciding to "let it go" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. Rick, meanwhile, behaves somewhat childishly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

## Levels of Alienation

*Rick and Morty* addresses alienation on both a micro and macro level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>:

*   **Micro Level**: The "family kind" experienced by Summer and Morty due to their parents' divorce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Rick suggests Summer's disillusionment stems from her tension with Jerry, implying that only a crumbled civilization can make her feel alive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
*   **Macro Level**: The alienation of society as a whole, which the show uses to frame how individuals lose agency in their daily lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

## Jerry as the "Everyman"

Jerry serves as a prime example of this societal alienation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. Rick's cynical view of Jerry highlights his "complete and utter lack of personal resolve, power, agency" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. Jerry is depicted as a "doormat to the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Morty's deep resentment towards Jerry is rooted in this powerlessness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>, extending beyond his failed marriage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

Jerry is portrayed as the "everyman of the modern world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. Since the Industrial Revolution, there have been complaints about a loss of control in modern life, where people are reduced to "monotonous jobs" instead of having their own trade or farm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. This loss of autonomy is a recurring theme in literature and film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. Morty's anger stems from Jerry embodying this "pinnacle of modern stoogery" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. His existence as a "cog in a meaningless machine" is further emphasized in "The Rickshank Redemption," where the Galactic Federation uses pharmaceuticals to keep everyone compliant and docile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. Essentially, Jerry thrives in a society "devoid of freedom" because he is so inept at being an individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. His inability to assert himself is consistently shown in his interactions with Rick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

In contrast, the Jerry from Cronenberg Earth—stripped of "the trappings of modern society"—transforms from a "useless hack in a loveless marriage" into a "total badass" who manages to keep his marriage together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. This suggests that the "trappings of modern society are inherently alienating and create Jerrys out of all of us" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

## The Wasteland's Transformation

The episode further illustrates this idea by showing the Wasteland's transformation into an industrialized society after Rick introduces electricity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. Summer's violent life is replaced by "everyday banalities"; instead of murdering mutants, she's "grocery shopping for human bits" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. The savagery of the Death Stalkers is reduced to trivial complaints about recycling, and Hemorrhage, once a "murdering machine," becomes a "good-for-nothing couch potato" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

This implies that modern comforts are what drive "our banal, terrible lives" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. Without external threats like mutants, people descend into "bickering about trivialities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. Electricity leads people to watch "blood-dome" instead of participating in it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. While most post-apocalyptic fiction warns of a worse future, *Rick and Morty* [[comparisons_of_postapocalyptic_and_modern_life_in_rick_and_morty | subverts this]], suggesting that modern life is its "own special brand of soul crushing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. Ultimately, comforts lead to alienation from meaning, creating "different kinds of misery" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. Rick's observation on ruining Summer's marriage encapsulates this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

## Speculation on Character Development

It's speculated that Summer might forgive her father because she realizes that modernization turns every man, even a post-apocalyptic badass, into an "actionless lump" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. There is also [[rick_and_morty_as_commentary_on_modern_life | speculation]] about Jerry's potential for character growth, perhaps undergoing a "Tyler Durden moment" akin to *Fight Club*, transforming from a "disaffected modern buffoon to a man of action" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. The show's numerous references to popular cinema make a *Fight Club* shout-out a fitting arc for Jerry in Season 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.

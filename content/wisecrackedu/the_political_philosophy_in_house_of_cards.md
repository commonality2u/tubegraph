*House of Cards* is an American political drama that chronicles the quest for power and the presidency by Frank and Claire Underwood, a power couple who will stop at nothing to achieve their goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. The show rejects traditional political drama narratives that offer redemption or portray good triumphing over evil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Instead, *House of Cards* depicts a political process where raw power and cunning consistently prevail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. The central question the show poses is: Is there more to politics than pure spectacle? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>

In the cynical world of *House of Cards*, characters are constantly maintaining an image, both publicly and privately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. The creators are notably "obsessed with aesthetics"—art and beauty—within the show, often depicting important dealings occurring while characters reflect on art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Claire's appearance is meticulously manicured, with her wardrobe frequently discussed within the show and even featured in real-life fashion articles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

The show's preoccupation with aesthetics also manifests in its frequent tributes to theater, particularly the works of William Shakespeare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. Frank frequently employs soliloquies and asides, a theatrical device Shakespeare used to reveal a character's inner thoughts to the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Many aspects of the show's plot and characters evoke Shakespearean classics like *Macbeth* and *Richard III*, which inform Frank's charming asides about his morally questionable actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. Even Petrov, a Russian character, quotes Gorbachev, who in turn quoted Richard III's famous opening line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

[[the_use_of_aesthetics_and_theater_in_house_of_cards | Theater, aesthetics, and art]] collectively highlight the fundamental concept that [[the_role_of_appearance_and_reality_in_house_of_cards | appearance drives politics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. Politics is presented as a form of theater or performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. For example, Frank visits his father not out of genuine desire, but to "seem more human" for public consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. His frequent breaking of the fourth wall blurs the line between the show and reality, reinforcing the idea of politics as performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

### Politics as Performance

Contemporary commentators lament the transformation of politics into entertainment, where slogans and catchphrases overshadow genuine political argument <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. *House of Cards* illustrates this: Frank destroys Michael Kern's career over an op-ed Kern didn't even write <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. Kern's downfall occurs because he cannot keep pace with media sensationalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. Frank himself fabricates a brick through his window to symbolize a stance against "out of control teachers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

German philosopher Hannah Arendt posited that "the realm of appearances is the realm of politics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. For Arendt, stripping away appearances to find a "core" is futile because appearance *is* reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. This idea stems from the ancient Greek *Polis*, where politics involved entering the *Agora* to speak and be heard, and a citizen's political life was identical to how they appeared to others, much like an actor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. Arendt states that for humans, "appearance—something that can be seen or heard by others as well as ourselves, constitutes reality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

Frank Underwood demonstrates understanding of this concept, stating, "We are nothing more or less than what we choose to reveal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. He acknowledges that his identity shifts based on who he is interacting with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. This can also be interpreted as Frank being a sociopath, carefully crafting manipulations to gain favor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

### [[the_role_of_appearance_and_reality_in_house_of_cards | Appearance vs. Reality]]

The notion that appearances are deceptive is an ancient philosophical idea, exemplified by Plato's allegory of the cave, which encourages disillusionment with misleading shadows to discover a "true" world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. Karl Marx used this Platonic distinction in his "Theory of Ideology," and even *The Matrix* rehashes this ancient concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. Modern commentators who bemoan political media as a "grotesque spectacle" concealing reality are modern proponents of this millennia-old argument <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

However, Frank and Arendt challenge the core tenet of this tradition: that an authentic reality exists behind appearances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. For them, appearance *is* reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. The difficulty in hating Frank Underwood stems from his lack of a stable identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>; he presents different facets of himself—husband, murderer, boss, friend, job creator, liar—to different people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. Remy and Jackie's struggle to reconcile their professional lives with their authentic selves further illustrates this problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

*House of Cards*, through its blend of art, theater, and aesthetics, questions traditional ideas about how reality functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. The argument isn't that Frank's actions or politicians' lies are good, but that disentangling appearances from reality is more complex than commonly thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

### Hypocrisy and Authenticity

Frank Underwood is the epitome of a hypocrite, openly admitting to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. A hypocrite is someone who acts inconsistently with their stated beliefs and puts on "false appearances" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. The term "hypocrite" itself originates from the Ancient Greek word for "playacting," reinforcing the idea of politics as mere theater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. Frank explicitly states, "The road to power is paved with hypocrisy... and causalities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.

Historically, the search for "true motives" and the rooting out of hypocrites in politics have led to negative consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. The "hunt for the Frank Underwoods of the world" is impossible due to the aesthetic nature of politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. Arendt believed that "The search for motives, the demand that everybody displays [their] innermost motivation... transforms all actors into hypocrites and 'hypocrisy' begins to poison all human relations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. Arendt's solution is to recognize our inability to distinguish between "being and appearance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. Even Frank himself might not know his "true, unwavering convictions" beyond the pursuit of power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

Claire Underwood's portrayal suggests that, unlike Frank, there might be something genuine behind her public mask, something she must suppress for her quest for power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. Her immediate act of applying makeup after learning of Zoe Barnes's death implies that aesthetics suppress her true feelings of disgust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. While Frank is elusive, Claire's affinity for art, such as photography and origami, suggests a yearning for authentic self-expression beyond performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. Her attraction to the photographer hints at her being seduced by his genuine bohemian lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.

## [[the_concept_of_legacy_in_house_of_cards | Leaving a Legacy]]

Frank Underwood is primarily driven by a desire for power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. He explicitly states, "Power is more important than money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. This quest for power is a foundation for his larger dream: to build a [[the_concept_of_legacy_in_house_of_cards | legacy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. His pursuit of power can be seen as an effort to create a work of art in the form of his legacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

This is contrasted with the Buddhist monks' sand painting (sand mandala) in Season 3, a practice of painstakingly creating elaborate designs only to destroy them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. Frank is deeply annoyed by the monks, which is significant because sand mandalas symbolize the fleeting nature of existence, contrasting sharply with the Western artistic tradition that seeks to create enduring art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. Frank, who seeks immortality through power, detests the idea of impermanence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. He articulates his view: "Money... is the McMansion in Sarasota that starts falling apart after ten years. Power... is the old stone building that stands for centuries" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

Frank's civil war diorama serves as a counterpoint; it's a way to memorialize his ancestors, but he ultimately destroys it, realizing it, like his presidency, is fleeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. Claire, unlike Frank, does not detest the sand mandala, and its destruction seems to foreshadow her departure from him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. Like the mandala, Claire acknowledges that nothing, including her marriage, is permanent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. Her act of leaving her political life, despite years of effort, mirrors the monks destroying their detailed work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

Claire also grapples with [[the_concept_of_legacy_in_house_of_cards | legacy]], but differently. While she supports Frank's ambitions, she has discarded her own, sometimes neglecting CWI or shunting her desire for children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. When a homeless person rejects her money (a symbol of power and status) and instead turns it into origami, Claire is confronted with her choice: power and wealth over creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. She takes up origami, symbolizing her desire to create a legacy through family rather than power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. The show's title itself, *House of Cards*, raises the question of whether Frank is building a lasting legacy or merely a structure on the verge of collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. Frank states, "I will win. And I will leave a legacy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>, striving for immortality akin to the politics of Ancient Greece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.

## [[politics_as_spectacle_in_house_of_cards | Politics as Spectacle]]

*House of Cards* notably lacks a central tenet of America's political system: democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. The political system is reduced to backroom dealings and media manipulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. Frank openly declares, "Democracy is so overrated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>, and compares Congress to a game of chess where pieces should remain concealed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. Public opinion is merely a variable to be manipulated, easily controlled or "turned off" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. Even the media, meant to be integral to democracy, is part of a larger political game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. Zoe Barnes is fed information beneficial to Frank, and Tom Yates is hired to write propaganda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.

German philosopher Carl Schmitt argued that debate and openness have become mere spectacle for the backroom dealings of party leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. French philosopher Jean Baudrillard takes this further, arguing that in the modern media landscape, there is no underlying truth behind the lies; the lies themselves take on a life of their own, and information circulates like commodities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. Frank and Zoe literally barter for information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>. Zoe's former boss dismisses modern media like Twitter and blogs as "surface" and "fads," as if integrity and depth are obsolete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>. Slugline, the new media standard, prioritizes being edgy, to the point that Zoe's work is not even checked before publication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>. Baudrillard states, "Where we think that information produces meaning, the opposite occurs. Information devours it's own content" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>. Frank tells Zoe, "Is that true? It will be after you write it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>.

This information circuit is seductive. Frank Underwood's character is seductive not only to characters like Tom Yates and Meecham but also to the viewer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>. Frank observes, "Great man once said, that everything in life is about sex... except sex. Sex is about power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. Frank's final act of knocking his ring at the end of Season 2 leaves viewers with a sense of awe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>. The show prompts reflection: if audiences are seduced by Frank, what does this reveal about modern political systems? Are people doomed to be drawn to real-life "Frank Underwoods" and enjoy the performance of politics? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>

*House of Cards* is a multi-layered show that ultimately explores [[the_role_of_appearance_and_reality_in_house_of_cards | the politics of appearance]], whether through art or theater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>. Whether this portrayal of politics is a negative development is left open for debate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>.

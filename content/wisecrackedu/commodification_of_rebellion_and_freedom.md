*The Ricklantis Mixup*, season 3 episode 7 of *Rick and Morty*, constructs a complex and "utterly dismal political world" within its runtime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. The episode explores themes of hope, resistance, and revolution in [[modern_society | modern politics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>. It cleverly mirrors the current political climate, depicting a news organization that trivializes dissent, inner cities devastated by social issues, and institutions that teach the disenfranchised to accept their predetermined roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>.

## Alienation and the System

A central theme building from previous episodes is [[the_concept_of_powerlessness_in_modern_society | alienation]], or the way [[modern_society | modern society]] estranges individuals from the world and their peers, leading to a sense of being "dead inside" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>. In *The Ricklantis Mixup*, various versions of Rick, the "smartest man in the universe," are reduced to the "drudgery of modern life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>. The Citadel of Ricks, despite its apparent ruling class of Ricks, is a place where everyone, including police officers, is a victim of alienation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>. The Ricks are victims not only of those in power but also of an "impenetrable system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>.

## The Commodification of Escape

The episode raises a significant question: does escaping the alienation of [[modern_society | modern life]] merely strengthen the foundations of the system that causes it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>? This is exemplified through "Simple Rick," a Rick who found fulfillment in his daughter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:00">[05:18:00]</a>. His happiest moment, when his daughter says "I love daddy," is captured and run on a loop in his mind, and the "chemical that makes his brain secrete" is used in "Simple Rick Simple Wafers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>. These wafers promise "the impossible flavor of your own completion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>.

Simple Rick embodies a "Ron Swanson" trope, fighting a fast-paced world by "slowing down, working with their hands, and spending time with the family" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>. This concept of the "simple life" – running from urban clamor, living off the land, learning a trade, and reconnecting with family – gained prevalence during the industrialization era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:00]</a>. However, the episode suggests that this escape is not a true retreat but an "essential part of its functioning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:34:00">[06:34:00]</a>.

The "Simple Rick wafers ‘brand’" functions as a "fantasy that reinforces the system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:45:00">[06:45:00]</a>. Ricks remain compliant in their work because they believe they can "unplug from the system with the distilled essence of simplicity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>. Yet, this "unplugging" is itself a commodity, requiring money earned by working on an assembly line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:00">[06:55:00]</a>. Sociologist George Ritzer's perspective is invoked, stating that enchantment with and disenchantment from the modern world are difficult to distinguish and exist in a "reciprocal relation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a>. This means the "fantasy of unplugging with some Simple Rick Wafers further entrenches you in the very system you want to unplug from" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a>.

## The Commodification of Rebellion

The episode takes this concept further by showing how even acts of rebellion are commodified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:36:00">[07:36:00]</a>. When an assembly line Rick revolts by killing his boss and attempting to acquire a portal gun to genuinely escape, his act of "freedom" is immediately turned into a product: "simple rick freedom wafer selects" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:00">[07:38:00]</a>. These wafers promise "the unique flavor of shattering the grand illusion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:55:00">[07:55:00]</a>. The system distills the "joy of rebellion" into a consumable form, ensuring that "freedom from the system entraps you in the system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:59:00">[07:59:00]</a>. Ritzer's idea that "Fantasies draw people into the new means of consumption, and those fantasies can be rationalized in order to further draw people in," underscores this dark reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a>.

## The Illusion of Change

This theme culminates in the bleak message that in the current political reality, the "best we can hope for is the illusion of making a difference" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:00">[08:21:00]</a>. The subplot of the orphaned Mortys illustrates this powerfully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:30:00">[08:30:00]</a>. They embark on an adventure hoping to escape their dire existence, but their "wish portal" turns out to be a "garbage portal," signifying that the system turns wishes into "literal trash" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:34:00">[08:34:00]</a>. Although one Morty sacrifices himself, believing his wish will make things better, the subsequent "change" is merely a ploy by Evil Morty, who comes to power on a platform of unity and change, only to reveal totalitarian intentions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:55:00">[08:55:00]</a>. The children's actions ultimately "mattered" only in their belief, paralleling the commodified rebellion of the assembly line Rick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:00">[09:14:00]</a>. The episode suggests that any promise of real progress, even through [[the_politics_of_disposability_and_class_struggle | class consciousness]] sold by figures like Evil Morty, can be mere "lip service as a means to power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:21:00">[09:21:00]</a>.

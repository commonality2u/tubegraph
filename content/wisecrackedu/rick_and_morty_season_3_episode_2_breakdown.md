Wisecrack's "Quick Takes" began with [[rick_and_morty_episode_analysis | Rick and Morty episode analysis]] to quickly react to current TV shows, starting with Season 3 of *Rick and Morty* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This format allows for timely discussions on new episodes, unlike the longer production time for "Wisecrack Editions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

The second episode of Season 3, "Rickmancing the Stone," features Rick, Summer, and Morty in a [[postapocalyptic_themes_in_rick_and_morty | Mad Max-inspired post-apocalypse]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. The central theme explored in this episode, which has appeared in previous episodes but is more fleshed out here, is modern alienation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. The episode suggests that society may be slowly destroying our souls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## Episode Recap

In "Rickmancing the Stone," Rick, Morty, and Summer infiltrate a group called the Death Stalkers to steal a glowing rock for Rick's scientific endeavors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. The aggressive post-apocalyptic world serves as an outlet for Morty and Summer to vent their confused emotions regarding their parents' divorce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

*   **Summer's Arc**: Summer acts out extensively, falls for a muscular individual, and eventually experiences her own "divorce" from him, allowing her to contextualize her parents' separation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.
*   **Morty's Arc**: Morty expresses his frustration by living vicariously through a revenge-driven arm, ultimately realizing he should let go of his anger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
*   **Rick's Role**: Rick largely acts childishly throughout the episode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

## Modern Alienation

Early in the episode, Rick introduces the concept of alienation, suggesting that Summer's tension with Jerry has made her disillusioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. He implies that only a place where civilization has crumbled can make her feel alive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. The show explores alienation on both a micro (family) and macro (societal) level, illustrating how individuals lose agency in their daily lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

### Jerry as the Everyman

Jerry serves as a prime example of this societal alienation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. Rick's statements often highlight Jerry's complete lack of personal resolve, power, or agency, portraying him as a "doormat to the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. This powerlessness fuels much of Morty's resentment towards Jerry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

Jerry is presented as an "everyman of the modern world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. Since the Industrial Revolution, there have been complaints about a loss of control in the modern world, as people often work monotonous jobs instead of having their own trades or farms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. This loss of autonomy is a recurring theme in literature and film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. Morty's anger at Jerry's powerlessness stems from Jerry being the "pinnacle of modern stoogery," an existence as a "cog in a meaningless machine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. This is further emphasized in "The Rickshank Redemption," where the Galactic Federation uses pharmaceuticals to keep everyone compliant and docile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. Jerry's inability to assert himself is evident in all his interactions with Rick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

### Cronenberg Earth Jerry

A notable contrast to the main Jerry is the "Cronenberg Earth" Jerry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. Stripped of the "trappings of modern society," this version of Jerry transforms from a "useless hack in a loveless marriage" into a "total badass" who manages to keep his marriage together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. This highlights the idea that modern society's conventions are inherently alienating and can turn individuals into "Jerrys" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

## Modernity's Soul-Crushing Effect

When Rick introduces electricity to the Wasteland, it quickly evolves into a modern industrialized society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. Summer's violent lifestyle is replaced by everyday banalities, such as grocery shopping for human parts instead of murdering mutants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. The savagery of the Death Stalkers is reduced to complaining about recycling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>, and the once-murderous Hemorrhage becomes a "good-for-nothing couch potato" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

The implication is that modern comforts contribute to banal and terrible lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. With no mutants to fight, people resort to trivial bickering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. Electricity means people are no longer murdering each other in the Blood Dome; instead, they are watching "blood-dome" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

Unlike most [[postapocalyptic_themes_in_rick_and_morty | post-apocalyptic fiction]], which serves as a cautionary tale of a grim future, *Rick and Morty* suggests that modern life itself is a unique form of "soul crushing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. Modern comforts ultimately alienate individuals from meaning, leading to different forms of misery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

The episode raises a speculative question: Does Summer forgive Rick because she observes that modernization transforms everyone into an "actionless lump," even a post-apocalyptic "badass?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>

## Speculation for Jerry's Character Development

While Rick is likely to remain largely unchanged, there's a possibility for significant [[character_development_in_rick_and_ Morty | character growth]] in other family members, particularly Jerry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. The idea is posed that Jerry might experience a "Tyler Durden moment" with the Cronenberg Jerry, transitioning from a disaffected modern buffoon to a man of action, similar to Edward Norton's character in *Fight Club* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. Given the show's numerous [[rick_and_morty_references_and_parodies | references to popular cinema]], a *Fight Club* shout-out could be a fitting arc for Jerry in Season 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.

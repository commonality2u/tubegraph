*The Purge* film series, at first glance appearing as typical horror with "violent carnage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>, serves as a profound [[critique_of_societal_systems_in_the_purge | social commentary]]. It highlights "dehumanizing policies of our current social landscape" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. The films are considered a "thinly veiled allegory for America's corrupt politics, rigged economic systems, and culture of violence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## The Purge as a Ritualistic Reaffirmation of Order

The Purge is likened to historical ritualistic festivals such as Mardi Gras, Carnival, or Halloween <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. While more violent, these events share the concept of designated times for people to "violate social norms" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

However, contrary to undermining authority, these rituals, including The Purge, actually "reaffirm these social structures" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. The chaos of Purge night leaves citizens longing for the return of law the next day, a "Purge hangover" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. The New Founding Fathers of America (NFFA), who sanction the ritual, are not challenged; instead, The Purge makes people accept the tenets of the ruling social ideology, which is identified as Neoliberalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

## Neoliberalism and the Politics of Disposability

Neoliberalism is defined by policies that promote the free flow of goods and protect "corporate interest" by limiting government intervention in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Each *Purge* film illustrates a different facet of this neoliberal economy, showcasing how characters' economic classes dictate their experience of the Purge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>:

*   ***The Original Purge***: Focuses on the upper-middle-class Sandin family in the suburbs, whose problems include a "sketchy looking homeless guy" and jealous neighbors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. They believe "things like this are not suppose to happen in our neighborhood" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
*   ***The Purge: Anarchy***: Depicts the struggles of a working-class family, like Eva Sanchez, who cannot afford medicine for her father <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. The inner city is shown as a dangerous place during the Purge, with "Purge traps" and government round-ups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
*   ***The Purge: Election Year***: Explores the impact on small business owners, exemplified by Joe, whose Purge insurance premiums are arbitrarily raised, reflecting a lack of "government checks to stop insurance companies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

The differing settings of the first two films can be seen as a metaphor for "white flight," where the affluent abandon cities for sheltered suburbs, leaving inner-city populations exposed to disproportionate crime and poverty, or in the films' context, Purging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

Those who benefit from neoliberalism, like the Sandins who profit from selling security systems based on fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>, also benefit from The Purge. Conversely, those disadvantaged by neoliberalism are also victims of The Purge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>, such as Eva, who can only afford "flimsy 2x4s" for protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>, and Joe, who loses his life guarding his deli with a "shoddy rolling steel door" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

### Superfluous Lives
The Purge exposes how neoliberal economics fosters a "politics of disposability," a concept discussed by thinkers Henry Giroux and Brad Evans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. Suburbanites in *The Original Purge* view the poor and homeless as "superfluous, disposable," dehumanizing them as "swine" and "filth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. James Sandin initially justifies torturing a house guest as a means to save his family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>, only seeing him as human when he volunteers to sacrifice himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

In *The Purge: Anarchy*, Papa Sanchez "sells" his life to the wealthy for his family's economic relief, demonstrating how his life as a "disposable object" is more valuable than as a person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. Eva explains:
> "It's how the wealthy Purge, baby. They buy poor and sick people and they take them in their homes and they kill them where they're safe." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>

The animated series *Rick and Morty* also offers a satirical take on this, with Rick noting:
> "This girl is one of your poor people and I guess you guys felt like it was okay to subject her to inhuman conditions because there was no chance of it ever hurting you." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>

Giroux and Evans argue that people become disposable under an economic system characterized by privatization (like healthcare), deregulation of banks, and the erosion of government safety nets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. Dante in *The Purge* summarizes:
> "For the past twenty years the NFFA has taken to legalize murder to decrease the poor population which in turn keeps the government's spending down. Less welfare, less healthcare, less housing." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>

This "elimination of the population" in *The Purge* parallels the real neoliberal economy, where populations are exposed to a "slow death" through unaffordable necessities or environmental hazards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

### Malthusian Justifications
The justification for The Purge echoes Thomas Robert Malthus's 1798 "Essay on the Principle of Population" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. Malthus argued that growing populations would outpace food production, leading to shortages, and proposed laws to keep "birth rates low and death rates high," including famine, disease, and wars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. Caleb Warrens, head of the NFFA, embodies this logic:
> "Idealistic pigs! They want the impossible. Everyone to HAVE. SOME cannot have. NOT enough to go around." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>

However, Friedrich Engels critiqued Malthus, arguing that the issue isn't population growth but "an economic system that doesn't value workers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. Engels saw Malthus's model as an "excuse to be a dick to poor people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. The NFFA's "over the top Purge ceremonies" suggest more than just economic concerns; they "take 'being a dick to poor people' to the next level" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.

## Conclusion: Audience Complicity

The brilliance of *The Purge* lies in its visceral exposure of how neoliberal economies generate profit "in a predatory manner" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. The privileged profit from weapon sales, insurance, and security systems, while the poor struggle to survive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.

While the main characters in *The Purge* films generally do not enjoy the Purge, the *Rick and Morty* episode on Purging offers an interesting counterpoint, highlighting [[analysis_of_audiences_complicity_and_enjoyment_in_excess | audience complicity and enjoyment in excess]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. Rick's "sick enjoyment of the brutal violence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a> suggests that audiences watching *The Purge* films may be "murder tourists," seeking a "titillating peek at something shocking and new" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. The success of the films might reveal that "People like watching violent shit because... well sometimes it just feels good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

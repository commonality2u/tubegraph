## Grand Theft Auto V as Parody

The world of Los Santos in [[Grand Theft Auto V as a reflection of player behavior and societal norms | Grand Theft Auto V]] is depicted as a "somewhat askew representation of reality," functioning in many ways as a [[the_distinctions_between_satire_social_commentary_and_parody_in_grand_theft_auto_v | parody]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. A [[the_distinctions_between_satire_social_commentary_and_parody_in_grand_theft_auto_v | parody]] is defined as "a form of high burlesque that imitates a specific literary work or style of an author for comic effect, usually to ridicule or criticize that work, author, or style… [[the_distinctions_between_satire_social_commentary_and_parody_in_grand_theft_auto_v | parody]] is often used to make a [[the_distinctions_between_satire_social_commentary_and_parody_in_grand_theft_auto_v | satiric]] (and even a political) point" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

### Corporate and Media Parodies
The game features numerous parodies of real-world brands and media entities:
*   Android phones are "badger phones" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.
*   Apple is replaced by "iFruit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.
*   Fox News becomes "Weasel News," complete with a fictional news ticker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
*   *American Idol* is parodied as "Fame or Shame" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.
*   Figures like Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, and Steve Jobs are combined into "Jay Norris" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.
*   Google Maps is "EyeFind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.
*   Facebook is "LifeInvader" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

[[Grand Theft Auto V as a reflection of player behavior and societal norms | Grand Theft Auto V]] offers an "all out criticism of our media driven world," targeting all forms of radio, television, film, and social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. Some of the most "stinging criticisms" come from listening to talk radio while driving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. The gaming and tech industries are also not exempt from this critique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.

### The Californian Lifestyle Through Michael De Santos
Michael De Santos, a retired bank robber in witness protection, serves as a "conduit to discuss the clichéd California lifestyle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. This lifestyle is characterized by concerns with the economy, capitalism, personal fitness, paparazzi, celebrity, and various forms of media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

Michael himself is a [[the_distinctions_between_satire_social_commentary_and_parody_in_grand_theft_auto_v | parody]] of the stereotypical Los Angeleano, routinely watching TV and being "enamored" with old movies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. His family life further exemplifies this: his wife is "enamored" with her tennis coach and yoga instructor, his son has identity issues, his psychologist is "utterly inept, cynical, and greedy," and his daughter is involved with "porno dudes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. Michael embodies "Hollywood problems" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.

While Michael "rails against capitalism," he "doesn't risk anything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. His criticism is "smug" as he still possesses significant wealth—a yacht, a fancy house, tricked-out cars, televisions, a tennis court, a pool, and a collection of "snazzy cargo shorts with sandals ensembles" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. He merely complains rather than challenging the underlying logic of consumption, "like most people in Hollywood" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

Michael's storyline "digs at the feeling of emptiness inherent in the shallow upper class California lifestyle," portraying a life built around appearance, plastic surgery, self-help, leisure, and misery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.

### Parody of Californian Locations
The game world's setting itself is a "tongue in cheek play on real California locations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>:
*   Vespucci Beach is Venice Beach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.
*   Vinewood is Hollywood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.
*   Del Perro Pier is the Santa Monica Pier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.
*   The Watts Towers are renamed the Jefferson Towers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.
*   Compton is reimagined as Davis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.
*   Long Beach is Cypress Flats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.
*   The Pacific Palisades are renamed the Pacific Bluffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.
*   Bel Air becomes Richman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.
*   The Salton Sea is renamed the Alamo Sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.
*   The surrounding desert, Sandy Shores, parodies the hipster sands of the Coachella Valley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

The game's commitment to "verisimilitude" in creating this "enormous, living breathing environment is outstanding," sometimes being "a little too real" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. This is exemplified by Lindsay Lohan's lawsuit against Rockstar over the use of her likeness for the character Lacey Jonas, a former child star constantly mobbed by paparazzi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.

## Social Commentary and Critique

### White-Collar Crime and Justice System
Franklin Clinton's involvement in manipulating the stock market highlights an "interesting contrast" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. Despite suspicious deaths and millions made through dubious means, "no one is ever sent to jail" for insider trading in [[Grand Theft Auto V as a reflection of player behavior and societal norms | Grand Theft Auto V]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. The game satirically questions why, if it is a [[the_distinctions_between_satire_social_commentary_and_parody_in_grand_theft_auto_v | satire]] on the contemporary condition, "the people that make millions and billions of dollars dubiously rarely ever see the inside of a jail cell" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.

This lack of punishment for white-collar criminals is contrasted with the "very real violence that people deal with in the inner city," both criminal and from the police <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. The LSPD, whose motto is "Obey and Survive," is a "caricature of the LAPD," known for its "stellar" history of race relations (sarcasm) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.

### [[Race cultural appropriation and social critique in Grand Theft Auto V | Race, Cultural Appropriation, and Social Critique]]
Complicated relations with [[Race cultural appropriation and social critique in Grand Theft Auto V | race]] are explored through Franklin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. Other characters, like Trevor, Jimmy, and Devin, "adapt their own version of street vernacular" when interacting with him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. Jimmy, in particular, acts as a foil to Franklin, wearing "blackness like a mask" and merely acting black when he wants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.

The game emphasizes Franklin's "authenticity," for example, by showing him unaffected by weak weed that causes Michael to hallucinate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. The game highlights the [[Race cultural appropriation and social critique in Grand Theft Auto V | appropriation of Black culture]], as Jimmy can "act black whenever he wants but he doesn't have to deal with any of the daily realities of being a person of color in America" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. This mirrors the player who can "pick up the controller and play an 'original gangsta' whenever they flip over to Franklin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>.

[[Grand Theft Auto V as a reflection of player behavior and societal norms | Grand Theft Auto V]] confronts the desire for a "guilt free solution to racism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>. It asks the player to laugh at white people awkwardly attempting to pass as black, while the player themselves "literally control a stereotypical shadow of a black male" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>. The game makes the audience experience the same gratification that a character like Jizzle (Jimmy's adopted persona) derives from living vicariously through "black culture," offering a "more interesting statement on racial politics than just shaming old people and pointing fingers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>.

## Conclusion

To view [[Grand Theft Auto V as a reflection of player behavior and societal norms | Grand Theft Auto V]] merely as a game about "stealing cars and blowing stuff up" or glorifying sex, violence, and drug use is to miss the point and be "on the outside of a long string of inside jokes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>. The main characters—Michael, Trevor, and Franklin—all "serve to destabilize the players ability to believe in the validity and seriousness of a world that they play in" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>.

[[Grand Theft Auto V as a reflection of player behavior and societal norms | Grand Theft Auto V]] is presented "less an opportunity to indulge in debauchery and is more like a mirror that shows America its true nature" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>. The developers are portrayed not as "vindictive sadists that profit off suffering," but as "craftsmen that use the supposed glorification of sex, violence, and torture to create a masterful criticism of American culture" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>.

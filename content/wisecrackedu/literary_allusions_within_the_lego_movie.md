*The Lego Movie*, an animated film based on the building toys, contains a deeper layer of meaning through its various [[the_satirical_elements_of_the_lego_movie | satirical jabs]] and symbolic references. Beyond its initial appearance as a children's movie, it incorporates numerous literary allusions that enrich its narrative and thematic depth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

## Allusions to Classic Literature

### George Orwell's *1984*
The film directly references George Orwell's dystopian classic, *1984*. A poster with "Iâ€™ve got my eye on you" and surveillance cameras are present, evoking the omnipresent surveillance themes found in Orwell's novel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

### Aristophanes' *The Birds*
The chaotic realm known as "Cloud Cuckoo Land" in the movie is a direct reference to "The Birds," a play by the ancient Greek playwright Aristophanes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. This play also features a similarly chaotic realm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

## Historical and Linguistic References

### Vitruvius and Architecture
The character Vitruvius's name is an allusion to a Roman author who penned a ten-volume work on architecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. This historical figure later inspired Leonardo da Vinci's renowned "Vitruvian Man" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

### Emmet's Symbolic Name
The protagonist, Emmet Brickowski, carries a name with symbolic weight; "Emmet" means "truth" in Hebrew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

## Religious and Existential Symbolism

Emmet's journey also features parallels to religious narratives, particularly with his "death trip into oblivion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. His entry into the "real world" symbolizes death, and his subsequent return is portrayed as a Christ-like resurrection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. This contributes to the [[existential_themes_in_the_lego_movie | existential undertones]] present throughout the film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

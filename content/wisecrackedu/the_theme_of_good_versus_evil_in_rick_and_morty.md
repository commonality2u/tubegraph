The *Rick and Morty* episode "Vindicators 3: Return of the World Ender" critiques the simplistic portrayal of good and evil often found in superhero films <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. While the episode serves as a jab at Marvel movies and their formulaic approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>, its deeper focus lies in exploring the complexities of morality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

## Morty's Crumbing Worldview

A central arc of "The Vindicators 3" involves Morty's optimistic worldview disintegrating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. His faith in the Vindicators erodes as the superhero genre is subverted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. This mirrors the erosion of Morty's wholesome view of fairy tales in the episode "Meeseeks and Destroy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. Rick plays a unique role in shattering Morty's perspective in this episode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

After drunkenly destroying the ominous Worldender effortlessly, Rick traps the Vindicators in a series of trials inspired by the *Saw* films <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. Unlike Jigsaw, who seeks to make people appreciate life through suffering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>, Drunk Rick's trials are designed to push the Vindicators over a moral cliff, revealing their true colors and proving to Morty that they are not heroes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. Examples include Vance showing his true nature, Million Ants killing Allen Rails over a woman, and Crocubot exposing the Vindicators' secret <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. Ultimately, Rick asserts his view on the "sham that is heroism" to Morty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

## Inspirations from Pop Culture Villains

The episode draws inspiration from complex villains like Jigsaw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a> and, more profoundly, The Joker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. Morty's carnival ride experience is reminiscent of Alan Moore's *The Killing Joke*, where Commissioner Gordon is tortured by The Joker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. Like Jigsaw, The Joker is motivated not just by murder, but by proving that "all it takes is a little push" for someone to descend into madness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. Rick's "shenanigans" similarly aim to push the Vindicators to their breaking point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

Just as The Joker infects the idealistic Harvey Dent with his nihilistic philosophy by corrupting those around him, Rick turns the seemingly benevolent Vindicators into "violent backstabbers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. This process "upends Morty's simplistic understanding of good and evil" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>, leading Morty to lament that Rick has destroyed "the villains, the heroes, the lines between them... my childhood" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

## Critique of Simplistic Narratives and "Infinite Evil"

Rick's perspective is that "heroes are good" is not a belief he shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. The episode makes a larger point about the detrimental nature of "spoon-fed narratives of good and evil" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. Such narratives, suggesting that "Everyone in the universe is a hero. All you have to do is notice the difference between good and bad and root for good!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>, can lead to significant problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

Philosopher Jacques Ranciere's concept of "Evil" with a capital E, often found in superhero movies, is highlighted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. When conflict is framed as an "ultimate struggle of Good and Evil," the value of winning becomes infinite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. This "fight for the soul of the world" can justify the "worst sh** in the world" to achieve victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

An example of this is the Vindicators' extermination of Dorian 5 to kill the shapeshifting Doomnomatron, believing it was "the only way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. Rick points out he could have easily created a device to detect Doomnomatron from orbit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. According to Ranciere, "infinite" evil leads to "infinite justice," which disregards morals, innocent lives (like the people of Dorian 5), and often loses sight of true justice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

## The Noble Lie and Moral Grey Areas

By the episode's end, Supernova is infected with Rick's nihilistic philosophy, no longer believing in a clear division between good and evil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. However, she recognizes that the *simplistic division* must be upheld for the galaxy's faith in the Vindicators to remain secure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. She is willing to kill Rick, Morty, and even her lover to protect the *perception* that the Vindicators are good, emphasizing that it's the galaxy's faith in their actions, not the actions themselves, that matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

This concept is a "noble lie," an idea made famous by the Greek philosopher Plato, where societies are built on a myth to maintain order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. The episode explicitly references *The Dark Knight*, where Batman lies about Harvey Dent's "goodness" to preserve peace in Gotham <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. *Rick and Morty* has made this type of *Dark Knight*-esque/noble lie shoutout before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>, as seen when the truth about King Jellybean is concealed to preserve the positive idea he represented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

Unlike *The Dark Knight*, which "celebrates this lie," *Rick and Morty* uses it to deconstruct the myth of superheroes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. While Rick asserts that "good and bad are artificial constructs," Morty suggests Rick needs this to be true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

## The Dismal Outcome

The episode suggests that while deconstructing good and evil as arbitrary concepts is relevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>, the complete absence of these concepts is also problematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. This connects to Dr. Wong's confrontation with Rick, where she states that Rick's intelligence is used to justify his family's sickness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.

The Vindicators fail to critically engage with their methods or mission, while Rick refuses to engage with his decisions because, to him, "nothing matters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. If good and evil are mere social constructs, Rick can justify any action he takes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

The episode presents two "completely dismal" perspectives on good and evil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>:
*   **Zero conviction:** The division between good and evil leads to characters like Rick doing "whatever the f*** he wants" without consequence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
*   **Complete conviction:** An absolute belief in what constitutes good and evil leads to people doing "really messed up shit for the sake of good," such as destroying an entire planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

As is often the case in *Rick and Morty*, there are "no right answers. Only wrong ones" regarding morality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

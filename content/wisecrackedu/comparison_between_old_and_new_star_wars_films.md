The modern **Star Wars** series, particularly *The Last Jedi*, has been met with significant fan contention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. Common criticisms include Luke Skywalker's portrayal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>, Snoke's undeveloped character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>, Holdo's plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>, and the Canto Bight sequence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>. Beyond specific plot points, the debate often centers on how the new films relate to and diverge from the original trilogy.

## Mimicry and Subversion

The relationship between Kylo Ren and Darth Vader can be seen as a meta-commentary on how the new **Star Wars** films interact with the original series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>. Just as Kylo Ren is burdened by the legacy of his grandfather, the new films face "seemingly impossible pressure" to live up to the original trilogy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>.

*   **The Force Awakens** closely mimics *A New Hope*, often described as "beat per beat the same movie" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. Kylo Ren's imitation of Darth Vader, including his attire and voice modulator, parallels this mimicry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>.
*   [[Rian Johnsons attempt to revolutionize the Star Wars franchise | Rian Johnson's attempt to revolutionize the Star Wars franchise]] in *The Last Jedi* aimed to break this cycle. Snoke's command to Kylo Ren to remove his "ridiculous" mask, followed by Ren destroying it, symbolizes a move away from rehashing the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. Johnson intended for the film to be a "radical subversion of the Star Wars formula," suggesting that "for the new Star Wars to live, the old Star Wars must die" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>.

### Undermining Tropes and Traditions

[[Rian Johnsons attempt to revolutionize the Star Wars franchise | Rian Johnson]] sought to progress the franchise by "abrasively undermin[ing] the tropes and traditions" of previous films <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. This includes:

*   **Heroic Lineage:** While Luke Skywalker was the son of noble blood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>, Rey's parents are "degenerate winos" and "filthy junk traders" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>. New heroes are portrayed as janitors and mechanics, contrasting with the politicians and princesses of old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>.
*   **Character Portrayals:** Luke is no longer an idealistic hero but a "failed nephew murder/slovenian philosopher" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>. Yoda, once a symbol of Jedi piety, becomes a "would-be book burner" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>.
*   **Critique of the Jedi:** The Jedi order is depicted as flawed, with a legacy of "failure. Hypocrisy. Hubris" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>. Luke blames the Jedi for the cyclical rise of fascist empires, stating that their belief that the light dies with them is "vanity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:02:00">[07:02:00]</a>.
*   **Moral Ambiguity:** The traditional "black and white" distinction between good and evil, literal in earlier **Star Wars** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:00">[08:35:00]</a>, is complicated. Characters like DJ challenge the idea of "good guys" and "bad guys" as "made up words," revealing that arms dealers sell to both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:21:00">[09:21:00]</a>. This marks a morally ambiguous moment, complicating the rebellion's infallible goodness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:49:00">[09:49:00]</a>.
*   **Systemic Critique:** *The Last Jedi* becomes the first **Star Wars** film to explicitly critique the galaxy's military economy, exploitation, and animal rights violations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:28:00">[10:28:00]</a>.

## Reinterpreting the Force and Shadow Archetype

George Lucas based the original trilogy on Joseph Campbell's "The Hero with a Thousand Faces," which sets forth the universal "monomyth" story structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>. Campbell's monomyth draws from Carl Jung's concepts of the collective unconscious and archetypes, including the "shadow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>.

*   **The Shadow in Old Star Wars:** For Jung, the shadow is the repressed "dark side" of the unconscious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>. In the monomyth, this is embodied by a character representing the protagonist's shortcomings and fears, such as Darth Vader to Luke Skywalker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:00">[05:29:00]</a>. The old **Star Wars** encourages conquering these inner demons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:00">[06:10:00]</a>; Luke sparing Darth Vader's life is a psychological victory over his own inner demons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:00]</a>.
*   [[Impact of The Last Jedi on Star Wars mythology | *The Last Jedi's* approach to the Force]]: The film suggests that the Force inherently promotes balance, where "Darkness rises and light to meet it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:00">[06:28:00]</a>. This implies that a powerful Jedi order would be met by an equally powerful dark side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:57:00">[06:57:00]</a>. The new **Star Wars** suggests that conquering the dark side merely causes the Force to "overcorrect" to achieve balance, leading to more amplifications of evil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>.
*   **Reconciliation vs. Conquest:** Jungian analyst Robert A. Johnson argues that suppressing the "dark sides" leads to "accumulate[d] the darkness" and "ego split," forcing scapegoating and perpetual conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46:00">[07:46:00]</a>. This is seen in how Luke's inner demons were "projected onto an evil space wizard" in the original films <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a>. [[Rian Johnsons attempt to revolutionize the Star Wars franchise | Rian Johnson]] tries to complicate the good/bad distinction, suggesting the galaxy needs to reconcile with its dark side for true "balance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15:00">[08:15:00]</a>.

## Backpedaling on Revolution

Despite its efforts to "kill the past" in both form and content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:47:00">[10:47:00]</a>, *The Last Jedi* ultimately "backpedal[s]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:28:00">[11:28:00]</a>.

*   **Rey's Choice:** Kylo Ren offers Rey a chance to end "all the dogmatism of the previous films" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:21:00">[11:21:00]</a> and reconcile the light and dark within, yet she rejects him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:21:00">[11:21:00]</a>.
*   **Reaffirming Old Ideas:** The film reaffirms the very ideas it sought to tear down:
    *   The legend of Luke Skywalker, the "Jedi Master," lives on, inspiring the galaxy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:08:00">[12:08:00]</a>.
    *   Despite the call for the Jedi to die, Rey proclaims, "I will not be the last Jedi" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:28:00">[12:28:00]</a>.
    *   The narrative structure of the original trilogy, including Obi-Wan's "strike me down" line, is echoed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:35:00">[12:35:00]</a>.
    *   The Jedi texts are saved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:49:00">[12:49:00]</a>.
*   **Inconsistent Themes:** The film makes a "psychologically sophisticated case" for why Rey should team with Ren, arguing that the "old way doesn't work" and Jedis are "repressed as hell" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:21:00">[13:21:00]</a>. Ren embodies a more Jungian balance, recognizing the ego and shadow as inseparable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:00:00">[14:00:00]</a>. However, Rey ultimately represents the "old moral code of Star Wars," choosing to be a "morally-pure, infallible hero" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:25:00">[14:25:00]</a>.

This "abrasively subverting everything we love and know about **Star Wars** just to shrug and revert back to where we started" is presented as a central flaw in the film's execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:50:00">[14:50:00]</a>.

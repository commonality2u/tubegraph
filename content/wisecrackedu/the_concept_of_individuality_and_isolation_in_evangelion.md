From: [[wisecrackedu]] <br/> 

*Neon Genesis Evangelion* explores complex themes, profoundly delving into the human condition, particularly the nature of individuality and the pervasive pain of isolation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This acclaimed series, focusing on the original twenty-six-episode run and films *End of Evangelion* and *Death and Rebirth*, posits that much of human suffering stems from the struggle to connect with others while maintaining a distinct self <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

## The Guiding Theme: The Hedgehog's Dilemma

A central [[the_hedgehogs_dilemma_and_its_role_in_evangelion | philosophical idea]] that permeates *Evangelion* is Arthur Schopenhauer's parable, known as the "Hedgehog's Dilemma" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. This parable illustrates that, like hedgehogs seeking warmth, humans desire intimacy but are inevitably hurt by getting too close due to their "quills" or individual natures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. Consequently, people either keep their distance, remaining cold, or learn to live without the warmth of others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

Ritsuko explains this parable to Mitsado in episode three, stating, "Even though a headgehog may wanna become close with another hedgehog, the closer they get the more they injure each other with their spines. It's the same with some humans" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. Episode four is even explicitly titled "The Hedgehog’s Dilemma" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. This desire to avoid injury creates a wedge between individuals, leading to a world of despair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.

Characters consistently grapple with this dilemma:
*   **Asuka** pilots her Eva to find meaning and draw people towards her, fearing being alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. She reflects, "Everybody’s so nice to me now! I don’t feel lonely anymore!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>
*   **Gendo** struggles to show love to Shinji, acknowledging that "When Shinji is near me, all I ever do is cause him pain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. He admits to rejecting the world to avoid pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.
*   **Mitsado** experiences profound lonesomeness, exemplified by her remark after Kaji's death: “Another phone that will never ring” <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

## Schopenhauer's Philosophy: Will and Representation

According to Schopenhauer's "The World as Will and Representation," life is suffering because the world is composed of will and representation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. For Schopenhauer, the fundamental nature of reality is unity, and suffering arises from the struggle to communicate between individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. Individuality itself is the source of this pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.

The universe is inherently one entity, but each individual's will or ego can only perceive the world from its own vantage point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. Anguish, fragmentation, alienation, and isolation result from this disconnect between individual wills and what the world offers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. Kaworu echoes this sentiment: "This is mankind's fate. The thread of human hope is spun with the flax of sorrow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.

This separation of wills is manifested in the show as **AT-fields** (Absolute Terror Fields), which act as unique human souls or life forces that separate each person's ego <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. These fields represent the barrier preventing true connection between individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. Characters frequently discuss what it means to be an ego and have a body, especially as their consciousness slips away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.

Conversations often highlight the fear of lack and the desire for unity: "Our minds lack something basic...And we fear that lack...And that is why we are attempting to become one...We will melt with and fill each other...This is the instrumentality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. Despite the longing for connection, the show acknowledges, "Mankind cannot live without being surrounded by others...Mankind cannot live alone...Although you yourself are always unique...That is why life is hard...That is why life is sad and empty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.

## Freudian Psychoanalysis: The Drives for Connection and Annihilation

*Evangelion* explicitly uses [[freudian_psychoanalysis_in_evangelion | Freudian terms]] and ideas to explore the psychological underpinnings of isolation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>. Episode twenty, titled "Weaving a Story 2: Oral Stage," references the Freudian oral stage of psychosexual development, linking the pilots' motherless status to their dispositions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>. The Evas themselves are infused with the souls of the pilots' mothers, further bonding them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. The characters are all mourning the lost love object that is their mother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

Rei, as an artificial being without a soul, experiences melancholia rather than mourning, feeling deep sadness for something missing that she cannot identify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>. This concept explains why the final episodes of the show are essentially a psychotherapy session within Shinji's mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>.

The Freudian concept of **ambivalence** (the coexistence of passionate love and hate) is also prominent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>. Shinji, for example, consistently states his hatred for his father, Gendo ("However, I really hated my father" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>), yet repeatedly pilots his Eva to earn his father's praise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>. He runs away from his responsibilities but always returns, embodying the internal conflict: "I mustn't run away. I mustn't not run away" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>.

Crucially, *Evangelion* delves into Freud's **Eros (life drive)** and **Thanatos (death drive)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>. The pleasure principle, the inclination to avoid pain and maximize pleasure, drives many characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>. Shinji's lament when he falls into a Dirac sea, "This world is filled with too much pain and suffering to keep going on," reflects this desire to minimize suffering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>.

The ultimate desire for peace and tranquility, escaping the pain of individuality, is represented by the **Death Drive** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. This is a longing to return to a state of complete harmony, like the peace of the womb, which in *Evangelion* is achieved through **Instrumentality** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>.

## Instrumentality and the Choice for Individuality

Instrumentality, or the Human Instrumentality Project, is the process by which all human consciousnesses are combined into a primordial soup called LCL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>. This represents a literal [[religious_symbolism_in_evangelion | reunification of the world]] and the end of individuality and separation, reflecting the Kabbalistic concept of Tikkun ha-Olam, or the restoration of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. Both Seele and NERV, and even individuals like Gendo, seek this unified state to escape loneliness and isolation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>. Gendo explains it as "not a return to nothingness. It is merely a return to the state of beginning. It is no less than a return to the primal womb that we lost so long ago. Souls and minds will become one, attaining eternal balance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>.

Initially, Shinji accepts Instrumentality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:09">[00:18:09]</a>. However, he eventually realizes that this means losing himself, as true self-perception relies on the presence of others and the "barriers between yourself, and others" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>. He concludes, "If I am alone, then I will be the same without others! For if this world is only of me, then there will be no difference between me and nothing!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>.

In a pivotal [[philosophy_of_neon_genesis_evangelion | moment of realization]], Shinji rejects Instrumentality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>. He chooses to affirm his individual existence: "I am me. I want to be myself. I want to continue existing in this world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>. He rejects a world of unified consciousness in favor of one where individual selves, wills, and desires exist, even if it means pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>. He confronts the drive towards inorganic existence and accepts the inevitability of suffering in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>.

Kaworu, a non-human character, shows a path forward: accepting vulnerability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. He sacrifices his desires for Shinji, demonstrating unguarded love and openess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>. His advice emphasizes that while distance avoids betrayal, it necessitates enduring loneliness, as "all men are fundamentally alone" and "Pain is something that man must endure in his heart" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>. Shinji's choice embraces this truth, opening the door for both hurt and joy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>. His choking of Asuka at the end, followed by her tender stroking of his face, symbolizes the world they chose: one of violence and pain, but also love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a>.

## The Problem of "Lack"

Ultimately, *Evangelion*'s exploration of individuality and isolation, across its theological, psychological, and philosophical dimensions, converges on the concept of "lack" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:52">[00:19:52]</a>. As explored by psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan, "lack" refers to the missing center at the heart of existence, the gap between representation and reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:19:59]</a>. This "lack" manifests in *Evangelion* as scarcity of friends, failing relationships, and emotional distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:12">[00:20:12]</a>. The series consistently weaves a plot that delves into the "visceral reality of humanity’s disappointing existence," where the challenge is to live with this inherent lack while embracing the difficult, individual self <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:18">[00:20:18]</a>.

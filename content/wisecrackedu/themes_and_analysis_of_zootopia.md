Zootopia, a 24th-century film artifact, portrays a world where humans have ceased to exist, and animals have adopted human attire and societal structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. The story follows Judy Hopps, an exceptionally enthusiastic rabbit who endeavors to become a police officer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Despite graduating at the top of her class, she is assigned to parking duty due to her size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

Judy eventually investigates a missing otter case, where she discovers that the missing animal, and others, have gone "savage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. This leads to widespread panic among the Zootopioids regarding predators becoming "psycho killers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. The mystery is ultimately solved when Judy learns that the "savage" behavior is caused by "night howlers," a type of flower that induces erratic behavior, rather than an inherent biological trait <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. The true culprit is revealed to be the new mayor, a sheep, who was making a serum from these flowers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

## Core Thematic Explorations

### [[nature_versus_nurture_debate_in_zootopia | Nature Versus Nurture]]
At the heart of Zootopia is the [[nature_versus_nurture_debate_in_zootopia | question of whether identity is biologically determined or shaped by environment and upbringing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. Initially, the film suggests that civilization's "veneer" is the only thing preventing predators from reverting to their wild instincts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. For example, Nick the fox, while on his best behavior publicly, exhibits his "sly nature" privately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. The widespread panic among Zootopioids when predators turn "savage" reinforces the initial belief in biological determinism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

However, the revelation that the "savage" behavior is caused by an external poison, the "night howlers" flower, dismantles the idea that biology is inherently to blame for aggression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

### [[use_of_stereotypes_and_prejudice_in_zootopia | Use of Stereotypes and Prejudice]]
The film explicitly illustrates the fallacy of relying on [[use_of_stereotypes_and_prejudice_in_zootopia | prejudice]] by inverting previously established stereotypes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>:
*   Judy's childhood fox bully becomes a pacifist pastry chef <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
*   Flash, a sloth known for being slow, is revealed to be a speed demon drag racer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
*   The "dumb bunny" solves the central case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.
*   The "sly fox" secures an honest job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.
*   The meek lamb assistant mayor is the ruthless mastermind behind the entire conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

### [[social_and_political_allegories_in_zootopia | Social and Political Allegories]]
Zootopia reflects the [[social_and_political_allegories_in_zootopia | social and political landscape of 20th-century America]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. The "Mammal Inclusion Initiative" in the film parallels real-world diversity and affirmative action programs designed to create a more equitable society for underserved minorities and majorities like women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. The use of language associated with "PC movement" further accentuates these parallels, as seen when Judy states she's "not just some token bunny" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

The film suggests that social ills can be resolved through effort and optimism, much like the portrayed resolution in 20th-century America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. However, the film also implicitly highlights limitations to this "inclusion," as reptiles, amphibians, fish, birds, and insects are notably absent, implying they are "dead" or ignored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. This suggests that despite its message of inclusion, the film may selectively ignore certain groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

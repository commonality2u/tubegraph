*The Ricklantis Mixup* (Season 3, Episode 7) of *Rick and Morty* is described as one of the season's darkest and densest episodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. In less than half an hour, it constructs a rich, complex, and utterly dismal political world, which the show then summarily dismisses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Despite the quick dismissal, the episode paints a vivid picture of modern politics, particularly regarding hope, resistance, and revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## A Mirror to Modern Politics

The episode throws viewers into the Citadel of Ricks as it rebuilds following the catastrophic events of *The Rickshank Redemption* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. Democratic elections are held for the first time after the dissolution of the Council of Ricks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

The world-building cleverly mirrors current political climates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a> through various allegories:
*   A news organization, resembling "CNN," trivializes dissent to maintain the status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
*   An inner city is depicted as devastated by drugs and guns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
*   A Hogwarts-like institution teaches disenfranchised Mortys to accept their predetermined lot in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

### Crushing Optimism

The episode's multiple subplots illustrate how political or personal optimism for change is consistently crushed by a cruel and indifferent reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>:
*   **Evil Morty's Rise** Evil Morty comes to power on a platform of unity and change, only to reveal his totalitarian intentions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. His initial rhetoric of [[depiction_of_class_struggle_in_rick_and_morty | class consciousness]], urging Ricks and Mortys to unite against the ruling elite, ultimately proves to be "lip service" used to seize power, followed by a brutal purge of political opponents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.
*   **Corrupt Justice System** An idealistic police Rick, fresh out of the academy, is forced to confront and abandon his ideals when he joins a crooked cop Morty and faces the corrupt underbelly of the Citadel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. This arc is reminiscent of *L.A. Confidential*, where an idealistic cop undermines the justice system he sought to protect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.
*   **Orphaned Mortys' Lost Hopes** A group of orphaned Mortys embark on an adventure akin to *Stand By Me*, but their hopes and dreams are literally discarded into a trash portal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. The system effectively turns wishes into trash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. Slick Morty's sacrifice for a better world is shown to be a naive act, as the promised change was merely a ploy by Evil Morty, having no actual bearing on the overall narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.
*   **Assembly Line Revolt** A Rick, overlooked for a promotion, realizes his life is wasted on an assembly line and revolts, but his triumph is swiftly ruined by the powers that be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

## [[alienation_and_societal_critique_in_rick_and_morty | Alienation]] and Class Division

The episode builds upon [[alienation_and_societal_critique_in_rick_and_morty | themes of alienation]], or the way modern society estranges individuals from the world and their peers, making them "dead inside" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. In this context, numerous versions of the "smartest man in the universe" are reduced to the drudgery of modern life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

A deeply divided society is evident, initially appearing as a split between Ricks and Mortys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. However, Evil Morty suggests this is a distraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. The true divide, he argues, is between the "Rich vs. The Working Class" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. Despite the apparent ruling class of Ricks, everyone, including the Ricks themselves, is a victim of [[alienation_and_societal_critique_in_rick_and_morty | alienation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>, reduced to cogs in an "impenetrable system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

## The Commodification of Escape and Rebellion

A significant [[philosophical_themes_in_rick_and_morty | philosophical theme]] explores whether attempts to escape modern [[alienation_and_societal_critique_in_rick_and_morty | alienation]] merely strengthen the very system driving it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

The character Simple Rick embodies the "Ron Swanson" trope—someone who combats the fast-paced world by slowing down, working with their hands, and prioritizing family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. This "simple life" provides respite from cubicles and assembly lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. While such ideas gained prevalence during industrialization, they were subsequently corporatized, as seen with organizations like the Boy Scouts and national parks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

The episode argues that this escape to a simple life, whether through nature, family, or trade, is not a retreat but an "essential part of [the system's] functioning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. The "Simple Rick Wafers" exemplify this; they represent a fantasy that reinforces the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. Ricks endure work because they believe they can "unplug" with the distilled essence of simplicity, even though this "unplugging" is a commodity requiring money earned by working in the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. Sociologist George Ritzer's perspective is cited, suggesting that enchantment and disenchantment with the modern world are not easily distinguishable and exist in a reciprocal relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. The fantasy of unplugging with Simple Rick Wafers paradoxically entrenches individuals further in the very system they seek to escape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

The darkest revelation comes when a Rick's actual rebellion—killing his boss and seeking a portal gun to truly escape—is also commodified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. This act of defiance is transformed into "Simple Rick Freedom Wafer Selects" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. The system distills the joy of rebellion into a consumable form, demonstrating that "freedom from the system entraps you in the system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. Ritzer's ideas reinforce this, stating that "Fantasies draw people into the new means of consumption, and those fantasies can be rationalized in order to further draw people in" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

## The Illusion of Difference

Ultimately, *The Ricklantis Mixup* conveys a bleak message: in a terrifying political reality, "the best we can hope for is the illusion of making a difference" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. The episode concludes that nothing the characters did mattered, but they are left to believe it did, mirroring the experience of the revolting Rick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.

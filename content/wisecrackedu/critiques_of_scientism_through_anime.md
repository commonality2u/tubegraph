*Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood* is an anime classic featuring high-concept science fiction and action, but its core lies in its strong philosophical examination of science and faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. The series explores the efficacy and application of "Alchemy," which is treated as a science combining chemistry and biology with unique laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. The most important of these laws is "The Law of Equivalent Exchange" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

## Science Versus Faith: An Initial Look

The show immediately establishes a dynamic tension between science and faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. Early on, brothers Edward and Alphonse Elric encounter Father Cornello, a holy figure in the town of Liore who controls people through "miracles" and by indoctrinating them in Leto-ism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. The Elrics' skepticism toward the divine is justified when they expose Cornello's "miracles" as cleverly veiled applications of alchemy used to attract followers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. This initial encounter suggests science is superior to faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

However, the narrative quickly complicates this view. In the subsequent episode, the brothers encounter Shou Tucker, the "Sewing-Life Alchemist," known for creating a talking chimera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. Their fascination turns to horror when they discover Tucker used his own daughter and family dog to create a new chimera, claiming it was merely what science demanded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. This atrocity questions the innocence of science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

## The Problem of Scientism

Shou Tucker's amoral pursuit of scientific knowledge sets a critical tone for the series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. *Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood* compels viewers to question the consequences of clinging single-mindedly to science and reducing all knowledge to scientific terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. This mode of thought is known as scientism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

Philosophers who critique scientism are not saying science is a lie, but rather they criticize the tendency to elevate scientific knowledge above all other forms of knowledge and to reduce other knowledge into scientific terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. According to philosopher Paul Feyerabend, science is just one of many competing explanatory frameworks, not inherently more rational or consistent than others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. Feyerabend cites Copernicus's heliocentric model, which was initially rejected by scientists of his day because Aristotle's celestial spheres offered a more complete explanation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. For Feyerabend, science, like any ideology, can become dangerous if accepted unquestioningly, leading to disastrous results, akin to the ideological tyranny seen with Father Cornello and Leto-ism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.

> "A free society is a society in which all traditions have equal rights and equal access to the centers of power. And this is not the case for scientific tradition. It is very privileged, and it is far too privileged." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>
> — Paul Feyerabend in *Against Method*

### Dehumanization and the Philosopher's Stone

The world of *Brotherhood* demonstrates how science can create "monsters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. This impersonal, dehumanizing aspect of alchemy is embodied by "The Law of Equivalent Exchange," which reduces objects, animals, and even people to their physical components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. The Elric brothers' journey begins because they mistakenly believe they can resurrect their mother by transmuting the basic ingredients of a human being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

This dehumanizing nature is further exemplified by the "Philosopher's Stone," alchemy's most sought-after creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. The key ingredient for the stone is human life itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. While the stone can bypass the law of equivalent exchange and restore the Elrics' bodies, they are unwilling to use it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. In contrast, the "Homunculi," artificial humans powered by Philosopher's Stones, embrace a scientistic philosophy, reducing the souls within the stones to mere alchemic principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.

The Elric brothers, however, use the power of the stones while respecting the autonomy of the souls within them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. This aligns with philosopher Immanuel Kant's view that people should never be used or reduced to calculations, but rather are always a goal in themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

### The Militarization of Science

Beyond its impersonal nature, alchemy in *Brotherhood* is criticized for its subservience to the military <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. The Amestrian government controls alchemy so thoroughly that one of the three state-appointed tenets of alchemy is literally to "obey the military" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. State Alchemists are often referred to as "dogs of the military" or even "human weapons" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

Sociologist Stanley Aronowitz, in his book *Science Wars*, argues that while scientists often see themselves as pursuing truth, their funding often comes from corporations or the state, meaning they don't truly own their discoveries or have control over their application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. Edward constantly clashes with this militarization of science and his own complicity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.

The military's influence even distorts the basic principles of science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. While the Elrics learn that alchemy is about understanding the natural flow of energy, deconstructing and reconstructing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>, this principle is later twisted by the military. A general justifies the destruction of an entire country and slaughter of its population by rephrasing it as "Alchemic Rebirth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

## Historical Parallels and Consequences

As tools of the government, alchemists become instruments of the series' chief antagonist, "Father," who controls the Amestrian state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. Father desires to assume the mantle of God, using alchemy, countless military conflicts, and millions of lives to achieve his goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. The Ishbalan War of Extermination, Amestris's most brutal war, was fought solely to further Father's plan, with state alchemists making a significant military impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

The shocking aspect of the Ishbalan War isn't just alchemy's destructive force, but the scientific language used to explain what is essentially genocide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. Führer King Bradley even uses "The Law of Equivalent Exchange" to justify refusing a ceasefire offered by the high priest of Ishbala <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. Bradley, a homunculus, views even his wife as an expendable pawn for his scheme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.

The country Amestris is reminiscent of pre-World War II Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. This includes its militant expansion, a blond-haired, blue-eyed army resembling the SS, and the "Might is Right" motivation of Nazi Germany, with General Raven invoking Social Darwinism to justify mass extermination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>. Amestris's human experiments parallel those of Dr. Josef Mengele, the lead doctor at Auschwitz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. The show depicts the same want, cruelty, and morbid scientific curiosity seen in Mengele's operations, such as raising babies in underground labs, stitching people and animals together, and ripping souls from bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>. Notably, Feyerabend himself fought as a lieutenant in World War II, earning an Iron Cross, and witnessing firsthand the scientific arguments used by a dictatorship for war and genocide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. This experience likely informed his later proposal for a separation between science and state, with ultimate power resting in democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.

## The Role of Faith

While *Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood* presents a cautionary tale about blind adherence to science, it also explores faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>. Faith is often portrayed as another explanatory model and source of truth and power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. Despite the prevalence of scientists, characters frequently appeal to faith:
*   In "The Miracle of Rush Valley," Ed and Al are awestruck by the delivery of a baby, pointing out alchemy's limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>.
*   Dr. Marcoh, who created the Philosopher's Stone during the Ishbal Civil War, calls it fate that he met the Ishbalan Scar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.
*   Knox, a doctor estranged from his family after the war, invokes God upon their return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>.
*   Even Bradley, a homunculus, wonders if his death at Scar's hand was providence, fulfilled by the sun resembling a crescent moon (symbolizing God in alchemy) blinding him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>.

## Beyond Simple Dichotomies: Integration of Ideologies

The show's thematic takeaway is not a simple "science is bad, faith is good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. Feyerabend's critique of scientism isn't anti-science; rather, it opposes any unreflective veneration of *any* ideology because it inhibits free thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>. Blindly following science as the arbiter of truth is as harmful as blindly following faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>. Examples include Father Cornello using Leto-ists to incite violence or Scar using his God, "Ishvala," to justify vengeance against alchemists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>. Faith alone can be as scary as science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>.

Characters in *Brotherhood* grow when they recognize the limitations of adhering to a single ideology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. Edward and Alphonse, for example, question Western Alchemy when Father cancels out its energy source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>. Their quest leads them to Alkahestry, alchemy's eastern equivalent, which uses life energy from the planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. By bridging these two ideologies, the heroes eventually triumph, using both scientific approaches to create a reverse transmutation circle that saves Amestris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>.

Scar, a survivor of the Ishbalan War who initially targets State Alchemists out of revenge and sees them as transgressing against God, undergoes a significant transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>. He realizes his vengeance was wrong and that no ideology can justify murder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>. Scar even breaks from his strict religious laws by using the very alchemy his God abhors to save the country he once hated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>.

In contrast, Father, the main antagonist, clings to his single-minded belief in science, becoming obsessed with alchemy's power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>. He views mankind as mere materials for him to use in becoming God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>. Blinded by scientism, Father cannot understand the value of human emotions and discards them in his pursuit of perfection, literally ripping the Seven Deadly Sins from himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>. Ultimately, his conviction in the absolute supremacy of science and the ability to achieve perfection through it leads to his undoing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>. The souls trapped in the Philosopher's Stone, which he dismissed as mere energy, assert their will and repel against him, demonstrating that his conception of a soul as a mere ingredient fails to account for individual autonomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>. In his final moments, still clinging to scientism, Father demands to know what he did wrong from the being known as "Truth," but he refused to recognize human wisdom beyond alchemy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a>.

## The Elric Brothers' Enduring Search for Truth

The Elric brothers stand out due to their humble rejection of a single ideology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>. From the outset, they grapple with the nature of alchemy and what it means to be a State Alchemist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>. At their core is a strong desire to discover their *own* truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:28">[00:19:28]</a>. When confronted by "Solf J. Kimblee," who questions why Alphonse doesn't just take the Philosopher's Stone to get his body back even if it means sacrificing the world's safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>, Al rejects this alchemic worldview, reaffirming their desire for *their own* truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>.

This search for possibilities distinguishes the brothers and allows Edward to make his final transmutation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:08">[00:20:08]</a>. After Alphonse sacrifices himself, Ed follows him into the portal. When asked by "Truth" what price he will pay, Ed offers his ability to perform alchemy, recognizing the arrogance in believing that alchemy could explain everything or solve all his problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:15">[00:20:15]</a>. Unlike Father, who equated alchemy with power, Ed knows the truth: the world doesn't belong to him, and he is merely a small part of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:40">[00:20:40]</a>.

With their bodies restored and the day saved, the Elrics continue their search for truth and new methods to discover it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>. They aim to give back to those who helped them, not through a cold formula like "The Law of Equivalent Exchange," but through mutual growth and assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:10">[00:21:10]</a>. Alphonse travels east and Edward west, seeking to gather all knowledge to make this principle a reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:32">[00:21:32]</a>. As Edward's confession to Winry illustrates, science alone cannot explain everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a>.

*Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood* serves as a powerful reminder that pure devotion to science can lead down a dark path, and that injecting philosophy into how we view the world is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:11">[00:22:11]</a>.

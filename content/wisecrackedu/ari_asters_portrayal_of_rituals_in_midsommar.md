From: [[wisecrackedu]] <br/> 

Director Ari Aster's 2019 film *Midsommar* "stunned and delighted horror fans" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, with contemporary horror director Jordan Peele calling it "the most idyllic horror film of all time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. The film prompts questions about whether there's deeper meaning behind its "gnarly vision of the Swedish countryside" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>, particularly concerning its [[ritualistic_festivals_and_societal_norms | ritualistic festivals]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

## A Blended Reality: Fact and Fiction in Hårga Rituals

Aster's depiction of the Midsummer festival is not entirely "anthropological fidelity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. While the actual Midsummer holiday in Sweden is a "light and happy tradition" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a> celebrating summer, fertility, dancing around Maypoles, and decorating with plants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>, the film portrays it as a "bloodbath where grandpas jump off cliffs or hapless foreigners are put in funny hats and burn to a crisp" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. The film's death rituals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a> and "weird sex stuff" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a> were largely Aster's "twisted brainchild" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>, although baby-making is a significant part of real Midsummer, explaining why many Swedes are born nine months after the solstice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. Celebrating Swedes are also more likely to drink alcohol than "trip balls" on psychedelics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

However, Aster did extensive research, spending months drawing from [[influence_of_swedish_culture_and_mythology_in_midsommar | Swedish traditions and folklore]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>, as well as [[influence_of_swedish_culture_and_mythology_in_midsommar | Norse mythology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
*   **Authentic Elements**: Hårga is a real rural village <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>, and much of the film's imagery, including the Maypole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>, barn paintings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>, eating herring, and wearing flower wreaths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>, is consistent with real Swedish Midsummer celebrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. The blessing of crops is also drawn from a 19th-century anthropological study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.
*   **Runic Symbolism**: Aster learned the Scandinavian runic alphabet, with Hårga clothing decorated in "specifically chosen runic symbols" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
    *   Christian's robe has the "upwards arrow Tiwas symbol" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>, associated with the Nordic god Tyr, representing bravery and virility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. Tyr's sacrifice of his hand aligns with Christian's eventual fate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.
    *   Dani's dress features an R-shaped "rivo" rune for journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a> and an hourglass-shaped "thawgaus" rune, meaning "new beginning" or "loss of hope," both relevant to her arc <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.
*   **Norse Mythology Influences**:
    *   The death rituals were inspired by long-debated Viking mythology and folklore, which depict sacrifices of animals and humans occurring every nine years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. While scholars dispute whether human sacrifices were common, they suggest it happened before 1050 A.D. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.
    *   Christian's burning inside a bear carcass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a> reflects the significance of bears in Norse mythology, where Viking men wore bear skins in battle believing they offered protection from fire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.
    *   Simon's "blood eagle" torture, where his lungs are splayed open and still breathing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>, reenacts a Viking ritual first documented in 865 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
*   **Love Rituals**:
    *   Hårga young women picking different flowers mirrors the real-life tradition of picking seven kinds of flowers to place under a pillow to dream of a future mate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.
    *   Maya placing a carved love rune under Christian's bed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.
    *   The pubic hair in Christian's pie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a> and menstrual blood in his drink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a> are elements Aster claims come from actual Swedish folklore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

Aster "had fun combining truth and fiction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a> to create a "creepy haven of cell phone-free agrarian life where ritualized human sacrifice is as normal as sourdough bread" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

## The Hårga's Rituals: Shared Catharsis and Empathy

The Hårga people move and behave "like different parts of the same organism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>, with [[comparative_perspectives_on_community_and_belonging_in_midsommar | shared catharsis]] in both pain and pleasure central to their rituals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.
*   **Collective Moaning**: When an old man survives a cliff jump, the tribe "moan in unison as if experiencing a collective pain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. This is mirrored when the women "moan in unison with Maya as if sharing her pleasure" during Christian's sex ritual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>, and again during the final sacrifice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.
*   **Empathy as Language**: Aster describes their language as "empathy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>; "every feeling experienced is shared by the community" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.
*   **Cycle of Life**: The Hårga view life "as a circle, a recycle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>, an attractive concept for Dani, who has recently lost her entire family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.

## Outsider Responses to Rituals

The film contrasts two very different reactions to these rituals among the outsider characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

### Dani's Embrace of Community and Belonging
Dani begins the film in a "cold, alienating secular society" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>, lacking [[comparative_perspectives_on_community_and_belonging_in_midsommar | community and emotional support]] after her family's death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. Her relationships are superficial, as seen in conversations through mirrors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a> or her boyfriend's detachment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

Despite initial wariness and fear, Dani is gradually "seduced by the warmth of their community" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>, especially through shared hallucinogenic experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.
*   **Integration**: Her costume transforms from dark clothing to Hårga attire, culminating in a full dress and flower wreath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. She takes hallucinogens in a ritualized, shared motion with the Hårga girls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>, leading to her first true smile as she moves "as part of the singular Hårga organism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.
*   **Shared Emotion**: When Dani cries after seeing Christian's infidelity, Hårga women cry in tandem with her, "sharing her emotional load and completely empathizing with her pain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.
*   **Surrender to Nature**: Her growing immersion is also reflected by her increasing "immersion into nature" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>, culminating in her May Queen attire covering her in bright blossoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>, symbolizing her "surrender to nature and this agrarian society" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.
*   **Final Choice**: Her new fidelity is evident when she chooses Christian for the ninth sacrifice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. As she watches him burn, she experiences both pain and joy, smiling as she is "free to start anew in a community where she can belong and be seen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.

### Christian and the Bros' Detachment
Christian and his friends approach the Hårga with "condescending distance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>, like "anthropology students working on a thesis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>. They sneak into temples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a> or "watch the rituals as if surveilling animals at a zoo" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>. Mark, preoccupied with sex, shows no respect for their beliefs, peeing on a sacred tree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>. Their "detached shock and intrigue" mirrors the audience's own alienation from "ancient rituals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.

## Aster's Deeper Point: Ritual in a Secular World

Aster uses this "potpourri of references" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a> to explore a deeper point: the film "constantly playing into and subverting our modern secular aversion to mystical traditions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. Religious worship has become increasingly alien to many, leading to "comfortable nihilism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a> and the perception of "ritual acts as primitive and potentially barbaric" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>. The choice of "very religious Swedes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a> as the film's "boogeyman" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a> speaks volumes about contemporary society's "fear and aversion to ritual" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>.

At the same time, Aster presents the Hårga clan as "the precise answer to everything wrong with Dani's life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>, offering her "complete acceptance, genuine reciprocity, and total empathy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>. Thus, *Midsommar* serves as a "shocking reassertion of the value of ritual" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>. Regardless of how irrational these acts may appear, they possess a "very rational purpose: to build community and a sense of belonging" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>.

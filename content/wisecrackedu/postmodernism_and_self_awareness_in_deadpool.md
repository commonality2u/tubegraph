From: [[wisecrackedu]] <br/> 

*Deadpool*, a film characterized by its self-aware, fourth-wall-breaking nature, has achieved unprecedented popularity in mainstream media, becoming the highest-grossing R-rated movie ever and Ryan Reynolds' biggest opening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This success is notable given its departure from the traditional superhero formula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Unlike typical superheroes, Deadpool does not fight for the greater good, is not selfless, and is decidedly not family-friendly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

The character, a Marvel ripoff of a DC competitor, constantly mocks the medium he inhabits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. Deadpool's popularity reflects a growing trend in media that, while seemingly new, is rooted in older philosophical concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Achieving "Fuck It"

Deadpool distinguishes himself within the Marvel universe by being an inveterate wiseass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. He is acutely aware of his status as a superhero, frequently breaking the fourth wall and commenting on comic book tropes and culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Deadpool takes nothing seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>; even the film's ad campaign was conceived in a "Deadpoolian fashion," including Valentine's Day ads designed to troll partners and a Tinder profile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

### Deadpool as a [[postmodernism_in_monty_pythons_work | Postmodern]] Work

Perhaps the best way to understand *Deadpool* is as a [[postmodernism_in_monty_pythons_work | postmodern]] work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. [[postmodernism_in_monty_pythons_work | Postmodernism]], a movement in arts and philosophy, typically rejects "grand narratives" used to interpret the world, such as the battle of good versus evil, democracy versus communism, or the inherent promise of technological progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. [[postmodernism_in_monty_pythons_work | Postmodern]] works often defy tradition and embrace "meta" self-reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

*Deadpool* is hyper-aware of itself and its position within the superhero genre <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. The film features numerous Ryan Reynolds jokes, including references to "The Green Lantern" and his appearance on People Magazine's "Sexiest Man Alive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. While traditional superhero films often present a grand narrative of good triumphing over evil, *Deadpool*, in [[postmodernism_in_monty_pythons_work | postmodern]] fashion, rejects this, opting instead for revenge and love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

The film illustrates this tension between old-world narratives and [[postmodernism_in_monty_pythons_work | postmodernism]] in various ways:
*   **Colossus's Attempts**: Colossus repeatedly tries to convince Deadpool to join the X-Men and embody a "good superhero" role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
*   **Dopinder Subplot**: The subplot involving Dopinder subverts classic narratives of courtly love, with kidnapping being more effective than chivalry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
*   **Blind Al**: Blind Al is a deranged version of the classic trope of a deformed protagonist taking refuge with a benevolent blind benefactor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.
*   **Love Interest**: The hero's love interest is not a fair maiden, but a prostitute turned stripper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

### Connection to Don Quixote

*Deadpool* can be seen as a spiritual successor to *Don Quixote*, a 400-year-old novel that also satirized heroes of its era, employed meta-narratives, and is considered by some a proto-[[postmodernism_in_monty_pythons_work | postmodern]] work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. *Don Quixote* is a story within a story, featuring a fictional author who discovers fictional accounts, and characters who are aware of being written about, with the fictional author constantly breaking the fourth wall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. In fact, Deadpool kills Don Quixote in the comic books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

*Don Quixote* was written during a period of burgeoning radical skepticism towards the existing order, just before the Enlightenment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. While the Enlightenment responded by promoting rationality, *Don Quixote* simply aimed to mock Spanish society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. Similarly, *Deadpool* signals a disenchantment with old, righteous narratives in contemporary society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

## Ironic Distance and Cynicism

Joss Whedon has criticized the pervasive self-referential nature of modern culture, exemplified by a scene in *Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom* where a self-aware joke about the protagonist's gun trick falls flat because it's a prequel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. This "self-reference for the sake of self-reference" has engulfed film, television, and literature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

This self-awareness often adopts a cynical tone. For example, in the *Tarzan* trailer, Jane overtly acknowledges her role as a "damsel in distress" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. Such films recognize their use of tired tropes but apologize for them, expecting audiences to view this self-awareness as clever, rather than creating something new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. *Star Trek Into Darkness* ends with a scene that is merely an "opposite day" version of a classic cinema moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>, and *22 Jump Street* reuses the exact plot of its predecessor, relying on Ice Cube's character to call out the repetition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.

This cynical attitude has escalated from self-reference to self-effacement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. Hollywood, perceived as a "decrepit machine fueled by the ideas of yesteryear," acknowledges its lazy clichés with a wink and a nod, or uses irony to undercut dramatic moments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

*Deadpool* employs both these strategies: it breaks the fourth wall to include the audience in the joke and avoids serious drama <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. While Hollywood uses familiar structures, it distances the audience from sincerity to create a perception of novelty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

### Consequences of Cynicism

Deadpool's humor is largely driven by cynicism and ironic distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. He remains unfazed by torture or gruesome injury, and even combat scenes are undercut by self-aware humor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. His immunity to criticism stems from his defining cynicism; he relentlessly deconstructs any trope that might imbue film with meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. Deadpool's journey is a "shallow endeavor" to regain his looks for love or lust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>, and he evades criticism because he has no moral scruples or values to defend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. His identity is purely reactionary, risking nothing but making fun of everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

The film itself "has 0 fucks to give" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>, with its ad campaign not taking itself seriously and the movie highlighting its own flaws, such as the overuse of superhero tropes or obvious budgetary constraints (e.g., Negasonic Teenage Warhead being a "Walmart bargain bin DVD" equivalent) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. However, the question remains whether merely being aware of and apologizing for its shortcomings makes a movie good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.

While Deadpool's self-reflective, edgy commentary is enjoyable, there's a danger in this trend: it "never creates anything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>, leading to an endless spiral of meta-commentary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. This phenomenon is likened to "hipsters," who ironically embrace clichés, endlessly recycle culture, and position themselves against the mainstream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. Douglas Haddow suggested that "the danger of the hipster is the end of Western civilization itself, 'a culture lost in the superficiality of its past and unable to create any new meaning'" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. *Deadpool* does not reinvent the superhero genre; it exists only to mock it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.

The fundamental issue is that "bashing the system" may feel good and provoke laughter, but it is ultimately powerless and does not change the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. As Slavoj Zizek noted, "cynical distance, laughter, irony, are, so to speak, part of the game. The ruling ideology is not meant to be taken seriously or literally" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. Just as hipsters present themselves as countercultural through ironic fashion choices, *Deadpool* positions itself as countercultural by celebrating its own played-out clichés and overused storyline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

This cultural impasse may reflect a society uncertain of its direction, having overcome major threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. Deadpool can say "Fuck it" because he doesn't fear death due to his immortality; if life has become limitless, how can anything be taken seriously? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. If the superhero genre has survived its "dumpster fires," perhaps it too is immortal, leading to a "why not break all the rules?" mentality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

Ironically, the comic book version of Deadpool adopted a similar "fuck it" attitude, not because of immortality, but because the creators felt it would be cancelled at any moment, leading them to write as if nothing mattered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. This societal "fuck it" might stem from death or existential threats being either too distant or too close to care about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>.

This raises questions about Deadpool's place in the cultural landscape: does its fourth-wall breaking merely put a "shiny makeover over the same old shit," or does it genuinely achieve something new? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>

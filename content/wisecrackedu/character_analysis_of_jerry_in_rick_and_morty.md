In *Rick and Morty* Season 3, particularly in the episode "Rickmancing the Stone," Jerry Smith is presented as a central figure for exploring themes of modern alienation and powerlessness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. His character serves as a stark contrast to Rick Sanchez's radical independence and highlights the soul-crushing nature of contemporary society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

## Jerry as the "Everyman"

Jerry is depicted as the "everyman of the modern world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. Since the Industrial Revolution, there have been complaints about a loss of control in modern life, where many individuals perform monotonous jobs instead of having their own trade or farm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. This loss of autonomy is a recurring idea in literature and film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

Morty's resentment towards Jerry goes beyond their failed marriage, stemming from Jerry's profound powerlessness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. Jerry is characterized as "the pinnacle of modern stoogery," whose existence as "a cog in a meaningless machine" is underscored in "The Rickshank Redemption" where the Galactic Federation uses pharmaceuticals to keep everyone compliant and docile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

According to the analysis, Jerry is "so bad at being a person" that he "thrives in a society devoid of freedom" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. His inability to assert himself is evident in nearly every interaction he has with Rick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. Rick himself describes Jerry as "an inert chunk of randomly assembled molecules drifting wherever the universe blows" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

## Contrasting Versions of Jerry

The show presents a contrasting version of Jerry from "Cronenberg Earth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. When stripped of the "trappings of modern society," this Jerry transforms from a "useless hack in a loveless marriage" into a "total badass" who manages to keep his marriage intact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. This contrast suggests that the comforts and structures of modern life are inherently alienating and can turn anyone into a "Jerry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

The episode "Rickmancing the Stone" further emphasizes this by showing the post-apocalyptic Wasteland becoming an industrialized society after Rick introduces electricity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. The former Death Stalkers, once violent and savage, resort to trivialities like complaining about recycling, and the murdering machine Hemorrhage becomes a "good-for-nothing couch potato" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. This implies that "modern comforts are what drive our banal, terrible lives," leading to alienation from meaning and different forms of misery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

## Potential for [[character_development_in_rick_and_morty | Character Development]]

While Rick is expected to remain largely unchanged, there is speculation that Jerry, along with other family members, may undergo significant [[character_development_in_rick_and_morty | character growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. The idea is posed that Jerry could have a "Tyler Durden moment" with the Cronenberg Jerry, transitioning from a "disaffected modern buffoon to a man of action," akin to Edward Norton's character in *Fight Club* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. This potential arc would align with the show's numerous references to popular cinema <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.

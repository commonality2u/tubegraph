Jerry Smith is a central figure in *Rick and Morty*, often serving as a comedic foil and a poignant representation of modern societal issues. The episode "Rickmancing the Stone" particularly highlights his role in exploring themes of alienation and agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Jerry as the "Everyman"

The series uses Jerry to explore the idea that society might be "slowly destroying our souls" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. He is presented as the "everyman of the modern world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>, embodying the loss of control and autonomy that people have felt since the industrial revolution, with many toiling in monotonous jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>. This societal alienation is tackled on both a micro (family) and macro (societal) level through characters like Jerry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>.

### Lack of Agency and Powerlessness

Jerry's defining characteristic is his "complete and utter lack of personal resolve, power, agency" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>. He is described as a "doormat to the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. This powerlessness fuels much of Morty's resentment towards him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>, extending beyond their failed marriage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>.

Rick himself dismisses Jerry as "an inert chunk of randomly assembled molecules drifting wherever the universe blows" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>. Jerry is presented as the "pinnacle of modern stoogery" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>. His struggle to assert himself is evident in nearly every interaction with Rick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>. In "The Rickshank Redemption," his existence as a "cog in a meaningless machine" is underscored by his thriving in a society devoid of freedom, where the Galactic Federation keeps everyone compliant through pharmaceuticals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:00">[04:33:00]</a>.

## Cronenberg Jerry and the Critique of Modern Society

A significant aspect of Jerry's [[character_analysis_of_rick_and_jerry_from_rick_and_morty | character analysis]] comes from his alternate version, Cronenberg Jerry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>. When "stripped of the trappings of modern society" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>, this Jerry transforms from a "useless hack in a loveless marriage" to a "total badass" who manages to keep his marriage together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>. This contrast suggests that the show is implying that "the trappings of modern society are inherently alienating and create Jerrys out of all of us" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>.

The idea that modern comforts lead to "banal, terrible lives" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:45:00">[05:45:00]</a> and alienate individuals from meaning, thereby creating different forms of misery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>, is a core theme reflected through Jerry.

## Potential [[character_development_in_rick_and_morty | Character Development]]

While Rick is expected to remain largely unchanged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>, the show has hinted at significant [[character_development_in_rick_and_morty | character growth]] for Jerry and other family members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>. Speculation suggests Jerry might experience a "Tyler Durden moment" with Cronenberg Jerry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:00">[06:56:00]</a>, transitioning "from being a disaffected modern buffoon to a man of action" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:00">[07:00:00]</a>. This potential "Fight Club" shout-out is seen as a fitting arc for Jerry in Season 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:00">[07:08:00]</a>.

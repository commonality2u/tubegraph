*Zootopia*, an artifact analyzed by Earthling Cinema, explores the concept of character stereotypes and their eventual inversion within its narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:10">[03:29:10]</a>. The film is set on Earth in the 24th century, after humans have become extinct, leaving animals to inhabit their world and wardrobes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>.

## Initial Character Stereotypes

Initially, *Zootopia* presents characters that embody common stereotypes:
*   **Judy Hopps** The protagonist, an "exhaustingly enthusiastic" rabbit, leaves her family to become a police officer, a "most venerated of all professions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>. Despite her academic success, she is initially relegated to parking duty due to her small size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>. This sets up the stereotype of the "dumb bunny" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>.
*   **Nick Wilde** A fox, he is introduced embodying the "sly nature" commonly associated with foxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>. He is seen as a "hard-working entrepreneur" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a> whom Judy blackmails into becoming her unpaid intern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. His motto, "It's called a hustle, sweetheart," reinforces this stereotype <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.
*   **Predators** The film initially suggests that the "veneer of civilization is the only thing keeping predators from going apeshit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>, implying a biological predisposition to savagery.
*   **Flash** A sloth, is initially portrayed as slow, as highlighted in the film's trailers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>.
*   **Assistant Mayor Bellwether** A lamb, she is initially presented as a "lil pipsqueak" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a> and a meek assistant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>.

## The Inversion of Stereotypes

At the heart of *Zootopia* is the question of "nature vs. nurture" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>, challenging whether identity is biologically determined or can be shaped by environment and personal choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>. The film illustrates the "fallacy of relying on prejudice" by inverting its previously established stereotypes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:10">[03:29:10]</a>.

Instead of a biological cause, the aggressive behavior of predators is revealed to be the result of a specific poison derived from "night howlers," a type of flower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>. This revelation leads the animals to understand that biology is not inherently to blame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>.

Specific inversions include:
*   **Judy's Fox Bully** From her childhood, a fox who was Judy's bully is shown to have become a "pacifist pastry chef" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>.
*   **Flash the Sloth** The slow sloth from the trailers is revealed to be a "speed demon drag racer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>.
*   **Judy Hopps** The "dumb bunny" is the one who ultimately solves the case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>.
*   **Nick Wilde** The "sly fox" eventually gets an honest job, becoming Judy's partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>.
*   **Assistant Mayor Bellwether** The "meek lamb assistant mayor" is unmasked as the "ruthless mastermind behind the entire conflict" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>.

## Societal Commentary

*Zootopia* mirrors the social and political landscape of 20th-century America, particularly efforts to address societal inequalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>. The film's "Mammal Inclusion Initiative" parallels Earthling diversity and affirmative action programs designed to "level the playing field for under-served minorities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>. The use of language associated with the "PC movement," such as Judy's line, "Sir, I'm not just some token bunny," further accentuates these parallels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>.

However, the film presents a simplified view of resolving social ills, suggesting that "citizens of Zootopia are able to fix all their social ills just by trying hard and being optimistic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>.

### Critique of Inclusion

Despite its themes of inclusion, *Zootopia* has been noted for its limited scope, seemingly ignoring reptiles, amphibians, fish, birds, and insects, implying they are "all dead" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>. This selective inclusion leads to the observation that "for a movie about inclusion, they sure do go out of their way to ignore all the freaks and uggos" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.

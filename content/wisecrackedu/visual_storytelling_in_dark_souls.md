The *Dark Souls* series is characterized by its incredibly difficult gameplay and its cryptic storyline, which is described as "impossibly baffling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Namco even offered $10,000 to anyone who could explain the story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. However, the apparent lack of a clear plot might be a deliberate distraction, similar to the techniques used by pioneering Italian filmmaker Michelangelo Antonioni <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## Meaning Through Visual Design

Hidetaka Miyazaki, the enigmatic maestro behind *Dark Souls*, creates meaning not through explicit narrative, but through visual design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:01">[02:01:01]</a>.

An example of this is seen at the beginning of *Dark Souls 2*, where an old lady is shown spinning yarn at a sewing machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:04">[02:04:04]</a>. While her dialogue offers little clarity, the visual imagery references the Norns of Norse mythology, who spin the yarns of fate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:13">[02:13:13]</a>. The game's sparse dialogue, though not pointing to narrative clarity, still echoes its thematic core: piecing together a broken past and understanding one's identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:23">[02:23:23]</a>. At the character creation screen, players are even prompted with the question: "Is this your TRUE self?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:43">[02:43:43]</a>. *Dark Souls* is presented as a nightmarish descent into the unconscious, exploring identity and deepest desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:47">[02:47:47]</a>.

## [[significance_of_birth_and_rebirth_imagery_in_dark_souls | Birth and Rebirth Imagery]]

The game prominently features imagery related to birth and the womb. The first *Dark Souls* opens with a visual birthing scene, where the camera plunges into a crevice shaped like a vagina, through a tunnel resembling an ovary, and into a pit that looks like a womb, full of "things being born" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:56">[02:56:56]</a>. *Dark Souls 2* begins with a similar scene but in reverse: players start inside a labyrinth of tunnels and work their way out through a vagina-like crevice into the light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:14">[03:14:14]</a>. This "tutorial" section takes place in a womb-like environment, from which the player emerges once "developed enough" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:27">[03:27:27]</a>. Womb and ovary-like landscapes are also common throughout the games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:35">[03:35:35]</a>, and the essential item "Humanity" in *Dark Souls 1* is deliberately vagina-shaped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:40">[03:40:40]</a>. *Dark Souls 2* is particularly full of mother symbols from the start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:49">[03:49:49]</a>.

Other birth-related imagery includes:
*   Mysterious nests and eggs that transport players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:10">[04:10:10]</a>.
*   The Demon Ruins covered with hideous egg monsters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:18">[04:18:18]</a>.
*   The ability to get infected with a "horrible egg head" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:21">[04:21:21]</a>.
*   Pregnant monsters hidden in cells, suggesting repression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:24">[04:24:24]</a>.

In *Bloodborne*, characters discuss bloody birth scenes and the screams of pregnant women as players collect parts of an umbilical cord to reassemble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:27">[04:27:27]</a>. The game ends with a bizarre, Lovecraftian baby alien <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:35">[04:35:35]</a>. The "blood dregs" look suspiciously like semen, and speculation suggests the blood players drink could be menstrual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:39">[04:39:39]</a>. The title "Bloodborne" itself alludes to these themes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:46">[04:46:46]</a>.

Instead of having an alien within, players in *Dark Souls* are creatures moving within an alien womb-world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:49">[04:49:49]</a>. The game suggests a desire not to escape, but to plunge deeper into this womb-world, seeking its secrets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:54">[04:54:54]</a>. This "Womb Raiding" is unique to *Dark Souls*, and this obsession with birth is linked to the game's theme of lost identity and self-discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:08">[05:08:08]</a>.

## [[freudian_elements_in_dark_souls | Freudian Elements]] and [[dark_souls_and_psychoanalysis | Psychoanalytic Interpretations]]

[[Freudian elements in Dark Souls | Sigmund Freud]], a game-changing psychoanalyst, believed that the complexity of identity leads individuals to look back to their origins, even to the mother's womb, or further to the "primal scene" (the moment of conception), as a means of understanding themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:28">[05:28:28]</a>. The opening line of *Dark Souls 2* — "perhaps you've seen it, maybe in a dream. A murky, forgotten land" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:54">[05:54:54]</a> — sets up the game as an endless search for identity, trying to return to this inaccessible "murky forgotten land" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:59">[05:59:59]</a>.

### Castration Anxiety

Despite the impossibility of re-entering the womb, the desire persists metaphorically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:08">[06:08:08]</a>. An opening shot of *Dark Souls 2* shows a hand desperately reaching for a mother figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:12:12">[06:12:12]</a>. Freud suggested that social taboos and prohibitions, often embodied by a metaphorical father figure, prevent this access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:17">[06:17:17]</a>.

This concept is visually represented in *Dark Souls* by "arched doorways" that players want to access, but whose paths are blocked by "male guards with big, erect, throbbing uh… weapons" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:30">[06:30:30]</a>. These "castrators" are often the vast majority of enemies, wielding large, sharp, phallic weaponry like swords, spears, and halberds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:44">[06:44:44]</a>. Freud considered swords to be symbols of castration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:10">[07:10:10]</a>. The frequent "YOU DIED" screen, which the average player sees 739 times in *Dark Souls 2*, creates a sense of constant failure and impotence, mirroring Freudian castration anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:19:19">[07:19:19]</a>.

### Vagina Dentata

Female enemies also visually embody this anxiety. Scorpioness Najka and Mytha the Baneful in *Dark Souls 2* are depicted with attractive upper halves but "weaponized bottom halves" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:01">[08:01:01]</a>. Queen Queelag has monstrous teeth in place of a vagina, conveying the message that attempting to re-enter the womb is the ultimate social taboo, and that one will be "bitten" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:19:19">[08:19:19]</a>. This classic symbol of castration is rooted in the concept of *Vagina Dentata* ("a vagina with teeth"), an ancient folklore tale that became an important concept in philosophy and psychoanalysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:30:30">[08:30:30]</a>.

*Dark Souls* visually embodies Freud’s idea of castration anxiety by showing desire and then attacking and symbolically castrating the player, leaving them feeling weak and unfulfilled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:55:55">[08:55:55]</a>.

## The Throne of Want and Unfulfillment

The ending of *Dark Souls 2* reverses the beginning's birthing scene. The hero goes through an "obviously vagina-like door" and is welcomed into the "seat at the heart of the mother’s womb" by a comforting female voice saying, "Take your throne" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:11">[09:11:11]</a>. The throne itself is based on a kiln, a type of oven historically associated with wombs, linking to the idea of a "bun in the oven" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:23:23">[09:23:23]</a>. This "Throne of Want" embodies ultimate desire, a place for the fulfillment of deepest, most repressed wishes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:34">[09:34:34]</a>. However, to reach it, the player must defeat more "penis wielding giant alpha males" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:43:43">[09:43:43]</a>.

Despite the character seemingly achieving satisfaction, the player often feels frustrated, questioning the purpose of 60 hours of gameplay for vague dialogue and an unlifted curse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:54:54">[09:54:54]</a>. The game suggests that the puzzle of desires and identities will never be fully solved, with the mysterious female voice stating that "souls will flourish anew and all of this will play out again" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:13:13">[10:13:13]</a>.

This reflects the ideas of psychoanalyst [[Dark Souls and psychoanalysis | Jacques Lacan]], a follower of Freud, who argued that fulfillment is impossible because as soon as a desire is met, it ceases to be wanted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:27:27">[10:27:27]</a>. The Ancient Dragon in *Dark Souls 2* directly expresses this Lacanian argument: "the curse of life is the curse of want," implying a destiny of unfulfillment and constant dissatisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:47:47">[10:47:47]</a>.

## Metaphor for Life and Death

Hidetaka Miyazaki has commented that the *Dark Souls* games are about the "strange crossover between life and death," exploring questions like "what is death, and for that matter, what is life?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:58:58">[10:58:58]</a>. Through this lens, *Dark Souls* can be seen as a metaphor for life itself: development in the womb, birth, followed by endless desire, frustration, and misery, until confronting death leads to a return to the peaceful oblivion of the mother's womb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:11">[11:11:11]</a>.

Ultimately, *Dark Souls* visually embodies horrific unconscious desires, a complicated relationship with birth, and the endless failure to find fulfillment, all presented with a nightmarish flair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:26:26">[11:26:26]</a>.

The "Pickle Rick" episode of *Rick and Morty* immediately poses the question: why does Rick turn into a pickle? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a> Part of the answer comes from a writer's room brainstorm where Dan Harmon simply stated, "Rick is a pickle!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a> The more straightforward explanation is that Rick wants to avoid family therapy. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a> However, his transformation into a pickle also offers significant insights into the nature of freedom. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>

## Episode Recap

In the "Pickle Rick" episode, Rick transforms himself into a pickle to skip family therapy. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a> Things quickly escalate as he battles his way out of a sewer and later a Russian embassy, utilizing a mech suit crafted from roach parts and rat limbs. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a> Meanwhile, Beth, Summer, and Morty attend therapy, triggered by Summer huffing pottery enamel and Morty peeing his pants. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>

## Parallels in Avoidance

A striking [[parallels_between_rick_and_beth | parallel]] exists between Rick and Beth in this episode. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a> Just as Rick goes to extreme measures to avoid emotional vulnerability in therapy, Beth actively stonewalls her therapist to maintain emotional distance. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a> The therapist, Dr. Wong, observes that their dynamic may punish emotion and vulnerability, eroding Beth's marriage and infecting her children with the tendency to misdirect feelings. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a> This behavior aligns with a growing emphasis on [[rick_and_morty_story_structure | serialized arcs]] in the season, where Rick consistently avoids reality, such as his daughter's divorce. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>

## Freedom, Choice, and "Bad Faith"

The episode delves into themes of freedom, notably highlighted by Dr. Wong's dialogue:
> "I think it's because the only truly unapproachable concept for you is that it's your mind within your control. You chose to come here. You chose to talk. To belittle my vocation, just as you chose to become a pickle. Each of us gets to choose." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>

At first, Rick's apparent omnipotence makes Dr. Wong's statement seem strange, as Rick can seemingly do anything, including transforming into a pickle. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a> However, drawing from existential philosophy, specifically Jean-Paul Sartre, a deeper meaning emerges. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>

Sartre posited that without God, humans are radically free to define their existence. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a> Choosing to act based on social pressures or perceived roles, rather than acknowledging one's true freedom, is what Sartre called "bad faith." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:03:02]</a> Additionally, human existence is characterized by "finitude"â€”a fixed number of choices, where each choice prevents others. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a> To deny the importance of these finite choices is another form of "bad faith," often seen in pretending not to have a choice, similar to the characters in *West Side Story* blaming their upbringing for their actions. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>

Rick's situation, however, is unique: he deals with "infinitude." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a> His access to infinite timelines and versions of himself means he transcends the human condition of finite choices. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a> While Sartre critiques those who shirk responsibility for their choices, Rick believes he *doesn't have to* take responsibility because he has already made all possible choices across infinite versions of himself. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>

### The Paradox of Rick's "Freedom"

Despite his supreme intelligence and mastery over the universe, Rick paradoxically struggles to come to terms with his own personal choices. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a> As Dr. Wong explains:
> "The only connection between your unquestionable intelligence and the sickness destroying your family, is that everyone in your family, you included, use intelligence to justify sickness." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>

No matter how many Ricks exist, his choices remain uniquely his own. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a> The "unapproachable concept" for Rick is that his mind is within his own control. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a> In Season 1, Rick advised Morty not to think about infinite possibilities, such as "the reality where Hitler cured cancer." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a> By turning himself into a pickle, Rick attempts to avoid choice and the introspection therapy demands, presenting himself as a helpless, armless entity. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a> This blatant disregard for his choices is, in Sartre's terms, an act of "bad faith." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>

## Broader Themes of Agency

This episode contributes to the season's evolving themes of agency. It contrasts Jerry's powerlessness with Morty's resentment, and Rick's stance as an all-powerful "madman" who can "invent, transform, create, and destroy for a living." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>

## A Speculative Connection

A more speculative interpretation suggests a humorous Freudian connection, where the phallic shape of a pickle might allude to Freud's "everything is a penis" concept, linking the object directly to the context of therapy. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>

The *Rick and Morty* episode "The Vindicators 3: Return of the World Ender" serves as a pointed jab at superhero films, particularly Marvel movies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. The group "The Vindicators" is an obvious stand-in for "The Avengers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. In this episode, [[Rick and Morty as commentary on modern life | Rick]] acts as a mouthpiece for audiences disillusioned with the formulaic nature of popular cinema <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

Rick's sentiment on superhero teams is clear:
> "They’re the writers of their own press releases, Morty. They’re a bunch of drama queens who spend an hour talking and 20 minutes jumping around while shit blows up. They’re a phase. We did one. It was the big event of that summer. Let it die.” <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>

## Subversion of the Superhero Genre

The episode's core narrative involves [[Inversion of common cliches and tropes in Rick and Morty | Morty's]] optimistic worldview crumbling, similar to how his view of fairy tales was subverted in "Meeseeks and Destroy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. In "The Vindicators 3," Morty's faith in the Vindicators erodes as the superhero genre itself is subverted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Rick's drunken actions quickly destroy the ominous Worldender with little effort, then trap the Vindicators in a series of trials that ruins their heroic facade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

## Deconstructing Good and Evil

Beyond mere jokes, the episode profoundly comments on the complexities of good and evil, a concept often clumsily handled in superhero films <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Rick's actions, while blackout drunk, orchestrate a series of "Saw"-inspired puzzles, less about confrontation and more about pushing the Vindicators over a "moral cliff" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. This scheme effectively reveals the Vindicators' true, often morally corrupt, natures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. Rick later gloats to Morty about the sham of heroism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

The show draws inspiration from villains like Jigsaw, who seeks to change paradigms through suffering rather than senseless murder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. Similarly, Drunk Rick's trials aim to create a moral crisis for the Vindicators, proving to Morty that they are not heroes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

### The Joker's Influence

A less obvious, but significant, inspiration for the episode's themes is The Joker, particularly from Alan Moore's *The Killing Joke* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. The Joker's goal is to prove that anyone, like Commissioner Gordon, could succumb to madness given "one sufficiently bad day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. Rick's "shenanigans" mirror this, pushing the Vindicators to lose their composure and reveal their darker sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. Just as the Joker corrupts Harvey Dent with nihilism, Rick transforms the benevolent Vindicators into violent backstabbers, shattering Morty's simplistic understanding of good and evil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

Morty laments the outcome:
> "Oh, I don't know, you managed to destroy just about everything today, the villains, the heroes, the lines between them... my childhood." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>

### Critique of "Infinite Evil" and "Infinite Justice"

The episode also criticizes how narratives, particularly in superhero movies, simplify good and evil into an "ultimate struggle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. Philosopher Jacques Ranciere's ideas are invoked: the problem with "Evil" (with a capital E) is that it leads to conflicts where the value of winning becomes infinite, justifying extreme actions, even the "WORST sh**" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

This is highlighted when it's revealed the Vindicators "exterminated a planet" to kill a shapeshifting villain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. The show points out that "infinite evil" warrants "infinite justice," a kind of justice that disregards morals or the lives of innocent populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

## The Noble Lie and its Deconstruction

By the end of the episode, Supernova, like Rick, no longer believes in a real division between good and evil, yet acknowledges the need to uphold the simplistic division for the galaxy's faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. She is willing to kill to protect the perception of the Vindicators' goodness, prioritizing the galaxy's faith in their actions over their actual morality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

This concept echoes *The Dark Knight*, where Batman lies about Harvey Dent's goodness to maintain peace in Gotham <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. Both instances refer to Plato's "noble lie," an idea that societies can be built on a myth to maintain order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. *Rick and Morty* has previously explored this with King Jellybean's legacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. However, unlike *The Dark Knight*, which celebrates this lie, *Rick and Morty* uses it to deconstruct the myth of superheroes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

### The Problem of Nihilism

While [[Critique of religion and belief systems in Rick and Morty | Rick]] states "good and bad are artificial constructs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>, the episode also suggests that the complete absence of these concepts is problematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. This links to Dr. Wong's confrontation with Rick, where she states his intelligence is used to justify his "sickness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. While the Vindicators fail to critically engage with their methods, Rick refuses to engage with his decisions because, for him, "nothing matters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. If good and evil are just social constructs, he can justify any action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

The episode ultimately presents two dismal perspectives on good and evil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>: either a lack of conviction, leading to nihilistic self-justification, or an absolute conviction, leading to catastrophic actions for the sake of a perceived "good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. True to [[Rick and Morty and Existentialism | *Rick and Morty*]]'s style, there are "no right answers, only wrong ones" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

In the *Rick and Morty* episode "Pickle Rick," a "clever parallel" is drawn between [[character_analysis_of_rick_and_jerry_from_rick_and_morty | Rick]] and Beth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. This connection highlights their shared emotional avoidance and its detrimental impact on their family.

## Shared Avoidance of Therapy

[[character_analysis_of_rick_and_jerry_from_rick_and_morty | Rick]] transforms himself into a pickle to avoid family therapy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>, literally running away from reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. Similarly, Beth "is doing her best to stonewall her school-appointed therapist and maintain her emotional distance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. Both characters go to extreme lengths to avoid baring their emotions in a therapeutic setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## Unhealthy Family Dynamic

Dr. Wong, the family therapist, identifies a specific dynamic between Beth and her father <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. She suggests that this dynamic "doesn't reward emotion or vulnerability" and may actively punish them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. This shared trait has negatively affected Beth's marriage and is "infecting [her] kids with the tendency to misdirect their feelings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. The children, Morty and Summer, appear "increasingly damaged" by their parents' divorce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

## Justifying Sickness with Intelligence

Dr. Wong also states that the "unquestionable intelligence" of [[character_analysis_of_rick_and_jerry_from_rick_and_morty | Rick]] and Beth is paradoxically connected to the "sickness destroying [their] family" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. Both [[character_analysis_of_rick_and_jerry_from_rick_and_morty | Rick]] and Beth use their intelligence to justify their unhealthy behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. Despite his "god-like intelligence," [[character_analysis_of_rick_and_jerry_from_rick_and_morty | Rick]] struggles to come to terms with his own choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>, a concept applicable to Beth as well. The inability to accept that one's own mind is within their control is presented as an "unapproachable concept" for [[character_analysis_of_rick_and_jerry_from_rick_and_morty | Rick]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>, and implicitly, for Beth given their shared dynamic.

The show *The Walking Dead* tells the story of sheriff Rick Grimes and his group of survivors as they transform from "coddled complainers" into "battle-tested zombie murdering badasses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. While the [[Zombies as societal metaphors | zombie sub-genre]] has a rich history of social commentary, with zombies often serving as metaphors for various societal fears like mindless consumers under capitalism (as seen in *Dawn of the Dead*), public health crises (*28 Days Later*), immigration (*World War Z*), or mega-corporations (*Resident Evil*), *The Walking Dead* distinguishes itself by exploring a multitude of issues such as politics, psychology, and humanity's relationship to death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. The series offers profound [[Philosophical themes in The Walking Dead | philosophical themes]], particularly regarding what it means to live and what constitutes being human <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## What Does it Mean to Live?

The terror zombies inspire goes beyond merely the fear of being eaten; it provides deep insights into how humans view their own lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. Zombies are unsettling because they are "like us, but not quite us," challenging the fundamental reasons humans use to tell themselves they are special <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. *The Walking Dead* is primarily a show about philosophical boundaries, specifically asking:
*   What constitutes life? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>
*   What constitutes "living"? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>
*   What constitutes being human? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>

The show constantly probes the distinction between life and death. The title itself, *The Walking Dead*, refers not only to the zombies but also to the survivors, raising the question of what truly makes someone alive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. An early example occurs at the CDC where Dr. Jenner reveals that everyone is infected, blurring the line between "walker" and human <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. The constant proximity to death further dissolves this distinction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. A brain scan at the CDC shows that a small section of the walker brain still lights up, allowing them to move and groan, suggesting a form of biological life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. This concept is debated by characters like Carl, who asserts "They're dead now," and Lizzie, who counters "No they're not. They're just different" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

The show consistently explores this blurred line, as characters often struggle to let go of loved ones who have turned, such as Morgan's inability to shoot his zombified wife, Hershel's collection of zombies believing there's still humanity in them, and The Governor keeping his zombified daughter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. This difficulty in letting go stems from the ambiguous definition of life itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

Beyond biological existence, the show delves into the philosophical question: "What constitutes a life worth living?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>
*   **Dale** believes all life is sacred, unable to let go no matter how dire the circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.
*   **Carol** values survival as an end in itself, displaying a pragmatic approach to continue living despite terrible circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.
*   **Rick** recounts his grandpa's war experience, where he "was dead the minute he stepped into enemy territory" but "made it out alive" by "pretending he was dead." Rick concludes, "We do what we need to do, and then we get to live" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. For Rick, biological life is a means to an end: the chance to truly live one day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

At the CDC, characters like Jenner, Andrea, and Jacqui contemplate ending their lives, believing there's no point in living a life devoid of meaning and full of misery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. However, drawing from Albert Camus' philosophy, the show suggests that despite life's meaninglessness, suicide is not liberating; "only life offers us freedom" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. Rick's group, by clinging to a notion of freedom, chooses to keep going <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.

## What Makes Us Human?

Another central philosophical question in *The Walking Dead* is "What makes us human? Or, put the other way, what makes us not a zombie?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>
Initially, one might say humans have purpose and don't hunger for flesh, unlike zombies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. However, the introduction of cannibals confronts this idea, raising the existential question: if survivors aimlessly wander for sustenance and resort to cannibalism, how do they differ from zombies? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a> This blurred distinction between human and animal drives survivors to distance themselves from walkers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. Most survivors wish to be killed before they turn, seeking a proper burial to maintain their humanity in death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.

The apocalypse strips away many aspects defining humanity, leaving only biological selves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. Rick is no longer a cop, but a man seeking offspring and a mating partner; alleged social distinctions disappear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. Rick declares, "There are no 'niggers' anymore. No dumb as shit, inbred, white-trash fools either. Only dark meat and white meat. There's us and the dead" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. Yet, survivors desperately cling to symbols of their former humanity, however trivial: Rick's sheriff's hat, Carol missing her Maytag, Andrea taking a mermaid necklace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. The show suggests that what separates humans from animals can be "our social status, our stuff, and hot showers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

Aristotle argued that the ability to speak and reason distinguished humans from animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. In the zombie world, losing these abilities warrants the claim that one is no longer human <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

### Moral Lines

In *The Walking Dead*, humans often prove scarier than zombies, exhibiting humanity's worst traits: abuse, rape, banditry, and cannibalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. Terminus, the home of cannibals named after the Roman god of boundaries, exemplifies how moral lines are crossed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. The residents have lost their humanity but ironically exhibit bureaucracy, a "crowning achievement" of humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. The show blurs binaries like human/zombie, human/animal, good/evil, and civilization/barbarism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. Gareth's maxim, "You're either the Butcher or the Cattle," highlights the brutal reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.

The struggle to retain humanity is a key focus. The residents of Terminus, originally a sanctuary, turned to cannibalism after being tormented themselves, illustrating a cautionary tale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. A former tormentor, trapped by the rebelling Terminus residents, yells, "We're the same," emphasizing that morality, along with consumer comforts, separates humans from animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.

Helping others is presented as essential to identity. Glenn convinces Rick not to abandon others trapped at Terminus, asserting, "That's still who we are. It's gotta be" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. Dale argues that losing justice equates to losing humanity, stating, "Now the world we know is gone, but keeping our humanity? That's a choice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>. Conversely, some characters believe morals hinder survival, as Martin tells a "good guy," "That's why you're gonna die today" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>. Ultimately, *The Walking Dead* shows that humanity is defined by many things, not just biology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.

A critical question is whether walkers retain any shred of their former selves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. Similarly, the show asks if morally contaminated survivors retain any sense of their former selves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>. Morgan's character arc explores this, as he loses himself after his family dies but is rehabilitated by a former psychiatrist who believes "no person is too far gone to be rehabilitated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. This leads Morgan to refuse killing even the Wolves, who most consider completely devoid of humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.

### State of Exception and Human Nature

The series explores the struggle between dictatorship and democracy in a post-apocalyptic world, where complications arise from finding food, maintaining shelter, and avoiding murder, especially with multiple people involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. Rick's declaration at the end of Season 2, "This isn't a democracy anymore," marks an open embrace of dictatorship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>. This harks back to Ancient Roman legal conventions where absolute power was granted during extreme emergencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.

According to German political theorist Carl Schmitt, the sovereign is "whoever makes the exception," meaning the person who can discard the law in emergencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>. Rick "Cincinnatus" Grimes embodies this, suspending democracy and taking charge when Alexandria is in danger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>. Other characters, like Shane and Carol, also suspend rules for the group's survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>.

Italian philosopher Giorgio Agamben argues that the "state of exception" has become the norm, particularly seen in phenomena like the war on terror and refugee camps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>. Agamben sought to understand how Nazi concentration camps could occur, finding the answer in this state of exception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>. In *The Walking Dead*, Rick, as a modern sovereign, suspends law to save people, sometimes leading him to do "messed up things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>.

The crucial difference between Rick and Gareth of Terminus is that for Gareth, the suspension of law has become permanent, and basic human moral laws, such as "don't eat people," are completely discarded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>. For Agamben, the terrifying implication is that Ricks of the world are "only a few setbacks away from becoming Gareth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>. The show makes it clear that these atrocities are committed in the name of survival, reinforcing the "us or them" logic often invoked by Rick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>. Agamben states, "The camp is the space that opens up when the state of exception starts to become the rule" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>. The problem, he argues, is that whether atrocities are committed depends on the law enforcer as sovereign rather than the rule of law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>. This logic, though set in a zombie apocalypse, permeates modern society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>.

Ultimately, *The Walking Dead*, despite its fictional setting, raises pertinent questions about what makes life worth living, what makes us human, and the circumstances under which societal rules and morality can erode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:33">[00:18:33]</a>. The show leaves the audience to ponder whether Rick and his group will rebuild or if Rick will continue to ruin every place he encounters, and if the world might eventually need saving from Rick himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:49">[00:18:49]</a>.

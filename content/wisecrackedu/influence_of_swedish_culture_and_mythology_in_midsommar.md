Director Ari Aster's 2019 film *Midsommar* presents a vision of a Swedish countryside festival, raising questions about the depth of its cultural and mythological underpinnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. While the film is a horror narrative, it weaves in elements of real Swedish traditions and Norse mythology with its fictionalized terror <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Depiction of the Midsommar Festival

The film's depiction of the Midsommar festival is not entirely anthropologically accurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. The actual Midsommar is a Swedish holiday celebrating summer, involving eating herring, drinking aquavit, and staying up late <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. It is described as a light and happy tradition meant to welcome summertime and the season of fertility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. Real Midsommar celebrations include dancing around maypoles, decorating with ferns and plants, and visiting holy springs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

However, the film deviates significantly from reality:
*   **Death Rituals**: According to Poe Tidholm, author of *Celebrating the Swedish Way*, there have never been any sacrifices on Midsommar, not even in ancient times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. The film's elements like elders jumping off cliffs or foreigners being burned are fictional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   **Sex Rituals**: The "weird sex stuff" in the film was entirely Aster's "twisted brainchild" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. While baby-making is a part of the Midsommar season (leading to many Swedes being born nine months after the summer solstice), the specific ritual shown is not real <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
*   **Psychedelics**: Real celebrating Swedes are more likely to drink alcohol than "trip balls" on psychedelics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

## Aster's Research and Integration of Folklore

Despite the fictionalized horror, [[Ari Asters portrayal of rituals in Midsommar | Ari Aster]] conducted extensive research, spending months drawing from Swedish traditions and folklore, as well as Norse mythology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

Elements consistent with real Swedish culture include:
*   **Hårga**: The village of Hårga is a real rural village <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
*   **Imagery**: Much of the film's imagery, such as the maypole, paintings on barn walls, eating herring, and wearing flower wreaths, is consistent with real Swedish Midsommar celebrations and agrarian societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
*   **Religious Traditions**: Aster plucked elements like the blessing of crops from James George Frazer's famous 19th-century anthropological study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

## Runic Symbolism

Aster went so far as to learn the Scandinavian runic alphabet, an ancient Germanic script <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. He stated that every item of Hårga clothing features specifically chosen runic symbols and an invented hieroglyphic language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.

Notable examples include:
*   **Christian's Robe**: The white robe Christian wears for the fertility ceremony is decorated with the upwards arrow "Tiwaz" symbol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. This symbol is associated with the Norse god Týr, representing bravery, masculine energy, and virility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. Týr famously sacrifices his hand to save the world, which is fitting for Christian's eventual fate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.
*   **Dani's Dress**: Dani's dress features two runes: an R-shaped "Rivo" symbolizing a journey, and an hourglass-shaped "Thauguas" rune, which can signify a new beginning or loss of hope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. Both are relevant to her character arc <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

## Norse Mythology in Death and Rituals

The film's death rituals are likely inspired by long-debated Viking mythology and folklore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. While disputed by scholars, some accounts from the prehistoric Viking period depict sacrifices of humans, horses, dogs, and birds, purportedly occurring every nine years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

Other striking moments infused with Norse mythology include:
*   **Christian's Bear Carcass**: Christian is placed inside a bear carcass before being burned alive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. Bears hold significance in Norse mythology, with Viking men donning bear skins before battle, believing the skins protected them from fire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.
*   **The Blood Eagle**: The gruesome fate of Simon, where his lungs are splayed open and still breathing, is a reenactment of the "blood eagle," a Viking torture ritual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. First documented in 865, its possibility is still debated by scholars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

## Love Rituals and Folklore

Some Hårga love rituals bear resemblance to reality:
*   **Flower Picking**: The young Hårga women pick different types of flowers, mirroring a real-life Swedish tradition where seven different kinds of flowers are placed under a pillow to conjure dreams of a future mate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. Maya, however, places a carved love rune under Christian's bed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.
*   **Love Spells**: Aster claims that the pubic hair in Christian's pie and menstrual blood in his drink are derived from actual Swedish folklore love spells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. However, confirming these specific practices has proven difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

## Conclusion

Aster intentionally combined truth and fiction, old and new mythology, and history to create the Hårga community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. This blend allows [[symbolism_and_themes_in_the_film_midsommar | *Midsommar*]] to be a compelling horror film that comments on society's relationship with [[ritualistic_festivals_and_societal_norms | ritualistic festivals and societal norms]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>. The film uses familiar Swedish cultural elements as a foundation upon which to build its horrifying, yet deeply meaningful, narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>.

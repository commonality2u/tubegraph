*Idiocracy*, released in 2006, centers on unwitting time traveler Joe Bauers and his journey to return to 2005 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Despite alleged attempts by Fox to "bury it" due to concerns about sponsors reacting negatively to its content, such as the "Carl's Jr. F*** you, I'm Eating" slogan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>, the film has achieved cult classic status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. It is celebrated not only for its toilet humor but also for its [[Political Satire and Antiintellectualism in Idiocracy | political prescience]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>, embodying what some perceive as society's gradual degeneration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Idiocracy's Dystopian Future

The film portrays a future America where a pro-wrestler, Dwayne Elizondo Mountain Dew Herbert Camacho, becomes president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. In this world:
*   Politics has devolved into shouting matches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.
*   People gamble for healthcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
*   Corporations feign care for consumers, exemplified by "Welcome to Costco, I love you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   Basic vocabulary has been lost, with people forgetting the word for tortillas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
*   Fully automated fast food exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.
*   Shows like "Ow my balls" are popular entertainment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

The film's screenwriter, Etan Cohen, claimed *Idiocracy* had become a documentary leading up to the 2016 election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>, with many noting the undeniable parallels between President Camacho and Donald Trump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

### Plot Recap

In 2005, Joe Bauers, deemed "the most average person in our entire armed forces" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>, is selected for a military experiment to be frozen for a year alongside sex worker Rita <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. Due to unforeseen circumstances, they remain in stasis for 500 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. Upon awakening, Joe discovers a world of utter degradation, surrounded by imbeciles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. Mountains of trash litter the landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>, and a sports drink called Brawndo has replaced water, leading to famine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. Entertainment primarily consists of retail HJs, porn, ball-kicking, and farts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. After an IQ test, Joe is declared the smartest man alive and appointed Secretary of Interior by President Camacho <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. His suggestion to water crops with H2O instead of Brawndo causes widespread unrest, leading to his apparent execution, but he survives to become president and save the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

## Cultural and Political Critiques

*Idiocracy* was made during the Bush era and is "saturated with jabs" at Bush's supporters, particularly those from the Southern United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. The film satirizes Fox News <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>, depicts language deteriorating into a mix of "hillbilly, valley-girl, inner-city slang, and various grunts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>, and shows clothing saturated with corporate sponsors, resembling NASCAR uniforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

### Part 1: Anti-intellectualism

Mike Judge's vision of a world overrun by "idiots" is often cited as having come true, with the spread of fake news and resurgence of cured diseases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. The film highlights a culture hostile to learning where Joe is mocked for sounding smart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>, people struggle with basic math <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a> and reading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>, and the justice system is a farcical spectacle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>, resembling a gladiator fight combined with a monster truck rally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

However, a counter-argument suggests that contemporary society is not [[Political Satire and Antiintellectualism in Idiocracy | anti-intellectual]] but rather "pseudo-intellectual" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. While [[Political Satire and Antiintellectualism in Idiocracy | anti-intellectualism]] involves outright rejection of scholarship, pseudo-intellectualism involves feigning appreciation for information while being "largely full of shit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. Examples include Flat Earthers, who construct elaborate, seemingly scholarly arguments with formulas and evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>, and anti-vaxxers who cite debunked articles as proof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. This "woo woo" new age trend is not due to a lack of education and can spread in hyper-educated areas like Silicon Valley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

Modern political discourse is "lively" with "bullshit and deranged anger," but it's not an aversion to logic; rather, it's the embracing of a different, arguably worse, kind of logic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. The issue isn't a lack of appreciation for knowledge, but a disagreement on how to evaluate it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. Therefore, Judge's take on [[Political Satire and Antiintellectualism in Idiocracy | anti-intellectualism]], while funny, may not be as prophetic as some believe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.

### Part 2: Too Many Babies

*Idiocracy* posits that the world's degradation stemmed from "dumb, irresponsible people" having more children than "upstanding citizens" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>, leading to a decline in the general populace's intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

This idea echoes Henry Herbert Goddard's influential book *The Kallikak Family* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>, which studied a family line purportedly plagued by "feeble-mindedness" (a term coined by Goddard, who also coined "moron") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. Goddard's work popularized Eugenics, a movement based on now-debunked genetic theories that led to forced sterilization programs across America, upheld even by the Supreme Court <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.

Mike Judge has addressed the criticism that *Idiocracy* is [[Pseudoscience and the Theme of Too Many Babies in Idiocracy | pro-eugenics]], stating that the film's opening sequence clarifies that both "nature and nurture are covered" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. He emphasized the irresponsible parenting depicted, rather than simply inherent "dumbness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>, and explicitly stated, "I obviously donâ€™t believe in eugenics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.

Contrary to the film's premise, average IQ scores have been increasing by 3 points annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. The notion of [[Cultural Commentary in Idiocracy | cultural deterioration]] is a recurring historical complaint, with past figures lamenting the decline of language, music (e.g., Theodor Adorno on Jazz), and cinema <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. Such "deterioration" often leads to the formation of new languages and cultural forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.

### Part 3: Corporate Culture and Spectacle

One of Judge's observations that remains relevant is the pervasive infiltration of corporate culture into personal and public life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>. In *Idiocracy*, characters are named after brands (Frito, Dr. Lexus, President Dwayne Elizondo Mountain Dew Herbert Camacho) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>, corporations can take custody of children (Carl's Jr.) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>, and government entities merge with companies (AOL, Time Warner, Taco Bell, US Government Long distance) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. The film also features a Secretary of State sponsored by Carl's Jr. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>, reflecting fears about corporate influence on politics exacerbated by figures like Dick Cheney and economic advisors with ties to Goldman Sachs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>.

The film's portrayal of a sports drink company buying regulatory bodies like the FDA and FCC to push its agenda is described as "on-the-nose hyperbole about how politics already works" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>. This blurring line between public discourse and private companies is further diminished by the rise of "branded content" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>.

This shrinking gap has also led to the "spectacle-ization of politics," where corporations, media, and government create a "grotesque Frankenstein" in which only sex and violence capture public imagination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>.

## Conclusion

*Idiocracy* serves as a "hilarious snapshot of early 2000's paranoia" about the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>. While some of its predictions might be misdirected, it functions beautifully as a [[Cultural Commentary in Idiocracy | cautionary tale]] about the consequences of ceding critical thinking and becoming "mindless consumers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>.

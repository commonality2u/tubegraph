The animated series *Rick and Morty* frequently explores and deconstructs themes related to atheism and the rejection of traditional religious or supernatural explanations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. The show often demystifies common tropes and concepts, presenting a world where science often provides answers, rendering mystical or divine intervention unnecessary or even obsolete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

## Demystifying the "Deal with the Devil"

In the episode "Something Ricked This Way Comes," *Rick and Morty* inverts the traditional "deal with the devil" trope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. This episode references Ray Bradbury's "Something Wicked This Way Comes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a> and Stephen King's "Needful Things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, both of which feature characters making deals with sinister figures that come with hidden, negative consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. These stories typically reflect the hidden consequences of trying to subvert the natural order to fulfill selfish desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

However, *Rick and Morty* subverts this moral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. In Rick's version of the story, desires can be achieved through science, without the need to sell one's soul or endure debilitating curses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Science eliminates the mystical repercussions for interfering with the perceived order of things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. The show portrays science as a force that demystifies religion by revealing magic and miracles as either sleight of hand or mere statistical coincidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. Rick's actions effectively demystify the "deal with the devil" trope, presenting it as merely a paranoid fairy tale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

The narrative suggests that what is often portrayed as "too good to be true" is typically a shorthand for "don't circumvent God's rules" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. Rick, through science, makes the devil obsolete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. The true lesson is that traditional evil is not what should horrify audiences; rather, a world without karmic retribution, where evil-doers do not face cosmic justice, is inherently scarier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. The show posits that if one seeks something truly terrifying, it lies not in evil, but in pure, disinterested science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

## God as a Lie in "Raising Gazorpazorp"

The episode "Raising Gazorpazorp" draws heavily from the 1974 film *Zardoz* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. In *Zardoz*, a giant floating head deity commands savages to murder others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. The protagonist, Zed, discovers this god is a lie, a convoluted plan to enslave the savages for immortal aristocrats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.

*Rick and Morty* uses this film as a basis to further its general theme of atheism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. Similar to *Zardoz*'s protagonist discovering his god is a lie and then killing it, *Rick and Morty* consistently reminds viewers that either there is no God, or that if there is, God is not particularly great <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. This reinforces the show's inclination to present a world without divine oversight or benevolent higher powers.

## Deconstructing Mysticism and Fantasy

A core element of *Rick and Morty*'s humor and [[Philosophical themes in Rick and Morty | philosophical themes]] is its persistent deconstruction of mysticism and fantasy through the lens of hard science and mundane reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. The show trivializes everything, including fairy tales, family, love, and even life itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.

*   **Fairy Tales:** In "Meeseeks and Destroy," Morty embarks on a clich√© fairy tale adventure, only for the show to "normalize" it by introducing a level of realism often omitted from children's stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. Instead of a "happily ever after," Morty faces trial for senseless murder and the giant's emotionally devastated widow, while the king turns out to be a sexual predator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. This dispels the comforting optimism of childhood narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.
*   **Horror Villains:** The character Scary Terry, a legally safe analogue of Freddy Krueger from *A Nightmare on Elm Street*, is presented as terrifying due to his ability to murder in dreams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. However, the show dispels this horror by revealing his life to be utterly banal, with a "shitty home life" and "lame dreams" just like anyone else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. This normalizes the supernatural threat, robbing it of its mystique.
*   **The Human Body:** "Anatomy Park" references *Jurassic Park* and *Fantastic Voyage* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. While *Fantastic Voyage* portrays the human body as a wonder, *Rick and Morty* presents it as a "gonorrhea infested nightmare," stripping away any romanticized view of human biology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.

This pervasive demystification, applying scientific or mundane explanations to what would traditionally be magical or terrifying, consistently reinforces the show's atheistic leanings. It suggests a universe governed by indifferent scientific principles rather than divine purpose or mystical forces.

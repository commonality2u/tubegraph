The recent backlash against new *Star Wars* content, particularly *The Last Jedi*, is seen as more than mere fan tantrums. It can be understood through the lens of a "legitimation crisis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:40">[00:43:40]</a>, a concept defined by political philosopher [[jurgen_habermas_and_legitimation_crisis | Jurgen Habermas]] as an existential crisis that threatens the foundation of a social system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:38">[02:14:38]</a>. This framework suggests that the *Star Wars* universe, as a social system, is undergoing a profound challenge to its established values and authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:34">[02:07:34]</a>.

## The Star Wars "Legitimation Crisis"

A social system, according to Habermas, comprises three sub-parts: the governmental, the socio-cultural, and the economic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:47">[02:28:47]</a>. These can be mapped onto the *Star Wars* fandom:

*   **Governmental Side**: A system needs a story or idea to give it legitimacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:08">[02:40:08]</a>. George Lucas acted as the "divinely ordained monarch" of the *Star Wars* universe, deriving his legitimacy from creating it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:27">[03:46:27]</a>. His word was akin to *Star Wars* law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:08">[04:43:08]</a>. However, with Disney's acquisition of Lucasfilm in 2012, a "regime change" occurred, leading some fans to perceive a shift from Lucas's authority to a "money-hungry animated mouse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:36">[04:58:36]</a>. This transfer of power, especially coupled with controversial decisions, ignited a [[jurgen_habermas_and_legitimation_crisis | legitimation crisis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:23:41">[05:23:41]</a>.
*   **Socio-Cultural Side (Lifeworld)**: Fans, alongside Lucas, helped create a "fully functioning social system" with shared practices, beliefs, values, and rules, known as a "lifeworld" (lebenswelt) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:30">[04:07:30]</a>. This lifeworld defined the community's identity, meaning, and shared understanding of *Star Wars* values and characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:10">[04:20:10]</a>. However, Disney's "decannonizing" of radio dramas, video games, comics, and spin-off novels, previously considered "gospel" by Lucasfilm, was seen as an attack on this shared identity and the agreed-upon "truths" of the *Star Wars* system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:20">[07:22:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:03">[07:44:03]</a>.

## Historical Parallel: The Catholic Church in the 1500s

The crisis within *Star Wars* fandom is compared to the [[jurgen_habermas_and_legitimation_crisis | legitimation crisis]] faced by the Catholic Church in the 1500s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:01">[05:42:01]</a>.

Prior to the 16th century, the Catholic Church held "total control over the meaning of the Bible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:09">[05:50:09]</a>. Access to hard copies of the Bible was limited and expensive, and few people could read <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>. This allowed the Church to engage in questionable practices, such as selling indulgences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:07">[06:07:07]</a>.

The invention of the printing press by Johannes Gutenberg in 1440 revolutionized the reproduction of texts, making the Bible accessible to ordinary people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:03">[06:16:03]</a>. Suddenly, people could read and interpret the Bible themselves, often arriving at "slightly different interpretations of some of those crucial texts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:23:25">[06:23:25]</a>. This shift meant the masses were no longer just consuming religious meaning but were also helping to "produce canonical interpretations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:17">[06:30:17]</a>. Figures like Martin Luther challenged the Church's authority by openly criticizing its practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:39:24">[06:39:24]</a>.

## Drawing the Parallels

The comparison between *Star Wars* and the Catholic Church highlights key parallels:

*   **Authority Shift**: George Lucas is likened to an "apostle or a prophet" who wrote the original "Star Wars universe" (the "Bible" in this analogy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:02:44">[07:02:44]</a>. Disney, however, is a "larger and fallible organization," and fans question its authority to develop the "quasi-holy texts or its canon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:16">[07:11:16]</a>.
*   **Canon Interpretation**: Just as the Catholic Church lost its monopoly on Bible interpretation with the printing press, Disney's changes to the *Star Wars* canon are akin to altering the "agreed upon values, meanings, and truths" of the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:20">[07:22:20]</a>.
*   **Empowered Masses**: The *Star Wars* crisis mirrors the Catholic Church's challenge by "the wrath of the educated masses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:16:16">[08:16:16]</a>. The modern equivalent of increased literacy is the rise of the "prosumer" – individuals who both consume and produce media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:36:16">[08:36:16]</a>. Fans actively contribute to the *Star Wars* universe through blogging, tweeting, video essays, fan theories, and more, effectively "practicing" *Star Wars* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:20:41">[08:20:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:08:44">[09:08:44]</a>. This empowerment allows a "million angry YouTubers and vloggers" to act as modern-day Martin Luthers, challenging Disney's authority over the *Star Wars* narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29:41">[08:29:41]</a>.

> "At the point when work writing & directing big franchises has become the emotionally loaded equivalent of writing a new chapter of The Bible (w/ the probable danger of being stoned & called a blasphemer), then a lot of bolder minds r gonna leave these films 2 hacks & corp boards." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:01:23">[10:01:23]</a>
> — James Mangold, Director of *Logan*

## Outlook for the System

The Catholic Church did not crumble under its [[jurgen_habermas_and_legitimation_crisis | legitimation crisis]]; it learned, adjusted, and stayed intact through councils and theological revisions, even as Protestantism emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:23:44">[10:23:44]</a>. Similarly, the *Star Wars* system may adapt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:47:33">[10:47:33]</a>. The future of *Star Wars* lies in whether Disney can evolve in the age of [[audience_complicity_in_media_narratives | prosumerism]], respecting fans and the universe they've helped create, or if a "reckoning" will occur, leading to a schism similar to the Catholic-Protestant divide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:50:23">[10:50:23]</a>.

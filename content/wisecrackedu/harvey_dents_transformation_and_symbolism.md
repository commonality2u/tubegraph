Harvey Dent, initially known as the District Attorney of Gotham, undergoes a significant transformation, both physically and philosophically, becoming the villain Two-Face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. This change is central to the film's exploration of duality and the nature of order versus chaos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

## The White Knight

Before his transformation, Harvey Dent is presented as the "White Knight" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. He represents order through idealism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a> and adheres rigidly to concepts of justice, morality, and order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. His approach to justice leaves nothing to chance, as reflected in his belief, "I make my own luck" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

Initially, Dent is depicted as a Christ figure, with his campaign slogan, "I believe in Harvey Dent," having religious connotations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. This imagery suggests he is an ideal who might sacrifice himself for the good of humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

## The Joker's Corruption

The Joker orchestrates Harvey Dent's downfall, considering it his "pièce de résistance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. The Joker sets a trap that results in the death of Rachel Dawes, Dent's love interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>, and leaves Dent disfigured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. This traumatic event shatters Dent's ideals and serves as the catalyst for his transformation into Two-Face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

## Two-Face: Embodiment of Duality

As Two-Face, Dent embodies the film's pervasive theme of duality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. This is manifested in:
*   The two sides of his face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
*   The two sides of his coin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

### The Scarred Coin

Central to Dent's [[character_names_and_symbolism | symbolism]] as Two-Face is his coin. Initially, it is a double-sided coin, representing his unwavering commitment to justice and order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. However, after his transformation, one side of the coin becomes scarred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. This scarred coin symbolizes his infection by the Joker's nihilistic vision, where "the only morality in a cruel world is chance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. The coin, now effectively 50/50, reflects a reality ruled by cosmic anarchy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

### Christ Without Resurrection

The film's depiction of Dent as a Christ figure takes a daring and modern interpretation, showcasing "a Christ without resurrection" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. Unlike traditional [[religious_imagery_and_allegories_in_the_matrix_revolutions | Christ imagery]] that suggests sacrifice and rebirth, Dent's trajectory shows a dead ideal, a false ideal that must nonetheless be upheld as a beacon of hope for mankind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. Batman takes on the burden of maintaining this facade to preserve order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

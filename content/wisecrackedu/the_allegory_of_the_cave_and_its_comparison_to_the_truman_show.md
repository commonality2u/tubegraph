[[analysis_of_the_truman_show | Truman Burbank's]] journey to uncover the truth in [[analysis_of_the_truman_show | *The Truman Show*]] mirrors the thought experiment known as [[platos_allegory_of_the_cave | The Allegory of the Cave]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>, which was conceived by "Plate o' Spaghetti" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

## [[platos_allegory_of_the_cave | The Allegory of the Cave]]

[[platos_allegory_of_the_cave | The Allegory of the Cave]] describes a scenario where humans are chained to a wall, knowing only the shadows projected before them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

## Comparison to [[analysis_of_the_truman_show | The Truman Show]]

[[analysis_of_the_truman_show | Truman's]] perspective is similarly restricted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. In this comparison:
*   [[analysis_of_the_truman_show | Truman's]] "cave" is the constructed town of Seahaven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.
*   The actors in his life function as his "shadows" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

[[platos_allegory_of_the_cave | Plato's allegory]] posits that a prisoner, once freed from the cave, would prefer the outside world to the darkness they once knew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. Christof, the show's creator, disagrees with this notion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. However, as the film reaches its climax, [[analysis_of_the_truman_show | Truman]] challenges Christof, calling him "a liar liar" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>, thereby choosing reality over the controlled illusion.

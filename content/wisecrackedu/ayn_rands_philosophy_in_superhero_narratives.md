The philosophical tenets of [[ayn_rands_objectivism_and_its_influence_on_bioshock | Ayn Rand's Objectivism]] have significantly influenced various superhero narratives, particularly evident in Frank Miller's *The Dark Knight Returns* and its cinematic adaptation, *Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

## Ayn Rand's Philosophy: Objectivism and Ethical Egoism

Ayn Rand's philosophy, known as Objectivism, posits that the best course of action is always what is in one's own best interest, a concept called "ethical egoism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. According to Rand, true happiness can only be achieved through the pursuit of self-interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

A "Randian hero" is depicted as a radical individualist, unwilling to compromise their integrity, intelligent, and physically appealing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Howard Roark, the protagonist of Rand's novel *The Fountainhead*, embodies this ideal as an "experimental" architect who faces constant opposition from the establishment but never sacrifices his integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. Rand was also famously an atheist, believing that the concept of a God-like figure undermines ethical egoism by imposing external authority on individual choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

## Influence on Frank Miller's *The Dark Knight Returns*

Frank Miller, the author of the graphic novel *The Dark Knight Returns*, has explicitly cited [[ayn_rands_objectivism_and_its_influence_on_bioshock | Ayn Rand]] as a major influence on his work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

In *The Dark Knight Returns*, Batman is presented as the quintessential Randian hero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>:
*   He is a wealthy, handsome playboy with a genius intellect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.
*   He refuses to bend his will to anyone else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
*   His adherence to Randian egoism—individualism—establishes a core ideological conflict with Superman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

Conversely, Superman in Miller's work is portrayed as the anti-Rand figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. His self-sacrificing moral righteousness and commitment to "good" mark him as a "Government Stooge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. The drama of *The Dark Knight Returns* largely stems from this clash of ideologies: Batman's individualism versus Superman's conformism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

## Ayn Rand's Philosophy in *Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice*

Director Zack Snyder, who has long expressed interest in adapting *The Fountainhead* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>, drew heavily from *The Dark Knight Returns* for *Batman v Superman* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>, including an older Bruce Wayne, Superman's healing from a nuclear warhead, Robin's memorialized costume, and the central fight dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

### Batman's Characterization
Ben Affleck's Batman largely aligns with Miller's Randian interpretation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>:
*   He is depicted as handsome, hyper-athletic, exceptionally intelligent, and a complete individualist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
*   He refuses to yield to anyone's will, including the judicial process, going so far as to brand criminals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
*   Batman's motivation to fight Superman may stem from Randian principles; a God-like figure challenges ethical egoism by introducing something "objectively greater" than individual rationality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

### Superman's Muddled Characterization
Where *Batman v Superman* diverges and becomes "muddled" is in its portrayal of Superman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. The film attempts to make Superman relatable by emphasizing his vulnerabilities and doubts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>, essentially making him more human <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. This approach aims to avoid the "boring" purely benevolent Superman, like Christopher Reeve's iconic self-sacrificing portrayal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.

However, the film also declines to make Superman the collectivist "stooge" that Miller depicted, as the audience is intended to like him for future Justice League films <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. This results in an internally conflicted Superman:
*   He appears burdened by his role, described as if he's "stuck performing the most tiresome 9-5 job imaginable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
*   The film "constantly undercuts" the perception of Superman as a benevolent, Christ-like hero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>, with Batman even telling him, "You were never a god, you were never even a man" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
*   Superman's crisis manifests as a struggle between "Superman ‘The God’" (benevolent) and "Superman ‘The Man’" (a Randian Objectivist, focused on saving Lois while ignoring other innocents) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

The film's exploration of Superman's philosophical dilemma is further muddled through key interactions:
*   **Martha Kent's perspective:** She suggests that there is no difference between choosing to be a "Benevolent Messiah" or a "Self Involved Objectivist"; both are equally valid, and the important thing is Clark's rational choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.
*   **Jonathan Kent's ghost:** He dismantles the notion of selfless heroism by recounting a story where his selfless act of saving his farm inadvertently flooded another. He suggests that "true moral righteousness comes from bettering yourself, pursuing your own self-interest, and protecting the ones you love" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>, an encapsulation of ethical egoism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.

Ultimately, Superman's choice between being a "Messiah" or a "Randian Hero" is ambiguous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. While he initially appears to embrace Objectivism by prioritizing Lois and Martha <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>, he later sacrifices himself in a "Messianic fashion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>, with a makeshift cross behind him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. This muddled philosophy means Superman's character embodies both self-interest and self-sacrifice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

## Ideological Failings in *Batman v Superman*

The film's [[batman_v_superman_ideological_failings | ideological failings]] stem from its inability to establish a clear philosophical conflict between Batman and Superman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. While the initial premise suggests Batman's distrust of a "superhuman benevolent savior" and Superman's desire to keep Batman's vigilante actions in check <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>, this dynamic is immediately "upended" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

By attempting to make Superman more relatable through [[ayn_rands_objectivism_and_its_influence_on_bioshock | Objectivism]], *Batman v Superman* inadvertently eliminates the very ideological distinction crucial to the rivalry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. The film presents a "Randian Hero" (Batman) versus a "Maybe Sort-of Randian Hero who can’t decide if he wants to be the divine savior the world wants him to be" (Superman) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. This results in "no preference of heroics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a> and a muddled message, ultimately prioritizing the introduction of more heroes for the Justice League rather than exploring a coherent philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.

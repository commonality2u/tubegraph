"The Great Gatsby" by F. Scott Fitzgerald explores various symbolic elements that deepen its themes. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>

## The Green Light

The green light is a significant symbol in the novel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. Some interpretations suggest it symbolizes the fading optimism of [[character_analysis_of_jay_gatsby_and_daisy_buchanan | Gatsby's]] dream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

Initially, at the beginning of the book, the green light possesses a "burning quality" that invigorates [[character_analysis_of_jay_gatsby_and_daisy_buchanan | Gatsby]] with excitement about being with [[character_analysis_of_jay_gatsby_and_daisy_buchanan | Daisy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. However, by the end of the narrative, it transforms into "just another lame ass green light," losing its special significance, mirroring [[motifs_of_dreams_versus_reality_in_the_great_gatsby | Gatsby's]] ultimately unfulfilled "fake ass dreams" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

## Other Symbolic Elements

### [[motifs_of_dreams_versus_reality_in_the_great_gatsby | Dreams vs. Reality]] and Gatsby's Books

The motif of [[motifs_of_dreams_versus_reality_in_the_great_gatsby | dreams versus reality]] is embodied in tiny details throughout the book <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. For example, on page 50, it is revealed that [[character_analysis_of_jay_gatsby_and_daisy_buchanan | Gatsby]] possesses a large collection of books, most of which he has never read <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. This symbolizes [[character_analysis_of_jay_gatsby_and_daisy_buchanan | Gatsby's]] pretense of intelligence and sophistication, which is not rooted in reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

Holden Caulfield, a 16-year-old, recounts the events that led to his stay in a mental hospital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. His narrative highlights his profound struggles with societal norms and his search for authenticity in a world he perceives as "phony."

## Rejection of "Phoniness"

Holden is depicted as trying to find stability and acceptance in a "broken society full of people that always be fakin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. When he "come[s] up empty handed," he feels compelled to "get real and buck the system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. His values are presented as the reverse of society's, symbolized by him turning around his hunting hat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. This stance foreshadows his aspirational role as the "Catcher in the Rye" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

He desires to save children from the "bent-ass shit of adulthood" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>, even though he knows he cannot stop the pure world of children from transitioning to the "fake-ass world of adults" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. His reflection on the glass cases at the Museum suggests he doesn't want to join the ranks of "fake-ass adults" and wishes to "freeze time" like the static figures behind the glass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. This illustrates his deep resistance to conformity and the inevitable changes of growing up.

## Search for Connection and Authenticity

Holden possesses a "legit desire to search for beauty in human contact" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>, but he struggles to find it in what he perceives as a world full of "ugliness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. This makes him "one of the loneliest playas in all of literature" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>, as he "keeps it so real, while errybody else frontinâ€™" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. The only individual he can "keep it real with" is his younger sister, Phoebe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>, highlighting the difficulty of his [[holdens_search_for_authenticity_and_human_connection | search for authenticity and human connection]] with others.

## Consequences of his Struggle

Holden's inability to reconcile with the "deceit" he perceives in the world ultimately leads to him spending his days in a "psych ward" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. Despite his "righteous talk," he admits to being "the most terrific liar" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>, yet he also possesses a "gentle soul" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>, shown by his concern for the ducks in Central Park Lake when the water freezes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. His struggles exemplify the price paid for being "too soft in a world twisted by deceit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

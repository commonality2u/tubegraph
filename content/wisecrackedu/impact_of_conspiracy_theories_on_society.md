The rise of groups like Flat Earthers highlights a significant societal challenge: a "crisis of knowing shit" where trust in established expertise has rapidly eroded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. While often met with ridicule, this phenomenon reflects a problem that affects everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## The Erosion of Trust in Expertise

There is a growing distrust in traditional sources of knowledge, including scientists, physicians, and government agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. This skepticism extends to readily accepted scientific facts, as seen with Flat Earthers who question centuries-old conclusions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. The core issue is not simply a lack of scientific knowledge, but a profound ignorance regarding the [[antiintellectualism_vs_pseudointellectualism_in_society | philosophy of science]] itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. This ignorance allows for the misuse of scientific language and concepts to persuade people towards conspiratorial views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

## Characteristics and Methods of Conspiracy Theories

Conspiracy theories, exemplified by Flat Earth, often operate under a unified belief that accepted facts are deliberate misinformation propagated by "shadow-y agents" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. Despite appearing critical and intelligent, proponents engage in specific problematic behaviors:

### Misapplication of Scientific Principles
Conspiracy theorists may appear to use scientific methods, like asking questions or testing hypotheses, but their application is flawed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. They often present bad evidence, fail to control for confounding variables, or misinterpret results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

Instead of following principles like falsification (trying to prove one's own theory wrong), they focus on disproving others to "prove" themselves right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. When confronted with contradictory evidence, they often tweak their models by introducing new, unverified explanations (e.g., "heavenly energies" interfering with experiments) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. Crucially, they resist abandoning their core theory, stating that no evidence would convince them to renounce it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.

### "JAQing Off" (Just Asking Questions)
A pervasive tactic in modern political and internet debates, "JAQing off" involves asking numerous questions without the intent of building consensus, but rather to sow doubt and shift the burden of proof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>. This method can make legitimate positions appear suspicious if all questions cannot be immediately answered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>.

For example, asking "Why aren’t oil companies drilling in Antarctica?" (a common Flat Earth query) can take minutes to explain, but the question itself takes seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>. This creates an impossible standard for disproving a conspiracy theory, as new questions can always be generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>.

> "Flat Earthers may say they’re “winning the debate” against round earthers, but this is more a statement on how profoundly bad public debates can be." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>

## Psychological Appeal of Conspiracy Theories
Conspiracy theories often appeal to individuals who feel powerless or insignificant in society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>. Discovering the "real" answer to complex events can provide a sense of control and make the world feel more rational and predictable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a>. For Flat Earthers, this appeal lies in the idea that humanity is not a "tiny blue marble drifting in the cosmos, but a special little terrarium that’s the center of the universe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>.

## Real-World Consequences
The widespread acceptance of conspiracy theories has tangible and dangerous societal impacts:

*   **Erosion of Faith in Expertise**: It signifies a larger [[societys_impact_on_personal_agency | societal crisis]] where faith in various forms of expertise is eroding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:36">[00:19:36]</a>.
*   **Anti-Science Movements**: This type of conspiratorial thinking can lead to dangerous movements, such as [[the_impact_of_the_internet_on_shared_culture | anti-vaccine sentiments]], which have contributed to the resurgence of almost extinct diseases and resulted in deaths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:45">[00:19:45]</a>.
*   **Harassment and Threats**: It can fuel extreme behaviors, from outlandish claims (e.g., a woman working for the CIA due to letters in her name) to sending death threats to individuals perceived as "crisis actors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>.

## Addressing the Problem
Instead of merely dismissing conspiracy theorists, it is crucial to understand how science operates, how scientific consensus is achieved, and to critically evaluate scientific practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>. This includes understanding experimental design, levels of confidence in predictions, and how contrary evidence is handled within established scientific models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>.

The goal is not to demand blind faith in science but to foster an understanding of its conventions and practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>.

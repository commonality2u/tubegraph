*Neon Genesis Evangelion* (Eva) is an immensely complex story that explores the end of the world through the lens of teenagers piloting biomechanical monsters against alien-angel-robot beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Beneath its surface, it delves into themes of intimacy, unconscious human motivation, and the challenges of existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. A significant part of its profound depth comes from its extensive use of religious imagery and allegories, especially from Jewish mysticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

## The Title: A New Beginning

The title *Neon Genesis Evangelion* itself carries deep religious significance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>:
*   **Neon**: Derived from the Greek *neos*, meaning "new" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
*   **Genesis**: Refers to a beginning and is a direct reference to the opening book of the Bible <a class="yt-timestamp" data="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
*   **Evangelion**: Means "the Gospel" or "the good news," stemming from the same root as "evangelize" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

Thus, *Neon Genesis Evangelion* literally translates to "a new telling of the gospel: genesis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>, or a re-imagining of the Book of Genesis infused with technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

## Biblical and Christian References

The show is replete with explicit religious iconography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>:
*   **Dead Sea Scrolls**: The show explicitly references the Dead Sea Scrolls, ancient Jewish religious manuscripts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
*   **Number 666**: Ritzko installs a type 666 firewall to protect the Magi system from cyberattacks, a number often associated with the Beast in Christian Revelation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
*   **Angels**: The primary antagonists are unearthly beings called Angels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
    *   **Adam and Lilith**: Two significant Angels are named Adam and Lilith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. While Adam is known from Genesis, Lilith is a figure from Jewish folklore, created alongside Adam and often described as a mother of demons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. In Eva, humans are depicted as descendants of Lilith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.
*   **Magi System**: NERV's supercomputer network, the Magi system, has three parts named Casper, Balthasar, and Melchior, after the three wise men who visited baby Jesus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

## Jewish Mysticism and Kabbalah

The majority of *Evangelion*'s religious imagery is rooted in Jewish mysticism and the Kabbalah <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
*   **Kabbalah**: It is an investigative practice of faith and mystical teachings that seeks religious revelation and sacred knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
*   **Angels from Texts**: Many of the Angels in Eva are directly drawn from texts within Judaism's extended canon, such as the Zohar (Kabbalah's bible), the Talmud, and the Book of Enoch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.
*   **El Theosophy**: A form of mystical writing using the "el" suffix (one of the Hebrew words for God) to connect names to the divine, is prevalent. Examples include Ramiel, Sachiel, and Matarael <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.
*   **Adam Kadmon**: In Kabbalistic tradition, the first being is Adam Kadmon, a being of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. This concept is eerily similar to Eva's first Angel, named Adam, who is a giant of light and whose explosion causes the Second Impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. The Second Impact kills half the planet's population and turns the oceans red, reminiscent of Revelation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.
*   **Shevirat ha-Kelim (Breaking of Vessels)**: This destruction echoes a Kabbalistic event called the Shevirat ha-Kelim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. In this tradition, a universal unity broke apart at the beginning, leaving everything separate and creating the diverse world we live in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. It's akin to a theological Big Bang <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.
*   **Tikkun ha-Olam (Restoration of the World)**: The purpose of Kabbalah is Tikkun ha-Olam, the restoration of the world, traditionally achieved through good deeds and prayer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. In Eva, this concept is taken literally, with characters seeking to reunify all consciousnesses into one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.
*   **Sefirot and the Tree of Life**: The ethical call of the Kabbalah is the reunification of the world's fragmented parts of Adam, called the Sefirot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. This is depicted as the Tree of Life, a pattern of ten circles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. The random circles appearing around Eva Unit 01 when attacked by manufactured Angels symbolize this sacred duty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. The Sefirot's reunification would recreate the universe as a complete whole, thereby destroying [[the_concept_of_individuality_and_isolation_in_evangelion | individuality]] and separation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
*   **Human Instrumentality Project**: The ultimate goal of reunifying all human consciousness into a primordial soup (LCL) is called Instrumentality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>. This desire for universal unity reflects the Kabbalistic concept of Tikkun ha-Olam, a return to the primordial womb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>. The death drive, a concept explored in [[freudian_psychoanalysis_in_evangelion | Freudian psychoanalysis]], also aligns with this desire to return to a state of tranquility and peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>.

## Conclusion: A New Adam and Eve

The culmination of these religious themes, particularly the concept of Tikkun ha-Olam, leads to the Human Instrumentality Project, where all human consciousnesses are merged into a single entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>. This is meant to alleviate the suffering caused by [[the_concept_of_individuality_and_isolation_in_evangelion | individuality]] and the "Hedgehog's Dilemma" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>.

However, Shinji Ikari ultimately rejects Instrumentality, choosing a world with pain, separation, and individual wills over a unified, pain-free existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>. This choice, while accepting suffering, also opens the door for hope and joy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:36">[00:19:36]</a>. The series concludes with Shinji and Asuka as the last remaining individuals, presented as a new Adam and Eve for a "New Beginning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:44">[00:20:44]</a>.

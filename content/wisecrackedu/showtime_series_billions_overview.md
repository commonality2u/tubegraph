*Billions* is a drama from Showtime, returning for its fourth season on March 17th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. On the surface, the show chronicles the rivalry between a ruthless billionaire and an equally ruthless US Attorney, both vying for their own versions of justice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. The series explores how games structure lives and how gamifying goals can corrode one's sense of morality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. It frames the common media refrain of "people losing sight of their morals" in a novel way, utilizing [[game_theory_in_billions | game theory]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Premise

The core narrative of *Billions* centers on Chuck Rhoades, the US Attorney for the Southern District of New York, and his billionaire nemesis, Bobby Axelrod <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. The show follows the intricate personal war between these two men and the lives of those caught in their conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. Beyond their clash, *Billions* examines how the path to power is often paved with corruption, deceit, and eroding morals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

## Main Characters

### Chuck Rhoades
Chuck Rhoades is portrayed as an ambitious prosecutor dedicated to fighting for "the little guy" by putting white-collar criminals behind bars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. He possesses a tendency for cold calculus, bordering on sociopathy, as he betrays friends and family to achieve his objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. With aspirations for higher public office, he strategically selects cases, forms alliances, and engages in significant backroom dealing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

### Bobby Axelrod
Bobby Axelrod is a mega-rich hedge fund manager who always remembers his humble beginnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a> and his love for Metallica <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. His staff, particularly his right-hand man Mike Wagner (Wags), is fiercely loyal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. However, Axelrod's drive to succeed is tainted by morally and legally questionable actions, including insider trading and profiting from 9/11 victims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. His stubborn pride often leads him to flaunt his wealth to law enforcement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

### Wendy Rhoades
Wendy Rhoades is Chuck's wife and works as a performance coach for Bobby Axelrod, the man her husband is trying to imprison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. She often finds herself caught between their conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>. Wendy eventually becomes a mediator, reframing the zero-sum rivalry between Chuck and Axe into a cooperative game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>.

### Supporting Characters
Chuck is flanked by two ambitious and morally driven prosecutors, Kate Sacker and Bryan Connerty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. Axelrod's actions eventually contribute to an increasing divide between him and his wife, Lara, and his protégé, Taylor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

## Central Themes

### Rivalry and Morality
The show portrays the escalating conflict between Chuck and Axe as they go to extreme lengths to harm each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. This includes psychological warfare, like Chuck goading Axe into a scrutinizable purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>, and reciprocal acts of spite, such as Axe buying Chuck's rare book collection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>. The series suggests that such a prolonged war, driven by revenge, ultimately leads to a downward spiral for both protagonists, causing them personal losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>.

### [[game_theory_in_billions | Game Theory]]
[[game_theory_in_billions | Game theory]] is a central concept in *Billions*, defined as the study of how people make strategic decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. In the world of Axe Capital, [[game_theory_in_billions | game theory]] is used for making more money, involving strategies like hedging bets, leveraging positions, taking short-term losses for long-term gains, and misleading competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. For Chuck Rhoades' office, it's applied to crafting plea deals, political maneuvering, and determining investigative tactics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

A key principle highlighted is the "Prisoner's Dilemma," a thought experiment from the 1950s that describes situations where individual betrayal leads to a worse outcome for everyone involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. The show uses this dilemma to explain why loyalty is so important at Axe Capital; cooperation among employees prevents ruin from federal investigations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. The relationship between Axe and Chuck is also framed as an iterative (repeated) [[game_theory_in_billions | game theory]] problem, often resembling the "tit for tat" strategy, where one wrong move leads to a spiral of revenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.

### Erosion of Morality/Principle
A significant theme is the "creeping erosion" of principle, where life becomes a series of strategic decisions aimed at winning or optimizing outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>. This is exemplified by Chuck losing aspects of his life due to the "game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>, and other characters slowly losing their sense of principle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.

Taylor, an intern who becomes Axe's protégé, initially understands [[game_theory_in_billions | game theory]] but realizes their love of winning and empathy are incompatible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. Despite once being active in Occupy Wall Street, Taylor becomes as cruel and manipulative as Axe, eventually betraying him when loyalty doesn't align with their long-term calculations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>. This illustrates the show's argument about the shortcomings of living life as a hyper-rational game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.

### [[character_dynamics_and_strategies_in_billions | Character Dynamics]]
The [[character_dynamics_and_strategies_in_billions | character dynamics]] in *Billions* are heavily influenced by the [[game_theory_in_billions | game theory]] framework. The show culminates in the "Ice Juice scandal," where both Chuck and Axe find themselves in a mutual bind; neither can achieve revenge without both facing jail time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. This forces them, with Wendy's help, to reach a cooperative conclusion, sacrificing their egos to avoid greater disaster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>. This resolution highlights how "breaking the stick" of an untenable situation by going "meta" on the game can provide an escape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>.

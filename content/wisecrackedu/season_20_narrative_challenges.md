*South Park* had embraced [[south_park_serialized_storylines | season-long serialization]] for three seasons, starting with Season 19, which "brilliantly blended themes of PC culture, advertising, and gentrification" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Season 20 kicked off with an even more ambitious storyline, juggling multiple complex plots, including the presidential election, Member Berries, a militant feminist Cartman, Butters, and internet trolling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. However, what seemed to be leading to an epic conclusion "fizzled out into confusion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## South Park's "Golden Rule" of Storytelling

The show's unpredictable and imaginative nature belies a "strict order to the madness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. *South Park*'s writing follows a rigid plot line rule: when outlining story beats, if the words "and then" belong between those beats, "you're f**ked" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. This means a narrative should demonstrate cause and effect, where actions lead to consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

Instead of "and then," good *South Park* writing uses "buts or therefores" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Each action beginning with "therefore" or "but" indicates a consequence or reaction to the previous action, ensuring every plot point matters and the show "never loses momentum" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. This is part of the [[south_parks_writing_rules_and_plot_structure | South Park's writing rules and plot structure]].

## The Impact of the 2016 US Presidential Election

The primary reason for Season 20's narrative difficulties stemmed from the outcome of the US presidential election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. Creators Stone and Parker, like most pollsters, "expected turd sandwich to win the election" (referring to Hillary Clinton) and had planned the season around that outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. When Donald Trump (Mr. Garrison) unexpectedly won, they had to perform "desperate last-minute rewrites" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. Once Mr. Garrison won, the show "starts breaking the creators core rules" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

## Member Berries Plotline Breakdown

Initially, the Member Berries plotline followed the "golden rule" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>:
*   Randy tries Member Berries, falls into a nostalgic trance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.
*   Therefore, Randy realizes Member Berries are "dangerous brainwashing germs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
*   Mr. Garrison, leading in polls, realizes he has no plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.
*   Therefore, Mr. Garrison tries to sabotage his campaign so Hillary will win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
*   But, his voters catch on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
*   Therefore, Randy explains to Garrison the truth about his popularity, linked to nostalgia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
*   Therefore, they set out to destroy Member Berries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.
*   But, they realize Member Berries "just won't die" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.
*   Therefore, Randy convinces Garrison to give a speech denouncing nostalgia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

However, after Hillary Clinton lost the election, the plot became "messy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. The writers had to improvise, leading to a "big cluster f**k of and thens" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>:
*   Mr. Garrison wins "out of nowhere" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
*   Caitlin Jenner barfs, reinfecting Garrison and Randy with Member Berries, causing them to forget their quest and get "stoked on Garrison's victory" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. This was "narrative backpedaling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.
*   The Member Berry storyline becomes "muddled" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. They were initially a "physical embodiment of toxic nostalgia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
*   They turn into a "weird vomit inducing virus" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.
*   They stop by a 1920s nightclub <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.
*   They are revealed to be Nazis and "tiny fruit militia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
*   They are also "pals with Vladimir Putin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

The show failed to offer justification for these transformations, resulting in a "random progression of events that build without any apparent logic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

## Trolling Plotline Breakdown

The trolling subplot, featuring Kyle's dad Gerald as "skankhunt42," also became "tangled up by a Trump win" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.
*   Gerald's trolling angers the Danes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.
*   Therefore, the Danes threaten to release everyone's internet history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.
*   Hillary Clinton, expecting to win, fears Troll Trace will leak her online activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.
*   Therefore, she needs Skankhunt42 to save her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

However, after Clinton lost, the narrative structure "starts to crumble" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.
*   Clinton confusingly recruits Gerald anyway, with a vague mission to "infiltrate troll trace to protect U.S. secrets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. This scene "feels super weird and disjointed, almost like it's from an alternate reality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>, likely recycled from the "if Hillary had won" version of the episode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.
*   The plot then reveals Clinton's claim was a "ruse," and she's helping the Danes kidnap American trolls to protect her emails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.
*   Then, the Danes are just trolling the American trolls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.
*   Then, the top Danish guy is also "just a giant troll trolling the world for the lulz," and "not even f**king Danish" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.

This progression led to a lack of cause and effect, with events that "don't actually build off previous actions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. The show writers openly complained about the "narrative hole they dug for themselves" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.

## Plot Resolution: Blowing Up the Internet

To resolve incomplete storylines, particularly the risks faced by Cartman and Gerald from their internet history being revealed, the show committed "plot hari-kari by blowing everything up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. Everyone, from Ike to Pentagon generals, collaborated to "take down the internet" with a "massive blitz of trolling and a little help from Elon Musk's SpaceX program" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. By deleting everyone's secrets, they also "destroy the cause-and-effect relationship that in building up all season" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. This resulted in an unsatisfying conclusion where things weren't resolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.

## Lost Potential Themes

Season 20 initially did a good job of analyzing how the internet "fragmented our public and private selves" and enabled people to behave like "assholes without the people we love ever having to find out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. This promising conclusion was never delivered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.

The show also brilliantly satirized the "outrage cycles that dominate internet culture" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>, suggesting this simmering outrage could be a "more interesting explanation for Mr. Garrison's victory than member berries" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. This idea, known as Trevor's axiom, describes how "one person could create a massive reaction on the internet," bringing out "the worst in humanity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.

## An Alternate Season 20

In a parallel universe where Hillary Clinton ("turd sandwich") had won, Season 20 would have focused on Bill Clinton's "new role as the apparently terrified First Gentleman of the U.S." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>. This would have escalated the "battle of the sexes already underway at South Park Elementary" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a> and given "more poignancy to Cartman's newly inspired fear of his girlfriend Heidi" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.

## Future of Serialization

The creators hinted at "the end of serialization as we know it" in the Season 20 finale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. While Season 20 was messy, earlier serialized seasons like [[south_park_season_19_and_serialized_storytelling | Seasons 18 and 19]] represented "some of their best work as a decade" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>, making the potential abandonment of serialization "kind of a bummer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.

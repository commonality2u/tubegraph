[[existentialism_and_nihilism_in_rick_and_morty | Existential Nihilism]] is a core idea explored in the animated series *BoJack Horseman* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. While the show appears to be a lighthearted cartoon with talking animals and Hollywood glamour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>, it reveals a dark and depressing reality beneath its colorful exterior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

The show uses "Hollywoo" as a metaphor for existence itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Just as Hollywoo's dazzling façade hides an ugly, hollow industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>, the routines of daily life conceal the inherent meaninglessness of existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

> [00:00:55] "Hollywoo’s a real pretty town that’s smack on top of all that black tar. By the time you realize you’re sinking it’s too late.”

If life is truly meaningless, the central question the show addresses is how one is supposed to cope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

## Coping with Meaninglessness: Distraction

One primary method of coping with the anguish of a meaningless world is simply through distraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

### Characters and Distraction
*   **Princess Carolyn** constantly distracts herself with her job and her need to fix the lives of others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. She struggles with free time, quickly finding her way back to the "Hollywoo grindstone" when her agency folds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
*   **Todd** is content as long as he has something to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. Without a task, he spirals into [[existential_depression_and_intelligence | existential despair]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>, quickly seeking out new projects like composing a space opera or building his own Disneyland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.
*   **Mr. Peanutbutter** lives in a constant state of distraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. Despite appearing foolish, he possesses a surprising self-awareness about the universe's meaninglessness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>:
    > [00:03:31] "The universe is a cruel uncaring void. The key to being happy isn't the search for meaning. It's to just keep yourself busy with unimportant nonsense. And eventually... you'll be dead."
*   **BoJack's** entire life is a series of trivial distractions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. For years after his show "Horsin' Around" ended, he drifted through life in this state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

### Philosophical Perspective on Distraction
The show's portrayal of distraction aligns with the ideas of 17th-century philosopher Blaise Pascal, considered a precursor to [[existentialism_and_radical_freedom_in_bojack_horseman | Existentialism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. Pascal argued that humans, when given too much time to reflect, will inevitably contemplate their own insignificance, leading to unhappiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

> [00:04:49] “I have discovered that all the unhappiness of men arises from one single fact: that they cannot stay quietly in their own chamber. I have found that there is one very real reason namely, the natural poverty of our feeble and mortal condition so miserable that nothing can comfort us when we think of it closely.”

Pascal believed humans have a natural psychological defense mechanism: they are easily distracted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. When distracted, they avoid thinking about their existence and can remain functional, if not happy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. He applied this to figures like kings, stating that even with every pleasure, a king without diversion, left to reflect on his being, would find his happiness unsustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

Like Pascal's king, BoJack, lacking serious struggles, must constantly distract himself to avoid confronting his reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. This charade collapses when he reads Diane's book, "One Trick Pony," which forces him to face an honest reflection of himself and his self-deception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

### The "God-Is-Dead" World
In the post-God-Is-Dead world of Hollywoo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>, as exemplified by Santa Claus being described as a "lie that grown ups made up because we like to believe that there’s an order to the universe and that good behavior will lead to happiness but the fact is that just isn’t true” <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>, traditional comfort from meaninglessness is absent. BoJack initially tries to return to distraction after his illusion is broken, but this path is shown to lead to tragedy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.

Examples of forced distraction failing:
*   Secretariat's advice to "run straight ahead... no matter what" and "never look behind you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a> mirrors BoJack's attempts to outrun his problems. However, "You can be the fastest runner in the world, but you can't outrun the truth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.
*   Sarah Lynn's tragic overdose after a months-long bender with BoJack illustrates the destructive nature of clinging to distraction once the illusion is broken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.

## Coping with Meaninglessness: Radical Freedom

BoJack initially rejects responsibility, believing that because "EVERYTHING IS MEANINGLESS! NOTHING I DO HAS CONSEQUENCE!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>, he is not accountable for his choices. He fears what Jean-Paul Sartre called [[existentialism_and_radical_freedom_in_bojack_horseman | "Radical Freedom"]], a key concept in his philosophy of [[existentialism_and_radical_freedom_in_bojack_horseman | Existentialism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.

### Existence Precedes Essence
Sartre's catchphrase, "Existence Precedes Essence," is fundamental to this concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. An object's essence is its purpose; a hammer's essence (hammering) precedes its existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. For an [[existentialism_and_nihilism_in_rick_and_morty | Existential Nihilist]], humans, unlike a hammer or a "Gentle Farms chicken" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>, exist without a predetermined purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

This implies that BoJack has total control over every choice he makes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>:
> [00:09:19] “That is what I mean when I say that man is condemned to be free. Condemned, because he did not create himself, yet is nevertheless at liberty, and from the moment that he is thrown into this world he is responsible for EVERYTHING he does.”

Diane echoes this idea: "I don’t think I believe in 'deep down.' I kinda think all you are is just the things that you do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. Therefore, there is no "good BoJack" hidden deep down; he is defined entirely by his past choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. As Todd bluntly puts it, "You are all the things that are wrong with you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

### Hope in Freedom
While seemingly bleak, this perspective offers hope: BoJack is not "doomed to be the person in that book" forever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. He possesses the freedom to change his actions and, consequently, himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>, but it is entirely up to him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. The show provides an optimistic take on Sartre's philosophy, using water as a metaphor for BoJack’s [[existentialism_and_radical_freedom_in_bojack_horseman | Radical Freedom]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. Initially overwhelmed by water, BoJack eventually recognizes it not as a scary force, but as "a medium of incredible opportunity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.

## Coping with Meaninglessness: Embrace the Absurd

Characters like Mr. Peanutbutter and Cuddly Whiskers find happiness after realizing nihilism, which aligns with [[albert_camus_and_absurdism_in_bojack_horseman | Albert Camus]] and his philosophy of Absurdism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.

For Camus, the universe is irrational and meaningless, yet humans seek reason and meaning within it. This discrepancy is "The Absurd" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. Upon recognizing The Absurd, one has three choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>:
1.  Return to the daily cycle and ignore it.
2.  Commit suicide.
3.  Rebellion: accept the absurd and be happy anyway, defying the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.

Camus illustrates this through "The Myth of Sisyphus," about a man doomed to an endless, repetitive task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. Sisyphus becomes the "Absurd Hero" by recognizing his task's futility yet choosing happiness despite it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.

The show directly references this myth:
*   Princess Carolyn states, "I have to push a boulder up a hill and then have it roll over me time and time again" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.
*   A recurring symbol is the Baboon jogging up the hill outside BoJack's house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>, who offers the advice, "It get's easier. Everyday it gets a little easier. Butcha gotta do it everyday. That's the hard part" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.

At the end of Season Three, BoJack confronts the meaningless loop of his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>, paralleling Camus's description of the "stage set collapses" moment leading to "Suicide or recovery" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. BoJack drives off, seemingly submitting to suicide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>, but then sees the Wild Horses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. These horses represent the alternative: embracing the absurd, carrying out their meaningless task (running purely for its own sake), and being happy anyway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.

## Conclusion

While [[the_concept_of_family_in_bojack_horseman | family]] is hinted at as a potential solution to BoJack's struggle for meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>, particularly through his longing for the domestic life he could have had with Charlotte <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>, the show suggests that even this might not be enough to fill the void <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>. The Wild Horses may also symbolize "the herd" and a sense of belonging that BoJack lacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.

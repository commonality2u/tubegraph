*Rick and Morty*, the animated series by Dan Harmon and Justin Roiland, is highly regarded for its mastery of [[rick_and_morty_story_structure | story structure]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. This article examines how the show, specifically the Season 2 episode "The Ricks Must Be Crazy," applies Dan Harmon's storytelling principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

## Dan Harmon's Story Circle

According to Dan Harmon, every story, from an epic to a simple joke, adheres to an "8 simple steps" framework, which he calls "the story embryo" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>:

1.  A character is in a zone of comfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
2.  But they want something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
3.  They enter an unfamiliar situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
4.  Adapt to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
5.  Get what they wanted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
6.  Pay a heavy price for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
7.  Then return to their familiar situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
8.  Having changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

However, this structure is adapted for television, which aims to keep viewers watching continuously, leading to less emphasis on internal [[character_development_in_rick_and_morty | change]] and more on preserving the status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. Harmon suggests that television "swaps out any meaningful and therefore potentially television-subverting truth with the basic, eternal 'truth' that change is unnecessary" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

The modified structure for a TV episode often looks like this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>:

1.  "I (the protagonist) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>
2.  Notice a small problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
3.  And make a major decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
4.  This changes things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>
5.  To some satisfaction, but <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>
6.  There are consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>
7.  That must be undone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>
8.  And I must admit the futility of change" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

## "The Ricks Must Be Crazy" Episode Breakdown

Every episode of [[rick_and_morty_story_structure | Rick and Morty]] follows this format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. Here's how it plays out in Season 2, Episode 6: "The Ricks Must Be Crazy":

### Step 1: Establish a Protagonist in a Zone of Comfort

The episode quickly establishes the protagonists and their world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. It opens with Summer, [[character_analysis_of_rick_sanchez_and_his_motivations | Rick]], and [[character_analysis_of_rick_and_jerry_from_rick_and_morty | Morty]] exiting the movie "Ball Fondlers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

### Step 2: Introduce a Small Problem and Establish a Need

This step reveals that life isn't perfect for the protagonist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. For the Sanchez family, the problem arises when [[character_analysis_of_rick_sanchez_and_his_motivations | Rick]]'s ship won't start due to a problem with its "Microverse Battery" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. This sets up the central motivation: the need to fix the ship's battery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. [[character_analysis_of_rick_and_jerry_from_rick_and_morty | Morty]]'s initial reluctance to go "inside" the battery serves to help the audience identify with the protagonist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

### Step 3: The Protagonist Makes a Major Decision and Enters an Unfamiliar Situation

The "descent into the unknown" begins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. [[character_analysis_of_rick_sanchez_and_his_motivations | Rick]] and [[character_analysis_of_rick_and_jerry_from_rick_and_jerry | Morty]] literally shrink down to visit a world inside [[character_analysis_of_rick_sanchez_and_his_motivations | Rick]]'s car battery, posing as aliens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. Harmon emphasizes the importance of a noticeable contrast between the two worlds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. This new world is populated by Martian-like people living in power plant-inspired buildings who venerate [[character_analysis_of_rick_sanchez_and_his_motivations | Rick]] for electricity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. Unbeknownst to them, the "Gooble Boxes" [[character_analysis_of_rick_sanchez_and_his_motivations | Rick]] gave them redirect most of their power to his ship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

### Step 4: Characters Adapt to the New Situation and Things Must Change (Externally)

This step focuses on characters learning their place in the new world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. In television, this is about external changes rather than deep internal transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. In the Microverse, [[character_analysis_of_rick_sanchez_and_his_motivations | Rick]] and [[character_analysis_of_rick_and_jerry_from_rick_and_morty | Morty]] identify the problem: Zeep Xanflorp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. Zeep, a carbon copy of [[character_analysis_of_rick_sanchez_and_his_motivations | Rick]], has created his own Microverse, rendering [[character_analysis_of_rick_sanchez_and_his_motivations | Rick]]'s "Gooble Boxes" obsolete and his battery unusable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. Despite facing a mirror image of himself, [[character_analysis_of_rick_sanchez_and_his_motivations | Rick]] refuses to acknowledge his hypocrisy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. Instead, he decides to find a scientist in Zeep's Microverse who is working on his own Microverse to force Zeep to realize his hypocrisy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

### Step 5: The Character Gets What They Wanted (Turning Point)

This is the story's major turning point, where motivations begin to shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. [[character_analysis_of_rick_sanchez_and_his_motivations | Rick]] achieves his goal by finding Kyle, a scientist in Zeep's Microverse creating his own Microverse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. However, as Zeep delivers the same "slavery with extra steps" rant [[character_analysis_of_rick_sanchez_and_his_motivations | Rick]] gave earlier, Zeep realizes his own universe is a Microverse, brought into being by [[character_analysis_of_rick_sanchez_and_his_motivations | Rick]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. This existential realization leads to Zeep and [[character_analysis_of_rick_sanchez_and_his_motivations | Rick]] fighting, while Kyle crumbles from his own realization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.

### Step 6: Paying a Hefty Price and Suffering the Consequences

This step prepares the hero for their return to the familiar world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. While [[character_analysis_of_rick_sanchez_and_his_motivations | Rick]] got his desired Microverse within Zeep's, his actions cause Kyle's existential meltdown and suicide, trapping them all in the Tinyverse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. Unable to put aside their egos, [[character_analysis_of_rick_sanchez_and_his_motivations | Rick]] and Zeep blame each other and wage war instead of working together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. Ultimately, [[character_analysis_of_rick_and_jerry_from_rick_and_morty | Morty]] and his primitive Tree People tribe force [[character_analysis_of_rick_sanchez_and_his_motivations | Rick]] and Zeep to form an alliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.

### Step 7: Undoing the Damage and Returning to the Familiar World

This is the final step before the hero resurfaces from the unfamiliar situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. Re-entering the old world is difficult, and elements from the "lower world" may follow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>. [[character_analysis_of_rick_and_jerry_from_rick_and_morty | Morty]] forces [[character_analysis_of_rick_sanchez_and_his_motivations | Rick]] and Zeep to engineer a solution to escape Kyle's Tinyverse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. Zeep, acting as a shadow figure embodying [[character_analysis_of_rick_sanchez_and_his_motivations | Rick]]'s undesirable traits, tries to stop [[character_analysis_of_rick_sanchez_and_his_motivations | Rick]] from fixing the car battery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. The beauty of [[rick_and_morty_story_structure | Rick and Morty]] is that [[character_analysis_of_rick_sanchez_and_his_motivations | Rick]] is aware of his flaws but has no desire to fix them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. The final confrontation is not about [[character_analysis_of_rick_sanchez_and_his_motivations | Rick]] changing, but "just [[character_analysis_of_rick_sanchez_and_his_motivations | Rick]] fighting [[character_analysis_of_rick_sanchez_and_his_motivations | Rick]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>.

### Step 8: Change or the Futility of It

In traditional narratives, this is where the hero achieves fulfillment and integrates new skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>. However, for television, the hero can never be truly fulfilled to ensure continuous adventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>. After escaping the Microverse, [[character_analysis_of_rick_sanchez_and_his_motivations | Rick]] explains that Zeep had to choose between reverting to "Gooble Box" technology or having [[character_analysis_of_rick_sanchez_and_his_motivations | Rick]] discard a broken battery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>. The episode concludes with them back in their "Ball Fondlers" reality, with [[character_analysis_of_rick_and_jerry_from_rick_and_morty | Morty]] and Summer shell-shocked by the normalcy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.

## Conclusion

While [[rick_and_morty_story_structure | Rick and Morty]] mocks popular culture and plays with audience expectations, its core [[rick_and_morty_story_structure | structure]] is like any other TV show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>. However, it uses this circular structure to make viewers confront "the depressing, crippling futility of change" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>. [[character_analysis_of_rick_sanchez_and_his_motivations | Rick Sanchez]] successfully re-enslaves an entire planet just to power his car battery for ice cream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>. This demonstrates the creative team's belief in the power of [[rick_and_morty_story_structure | story structure]], even if [[character_analysis_of_rick_sanchez_and_his_motivations | Rick]] himself believes in little else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>.

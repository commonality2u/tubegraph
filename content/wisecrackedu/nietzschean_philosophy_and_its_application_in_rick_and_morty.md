The animated series *Rick and Morty* frequently explores themes of meaninglessness, particularly within its third season <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. The show often emphasizes that nothing truly matters, as events unfold infinitely across infinite realities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This perspective, indicative of [[cosmic_nihilism_and_its_depiction_in_rick_and_morty | cosmic nihilism]], poses a challenge for character development in a TV series: how can characters grow when existence itself is meaningless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>?

The season three finale, "The Rickchurian Mortydate," offers a novel solution that transcends a descent into [[nihilism_and_existential_themes_in_rick_and_morty | nihilism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This growth is primarily observed not in Rick, but in the family matriarch, Beth Smith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## Beth's Existential Dilemma

The primary subplot of "The Rickchurian Mortydate" revolves around Beth's existential crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Following events in a previous episode, Beth questions whether she chose to be replaced by a clone and if she is, in fact, the clone herself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. This uncertainty prompts her to seek comfort from Jerry, with whom she rekindles their relationship by recreating one of their first dates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

Rick's earlier advice to Beth regarding her intelligence highlights the show's [[nihilism_and_existential_themes_in_rick_and_morty | nihilistic]] undertones: "When you know nothing matters the universe is yours and I’ve never met a universe that was into it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Rick's typical solution to this realization is to "Don't think about it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. However, Beth is confronted with radical freedom to choose her destiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>, which brings her solace regardless of her choice to stay with or leave her family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. The episode suggests she chooses to stay, finding newfound happiness, becoming a "better mother," and reconnecting with Jerry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

## Amor Fati: Embracing Fate

Beth's paradigm shift, particularly her reconciliation with Jerry, can be explained through the Nietzschean concept of **Amor Fati** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

Amor Fati is a Latin phrase meaning "Love of Fate," popularized by Friedrich Nietzsche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. It is about the affirmation of life, becoming a "Yes-Sayer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. This concept is closely tied to the thought experiment of "Eternal Recurrence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

### Eternal Recurrence

Imagine a demon proposing to make you infinitely relive your entire life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. According to Nietzsche, the ultimate affirmation of life, Amor Fati, is to desire to relive every moment—the good, the bad, and everything in between—for eternity, rather than falling into [[philosophy_and_existentialism_in_rick_and_morty | existential despair]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. This acceptance is part of Nietzsche's strategy to overcome the "crushing [[nihilism_and_cosmic_pessimism_in_rick_and_morty | nihilism]] of existence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

### Beth's Application of Amor Fati

Beth, plagued by her existential crisis and burdened by an [[science_and_rationalism_in_rick_and_morty | intelligence]] that causes disillusionment, must confront her past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. By recreating a past date with Jerry, she effectively "relives" a part of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. Although she may have disliked her life and her date with Jerry the first time, this time, she embraces it as a "Yes-Sayer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

Amor Fati isn't about denying past misery or believing "everything is a blessing in disguise" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. Instead, it encourages not shunning the "ugly aspects of our lives" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. Beth acknowledges she is "no longer the woman he married" to Jerry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>, suggesting an acceptance of growth and change while integrating her past. Despite Jerry's perceived simplicity, Beth chooses to embrace this connection, potentially as a counter to her family's history of using [[science_and_rationalism_in_rick_and_morty | intelligence]] to justify unhealthy patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

Another example of Amor Fati in Beth occurs when she believes Rick has come to "retire" her. She functionally accepts this fate, embracing being with her family rather than dwelling on what "could have been" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. Even in a multiverse of infinite choices, she chooses to stay in her present reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

## Beth as the Ubermensch

Nietzsche also wrote about the "impossible task of 'knowing oneself'" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. Beth openly struggles with this, asking "who am I? What do I do?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. Nietzsche suggests that the true reasons for our actions are impenetrable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. For Beth, whether she was cloned or if anything matters in infinite versions of herself, Nietzsche would argue it doesn't; all one can do is love one's fate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. This appears to be the choice Beth makes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

While Rick is often portrayed as a Nietzschean *Übermensch* ("overman") at war with the meaningless cosmos, often exclaiming "There is no God!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>, he frequently fails to create new meaning. Instead, he engages in self-destructive behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. Beth, however, when faced with the meaninglessness of the cosmos, actively finds happiness through embracing her fate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. This act of affirmation and self-overcoming, creating her own meaning in the face of [[cosmic_nihilism_and_its_depiction_in_rick_and_morty | cosmic nihilism]], makes Beth's journey arguably more *ubermenschy* than Rick's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

*South Park* Season 19 marks a significant shift for the long-running animated series, becoming a serialized narrative that tells an overarching story across episodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. This season is considered highly intelligent, chronicling significant social changes in the small Colorado town, introducing new characters, and commenting on America’s current political climate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Meta-Commentary on South Park Itself

A clever aspect of Season 19 is its layered commentary, which not only addresses modern social conditions but also critiques the show itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. The season opens with Principal Victoria's firing and the appointment of a new person to make South Park Elementary "a more progressive place that fits in with today's times" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This dialogue serves as a [[analysis_of_south_parks_approach_to_satire_and_internet_culture | meta-commentary]] on *South Park* the show, questioning whether its signature vulgar sensibility can survive in a politically correct world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Comments about the town changing can be interpreted as the show itself facing change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. Characters like Officer Barbrady and Mr. Garrison, a "fountain of unbridled profanity," symbolize an older time that is being phased out or is fighting against these changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

## Political Correctness and [[neoliberalism_in_south_park_season_19 | Neoliberalism]]

While some might interpret the PC plotline as simply Trey Parker and Matt Stone criticizing [[south_parks_critique_of_liberal_media | liberal politics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>, the show's critique is more complex, often evading a simple left/right political divide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. Season 19 connects PC culture, gentrification, and advertising through the lens of [[neoliberalism_in_south_park_season_19 | neoliberalism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

[[neoliberalism_in_south_park_season_19 | Neoliberalism]], an economic ideology, emphasizes personal freedoms and market-based solutions for societal problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. Its tenets include consumerism as a civic duty, individual freedoms outweighing public freedoms, and addressing social issues privately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. The show proposes that PC culture is a "verbal form of gentrification," sprucing things up to create a false sense of paradise where only advertisements can truly thrive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

### PC Culture as a Marketable Commodity

[[neoliberalism_in_south_park_season_19 | Neoliberalism]] aims to make everything marketable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. Gentrification, for example, is the market's solution for "shitty neighborhoods," transforming them into overpriced, trendy areas without addressing underlying poverty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. *South Park* suggests that even diversity and multiculturalism become tools for profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. Advertisers manipulate PC culture to gentrify areas globally, turning "otherness and diversity" into marketable brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. This is explicitly stated when a character notes, "ads are using PC for their own games? That's a new low" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

The ads in the show symbolize the dehumanizing forces of [[neoliberalism_in_south_park_season_19 | neoliberal capitalism]], which assimilate or destroy everything in their path, often covertly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. This raises anxiety about what ideas are genuinely one's own versus those planted by clever commercials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. In a world permeated by advertising, cultures and individuals become "reduced versions" that can be neatly packaged and sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. Social acceptance becomes a brand rather than genuine tolerance, exemplified by gay pride parades sponsored by banks or "real standards of beauty" sponsored by corporations, replacing genuine revolution with clever hashtags <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

*South Park* is not arguing that diversity is inherently bad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. Instead, it highlights [[neoliberalism_in_south_park_season_19 | neoliberalism]]'s ability to "coopt" what was once outside the system, assimilating it to serve capitalism's needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. Multiculturalism becomes a trendy brand to be purchased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

### The Whole Foods Metaphor

The show uses Whole Foods as a focal point for the progressive changes in South Park <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. The town adopts "marks of tolerance," such as having "gay kids" and a "police-free environment," to attract businesses and new residents, effectively using tolerance as a marketing strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. Whole Foods ceases to be just a place to buy organic food and becomes a symbol of lofty ideals bought into with overpriced products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

The show explicitly links the spectacle of inclusion to business. When Craig and Tweek are perceived as gay, they are showered with money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. The episode concludes with voyeurs watching them, raising the question of whether the affirmation is for the characters or the viewer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. In the [[neoliberalism_in_south_park_season_19 | neoliberal economy]], the spectacle of inclusion is sold as a commodity, allowing consumers to feel self-righteous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

## The Dangers of PC Culture

Slovenian theorist Slavoj Zizek's ideas are used to explain the dangers of modern political systems that are "so dang pleasant" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. Unlike clear villains from the past, the "PC bro" presents a pleasant facade while still pursuing self-serving motivations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.

Zizek describes political correctness as a "form of self-discipline which doesn’t really allow you to overcome [racism, misogyny, and so on]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. If PC culture is dangerous, it's because it's a "nice paint job over the same old discriminatory reality," making it difficult to identify a clear villain and leading to "self-satisfying acts of social justice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

### Token Gestures and "Inter-Passivity"

The "progressive" world of South Park involves people spending hundreds at Whole Foods but feeling good by donating a dollar to charity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. This "Whole Food style charity" is presented as a marriage between inaction and action, where change and rebellion become commodities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. Zizek argues that criticism is disarmed when one can be a "good [[neoliberalism_in_south_park_season_19 | neoliberal]] consumer" while feeling like they are fighting the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. Rebellion is tolerated as long as it stays within acceptable bounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

Zizek uses the term "inter-passivity" to describe doing things not to achieve something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. He suggests that political correctness often fits the formula of "Let’s go on changing something all the time so that, globally, things will remain the same" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

### Feigning Knowledge and Disempowering Victims

*South Park* attacks this hypocrisy by showing the town's real feelings about the poor when Whole Foods is surrounded by the homeless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. Multiculturalism becomes a badge to wear, rather than a genuine political project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. Characters in South Park remain ignorant but feign knowledge of other cultures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. The [[analysis_of_south_parks_approach_to_satire_and_internet_culture | meta-criticism]] questions whether token inclusion truly leads to inclusivity or is merely a shell of diversity meant to boost ratings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. The show suggests that this display of tolerance is often more about making white liberals feel good than genuinely helping marginalized people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

The PC frathouse, despite its talk of marginalized people, is entirely white, with its passion to help the disabled being a cover for self-interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. French philosopher Jean Baudrillard's concept of "charity cannibalism" is introduced, where "other people's destitution becomes our adventure playground," continually reproducing the "catastrophe market" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.

PC Principal's interaction with Jimmy, a marginalized person who doesn't want his help, exemplifies this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. PC Principal then finds Nathan, who fits his narrative of a helpless victim. This "protector-victim" relationship is disempowering, as the victim is only validated by their helplessness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. Zizek argues that this PC culture can be more intolerant to other cultures, as it accepts everyone only if they can be pigeonholed into a consumable type of difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. The show uses the example of Caitlyn Jenner, who is celebrated despite controversies, because her image is "simple, it’s consumable, it sells" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>.

## Narcissism and Victimhood

*South Park* reliably takes down both sides of the political extreme, satirizing both Trump-esque conservatism and aspects of liberal arts culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>. The show argues that a deep-rooted narcissism underlies both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. Buying into the PC brand is often more about self-validation than enacting real change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>. Randy's charity efforts evolve from feeding hungry kids to providing iPads to children in developing countries to protect the fragile egos of people like him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>. This "Whole Foods activism" is about "being a sell-out to the system while making meaningless gestures to protect your own sense of self-worth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>.

Cartman, a pathological liar and narcissist, adopts PC culture to protect his ego <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>. On the other side, Mr. Garrison's "fuck-em-all-to-death attitude" and version of American exceptionalism represent a nationalist "special snowflake" complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>. [[neoliberalism_in_south_park_season_19 | Neoliberalism]], by promoting a consumerism centered on the individual, fuels this self-obsession, resulting in a "cult of victimhood" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>. For Mr. Garrison, this is a paranoid delusion of others ruining his life; for the PC crowd, it's the mistaken idea that not being a victim means having one's illusions of grandeur entertained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>. In the end, "everyone wants to hang reality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>.

## *South Park*'s Nuanced Stance

The show clarifies that it is not attacking every aspect of PC culture or everyone who advocates for safe spaces or loves their country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>. Rather, it critiques the "shallow versions of it propagated in the mainstream media" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>.

PC Principal has a redemption arc, where he goes on a rampage against "inauthentic" PC bros after realizing he was manipulated by ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>. Creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker acknowledge their own "privileged position," stating that they are "two privileged straight white boys who have theirs laughs about things we've never had to deal with" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>. The finale makes it clear that PC Principal is here to stay, with Stan commenting, "This is gonna be really hard" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>. This reflects the difficulty of avoiding bigotry while navigating the pitfalls of phony inclusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>. *South Park* must navigate the current political climate, and like any TV show, it needs ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>.

*South Park* Season 19, a serialized narrative, explores significant social changes in the town of South Park and comments on America's political climate, introducing a new central character in the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. This season is considered one of the show's smartest, offering a layered commentary on both modern social conditions and the show itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## Season 19's Engagement with PC Culture

The season begins with the dismissal of Principal Victoria and the appointment of a new principal to make South Park Elementary "a more progressive place that fits in with today's times" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. This change prompts a meta-commentary on the show's own struggle to maintain its "signature vulgar sensibility" in an increasingly politically correct world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. The town's transformation can be interpreted as the show itself facing change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>, with characters like Officer Barbrady and Mr. Garrison struggling with the new reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

While some might interpret the PC plotline as *South Park*'s creators, Trey Parker and Matt Stone, simply "taking a dump on liberal politics" due to their espoused libertarian leanings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>, the show often evades a simple left/right political divide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

## Neoliberalism as a Unifying Theme
A key to understanding Season 19's critique of PC culture is the concept of [[neoliberalism_in_south_park_season_19 | neoliberalism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. Defined as an economic ideology emphasizing personal freedoms and market solutions for societal problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>, [[neoliberalism_in_south_park_season_19 | neoliberalism]]'s tenets, as articulated by philosopher Henry Giroux, include:
*   Consumerism as a primary civic duty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
*   Individual freedoms outweighing public freedoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
*   Addressing public social issues on a private level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

[[neoliberalism_in_south_park_season_19 | Neoliberalism]] connects the seemingly disparate themes of gentrification, PC culture, and advertising in the show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. The show famously posits that "What is PC but a verbal form of gentrification? Spruce everything up, get rid of all the ugliness, in order to create a false sense of paradise? Only one thing can actually live in that world: ads" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

Under [[neoliberalism_in_south_park_season_19 | neoliberalism]], the goal is to make everything marketable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. Even diversity and multiculturalism become tools for profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. The show suggests that advertisers manipulate PC culture to gentrify areas, turning "otherness and diversity" into marketable brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. Ads, embodying the "grossly inhuman forces of [[south_park_and_capitalism | neoliberal capitalism]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>, can infiltrate society, leading to anxiety about whether friends, family, or even beloved TV shows are just sponsored content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. This advertising covers up reality, leaving only "reduced versions of ourselves, of cultures, that can be neatly packaged and sold" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

## Cooptation of Diversity and "Whole Foods" Activism
The show highlights [[neoliberalism_in_south_park_season_19 | neoliberalism]]'s strength in "cooptation"—assimilating elements outside the system to serve [[south_park_and_capitalism | capitalism]]'s needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. Multiculturalism transforms into a "trendy brand to be purchased" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. For South Park to progress economically, it adopts "marks of tolerance" to attract businesses and residents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

Whole Foods serves as a central symbol for these progressive changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>, becoming "a set of lofty ideals that we buy into" rather than just a place to buy organic food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. The show illustrates that the spectacle of inclusion, such as the town's embrace of Craig and Tweek's perceived gay relationship, is good for business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. In the neoliberal economy, this spectacle is sold as a commodity, offering a "healthy dose of self righteousness" in return for cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

## Slavoj Žižek and the Danger of "Pleasant" Political Systems
Slovenian theorist Slavoj Žižek suggests that modern political systems are more dangerous due to their "pleasant" facade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. Unlike overt villains, the "PC bro" presents a pleasant exterior, hiding true motivations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. Žižek views political correctness as "a form of self-discipline which doesn’t really allow you to overcome [racism, misogyny, and so on]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. It's a "nice paint job over the same old discriminatory reality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>, with no clear villain, only "self-satisfying acts of social justice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

The "Whole Foods style charity" in the show exemplifies this: people spend excessively while alleviating guilt with token charitable gestures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. Žižek argues this is a "perfect marriage" between inaction and action, where change becomes a commodity, and criticism is disarmed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. Rebellion is tolerated as long as it stays within acceptable bounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>, fitting his concept of *inter-passivity*: "Let’s go on changing something all the time so that, globally, things will remain the same" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

*South Park* exposes this hypocrisy, revealing the town's true feelings about the poor when the homeless surround Whole Foods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

## The Narcissism of "Token Inclusion"
The show criticizes multiculturalism as a "badge to wear" rather than a genuine political project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. The town's residents feign knowledge of other cultures without actual understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. This [[meta_commentary_on_political_satire_in_south_park | metacriticism]] raises the question: does token inclusion truly foster inclusivity, or is it a "shell of actual diversity" meant to boost ratings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>? Ultimately, this "show of tolerance" is often about making "white liberals feel good" rather than genuinely helping marginalized people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

The PC frathouse, despite its rhetoric, is entirely white <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>, and their passion to help the disabled is a cover for personal gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. Jean Baudrillard's "charity cannibalism" describes how "other people's destitution becomes our adventure playground" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>, creating new tragedies when old ones run out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>. PC Principal's interaction with Jimmy, a disabled person who doesn't want his help, illustrates this: he seeks out Nathan, who fits his narrative of a helpless victim needing protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. This "protector-victim" dynamic disempowers the victim, validating them only through their helplessness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.

Žižek argues that this PC culture is more intolerant to other cultures because it "lovingly accepts everyone, so long as we can pigeonhole them into a type of difference we can consume" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. The example of Caitlyn Jenner, despite her controversial actions and views, being celebrated as a "stunning and brave hero" on *Vanity Fair* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>, illustrates how complex realities are simplified for consumable branding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.

*South Park* aims to critique the "deep rooted narcissism" behind both political extremes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.
*   **PC Culture**: Much of "buying into the PC brand" is about personal validation rather than real change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>. Randy's charity, for instance, morphs from feeding hungry kids to providing iPads for kids in developing countries to protect the fragile egos of people like Randy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>. Cartman, a known narcissist, uses "safe space language" to protect his own ego <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.
*   **Opposing Extremes**: Mr. Garrison's "fuck-em-all-to-death attitude" and "nationalist version of the 'special snowflake' complex" are fueled by a narcissistic obsession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>. His shock at a Canadian wall keeping *him* out reveals his self-centered worldview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>.

[[neoliberalism_in_south_park_season_19 | Neoliberalism]], by promoting a "culture of consumerism centered on the individual" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>, fuels this mass self-obsession, resulting in a "cult of victimhood" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>. For the PC crowd, being a "victim of harassment" means having one's "illusions of grandeur" entertained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>.

The show isn't arguing against genuine advocacy for safe spaces or patriotism, but rather highlights how otherwise reasonable logic gets "caught up in a whirlwind of societal bullshit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>. The creators do not hate "every aspect of PC culture," but rather its "shallow versions... propagated in the mainstream media" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>. PC Principal's redemption, where he murders "inauthentic" PC bros after realizing he was manipulated by ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>, suggests a nuanced view.

The show acknowledges its own privileged position, with creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker self-referentially stating, "We're two privileged straight white boys who have theirs laughs about things we've never had to deal with" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>. The finale makes it clear that PC Principal is here to stay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>, indicating the ongoing challenge of navigating society without appearing bigoted while avoiding "phony inclusion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>. *South Park* must continue to navigate the current political climate and its reliance on advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>.

The narrative of F. Scott Fitzgerald's *The Great Gatsby* primarily unfolds through the relationships and interactions of its central characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Main Characters

### Nick Carraway
Nick Carraway is introduced as an Ivy League graduate who rents a house in Long Island, situated next door to Jay Gatsby's residence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. He is also the cousin of Daisy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. After experiencing the "rich white boy angsty bullshit" in New York, Nick decides to leave and relocate to the Midwest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

### Jay Gatsby
Jay Gatsby is a wealthy playboy who resides next to Nick Carraway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. He moved to Long Island with the specific intention of rekindling his past relationship with Daisy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Gatsby is characterized by his adherence to his "American ideals," despite the cynical nature of the world around him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. His "romantic dream" is often seen as ridiculous in the context of the "back stabbin crackers" that populate Fitzgerald's America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. Some interpretations suggest that Gatsby's greatness stems from the "beauty of his dream and the heroism of his efforts" to move beyond it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

### Daisy
Daisy is Nick Carraway's cousin and the wife of Tom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. She was formerly Jay Gatsby's "main bitch" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. When confronted by Gatsby and Tom, she struggles to choose between them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. Daisy is driving Gatsby's car when Myrtle is killed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. After the accident, she flees the scene in Gatsby's car and subsequently ends her relationship with Gatsby <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. Gatsby's "big ass delusions" revolve around a future with Daisy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

### Tom
Tom is Daisy's husband <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. He is having an affair with Myrtle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Tom becomes enraged by Daisy's relationship with Gatsby at the Plaza Hotel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. After Myrtle's death, Tom falsely informs George that Gatsby was driving the car that killed Myrtle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

### Myrtle
Myrtle is Tom's mistress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. She is married to George, whom she believes "canâ€™t please his woman" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. After an argument with George, Myrtle runs into the road and is fatally struck by Gatsby's car, which Daisy is driving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

### George
George is Myrtle's husband <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. He refers to Myrtle as a "dirty skank" due to her infidelity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Believing Gatsby was Myrtle's lover and responsible for her death, George shoots Gatsby while he is in his pool, and then takes his own life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

## Character Relationships

### Gatsby and Daisy
Jay Gatsby and Daisy were previously in a romantic relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. Gatsby moved to Long Island specifically "in hopes that he might get a crack at that ass again" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Their past connection becomes a point of contention when Tom confronts them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. Daisy struggles to decide between Gatsby and her husband, Tom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. Ultimately, Daisy ends her relationship with Gatsby after the car accident that kills Myrtle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. Gatsby's aspirations are heavily tied to his "big ass delusions about the future with this bitch, Daisy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. This focus on the past and future with Daisy is a central element to the [[motifs_in_the_great_gatsby | Dreams vs. Reality motif]] in the novel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

### Tom and Daisy
Tom and Daisy are married <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. Their marriage is strained by Tom's infidelity and Daisy's renewed connection with Gatsby <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Tom becomes openly hostile towards Gatsby due to his relationship with Daisy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

### Tom and Myrtle
Tom is having an affair with Myrtle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Myrtle is married to George, but her relationship with Tom is a secret to George <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

### George and Myrtle
George and Myrtle are married <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Their relationship is depicted as troubled, with Myrtle expressing dissatisfaction with George <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. George later confronts Myrtle about her infidelity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

### Gatsby and Tom
Gatsby and Tom are rivals for Daisy's affection, which culminates in a heated confrontation at the Plaza Hotel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. Tom's resentment towards Gatsby leads him to misinform George about the driver of the car that killed Myrtle, effectively setting Gatsby up for his death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

### George and Gatsby
George comes to believe that Gatsby was Myrtle's lover and the driver of the car that killed her, due to Tom's false accusations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. This mistaken belief leads George to murder Gatsby before taking his own life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

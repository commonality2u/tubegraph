The term "prosumer" is a technical term coined in the 1980s by futurists Alvin and Heidi Toffler [00:08:59]. It describes the merging roles of the producer and consumer in the age of modern technology [00:09:03]. In contemporary media, individuals are not merely consuming content but are actively involved in its production [00:08:36].

## The Star Wars Legitimation Crisis: A Case Study
The recent backlash against *Star Wars* illustrates the significant impact of prosumers [00:00:13]. Some fans reacted intensely to *The Last Jedi*, issuing an anti-Disney manifesto, driving an actress off Instagram, crowdfunding a remake, and claiming responsibility for *Solo*'s box office failure [00:00:14]. There were even rumors that Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy might retire early, potentially influenced by Twitter [00:00:26]. This situation is framed as a "legitimation crisis," a concept from political philosopher Jurgen Habermas, which describes an existential crisis threatening the foundation of a social system [00:02:14].

The Star Wars fandom is seen as a social system comprising governmental, socio-cultural, and economic sub-parts [00:02:28]. George Lucas was initially considered the "divinely ordained monarch" of the Star Wars universe, which included not only films but also spin-offs like video games, board games, cartoons, and tie-in novels [00:03:46]. This formed a "lifeworld" (lebenswelt) â€” a socially cohesive system with shared practices, beliefs, values, and rules [00:04:12].

However, the acquisition of Lucasfilm by Disney in 2012 marked a "regime change" [00:04:58]. According to some fans, Lord Lucas was replaced by a "money-hungry animated mouse" [00:05:08]. Disney's controversial decisions, such as "decanonizing" radio dramas, video games, comics, and hundreds of spin-off novels previously considered part of the Star Wars gospel, deeply affected the community's identity [00:07:44]. Fans' identities are deeply "wrapped up" in what counts as Star Wars [00:08:03].

### The Printing Press Analogy
The current Star Wars crisis is compared to the [[exploration_of_control_and_power_dynamics_in_media | legitimation crisis]] faced by the Catholic Church in the 1500s [00:05:42].
*   **Before the Printing Press** Until the 16th century, the Catholic Church maintained total control over the meaning of the Bible because hard copies were scarce and expensive, and few people could read [00:05:50]. This allowed the Church to engage in practices like selling indulgences [00:06:07].
*   **Gutenberg's Impact** Johannes Gutenberg's invention of the printing press in 1440 enabled the rapid reproduction of texts [00:06:16]. Suddenly, regular people could read the Bible and develop their own interpretations, leading to a crisis of legitimation as the masses began "producing canonical interpretations" [00:06:23]. Figures like Martin Luther challenged the Church's authority [00:06:43].

In the Star Wars analogy, the original universe created by George Lucas is the "Bible" [00:07:01]. While Lucas's authority derived from creating it, Disney's authority is questioned because it is a "larger and fallible organization" that changed "agreed upon values, meanings, and truths" of the system [00:07:11].

### The Prosumer Age: Beyond Literacy
Today, the challenge goes beyond simple literacy [00:08:20]. [[audience_complicity_in_media_narratives | Prosumers]] blog, tweet, create video essays, produce their own cartoons, and stream content to millions [00:08:20]. This means that for every Martin Luther, there are "a million angry YouTubers and vloggers" critiquing media [00:08:29].

*Star Wars* fans are "prosumers extraordinaire" [00:09:08]. They actively contribute to the meaning of the Star Wars universe by sharing YouTube videos, posting video essays or fan theories, subscribing to subreddits, and retweeting [00:09:12]. This includes developing theories about characters like Luke or Snoke, or lightsaber fighting styles [00:09:24]. These actions are seen as ways for the community to "practice" Star Wars [00:09:35].

This dynamic is not unique to Star Wars. Director James Mangold, known for *Logan*, has noted that writing and directing large franchises has become "the emotionally loaded equivalent of writing a new chapter of The Bible," fearing that bolder minds will leave such films to "hacks & corp boards" due to the risk of being "stoned & called a blasphemer" by fans [00:09:55].

## The Future of Prosumerism and Media
The future of media systems facing such crises remains uncertain. Just as the Catholic Church learned and adjusted after its own legitimation crisis, media franchises like Star Wars might also evolve [00:10:23]. The key questions are whether Disney will adapt to the age of prosumerism by respecting fans and the universe they've helped create, or if fans will grow with the system and find new ways to interact with the material [00:10:50]. Alternatively, there could be a "reckoning," where Disney and fans diverge, much like the Catholics and Protestants, each creating their own version of the media religion [00:11:02].

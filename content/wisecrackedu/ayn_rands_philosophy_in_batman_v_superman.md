*Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice* is identified as a "punching bag of the DC Universe" often criticized for its shameless franchise plugging, slow plotting, and moments like "Save Martha" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This article focuses on the film's [[batman_v_superman_ideological_conflicts | ideological failings]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

A major challenge for the DCEU's architects was making Superman a relatable character, as he is an "indestructible, self-less, god-like figure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Their solution was to emphasize his vulnerabilities, flaws, and doubts, making him more human, similar to how *The Last Temptation of Christ* handled a benevolent messiah figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. This approach, however, "botches a fundamental part" of a film about the rivalry between Batman and Superman: "having them embody different ideologies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

## Inspiration from Frank Miller's *The Dark Knight Returns*

*Batman v. Superman* draws significant inspiration from Frank Miller's graphic novel *The Dark Knight Returns* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. Similarities include:
*   An older, broken Bruce Wayne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
*   Superman being hit by a nuclear warhead and then healed by the sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
*   Robin's memorialized costume in Batman's lair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
*   The central fight between Batman and Superman, with Superman trying to reason and Batman refusing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

Beneath the surface of *The Dark Knight Returns* lies an unlikely inspiration that solidifies the ideological distinction between Batman and Superman: Ayn Rand’s *The Fountainhead* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. Zack Snyder has attempted to make a film adaptation of *The Fountainhead* for years, and Frank Miller himself cites Rand as a major influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

### Ayn Rand's [[ayn_rands_objectivism_and_its_influence_on_bioshock | Objectivism]] and Ethical Egoism

Both Miller and Snyder appear drawn to Rand's depiction of male heroes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. In *The Fountainhead*, the protagonist Howard Roark is presented as the ideal man: one who achieves his goals and maintains his integrity regardless of obstacles or conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. This "Randian hero" is defined by "ethical egoism," the belief that the best course of action is always what is in one's own best interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. This pursuit of self-interest is considered the only path to happiness, a core tenet of [[ayn_rands_objectivism_and_its_influence_on_bioshock | Ayn Rand's philosophy: Objectivism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

To Rand, a male hero must be a "radical individualist, unwilling to bend, smarter than everyone else" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. This description perfectly fits Miller's Batman: a "super rich, handsome playboy with a genius intellect who refuses to bend to anyone’s will but his own" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. Batman's adherence to Randian egoism creates an [[comparison_of_batman_and_supermans_ideologies | ideological conflict]] with Superman, representing individualism versus collectivism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

In Miller's work, Batman faces obstruction from the US Government, which tasks Superman, the "ultimate ‘conformist’," to stop him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. Miller's Superman is portrayed as the "anti-Rand figure," whose "self-sacrificing moral righteousness & commitment to ‘good’ marks him a ‘Government Stooge’" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. The drama in Miller’s graphic novel stems from these differing ideologies: "the individualism of Batman vs. the conformism of Superman" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. Miller successfully instilled the spirit of Rand's theories to create a compelling interior conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

## Randian Philosophy in *Batman v. Superman*

### Batman's Portrayal
*Batman v. Superman*'s integration of this philosophy is where the film encounters issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. However, Ben Affleck’s Batman is largely consistent with Miller’s Randian interpretation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. He is handsome, "almost supernaturally athletic," "smarter than everyone else," and a complete individualist who refuses to bend his will to anyone, even the judicial process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. His actions, such as branding criminals to be shanked in prison, demonstrate his defiance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

Batman's concern about the "God-like Superman" can be interpreted as a nod to Rand's atheism, as a god-like figure would undermine ethical egoism by questioning one's ability to make choices based solely on rationality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

### Superman's Muddled Depiction
While the Randian version of Batman is depicted accurately, Superman's portrayal becomes muddled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. The filmmakers opted not to create a purely benevolent, do-gooder Superman (as that would be boring and unrelatable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>) nor the collectivist "stooge" that Miller made him (as the audience needs to like him for future Justice League films <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>).

Previous depictions, like Christopher Reeve's Superman, focused on self-sacrificing goodness, where he acts simply "because it’s the right thing to do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. However, the Superman in *BvS* appears burdened by his role, constantly undercutting the perception of him as a purely benevolent Christ-like hero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. Batman explicitly tells him, "You were never a god, you were never even a man" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.

Superman’s crisis manifests as two warring identities: the classic "Superman ‘The God’" (benevolent and Christopher Reeve-like) and "Superman ‘The Man’" (which for Snyder means a Randian Objectivist) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. An example of the latter is when he saves Lois in the Middle East but leaves other innocents to die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.

This internal conflict is highlighted by Martha Kent, who tells Clark that there's no difference between choosing to be a "Benevolent Messiah or a Self Involved Objectivist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. The important thing is that it is Clark's rational choice, a hallmark of a Randian hero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

Jonathan Kent's ghost further advises Clark, recounting a time he selflessly saved his farm from a flood, only for the water to flood another farm upstream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. Jonathan "dismantles the notion of self-less heroism," suggesting there's no point in being a classic selfless do-gooder because "there will always be another flooded farm you couldn’t stop" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. Jonathan's advice, akin to a "ghost of Objectivism past," suggests that true moral righteousness comes from "bettering yourself, pursuing your own self-interest, and protecting the ones you love, because they in turn bring you happiness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. This is ethical egoism in a nutshell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.

Superman ultimately doesn't make a clear choice between being a Messiah or a Randian Hero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. He initially seems to embrace Jonathan's objectivism, returning to Metropolis to save only Lois and Martha, explicitly echoing Jonathan's words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. However, he then sacrifices himself in a "Messianic fashion," with his arms spread out like Christ on a cross <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. He takes responsibility for the whole planet as a benevolent savior, but also states he's doing it for Lois as an objectivist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

## Lack of Ideological Conflict
Superman's ambiguous philosophy becomes problematic because *BvS* is framed as an [[comparison_of_batman_and_supermans_ideologies | ideological conflict]] between Batman and Superman, yet "none actually exists" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. Initially, the film pays lip service to their differing beliefs: Bruce distrusts Superman as a "superhuman benevolent savior," having a "bad history with freaks dressed like clowns" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>, while Clark views Batman as a vigilante who needs to be checked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

This is similar to Miller's *The Dark Knight Returns*, but *BvS* immediately undermines this dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. The world turns against Superman because, like Batman, he acts on his own accord <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. By using Objectivism to make Superman relatable, the film "shoots itself in the foot" as there is "almost no ideological difference between Batman and Superman" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

Instead of a film with a conflict based on differing ideals, *BvS* becomes a confrontation between a "Randian Hero" (Batman) and a "Maybe Sort-of Randian Hero who can’t decide if he wants to be the divine savior the world wants him to be" (Superman) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.

The film ultimately presents no preference for heroics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>. The message isn't that one type of hero should be checked while another promoted, but rather that "MORE HEROS" are needed—Aquaman, The Flash, Cyborg—to form the Justice League <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. This muddles any clear philosophy the film might have espoused, making it "a mess" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>, though an ambitious one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.

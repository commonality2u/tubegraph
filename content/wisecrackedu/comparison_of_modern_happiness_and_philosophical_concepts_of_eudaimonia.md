The 2015 Disney/Pixar film *Inside Out* received critical acclaim for its light-hearted yet scientifically rooted exploration of how the brain works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The film’s creators consulted psychologists to ensure its whimsical world was based on actual science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. *Inside Out* offers insights into how current emotions can color past memories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a> and how emotions interact with the rational part of our brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. Contrary to the societal notion that emotions disrupt rational brains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>, modern science, according to consulting psychologists Dacher Keltner and Paul Ekman, indicates that emotions organize, rather than disrupt, rational thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. For instance, anger can increase awareness of unfairness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>, fear helps avoid danger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>, and disgust limits urges to eat spoiled food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

## The Modern Distortion of Happiness

While *Inside Out* is often seen as a journey where Joy, the protagonist, learns to let sadness butt in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>, the film can also be viewed as a commentary on the [[critique_of_compulsory_happiness_in_modern_society | compulsory happiness]] prevalent in 20th-century society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. In this context, Joy, the "ostensible hero" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>, is argued to be the villain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. Joy's attempts to recover a core memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>, stemming from her "fascist" tendency to boss around other emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>, inadvertently harms Riley's brain and makes things worse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

This perspective highlights a societal problem where not being happy is often not considered an option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. An array of professionals, from doctors to self-help gurus, mandate a positive outlook, even suggesting drugs if needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. However, this view neglects the utility of other emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Many beloved works of art are created by individuals dealing with unpleasant emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>, and trying to wipe away emotions like depression can be dangerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

The idea that "happiness is a personal responsibility" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>, a struggle within one's own mind, is embodied by *Inside Out*'s structure, with the drama primarily occurring inside Riley’s mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. This focus diverts attention from broader political and economic issues that might contribute to unhappiness, such as the "impersonal machinations of capitalism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. Economic sociologist William Davies argues in *The Happiness Industry* that this [[critique_of_compulsory_happiness_in_modern_society | compulsory happiness]] is a central component of neoliberal capitalism, manipulated by corporations to make people work harder and buy more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. Society aims to put Joy in control, suppressing emotions like anger that can make individuals aware of injustice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. This societal emphasis on happiness often omits crucial questions about the roots of one's dissatisfaction, such as hating one's job or being a victim of an unjust system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

## Eudaimonia: A Robust Happiness

Ancient Greek philosophy offered a concept of happiness known as Eudaimonia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. Espoused by philosophers like Plato and Aristotle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>, Eudaimonia was not merely a pursuit of pleasure, but rather a pursuit of virtue and justice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. Plato argued that a person seeking only [[exploration_of_hedonism_and_disillusionment | earthly hedonist pleasure]] was not truly happy, as their inner sense of virtue would create internal strife and disharmony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

*Inside Out* implicitly criticizes the notion of [[critique_of_compulsory_happiness_in_modern_society | compulsory happiness]] by casting Joy as the villain who sets Riley on a downward spiral by compulsively trying to maintain happiness in the face of hardship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. The film's climax, where Anger, Disgust, Fear, and Sadness work together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>, ultimately sets Riley on the path to a better mental state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. This suggests that emotions like sadness and anger are not hindrances but contribute to making individuals better people and creating a "more robust kind of happiness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. This robust happiness aligns with the philosophical concept of Eudaimonia, which transcends simple pleasure to embrace a fuller, more virtuous existence.

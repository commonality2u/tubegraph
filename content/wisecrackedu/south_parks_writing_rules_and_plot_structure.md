South Park's writing is known for its effectiveness, attributed to a "secret sauce" by creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. The show maintains a "strict order to the madness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a> through a core narrative rule.

## The Golden Rule: "But" or "Therefore"

The fundamental rule for South Park's plot lines dictates that "if the words 'and then' belong between those beats, you're f**ked" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. Instead, good writing for the show occurs "whenever you can replace your ands with buts or therefores" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. This ensures a cause-and-effect relationship between plot points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

### "And Then" vs. "But/Therefore"

*   **"And Then" Example (Poor Narrative)**
    A storyline about "stick figure John" illustrates a "sucky narrative" because it lacks cause and effect: "John adopts a stray dog, and then John wins the lottery, and then John becomes a Scientologist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. These actions could be rearranged without changing the story, making it a "random series of events" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

*   **"But/Therefore" Example (Effective Narrative)**
    South Park's Mormon episode exemplifies the "but/therefore" rule:
    *   "An annoyingly perfect Mormon kid moves to town, **therefore** he pisses everyone off" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
    *   "**Therefore** Stan decides to kick his ass" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
    *   "**But** the kid is so nice, that he tell Stan to go ahead and beat him up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
    *   "**Therefore** Stan doesn't beat him up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
    *   "Instead, he agrees to go to the kids house for dinner" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

Each action linked by "therefore" or "but" indicates a "consequence or reaction to the previous action" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. This structure ensures that "every plot point matters," preventing the show from losing momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

## Impact on [[south_park_serialized_storylines | Season 20]]'s Narrative Structure

For three seasons, South Park adopted [[south_park_serialized_storylines | season-long serialization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. While [[south_park_season_19_and_serialized_storytelling | Season 19]] "brilliantly blended themes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, Season 20 encountered significant structural issues due to an unexpected outcome in the US presidential election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

The creators had anticipated a Hillary Clinton victory, planning the series around that outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. When Donald Trump (represented by Mr. Garrison) won, Stone and Parker were forced into "desperate last-minute rewrites" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>, leading the show to "start breaking the creators' core rules" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

### Breakdown of Key Season 20 Plotlines

*   **Member Berries**
    *   **Initial Structure (Pre-election):** The member berries plotline adhered to the "but/therefore" rule. Randy tries them, realizes they're "dangerous brainwashing germs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. Mr. Garrison, not wanting to win, tries to sabotage his campaign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. Randy explains the berries' influence, and they set out to destroy them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. This established a clear setup for a Hillary Clinton victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
    *   **Post-election Issues:** After Mr. Garrison's unexpected win, the plot became a "big cluster f**k of and thens" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. Garrison wins "out of nowhere" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. Member berries re-infect characters, causing them to "trip out on nostalgia" and "forget their quest" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. The berries' nature randomly shifts from "lazy intoxicating" to a "weird vomit inducing virus" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>, then to Nazis, and ultimately a "tiny fruit militia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. The show failed to offer "any justification for the member berries transformation," resulting in a "random progression of events that build without any apparent logic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.

*   **Trolling Plotline**
    *   **Initial Structure (Pre-election):** Gerald's trolling angers the Danes, who threaten to release internet history, creating panic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. Hillary Clinton, expecting to win, discovers "troll trace might leak her online activities," therefore she needs Gerald <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. This plan, where Hillary recruits Gerald to take down the Danes to protect her emails, adhered to the "but/therefore" rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.
    *   **Post-election Issues:** After Clinton loses, the "narrative structure starts to crumble" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. She "doesn't have any real reason to recruit Gerald" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>, yet confusingly recruits him anyway for a vague mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. The scene feels "disjointed, almost like it's from an alternate reality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>, likely recycled from the original plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.
    *   **Escalation of "And Then":** The plot escalates with a series of illogical "and thens": Clinton's claim is a ruse, she helps Danes kidnap trolls, then it turns out they're just trolling the trolls, and the "top Danish guy" is also just a "giant troll trolling the world for the lulz" and "not even f**king Danish" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. The writers themselves acknowledged the "narrative hole they dug for themselves" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.
    *   **Plot Resolution:** To resolve incomplete storylines, the show resorted to "plot hari-kari by blowing everything up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>, deleting internet history and destroying the cause-and-effect relationship built throughout the season <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.

### Abandoned Plotlines

Had Hillary Clinton won, [[south_park_serialized_storylines | Season 20]] would have focused on Bill Clinton's role as "terrified First Gentleman of the U.S." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>, escalating the "battle of the sexes" already underway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>. This would have added "poignancy to Cartman's newly inspired fear of his girlfriend Heidi" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>. Instead, the "First Gentleman's Club" plotline was abandoned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.

## The Future of Serialization

At the end of [[south_park_serialized_storylines | Season 20]], the creators hinted at "the end of serialization as we know it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>. While Season 20 was "messy," earlier serialized seasons like 18 and [[south_park_season_19_and_serialized_storytelling | 19]] produced "some of their best work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.

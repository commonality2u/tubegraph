For two decades, [[social_satire_in_south_park | South Park]] has consistently satirized sacred cows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. In its thirteenth season, the episode "Margaritaville" masterfully merged two of its favorite targets for ridicule: religion and consumerism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. The episode presents a multilayered argument about personal agency and the opaque nature of the economy, using clever [[religious_themes_and_criticism_in_south_park_episodes | religious allegory]] to tackle the 2008 economic crash and the mysterious economic system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## The Economy as a Deity

When the "all-powerful Economy" devastates [[cultural_and_social_critiques_in_south_park | South Park]]'s community, blame is quickly directed at various entities, including Wall Street <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Randy Marsh's bizarre perspective gains a large following in the town <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. Drawing from old-school Protestant ethics, Randy preaches that the economy is a petty, vengeful deity that must be placated through worship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

### Biblical Allegory

Randy's position reflects the fearful, punishment-oriented philosophies found in the Old Testament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. The episode leans into these biblical parallels, even showing individuals "flinging stones — I mean squirrels — by those who pass judgement on the fallen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. Randy's persecution of Kyle mimics the biblical role of the Pharisees, an influential group from the New Testament who greeted Jesus's message with skepticism, paranoia, and incitement of violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

Kyle's third-act self-sacrifice furthers the biblical parallels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. As a Christ-like figure, Kyle has dinner with his enemy, takes on all of [[cultural_and_social_critiques_in_south_park | South Park]]'s debt, and sacrifices himself for the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. His sacrifice parallels the crucifixion of Jesus; however, instead of taking on the sins of the world, Kyle shoulders the debt of [[cultural_and_social_critiques_in_south_park | South Park]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. Just as Jesus's death was mourned by Mary, Kyle's figurative "death" is mourned by his weeping mother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. The episode even states, "Kyle has died. Kyle is risen. Kyle will come again" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

Similar to the hero of the New Testament, Kyle sets forth a philosophy that challenges and chastises the accepted norms of the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. While Jesus established a religious code of conduct, Kyle proposes a financial one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

## Economic Philosophies as Faith

Kyle's philosophy, known in the real world as faith-based economics, suggests that "the economy" is us, and it should be trusted, not feared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. Since people drive the economy, Kyle argues, "we are at one with economy. Forever and ever. Amen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. "Margaritaville" effectively positions the economy as a modern religion unto itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

The conflicting arguments between Randy and Kyle demonstrate [[religious_themes_and_criticism_in_south_park_episodes | religious parallels]] and spring from interesting economic and social theories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

*   **Randy's Message**: His unforgiving message of self-discipline and self-denial aligns with the ethics described by German sociologist Max Weber in "The Protestant Ethic and The Spirit of Capitalism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. Weber argued that Protestant values of austerity and frugality were crucial for the development of modern capitalism, implying a life of constant work without leisure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
*   **Kyle's Take**: Kyle offers a contrasting view, reflected in the work of British economist John Maynard Keynes, who proposed that consumer spending is what keeps the economy "humming" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. Keynesian economics argues that economic growth requires continuous "moving that paper" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

## The Deliberate Obfuscation of Economics

[[cultural_and_social_critiques_in_south_park | South Park]] highlights that economics are often deliberately made too difficult for most people to understand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. This strategy of linguistically keeping information from everyday citizens is known as technostrategic discourse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. The episode dedicates a "B" storyline to demonstrating this in action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

### Technostrategic Discourse

For example, when Stan visits his bank, he is met with a string of jargon before his money "magically disappears without explanation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. While economics is not magic, most people do not understand its intricacies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. The subprime mortgage crisis of the late 2000s demonstrated that those "in the know" count on, and even profit from, public ignorance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

### Dispersed Power (Foucault)

French philosopher Michel Foucault argued that in the modern era, power is no longer concentrated but dispersed through complex systems like prisons, religious authorities, and, as [[cultural_and_social_critiques_in_south_park | South Park]] highlights, finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. Unlike traditional views of power, Foucault explored how individuals play tiny roles in this system, often ignorant of its complete workings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. This dispersed power is shown as Stan climbs a ladder of helpless bureaucrats, each powerless to the rules or "magic" of the system they participate in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. Experts sustain and amplify power by exploiting confusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

Stan's journey to return his "Margaritaville" machine leads him from Sur le Table to the finance company, then to Wall Street, and finally to the Treasury Department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. What Stan discovers is that "no one is really in charge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. The amorphous abstraction of money means its source—and, with it, the source of power—never seems to be anywhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.

The result of this technocratic babble, according to [[cultural_and_social_critiques_in_south_park | South Park]], is that the consumer is exhausted into submission, either willfully submitting to technocrats or reacting in frustration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

## The Call for Personal Responsibility

In matters both religious and economic, "Margaritaville" challenges the seemingly distant and unknowable forces that govern our lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. If money isn't real, if the powerful deliberately complicate things to retain power, and if answers aren't found with experts or the divine, [[cultural_and_social_critiques_in_south_park | South Park]] suggests we look inward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.

The answer may be found in Jimmy Buffett's song "Margaritaville," where a drunk man laments a failed relationship but gradually realizes his own drinking problem contributed to his failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. This highlights the theme of personal responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

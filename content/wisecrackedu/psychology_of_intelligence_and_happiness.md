This article explores the relationship between intelligence and happiness, using the characters of Rick Sanchez and Jerry Smith from *Rick and Morty* as a case study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. The central question is whether high intelligence, like Rick's, inevitably leads to misery, and conversely, whether a lower intelligence, akin to Jerry's, might lead to a "fool's paradise" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## The Tortured Genius Stereotype

Nineteenth-century author Fyodor Dostoevsky famously posited in *The Idiot*: “It is better to be unhappy and know the worst, than to be happy in a fool’s paradise” <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. This statement is seen as apt for the dynamic between Rick and Jerry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Rick's despondency stems from his knowledge that "nothing matters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>, while Jerry often exists in situations that could be described as a "fool's paradise," such as Jerryboree or the Shymaliens simulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

Rick, despite being the smartest man in the universe, is relatable due to his self-loathing and self-destructive behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. He is practically omnipotent, able to invent, transform, and destroy to get what he wants, yet he remains miserable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. His famous catchphrase, "wubbalubbadubdub," translates to "I am in great pain, please help me" in his people's tongue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>, and he even attempts suicide in season 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

The stereotype of the tortured genius is prevalent in pop culture, raising questions about whether it is an overblown Hollywood trope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. While many famous historical figures suffered from depression, and media often highlights a link between brilliance and "madness," there are also many brilliant individuals who do not suffer from mental illness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

## [[impact_of_intelligence_on_mental_health | Impact of Intelligence on Mental Health]]

Some research suggests a correlation between high intelligence and a propensity for misery or depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

### Mensa Study Findings

A 2017 study by Dr. Ruth Karpinski asked 3,700 Mensa members if they were currently dealing with mental illness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. More than one-third reported being depressed, which is five times the national average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. For every 100 Mensa members, over 30 would likely report depression, compared to 6-7 regular people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. It's noted that this study relied on self-reported well-being, and roughly 10% of those reporting depression had not been diagnosed by a doctor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

### "Hyper Brains" and "Overexcitability"

Karpinski asserted that people with IQs of 130-plus have "hyper brains," meaning they can comprehend the world's problems, uncertainties, and possibilities more easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. This concept builds on the work of psychiatrist Dr. Kazimierz Dabrowski, who observed that his exceptionally smart patients tended to overly contemplate everything, especially negative aspects, and sometimes experienced deeper depression than intellectually average individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

Dabrowski termed these traits "overexcitability," which he viewed positively as predictive of achieving one's ideal self <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. In 1972, he wrote: "One who manifests several forms of overexcitability sees reality in a different, stronger and more excitable manner" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

Overexcitabilities come in five forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>:
1.  Excessive energy or nervousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.
2.  Deep appreciation for things like art or music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.
3.  Being extremely curious or having an active mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.
4.  Having a vivid imagination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.
5.  Extreme and complex emotional experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

Rick Sanchez is considered a textbook example of all these traits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

### [[existential_depression_and_intelligence | Existential Depression and Intelligence]]

Some psychologists believe that people with these "hyper brain" characteristics are more prone to [[existential_depression_and_intelligence | existential depression]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. This refers to feelings of hopelessness arising from questioning life's ultimate meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

Dr. James Webb, a psychologist who studies gifted children, notes that while [[existential_depression_and_intelligence | existential depression]] can occur after a crisis for anyone, it is more likely to happen spontaneously in people with above-average intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. Rick's statements often come close to expressing this burden of a futile existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

> "Am I evil?" "Worse. You’re smart. When you know nothing matters, the universe is yours. And I’ve never met a universe that was into it. The universe is basically an animal. It grazes on the ordinary. It creates infinite idiots just to eat them, not unlike your friend Timmy." "Tommy." "Yeah, it hardly matters now, sweetie. You know, smart people get a chance to climb on top, take reality for a ride, but it’ll never stop trying to throw you. And, eventually, it will. There’s no other way off." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>

Rick is also perpetually bored by the mundane world, finding temporary relief only through his portal gun-aided adventures and alcohol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.

## The "Fool's Paradise" - Jerry's Case

In contrast, Jerry possesses none of the traits associated with a "hyper brain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. He operates best when he doesn't have to think too much, as overthinking generally leads to worse outcomes for him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. Even in difficult situations, Jerry does not appear to suffer to the same degree as Rick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. He doesn't struggle with substance abuse or question his place in the universe, and his "bar for happiness seems… low" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

However, despite his relative lack of intellectual struggles, the answer to whether Jerry is inherently happier is "Nope. But - it’s complicated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

## [[the_correlation_between_iq_wealth_and_happiness | The Correlation Between IQ, Wealth, and Happiness]]

While some studies suggest a link between intelligence and depression, others indicate that intelligence can open doors to a healthier and sometimes happier life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

### Intelligence, Wealth, and Health

Most studies on IQ and depression point out that higher intelligence is associated with greater wealth and, consequently, better health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. This correlation can be complex, as well-off families are also more likely to have their children tested for IQ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. Nevertheless, the link between achievement, money, and intelligence challenges the idea that genius equals misery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. Some studies have found a positive correlation between higher IQ and greater happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. For example, a UK study of over 6,800 people found that IQ was positively correlated with self-reported happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

### Social Isolation and "Crisis of Self"

Highly intelligent individuals, like Rick, are often characterized by eccentricity and intensity, which can overwhelm others and lead to social isolation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. Attempting to conform to societal norms may require minimizing this intensity, potentially resulting in a "crisis of self" where individuals feel lost about their true identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. Rick's perpetual "crisis of self" is evident in his struggles with family relationships and his disdain for mundane activities like therapy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

> “I have no doubt that you would be bored senseless by therapy the same way I’m bored when I brush my teeth and wipe my tush. Because the thing about repairing, maintaining and cleaning is...it’s not an adventure.” <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>

Jerry also struggles with fitting in, lacking social, survival, and general skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. He is so incompetent that he often relies on pity from others to survive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. Rick asserts that he survives because he knows everything, while Jerry survives because people feel sorry for him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

## Conclusion

In summary, some research suggests that the "hyper brains" of highly intelligent people make them more prone to depression due to their intense perception of the world, which can lead to social isolation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. However, their intelligence can also lead to higher-paying jobs and better healthcare, potentially contributing to greater overall happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.

The question of whether it's better to be unhappy and "know the worst" (a Rick) or to be happy in a "fool’s paradise" (a Jerry) is subjective, and psychology does not offer a concrete answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. However, limited evidence suggests that while one might be less prone to [[existential_depression_and_intelligence | existential depression]] as a Jerry, a Rick is more likely to live a better life overall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.

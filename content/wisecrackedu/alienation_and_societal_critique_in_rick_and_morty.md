Season 3, Episode 7 of *Rick and Morty*, "The Ricklantis Mixup" (also known as "Tales from the Citadel"), presents a dense and dismal political world within less than half an hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The episode offers a commentary on modern politics, particularly focusing on hope, resistance, and revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## World-Building and Political Commentary

The episode delves into the Citadel of Ricks as it rebuilds following the events of "The Rickshank Redemption" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. Democratic elections are held after the dissolution of the Council of Ricks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>. The world-building in this episode effectively mirrors contemporary political climates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:02">[02:02:02]</a>, featuring:
*   A news organization (CNNN) that trivializes dissent to maintain the status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>.
*   An inner city ravaged by drugs and guns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>.
*   A "Hogwarts" institution that teaches disenfranchised Mortys to accept their predetermined societal roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.

## Themes of Alienation and Disillusionment

"The Ricklantis Mixup" builds on themes of [[modern_alienation_in_rick_and_morty | alienation]], where modern society isolates individuals from their environment and peers, leading to a sense of emotional detachment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>. Various subplots within the episode illustrate this:
*   Evil Morty rises to power on a platform of unity and change, only to reveal totalitarian intentions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>.
*   An idealistic police Rick is forced to abandon his ideals when confronted with corruption within the Citadel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>.
*   A group of orphaned Mortys embark on an adventure, only to see their hopes and dreams discarded into a literal trash dump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>.
*   A Rick working an assembly line revolts after being passed over for a promotion, but his triumph is swiftly undermined by the established powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>.

In each scenario, political or personal optimism for change is crushed by a "cruel and indifferent reality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>. Even the "smartest man in the universe" is shown in multiple versions reduced to the "drudgery of modern life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>.

## Class Struggle and Systemic Control

The episode highlights a deeply divided society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a>. While initially presenting a divide between Ricks and Mortys, Evil Morty suggests this is a distraction, revealing the true split as between "the Rich vs. The Working Class" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>. This [[depiction_of_class_struggle_in_rick_and_morty | class struggle]] is further emphasized by the fact that despite Ricks forming the apparent ruling class, all Ricks and Mortys are victims of [[modern_alienation_in_rick_and_morty | alienation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>. They are stripped of their uniqueness and reduced to mere workers in various systems, such as the "assembly line of justice" for the police <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>.

### The "Simple Rick" Metaphor

The episode presents a powerful metaphor for systemic control through "Simple Rick." Simple Rick's brain secretions, stemming from his happiest memory of his daughter, are used to create "Simple Rick's Simple Wafers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:00">[05:18:00]</a>. This concept raises a philosophical question: "Is our escape from the [[modern_alienation_in_rick_and_morty | alienation]] of modern life just strengthening the foundations of the system that drives that [[modern_alienation_in_rick_and_morty | alienation]]?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>

The "Ron Swanson" trope, or the idea of escaping the fast-paced world by slowing down, working with hands, and spending time with family, is explored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>. However, this "simple life" escape, whether through nature, family, or trade, is argued to be not a retreat from the system, but an essential part of its functioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:34:00">[06:34:00]</a>. The "Simple Rick wafers" brand embodies a fantasy that reinforces the system:
*   Ricks continue to work because they believe they can "unplug" from the system using a commodity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>.
*   This "unplugging" requires money earned through the very assembly line from which they seek respite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:00">[07:00:00]</a>.
*   The fantasy of unplugging, according to sociologist George Ritzer, further entrenches individuals in the system they wish to escape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a>.

Even rebellion is commodified. When a Rick attempts a true act of rebellion by killing his boss and trying to escape, his rebellion is distilled into "simple rick freedom wafer selects" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:00">[07:38:00]</a>. This means the joy of rebellion is endlessly consumed, and freedom from the system becomes a new form of entrapment within it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:59:00">[07:59:00]</a>.

## The Illusion of Making a Difference

The episode's darkest message suggests that in a terrifying political reality, the best one can hope for is the "illusion of making a difference" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:00">[08:21:00]</a>. The subplot of the orphan Mortys illustrates this:
*   They go on an adventure to escape their grim existence and future servitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:34:00">[08:34:00]</a>.
*   Their "wish portal" turns out to be a garbage portal, signifying that the system turns wishes into literal trash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:00">[08:41:00]</a>.
*   Slick Morty's sacrifice for a better world appears to succeed briefly, but this change is revealed to be a ploy by Evil Morty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:00">[08:47:00]</a>.
*   The children's actions ultimately have no bearing on the overall narrative, serving only to highlight the naive idea that their sacrifice could have changed something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:08:00">[09:08:00]</a>. They are left to believe their actions mattered, much like the revolting Rick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:00">[09:14:00]</a>.

Evil Morty, despite selling a form of [[depiction_of_class_struggle_in_rick_and_morty | class consciousness]] to unite Ricks and Mortys against the ruling elite, ultimately uses this as "lip service" for his own totalitarian ascent to power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:21:00">[09:21:00]</a>. The episode thus offers a cynical outlook on the possibility of real progress.

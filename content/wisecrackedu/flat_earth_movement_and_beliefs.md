The Flat Earth movement consists of a growing number of people committed to proving that the Earth is flat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. While the debate over the Earth's shape was concluded centuries ago, the Flat Earth movement has gained increasing attention and ridicule on YouTube and social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. The phenomenon speaks to a broader societal issue: a "crisis of knowing shit," characterized by rapidly eroding trust in experts like scientists, physicians, and government agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Core Beliefs and Models

Flat Earth theories vary in their specific beliefs, covering aspects like whether the Earth is a dome or an infinite plane, the distance of the sun, and the cause of eclipses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. However, they are unified by the belief that the idea of a spherical Earth is deliberate misinformation propagated by shadowy agents, including NASA and world governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

One prominent model, featured in the Netflix documentary "Behind the Curve," posits that the Earth is a flat plane enclosed by a dome called a "firmament" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. This concept dates back at least to the Biblical story of Genesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. In this model, the sun travels in circles thousands of miles above the Earth, not millions, and, along with the moon, acts more like a flashlight illuminating part of the globe rather than a large ball of fire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

Common questions Flat Earthers pose include:
*   Why don't planes go to or pass Antarctica? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>
*   Why haven't oil companies set up operations in Antarctica? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>
*   Why are there only composite images of the Earth, and not whole images? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>

Despite common perceptions, "Behind the Curve" shows that Flat Earthers can be smart, critical individuals who state they became Flat Earthers by trying to debunk the theory themselves, and believe the scientific method is the best way to find truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

## Misunderstanding the Philosophy of Science

The rise of Flat Earth beliefs highlights a larger problem: a poor public understanding of how science works, specifically the philosophy of science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. The philosophy of science asks fundamental questions such as how to distinguish science from non-science, how to weigh evidence, and what kind of evidence is acceptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. A general ignorance of these principles allows for the misuse of scientific language, as seen in the Flat Earth movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

### Verificationism

In the early 1900s, logical positivists proposed **verificationism**, which posited that science is something that can be verified; if it cannot, it is not science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. For example, the statement "this swan is white" can be verified through observation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. Flat Earthers may allude to this idea by suggesting that one must go to space to "verify" the Earth is round <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.

However, verificationism faces a significant problem with universal statements like "all swans are white." Even after observing thousands of white swans, one can never truly verify such a statement universally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. This was famously disproven by the discovery of black swans in Australia in the 1690s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. Applying this doctrine rigorously would be limiting, as it would require individual verification of all phenomena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

### Falsificationism

Philosopher Karl Popper proposed **falsificationism** as a solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. For Popper, good science involves formulating a hypothesis and then diligently trying to prove it wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. If a statement cannot theoretically be falsified, it is not science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. According to this, if an experiment designed to prove the Earth is not flat yields contrary results, the hypothesis of a flat Earth should be abandoned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. It's important to note that proving the Earth is *not* flat does not automatically prove it is round, nor vice-versa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

Flat Earthers claim to "test everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. However, their application of falsificationism is flawed in two ways:
1.  **Bad Evidence**: Their evidence is often flawed. For example, the Bedford Level Experiment, a "darling experiment for Flat Earthers," failed to account for atmospheric refraction, a confounding variable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. When re-tested with controls for refraction, evidence for a round Earth was found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.
2.  **Not Proving Their Own Theory Wrong**: A core aspect of falsification is attempting to prove *one's own* theory wrong, not merely disproving someone else's to prove oneself right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. In "Behind the Curve," experiments conducted by Flat Earthers (like a laser gyroscope showing a 15Â° per hour drift or a flashlight experiment) yielded results that suggested the Earth is not flat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. However, instead of abandoning their hypothesis, they rationalized the results (e.g., claiming "heavenly energies" interfered with data) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. This resistance to falsification, where no evidence would cause them to renounce their theory, is common in "woo-woo" movements like anti-vaxxers and creationists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.

### Paradigms

Physicist Thomas Kuhn offered another understanding of science, working in **paradigms** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>. Theories and tests do not exist in vacuums but within larger systematized theories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. Kuhn argued that scientific paradigms are not abandoned simply because of contradictory evidence, but only when a "bigger, badder paradigm" emerges that can explain everything the old one could, plus the anomalies (e.g., Einstein's relativity explaining Mercury's orbit where Newton's physics failed) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. Scientists often "tweak" a model to accommodate anomalies before a full paradigm shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.

Flat Earthers, in a perverse way, mirror this "tweaking" by inventing explanations like "heavenly energies" to explain away contradictory evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. However, these "tweaks" are not subjected to further experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>. Unlike a true scientific paradigm shift, the Flat Earth model cannot account for, or help build, technologies predicated on a round Earth, such as long bridges, GPS, airplane navigation, or satellite TV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>.

## "Just Asking Questions" (JAQing off)

A widespread tactic in modern internet debates, including the Flat Earth movement, is "Just Asking Questions," or "JAQing off" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>. This involves rapidly posing numerous questions, often with simple answers, to shift the burden of proof onto the other party and sow doubt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>.

For example, the question "Why aren't oil companies drilling in Antarctica?" can be answered by explaining the 1959 treaty that opened Antarctica to discovery and the 1991 treaty explicitly banning commercial activity for 50 years to preserve the environment, alongside the extreme cost and danger of extraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>. Similarly, questions about flight patterns can be explained by the distortion of projecting a sphere onto a flat map, or practical reasons like efficiency and demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>.

While science is built on asking questions, these questions are meant to initiate conversations that build consensus, not to "win" a debate by drawing doubt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>. Unanswered questions can make it appear that someone is wrong or hiding something, making this tactic appealing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>.

## Societal Implications and Impact

The Flat Earth movement, along with other conspiracy theories, highlights a broader [[impact_of_conspiracy_theories_on_society | crisis of trust]] and [[exploration_of_human_beliefs_and_perception | erosion of faith in expertise]] in modern society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>. Some psychologists suggest that conspiracy theories appeal to people who feel powerless or insignificant, offering a sense of control and predictability in a chaotic world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>. For Flat Earthers, it offers the appealing notion that humanity is not a tiny blue marble but a special terrarium at the center of the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>.

This conspiratorial thinking is not harmless. It can lead to severe consequences, from claiming individuals work for the CIA based on trivial details, to sending death threats to perceived "crisis actors," and contributing to the resurgence of almost extinct diseases due to skepticism about vaccines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>.

Instead of ridiculing Flat Earthers, it is crucial to understand how science operates, how scientific consensus is formed, and to be critical of when science is conducted poorly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>. This means understanding how experiments are designed, the confidence levels of predictions, and how contrary evidence impacts models, particularly in complex fields like quantum physics or climate science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>.

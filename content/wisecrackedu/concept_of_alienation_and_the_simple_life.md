Season 3 episode 7 of *Rick and Morty*, "The Ricklantis Mixup," is described as one of the "darkest and DENSEST of the season" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This episode delves into [[modern_life_and_alienation_in_rick_and_morty | alienation]] and the concept of the "simple life" as a response to it, questioning whether this escape merely reinforces the system it seeks to flee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>.

## Alienation in the Citadel of Ricks

The episode paints a "complex, and utterly dismal political world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a> within the Citadel of Ricks, which serves as an [[allegory_of_class_struggle_and_modern_society | interesting picture of modern politics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This world reflects various facets of contemporary society:
*   A news organization trivializing dissent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
*   An inner city ravaged by drugs and guns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
*   An educational institution (a "Hogwarts") teaching the disenfranchised to accept their fate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

The episode demonstrates how "any kind of political or personal optimism for change" is "crushed by a cruel and indifferent reality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. This directly builds on the theme of [[modern_life_and_alienation_in_rick_and_morty | alienation]], defined as "the way modern society estranges us from the world and our peers, making us all dead inside" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>. While the earlier episode "Rickmancing the Stone" showed how creature comforts could turn an exciting apocalypse into a domestic nightmare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>, "The Ricklantis Mixup" displays many versions of the "smartest man in the universe reduced to the drudgery of modern life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>.

Despite an apparent ruling class of Ricks, everyone on the Citadel is depicted as a victim of [[modern_life_and_alienation_in_rick_and_morty | alienation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>. Ricks feel stripped of their uniqueness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>, and even the police are likened to "workers on the assembly line of justice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>. Ricks are victims not only of powerful individuals but also of "an impenetrable system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>.

## The "Simple Life" and its Commodified Form

The episode introduces "Simple Rick," a Rick who "realized long ago that the greatest thing he'd ever create was his daughter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:00">[05:18:00]</a>. This realization represents what the speaker calls the "Ron Swanson trope" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>: a desire to slow down, work with one's hands, and spend time with family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>, as a respite from the "fast-paced world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>. This includes [[the_theme_of_isolation_and_seeking_authenticity | running away from urban clamor]], [[the_theme_of_isolation_and_seeking_authenticity | living off the land]], [[the_theme_of_isolation_and_seeking_authenticity | learning a trade]], and [[the_theme_of_isolation_and_seeking_authenticity | reconnecting with family]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:00">[06:14:00]</a>. Such ideas gained traction during industrialization, leading to movements like the Boy Scouts and national parks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>.

However, the episode reveals a darker truth: Simple Rick's moment of completion is captured, put "on a loop," and its "chemical" essence is used to create "Simple Rick Simple Wafers Wafer Cookie," marketed with the slogan "Come home to the impossible flavor of your own completion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>. This illustrates a critical question: "Is our escape from the [[modern_life_and_alienation_in_rick_and_morty | alienation of modern life]] just strengthening the foundations of the system that drives that alienation?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>.

The "Simple Rick wafers" brand embodies a fantasy that reinforces the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:45:00">[06:45:00]</a>. Ricks are able to endure their work because they believe they can "unplug from the system with the distilled essence of simplicity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>. Yet, this "unplugging" comes in a commodity form, requiring money earned through the very assembly line work it seeks to escape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:00">[06:55:00]</a>.

Sociologist George Ritzer's perspective is invoked, suggesting that enchantment with and disenchantment from the modern world are not easily distinguished and exist in a "reciprocal relation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a>. This means the fantasy of unplugging, through products like Simple Rick Wafers, "further entrenches you in the very system you want to unplug from" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a>.

## Rebellion and its Commodification

The episode further darkens this concept when a Rick, fed up with his life, rebels by killing his boss and attempting to "ACTUALLY escape the system" with a portal gun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:00">[07:38:00]</a>. However, his act of rebellion is quickly commodified into "Simple Rick Freedom Wafer Selects," advertised as "the unique flavor of shattering the grand illusion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:00">[07:47:00]</a>. His joy of rebellion is endlessly replayed and distilled into a consumable form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:59:00">[07:59:00]</a>. This highlights that "Freedom from the system entraps you in the system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05:00">[08:05:00]</a>.

Ritzer's idea that "Fantasies draw people into the new means of consumption, and those fantasies can be rationalized in order to further draw people in" perfectly encapsulates this grim reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a>. The episode's message is that in this terrifying political reality, "the best we can hope for is the illusion of making a difference" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:00">[08:21:00]</a>, aligning with themes explored in [[the_philosophy_of_nihilism_and_existentialism | nihilism and existentialism]]. The subplot of the orphan Mortys, whose wish portal turns out to be a garbage portal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:34:00">[08:34:00]</a>, reinforces this, showing how the system turns wishes into "literal trash" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:00">[08:41:00]</a>. Their belief that their sacrifice changed something is portrayed as naive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:08:00">[09:08:00]</a>, because "Nothing they did mattered, but they get to believe it did" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:00">[09:14:00]</a>.

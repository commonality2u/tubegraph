*Rick and Morty* is a show rich with references to science fiction, horror, and fantasy, using them for throwaway jokes, simple homage, and thought-provoking insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. By inverting common clichés and tropes, the series offers a smart and beloved take on these genres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Inverting the "Deal with the Devil" Trope

In the episode “Something Ricked This Way Comes,” *Rick and Morty* subverts the classic "deal with the devil" narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

*   The episode title itself is a nod to Ray Bradbury’s novel *Something Wicked This Way Comes*, which features a magical carnival and deals with creepy strangers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   The Devil’s shop of oddities in *Rick and Morty* is named "Needful Things," a direct reference to Stephen King’s novel where people are tricked into buying items at a low cost in exchange for pranks that throw a town into civil war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. In the show, the items are free but creatively ruin the desired benefit, such as a microscope that makes Rick too stupid to use it or an aftershave that attracts women but causes impotence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

Traditional "deal with the devil" stories reflect hidden consequences for selfish desires that thwart the natural order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. *Rick and Morty* dismisses this moral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. Rick demonstrates that with science, anything is possible without mystical repercussions or selling one's soul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Science demystifies religion, magic, and miracles, turning the "deal with the devil" into a "paranoid fairy tale" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. Rick's scientific prowess renders the devil obsolete, suggesting that "evil" and "karmic retribution" are less horrifying than pure, disinterested science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

## Critiquing Conformity in "Auto Erotic Assimilation"

In “Auto Erotic Assimilation,” *Rick and Morty* uses popular fears of conformity to explore Rick’s inner psyche and critique basic values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

*   Rick's ex-girlfriend, Unity, is a hive-mind collective that assimilates alien races <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. This is a direct reference to the 1956 film *Invasion of the Body Snatchers*, a science fiction trope about aliens replacing people with emotionless replicas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. *Invasion of the Body Snatchers* was often interpreted as a commentary on the threat of the Soviet Union and the loss of individualism under Communism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
*   *Rick and Morty* inverts this by showing that individual freedom can be problematic, as Unity’s assimilated subjects recall lives as sex offenders and drug addicts, and their liberation sparks a "nipple-driven race war" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. The show highlights the "very-not-fictional horrors of our own freedoms" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>, offering a [[modern_alienation_in_rick_and_morty | modern alienation]] critique.
*   This tension between individual freedom and collective existence develops Rick’s character, as his rampant egotism impedes his relationships, including destroying Unity’s society and making Unity lose her sense of self <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.
*   As an additional reference, the TV show viewed in the episode is a recreation of *Community*, Dan Harmon’s previous show, with its main character Jeff Winger sharing parallels with Rick as an egotistical individual struggling with relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

## God and Atheism in "Raising Gazorpazorp"

The episode “Raising Gazorpazorp” prominently features references to the 1974 film *Zardoz* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

*   *Zardoz* is known for its imagery, including a giant floating head vomiting guns and declaring, “The gun is good, the penis is evil” <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. The film's plot involves a chosen savage discovering his giant-floating-head-god is a lie designed to enslave savages for immortal aristocrats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.
*   *Raising Gazorpazorp* adapts this plot, replacing the conflict between immortals and savages with one between men and women, while retaining the "penis is evil" theme, all instigated by Morty wanting a sex doll <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.
*   The *Zardoz* reference reinforces a general theme of atheism in *Rick and Morty*, which suggests that either there is no God, or that God is not all that great <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

## Animal Rebellion and "Dogworld" in "Lawnmower Dog"

The episode “Lawnmower Dog” draws from various sources, particularly around themes of animal intelligence and rebellion.

*   Its title references the 1992 film *Lawnmower Man*, where a gardener becomes a genius through scientific experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. In *Lawnmower Dog*, Rick's attempt to make Snuffles intelligent enough to stop peeing on the rug accidentally leads to Snuffles subjugating the human race <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.
*   Snuffles rejects his "slave name" for "Snowball," a direct reference to the pig and Leon Trotsky analogue from George Orwell’s *Animal Farm* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. The interspecies war that ensues in *Rick and Morty* mirrors the animals' rebellion against human masters in *Animal Farm* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. While *Animal Farm*'s animals rebel against exploitation, Snuffles rebels against the "lazy life of pethood" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.
*   The episode includes a reference to *Inception*, which helps avert a dystopian nightmare when Snowball realizes he is becoming like the humans he hated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.
*   The episode also makes references to “Dogworld,” a series concept by show co-creator Justin Roiland, featuring a family transported to a dog-run alternate dimension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.

## Deconstructing Fantasy and Horror

A central theme in *Rick and Morty* is disillusionment, often achieved by deconstructing mysticism with hard science or subjecting fantasies to the mundanity of everyday life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.

*   **"Meeseeks and Destroy"**: Morty's cliché fairytale adventure to help a poor village by enacting a *Jack and the Beanstalk* story is "normalized" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. Instead of a "happily ever after," Morty faces a trial for senseless murder and confronts the giant's emotionally devastated widow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. The village's king is also revealed to be a sexual predator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.
*   **Scary Terry**: A "legally safe knockoff" of Freddy Krueger from *A Nightmare on Elm Street* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. Despite his terrifying abilities, Scary Terry's life is utterly banal, demystifying the horror icon by showing him with a "shitty home life" and "lame dreams" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>.
*   **"Anatomy Park"**: References both *Jurassic Park* and *Fantastic Voyage* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. While movies like *Fantastic Voyage* portray the human body as a natural wonder, *Rick and Morty* presents it as a "gonorrhea infested nightmare" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.

*Rick and Morty*'s humor often stems from robbing fantasy of its magic and trivializing everything, from fairy tales to family, love, and life itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.

Rian Johnson, the director of *The Last Jedi*, made creative decisions that significantly impacted the *Star Wars* franchise and its fanbase, contributing to what some observers describe as a "crisis in the Star Wars Universe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Johnson's approach was characterized by [[rian_johnsons_approach_to_revolutionizing_star_wars | subverting the canon]] and "killing the past" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>, prioritizing the story of his film over established fan expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>.

## Key Creative Decisions and Subversions

Johnson's notable creative choices in *The Last Jedi* include:
*   **Rey's Parentage** Instead of revealing Rey's parents to be prominent figures like Skywalkers or Kenobis, they were depicted as "nobodies," despite prior "mystery box teasing" in *The Force Awakens* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>.
*   **Snoke's Fate** The character of Snoke, whose backstory and origins were a subject of much fan speculation, met an "unceremonious death" without a "storied rise" or a reveal of his identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>.
*   **Luke Skywalker's Portrayal** The character of Luke Skywalker, previously seen as a "wholesome hero" who found light in villains, was shown throwing lightsabers off cliffs and almost killing his child nephew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>. This portrayal "just didnâ€™t seem right" to many fans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>.

## [[fan_reaction_to_the_last_jedi | Fan Backlash and Criticism]]

These decisions ignited a significant wave of [[star_wars_fan_backlash_and_criticism | Star Wars fan backlash and criticism]]:
*   Some fans responded by issuing an anti-Disney manifesto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.
*   An actress involved with the film was "run off Instagram" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.
*   Crowdfunding efforts were initiated for a remake of the film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.
*   Some fans claimed credit for *Solo*'s failure at the box office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
*   There were even rumors that Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy's potential retirement was influenced by Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Broader Implications: [[philosophical_insights_into_the_star_wars_legitimation_crisis | Legitimation Crisis]]

The creative direction taken in *The Last Jedi* contributed to a "legitimation crisis" within the *Star Wars* system, a concept described by political philosopher Jurgen Habermas as an "existential crisis that threatens the foundation of a social system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>.
*   The film changed "many of the agreed upon values, meanings, and truths of the Star Wars system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:00">[07:22:00]</a>.
*   This shift, coupled with [[disneys_acquisition_and_changes_to_star_wars_canon | Disney's acquisition of Lucasfilm]] and subsequent decanonization of various extended universe materials (radio dramas, video games, comics, spin-off novels) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>, led fans to feel betrayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>.
*   The system, once a cohesive "lifeworld" with shared practices, beliefs, and values established by George Lucas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>, faced questions about its new authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>.
*   This crisis is exacerbated by the age of [[impact_of_prosumerism_on_star_wars_fandom | prosumerism]], where fans are not just consumers but also producers of media and meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:36:00">[08:36:00]</a>, leading to widespread online criticism and differing interpretations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29:00">[08:29:00]</a>.

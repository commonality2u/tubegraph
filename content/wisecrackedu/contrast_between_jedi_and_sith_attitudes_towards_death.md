The *Star Wars* saga, particularly through the character of Darth Vader, delves into two distinct [[philosophical_responses_to_death_in_star_wars | philosophical responses to death]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. The journey of Anakin Skywalker to the Dark Lord of the Sith, Darth Vader, is fundamentally driven by an all-consuming [[darth_vaders_fear_of_death | fear of death]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>, showcasing the stark contrast between the Jedi and Sith approaches to mortality.

## Anakin Skywalker and the Fear of Loss

The core of Anakin Skywalker's transformation into Darth Vader is fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>, specifically the fear of death and loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. Cultural anthropologist Ernest Becker, in his 1973 book *The Denial of Death*, posits that much of human behavior is a way of managing the fear of one's own demise and the demise of loved ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. This anxiety, known as **death denial**, is profoundly evident in Anakin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

From his childhood, Anakin's distress over his mother’s mortality becomes a haunting fixation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. Yoda recognizes this fear as a significant problem early on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

### Jedi Concerns and [[jedi_training_and_the_concept_of_death_denial | Death Denial]]

The Jedi's hesitation to train Anakin due to his age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>, though not explicitly canon, can be interpreted as a concern regarding death denial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. Training young children makes it easier to indoctrinate them not to fear death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. Children typically understand death as permanent around ages 5-9, but only later, around age 10, do they realize its universality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:03:13]</a>. Anakin, at 9, was on the cusp of understanding his own mortality, making him more susceptible to this fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:19]</a>.

Becker argues that human violence is a natural response to death denial, providing an illusion of control over mortality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:45]</a>. Anakin's slaughter of the Tusken Raiders after his mother's death exemplifies this, as killing others gives him a sense of ownership over death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:37]</a>.

## The Jedi Way: Nonattachment and Acceptance

When confronted with his anxiety dreams about Padmé's death in childbirth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:47]</a>, Anakin seeks guidance from Yoda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:05]</a>. Yoda's advice is clear: "Train yourself to let go of everything you fear to lose" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

This approach aligns with Buddhist philosophy, specifically the concept of *jaramarana*—the desire to escape old age and death—as a dangerously seductive human impulse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:26]</a>. **Nonattachment**, or letting go of desires, is presented as the only way to defeat it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:34]</a>.

### Yoda: A Knight of Faith

Yoda perfectly embodies this philosophy, facing his own death in *Return of the Jedi* with profound calm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:40]</a>. Becker would call Yoda a "knight of faith," a term from existentialist Søren Kierkegaard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:55]</a>. Authentic faith in something more powerful than death—for Yoda, the light side of the Force—is a way to manage terror <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:06:09]</a>.

> "Death is a natural part of life. Rejoice for those around you who transform into the force." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:15]</a>

This type of faith is "a matter of grace and not of human effort" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:23]</a>.

### Transcending Death: The Force Ghost

The Jedi learn to transcend death, not conquer it in a traditional sense, by becoming Force ghosts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:18]</a>. This path to immortality, learned by Qui-Gon Jinn and taught to Obi-Wan and Yoda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:09:06]</a>, allows them to interact with living Jedi, showcasing acceptance rather than denial of physical death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:24]</a>.

## The Sith Way: Conquering and Control

Anakin, lacking Yoda's faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:26]</a>, turns to Palpatine. The Sith approach is to embrace desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:31]</a>, particularly the desire to prevent death—a direct manifestation of death denial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:36]</a>.

Palpatine tempts Anakin with the legend of Darth Plagueis the Wise, who could save others from death through the dark side of the Force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:48]</a>.

> "Is it possible to learn this power?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>
> "Not from a jedi." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>

Anakin's condition for becoming a Sith Lord is to save Padmé's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:07]</a>. In doing so, he sacrifices his identity, loyalty, and conscience, refusing to accept death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:15]</a>.

### The Terminal Point of Death Denial

This path leads Anakin to kill children, his wife, and attempt to kill his mentor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:22]</a>. Becker describes this as the "terminal point of death denial": "the person seeks to avoid death, but he does it by killing off so much of himself... that he is actually isolating and diminishing himself and becomes as though dead" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:43]</a>. Darth Vader becomes an instrument of power, with nothing left to protect from death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:50]</a>.

## Contrasting Confrontations with Death

The differing attitudes toward death are further highlighted by the contrasting confrontations of Anakin/Vader and Luke/Obi-Wan.

*   **Anakin's Rage**: Anakin's most telling confrontation with death was his indiscriminate slaughter of the Tusken Raiders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:39]</a>, ultimately leading to Padmé's death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:42]</a>. His violence stems from his inability to cope with loss.
*   **Obi-Wan's Sacrifice**: Obi-Wan's self-sacrifice during his duel with Vader on the Death Star shows a Jedi confronting Anakin's ill-fated choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:08:07]</a>. By willingly embracing death, Obi-Wan demonstrates an alternative to Vader's death denial, becoming "more powerful than you could possibly imagine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:47]</a>.
*   **Luke's Acceptance**: Luke, in contrast to his father, is willing to sacrifice his own life to avoid turning to the dark side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:55]</a>. His refusal to kill Vader, even when ordered by Darth Sidious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:04]</a>, epitomizes the Jedi's willingness to accept death, a key differentiator from the Sith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:07]</a>.

It is only when Anakin follows his son's example and renounces his own life that he embraces the reality of death and conquers *jaramarana* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:17]</a>.

Ultimately, *Star Wars* suggests that while death denial can rot personalities and drive individuals to terrible acts, leading to violence and control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:46]</a>, accepting the reality of death can build courage, expand compassion, and restore dignity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:56]</a>.

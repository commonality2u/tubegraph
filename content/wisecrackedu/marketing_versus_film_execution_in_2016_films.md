While many films in 2016 proved underwhelming, *Suicide Squad* stands out as a "unique disaster" in terms of its execution, heavily influenced by its marketing campaign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## The Case of Suicide Squad

Warner Bros. perceived the trailer for *Suicide Squad* to be significantly better than the actual movie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This led to an unprecedented decision: hiring the trailer company to effectively rewrite the film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. The result is evident in the film's opening sequence, where the first 30 minutes resemble a music video saturated with "too much neon exposition," a direct consequence of the marketing team's influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

> The original trailer for *Suicide Squad* was considered "pretty awesome" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. However, the subsequent re-editing meant the movie was "hacked to shit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>, leading to a final cut that lacked the thematic depth hinted at in earlier versions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.

Despite its flawed execution, *Suicide Squad* was an ambitious film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. The extensive changes, however, resulted in a finished product that struggled to develop its intended themes, such as control, and ultimately undermined its potential for insightful commentary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

From: [[wisecrackedu]] <br/> 

Grand Theft Auto V has been described in various ways, from satire to social commentary and sarcasm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Beyond these, the game also employs a form of metagaming, challenging the player's perception and actions within the virtual world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

## Trevor Phillips: The Embodiment of Player Behavior

Trevor Phillips, the depraved psychopathic tweaker from Sandy Shores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>, is presented as a crucial element in Grand Theft Auto V's metagaming approach. He embodies the sociopathic tendencies often exhibited by players in a GTA game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. Trevor's complete lack of qualms about violence—smashing a biker's head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>, eliminating a banker gang <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>, or kidnapping a wife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>—reflects the "shit talking crazy person people become in sandbox worlds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

Instead of merely offering catharsis, the game uses Trevor's deliberate psychotic nature to suggest that players, when given the choice to indulge in violence, tend to be "pretty messed up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. He forces players to confront the radical possibility that "deep down inside we are all violent sickos" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. This aspect ties into the [[grand_theft_auto_v_as_a_reflection_of_player_behavior_and_societal_norms | game's reflection of player behavior and societal norms]].

## Meta-gaming: Games About Games

Traditionally, meta-fiction is defined as fiction about fiction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. Grand Theft Auto V extends this concept into "meta-gaming," which can be described as "games about games" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. This approach aims to make the audience experience gratification in a self-reflexive way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>.

## Player Choices and Psychological Projection

Grand Theft Auto V offers various activities beyond violence, such as yoga, tennis, golf, darts, and hunting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. These choices are not arbitrary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. The game highlights the paradox that mundane activities like yoga are considered boring, while "massacring troves of people" is deemed fun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

While the franchise has often been accused of empowering gamers to commit random acts of violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>, GTA V provides "viable, peaceful alternatives" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. The fact that players "usually choose to bask in destruction and chaos" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a> leads to the conclusion that the game developers are making a statement about how players project their *own* psyches and desires onto the game, rather than the developers empowering them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

## The Torture Scene: A Confrontation with Sadism

The most controversial scene in GTA V, where Trevor tortures an informant for the FIB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>, serves as a powerful example of metagaming. Trevor not only tortures without hesitation but "seems to take some sick pleasure in it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

The game then poses a critical question: "who is the real sadist? Trevor? Or the gamer who enjoys acting out their psychopathic urges on fictional characters?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. This scene is not a passive acceptance of torture, but rather "serves to over-identify with the sadistic desire to inflict harm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

> "Over identification is a loaded term that is best described as a sort of radical re-production of what is deemed taboo—it is a tactic of performance that undermines power through mimicry." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>

By forcing the player to engage in "advanced interrogation techniques" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>, the game provokes a strong reaction, whether "disgust, thereby subverting the ideology of the war on terror, or even sadistic enjoyment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. This technique is a form of [[the_distinctions_between_satire_social_commentary_and_parody_in_grand_theft_auto_v | satire]], aiming to "provoke a response, ideally with some kind of reform" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. Trevor's "explosion of the fourth wall" in this context creates a reflection for the gamer, forcing a confrontation with their "true psychic selves and our actual feelings about gruesome violence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

## Franklin Clinton: Reflecting on Racial Identity

Franklin's storyline, while primarily focused on [[race_cultural_appropriation_and_social_critique_in_grand_theft_auto_v | racial dynamics]], also contains a metagaming element regarding player identity. The game explores how characters who are not people of color adapt "street vernacular" when interacting with Franklin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. Jimmy, for example, "merely wears blackness like a mask" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.

The game ensures Franklin is perceived as "real" by contrasting his reactions (shrugging off weak weed) with Michael's hallucinatory experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. This draws attention to the appropriation of Black culture, as players can "act black whenever they want but... don't have to deal with any of the daily realities of being a person of color" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.

GTA V confronts the desire for a "guilt-free solution to racism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a> by having players laugh at white characters awkwardly attempting to pass as Black, "while they literally control a stereotypical shadow of a black male" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>. The game highlights the irony that players might feel smug about not being like Jimmy ("Jizzle") while still participating in violent acts like drive-bys and gang wars through Franklin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. This [[cultural_implications_of_selfreferential_and_meta_narratives | self-reflexive experience]] makes a more interesting statement on racial politics than simple shaming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>.

## Conclusion

To reduce Grand Theft Auto V to merely a game about stealing cars and blowing things up is a mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>. Michael, Trevor, and Franklin collectively "destabilize the players ability to believe in the validity and seriousness of a world that they play in" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>. Grand Theft Auto is not just an opportunity for debauchery; it functions as "a mirror that shows America its true nature" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>. The creators, rather than being "vindictive sadists," are craftsmen who use the "supposed glorification of sex, violence, and torture to create a masterful criticism of American culture" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>.

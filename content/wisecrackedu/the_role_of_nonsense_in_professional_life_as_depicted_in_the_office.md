*The Office* has maintained its popularity, being one of the most streamed shows even years after its conclusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. While the show is loved for its characters and humor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>, a significant part of its enduring appeal lies in its reflection of the widespread "BS" (bullsh__) that has infiltrated modern professional lives and the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. The series highlights characters who often spend their days doing nothing at a desk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. This phenomenon aligns with [[david_graebers_theory_on_the_proliferation_of_pointless_jobs | David Graeber's theory]] on [[bs_jobs_and_the_modern_workplace | BS jobs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

## What is The Office?

*The Office* is a mockumentary-style series centered on the Scranton, Pennsylvania, branch of Dunder Mifflin, a struggling paper company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. The branch is led by Michael Scott, a manager whose antics constantly divert his staff from their actual work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. After Steve Carell's departure, other equally incompetent managers continue this tradition of distraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

On the surface, *The Office* portrays individuals coping with unsatisfying jobs and uncomfortable bosses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. It satirizes common office archetypes, including the uptight accountant, the chatterbox, the attractive receptionist, the employee waiting for retirement, the unlovable HR representative, and the lovable dunce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. The show also touches upon anxieties surrounding the changing American economy, specifically the effects of digitization, e-commerce, and retail consolidation that emerged in the 2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

## [[david_graebers_theory_on_the_proliferation_of_pointless_jobs | David Graeber's Theory of BS Jobs]]

The show's portrayal of work aligns with anthropologist [[david_graebers_theory_on_the_proliferation_of_pointless_jobs | David Graeber's claim]] that [[bs_jobs_and_the_modern_workplace | BS jobs]] are proliferating globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. Graeber defines a [[bs_jobs_and_the_modern_workplace | BS job]] as:
> a form of paid employment that is so completely pointless, unnecessary or pernicious that even the employee cannot justify its existence even though as part of the conditions of employment the employee feels obliged to pretend that this is not the case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

This definition perfectly encapsulates life at Dunder Mifflin, where employees engage in useless meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>, follow random directives from superiors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>, and desperately try to find meaning in a job nearing obsolescence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

While some work at Dunder Mifflin is legitimate (e.g., accountants Oscar and Angela being competent, salespeople selling) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>, many aspects of the company fit Graeber's criteria for a [[bs_jobs_and_the_modern_workplace | BS job]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. Employees are often aware of the general pointlessness of their work, as Dunder Mifflin struggles to compete with modern chains and its management fails to adapt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. The company could close at any moment, with clients easily getting their paper from larger, more cost-effective competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. Even under the threat of downsizing, much of the workday is consumed by trivial activities like choosing streamer colors for parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>, playing "Flonkerton" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>, and office romance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

## Examples of BS Jobs at Dunder Mifflin

With few exceptions, most employees at Dunder Mifflin do not particularly enjoy their jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>:
*   **Jim Halpert** fills his time with distractions, primarily by playing pranks on Dwight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. Despite spending most of his time scheming and moving his desk an inch daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>, he is often praised as smart and competent and repeatedly offered promotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
*   **Pam Beesly** spends her work hours planning her wedding and conspiring with Jim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. She even invents a job, "office administrator," to avoid being fired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.
*   **Kevin Malone** is an accountant who struggles with basic math <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>, yet remains employed for years because firing him would be uncomfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.
*   **Dwight Schrute** revels in bureaucracy, obsessing over rules and inventing pointless structures like the "assistant to the assistant" position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.
*   **Gabe Lewis** holds a "director" title but has no real power and cannot even fire anyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.
*   **Andy Bernard** serves as a prime example; as manager, he spends months away on a boat without anyone noticing, and the office seems to function, or even excel, without him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

The idea that Dunder Mifflin is a "parasite on the economy" is explicitly raised when Michael Scott explains his job to children, revealing that Dunder Mifflin merely resells paper bought from a manufacturer for a higher price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. The children quickly point out the superfluousness of his business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.

## The Paradox of BS Jobs

[[david_graebers_theory_on_the_proliferation_of_pointless_jobs | Graeber]] highlights the paradox that a free market, which theoretically eliminates waste, should cause [[bs_jobs_and_the_modern_workplace | pointless jobs]] to disappear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. Dunder Mifflin is subject to market pressures, experiencing layoffs, branch mergers, and company sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. Yet, the Scranton branch persists despite its pervasive inefficiency, from incompetent managers and accountants to an HR representative prohibited from doing his job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.

## Why BS Jobs Proliferate

[[david_graebers_theory_on_the_proliferation_of_pointless_jobs | Graeber]] theorizes several reasons why [[bs_jobs_and_the_modern_workplace | BS jobs]] continue to exist:
*   **Cultural Expectation of Busyness** Culturally, there's an expectation to work 40 hours a week, leading to a "culture of looking busy" where managers create pointless tasks to fill time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. Employees often publicly affirm the importance of their jobs, if only to justify their income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.
*   **Optimization of Suffering** Graeber suggests a societal belief that if a job isn't suffering, it's not worth fair compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. Rather than optimizing efficiency, society has begun to optimize suffering, leading to the hiring of more useless individuals to ensure others who have nothing to do can appear busy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. Michael Scott, for example, convinces himself his job is to break up monotony for staff well-being, though his behavior often impedes productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. He frequently feigns busyness to avoid actual duties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.
*   **Rise of the Service Economy** Graeber attributes the spread of [[bs_jobs_and_the_modern_workplace | BS jobs]] to the boom in the service economy, specifically in administrative, consulting, clerical, accounting, and IT roles. While not all these jobs are pointless, the sector is conducive to their proliferation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>.

[[david_graebers_theory_on_the_proliferation_of_pointless_jobs | Graeber]] categorizes [[bs_jobs_and_the_modern_workplace | BS jobs]] into several types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>:
*   **Flunkies:** Employees who exist solely to justify a manager's position or inflate their prestige <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>.
*   **Goons:** Roles that exist because other companies also have them (e.g., legal or marketing departments) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26">[00:17:26]</a>.
*   **Duct Tapers:** Those who clean up the mess of inefficient systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>.
*   **Box Takers:** Individuals who exist to verify that some actual work is being done, even if it's not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>.
*   **Taskmasters:** People who create pointless work for other unproductive employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>.

As a company that doesn't actually manufacture paper, Dunder Mifflin squarely fits into this service economy model, justifying its higher prices through customer service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>. Michael's goal to hire and inspire people isn't necessarily about business growth but about his personal need to be loved, which he fulfills by creating a pseudo-family at work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>.

## Psychological Impact and Coping Mechanisms

[[david_graebers_theory_on_the_proliferation_of_pointless_jobs | Graeber]] argues that [[bs_jobs_and_the_modern_workplace | pointless jobs]] are not just wasteful but also harmful to the psyche, leading to depression, anxiety, and guilt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>. He posits that people derive pleasure from "being the cause"—having an effect on the world, even in a small way—and pointless jobs rob them of this pleasure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>. Citing Dostoevsky, Graeber notes that the worst torture is to force someone to endlessly perform an obviously pointless task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.

Many Dunder Mifflin employees are thwarted from "being the cause" by managers, bureaucracy, or the inanity of their tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. The show often depicts characters' responses to their professional meaninglessness:
*   **Jim**, bored with his job and admitting he'd "throw himself in front of a train" if paper became his career, finds agency by pranking Dwight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.
*   **Pam** copes with distraction and eventually finds fulfillment in love and family, noting it's not "many little girls' dream to be a receptionist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.
*   **Stanley** endures his job with the hope of retirement, where he plans to carve wooden birds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>, and finds joy in "Pretzel Day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.
*   **Oscar** eventually runs for state senate, a role where he could theoretically effect change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.
*   **Kevin** finds happiness running a bar, where he can competently bring guests joy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>.
*   **Michael** denies the superfluousness of his job by convincing himself of its importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. His intense dislike of Toby stems from Toby's infringement on Michael's ability to "be the cause" in his own office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>. His narcissism and need for attention are rooted in a lonesome childhood, satisfied only when he quits to live with Holly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. He desperately seeks meaning by framing his job in grandiose terms or emulating respected figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>. The mockumentary style further emphasizes Michael's posturing for the cameras to appear as an admired leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>.
*   **Dwight** embraces the inanity and clings to pomp and circumstance, serving his warped view of "being the cause." Despite a successful beet farm, he fixates on bureaucratic titles and the appearance of authority, ultimately desiring to be a "petty dictator" with ultimate control over his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>.

## Conclusion

[[the_popularity_and_cultural_impact_of_the_office | The Office's success]] can be attributed to many factors, including its cast, jokes, and ambient quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. However, a major reason for its deep resonance is the pervasive reality of [[bs_jobs_and_the_modern_workplace | BS jobs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>. Surveys confirm this reality: a 2013 Harvard Business Review survey found that half of 12,000 professionals felt their job lacked meaning, and another poll indicated 37% of British workers considered their jobs utterly useless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>.

*The Office* serves as an escapist fantasy where characters largely avoid getting fired despite working minimally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>. By the finale, they all manage to endure the "BS" either by finding love or simply leaving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:33">[00:18:33]</a>. This offers a hopeful message that in our own lives, we can either find a better job or build a domestic life satisfying enough to mitigate the misery of meaningless work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:42">[00:18:42]</a>.

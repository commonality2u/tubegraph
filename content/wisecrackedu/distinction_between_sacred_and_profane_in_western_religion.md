In Western spiritual traditions, honoring the sacred is a fundamental aspect of religious practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>. The French philosopher and sociologist Ã‰mile Durkheim, in *The Elementary Forms of Religious Life*, articulated that Western religions primarily categorize the world into two distinct realms: the sacred and the profane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>.

## Defining the Sacred and Profane

The sacred is always treated with seriousness, as it relates to fundamental cosmic forces and dictates the state of one's soul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>. The profane, conversely, is not accorded such gravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23:00">[04:23:00]</a>. Durkheim highlighted the profound differentiation and radical opposition between these two categories in human thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>.

## South Park's Approach to the Distinction

The television series *South Park* fundamentally denies the legitimacy of this distinction between the sacred and the profane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:00">[04:33:00]</a>. This approach can lead some to perceive the show as anti-religious, precisely because it does not treat religion as a sacred subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>.

### Denying the Sacred

*South Park* often portrays revered figures and concepts in a mundane or even absurd light:
*   Jesus is depicted engaging in mortal combat against Frosty the Snowman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a> or Satan questioning his birthday party costume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00">[00:45:00]</a>.
*   The boys are not starstruck when meeting Jesus but argue over playing him in an Easter play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>.
*   When meeting God, Stan asks about periods instead of profound questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>.
*   Jesus struggles to get viewers for his public-access talk show, "Jesus and Pals," which is routinely beaten in ratings by "Huntin' and Killin'" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:13:00">[06:13:00]</a>.
*   Satan is portrayed as a "serial monogamist" who keeps returning to Saddam Hussein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>.

In *South Park*, profound and ordinary elements "swim in the same soup" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>. Things that seem ordinary can be a big deal, while those that appear "mindblowingly important" can be trivial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>.

### Desecration as a Means of Salvation

A recurring theme in the series is that sometimes, the only way to save something that has been made sacred is by desecrating it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:00">[05:24:00]</a>.
*   In "Red Hot Catholic Love" (Season 6), Father Maxie tears a "sacred Vatican Document" in two to defy the Queen Spider's authority, metaphorically representing the need to investigate the Catholic Church's molestation scandal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:00">[04:38:00]</a>. The show suggests that the church could only be saved if it was no longer "too sacred to investigate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>.
*   In *South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut*, Cartman and Kenny save the world by cursing out Saddam Hussein and making a deal with the Devil, respectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a>.

### The Myth of Redemptive Violence

*South Park* suggests that human beings' concept of the sacred can be "screwy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>. For example, Jesus, despite literally walking the Earth, often goes unnoticed until he fights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:00">[06:04:00]</a>. He consistently engages in combat with figures like Frosty, Santa, Satan, Iraqi soldiers, Bill Donohue, a xenomorph, and a Seussian villain to maintain his followers' respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:19:00">[06:19:00]</a>.

This aligns with what American theologian Walter Wink termed the [[concept_of_good_and_evil_in_pop_culture | myth of redemptive violence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:00">[06:42:00]</a>. According to this myth, our sense of the sacred, originating from ancient Babylonian mythology, stems from the desire to see good triumph over evil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48:00">[06:48:00]</a>. Wink argued that this myth, rather than traditional religions, is the dominant religion in modern society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:00">[07:05:00]</a>. Jesus in *South Park* fights because he realizes the myth his followers project onto him is more important than his own teachings, conceding to the power of the [[concept_of_good_and_evil_in_pop_culture | myth of redemptive violence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:15:00">[07:15:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>.

## South Park's Philosophy on Religion

While [[irreverence_and_sacredness_in_south_park | irreverent]], *South Park* creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker do not consider themselves anti-religious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>. They are fascinated by religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>. They hold the view that human beings are inherently ridiculous and that getting rid of religion will not change this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:00">[10:04:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:26:00">[10:26:00]</a>.

Ultimately, *South Park* suggests that all worldviews risk appearing ridiculous, and all movements risk becoming fanatical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:19:00">[11:19:00]</a>. The show's unique philosophy is that being human is inevitably ridiculous, and there's no way to avoid this fate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:00:00">[13:00:00]</a>. No matter which religion or life philosophy is adopted, the show conveys that one will appear silly if they take themselves too seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:07:00">[13:07:00]</a>. The core question, then, is not whether one's belief system is a joke, but whether one is aware of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:19:00">[13:19:00]</a>.

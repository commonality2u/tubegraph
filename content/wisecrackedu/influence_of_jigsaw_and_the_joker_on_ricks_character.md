In the *Rick and Morty* episode "The Vindicators 3: Return of the World Ender," Rick Sanchez's actions and philosophical outlook are significantly influenced by notorious cinematic villains, particularly Jigsaw from the *Saw* franchise and [[the_jokers_origin_and_evolution_in_comics_and_film|The Joker]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. This influence is used to deconstruct traditional superhero narratives and explore the complexities of good and evil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

### Influence of Jigsaw

After getting blackout drunk and effortlessly destroying the Worldender, Rick devises a series of traps for the Vindicators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. This setup is directly inspired by Jigsaw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

While Jigsaw aims to make people confront their demons and appreciate life through suffering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>, Rick's trials are described as "less 'a thought out plan to make people confront their demons' a la Jigsaw and more 'a drunken scheme to push people over a moral cliff'" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. Rick's primary goal is to create a moral crisis for the Vindicators, thereby proving to Morty that they are not heroes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. This scheme successfully reveals the true colors of the Vindicators, leading to internal conflict and betrayal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

### Influence of The Joker

[[the_jokers_origin_and_evolution_in_comics_and_film|The Joker]] serves as a "less obvious inspiration" for Rick's actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. Morty's experience on a carnival ride in the episode is a nod to Alan Moore's *The Killing Joke*, where [[the_jokers_origin_and_evolution_in_comics_and_film|The Joker]] tortures Commissioner Gordon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

Similar to Jigsaw, [[the_jokers_origin_and_evolution_in_comics_and_film|The Joker]] is not solely motivated by murder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. His aim is to prove that "with one sufficiently bad day," someone like Gordon could descend into madness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. As a [[the_jokers_origin_and_evolution_in_comics_and_film|Joker]]-inspired quote suggests, "madness... is like gravity. All it takes is a little push" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. Rick's "shenanigans" in the episode embody this philosophy, pushing the Vindicators to their breaking point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

Just as [[the_jokers_origin_and_evolution_in_comics_and_film|The Joker]] corrupted Harvey Dent with his nihilistic philosophy in *The Dark Knight* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>, Rick transforms the "benevolent Vindicators" into "violent backstabbers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. This act shatters Morty's "simplistic understanding of good and evil" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.

### Deconstructing Good and Evil

Rick's actions, influenced by Jigsaw's trials and [[the_jokers_origin_and_evolution_in_comics_and_film|The Joker]]'s nihilism, serve to critique the simplistic portrayal of good and evil in popular narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. Rick's perspective is that "good and bad are artificial constructs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

The episode suggests that the complete absence of these concepts is problematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. Rick's refusal to critically engage with his decisions, based on the belief that "nothing matters," allows him to justify any action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. The episode presents a bleak dichotomy: either a lack of conviction in good and evil, leading to unchecked actions, or an absolute conviction that can justify extreme measures, such as destroying an entire planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. In typical *Rick and Morty* fashion, there are "no right answers, only wrong ones" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

Disney's expansive artistic reach is argued to be detrimental to culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. The company has developed an aesthetic characterized by "round faces, saucer eyes, [and] big goofy grins" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>, and Walt Disney was "ruthless" in his pursuit of making all content adorable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. This process often involves acquiring stories, adapting them, and "ultimately twisting their original artistic intentions beyond recognition" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

Disney's approach to storytelling, particularly with fairy tales, often involves a "meat grinder" process that "polishes off any rough and unsavory edges" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. This consistent method, spanning decades, "blanches [stories] artistically, ground[s] down, and pump[s] out as a cute little Disney sausage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

### Pinocchio

Disney's adaptation of *Pinocchio* "whitewashed" the original story by Carlo Collodi to align with the company's "cutesy aesthetic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. Collodi's original narrative was not intended to evoke a "warm fuzzy feeling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a> and featured a gruesome ending where Pinocchio was "gruesomely hanged" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. The original was a "bleak morality tale" intended to teach children to "be good or suffer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>, portraying Pinocchio as "mean-spirited and rude" whose actions led to his suffering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. Disney removed these dark, satiric elements, replacing them with "syrupy lines" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a> and transforming Pinocchio from a "total frat pro to the naive piece of pine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>, with a character design resembling Mickey Mouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. The alteration of "a beloved fairy tale [to] purge it of its original intentions and thus rewrite the narrative in our collective memories" is considered unsettling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

### The Little Mermaid

Disney's 1989 classic *The Little Mermaid* is based on Hans Christian Andersen's tale but "strips the story of a lot of its darker and more religious overtones" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. The Disney version presents a love story culminating in a "happily ever after," with the message that "true love saves all" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.

However, Andersen's source material is neither happy nor uplifting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>. His story portrays love primarily as "suffering" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>, with the mermaid enduring pain with every step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. The prince in Andersen's version "never returns the mermaid's affection" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>, marrying a different princess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>. Andersen intended for the mermaid to be saved by "sacrifice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>, not romantic love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. Her quest was to gain a soul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>, and in his tale, she achieves this through a "christ-like sacrifice" of her life to save the prince <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>, being rewarded by becoming a "gentle spirit" who earns a soul after helping mankind for 300 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. Andersen would have "despised Disney's ending" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.

### Other Altered Stories

Other classic tales, such as *Pocahontas* and *Sleeping Beauty*, have also been significantly altered. The "real Pocahontas" story is not about love but about "colonists kidnapping a Native American woman and murdering her husband" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[0:12:38]</a>. The original *Sleeping Beauty* describes a woman being "non-consensually impregnated in her sleep and giving birth to twins also in her sleep" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. The alteration of *Pocahontas*, for example, results in "a very shitty history lesson that some people might never question" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.

## Consequences of Disney's Storytelling on Children

### Missing Developmental Tools

Traditional fairy tales, despite their often "dark and complex and vaguely disturbing" nature, offer children "a symbolic template for understanding the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. They allow children to "express and cope with their anxieties," as seen in a children's cancer clinic where patients used fairy tales to process their feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. The "darkness of fairy tales can actually offer a light to children confronting adversity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.

However, Disney "strips these fairy tales of their bite," replacing complexity with "a bland wholesome narrative" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>. This creates "new narratives that are in their own rights potentially quite destructive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>.

### Perpetuating Harmful Narratives

Psychologist Susan Darger Smith notes that young girls who identify with characters like Cinderella or Belle from *Beauty and the Beast* are "more likely to end up in abusive relationships as adults" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>. Victims of domestic abuse often identified with these heroines and believed that if their "love is strong enough they can change their partner's behavior" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>.

The "convenient narrative in which all the world's problems can be solved by true love" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>, peddled by Disney, "fails to give children any tools for navigating real life problems" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>. The original purpose of fairy tales was to "convey the darker and crueler aspects of life so as to better prepare children for the realities of adulthood" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.

## The Commercialization of Cuteness

According to economist Milton Friedman, companies' "only responsibility is to make more money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>, a principle that has become "gospel" in corporate responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>. This explains why Disney operates a "cuteness factory" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>. A period in the 1970s and 80s where Disney produced "grimmer, edgier films" resulted in "huge box office failures" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a> and nearly led to the company's collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>. The "Disney Renaissance" of the 90s was a course correction back to "sentimental cuteness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>.

Studies show that cuteness "increases our concentration" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a> and activates the brain's pleasure center, pumping out dopamine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. Cultural theorist Joshua Paul Dale calls the use of cuteness for potentially nefarious purposes "evil cute" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>, a term that could apply to Disney's animated characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>. Ultimately, cuteness is "just a means for Disney to pad its bottom line" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>, regardless of whether it tells stories "ultimately good for children" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>.

## Broader Cultural Impact

The "disney-fication of storytelling" becomes more concerning when applied to "more iconic cultural works" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>, such as the *Star Wars* franchise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. The latest *Star Wars* trilogy began with "sentimental fan service" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>, flirted with darkness, but then "course corrected and opted for a sweet conclusion based on a magical kiss, romantic sacrifice and of course everyone you care about is Jedi royalty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>.

As Disney continues to expand its control over media, there is concern that "there won't be space for grittier, darker stories for grown up fairy tales" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>.

Syndrome, initially known as Buddy, is a significant antagonist in *The Incredibles* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>. He is portrayed as a grown man and Mr. Incredible's new employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.

## Origin and Initial Actions

As a young boy named Buddy, he was a "normie" who interfered with Mr. Incredible's plan to capture Bomb Voyage, leading to the culprit's escape and endangering a train full of other "normies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>. This interference is presented as an instance where "mediocrity gets in the way of excellence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>.

## Transformation and Goals

Buddy transforms into Syndrome, suggesting that ordinary people *could* elevate themselves through "grit, determination, a tablespoon of elbow grease, and grit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>. He rises to build an "empire of technological innovation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>.

Syndrome's primary motivation is to unleash his robots on the world so he can then "pretend to defeat them and soak up some of that sweet superhero glory" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>. His "robot shtick" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a> is designed to achieve this false heroism.

## Flawed Greatness

Despite his technological prowess, Syndrome's "manufactured greatness" is ultimately proven inferior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>. During his plan, he is unable to control his own robot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.

## Demise

After the Incredibles thwart his plans, Syndrome attempts to steal the Incredibaby as an act of revenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>. However, the baby's abilities lead to Syndrome's demise, "sending Syndrome to hell where he belongs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>. The film concludes that The Incredibles "murdered him" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>.

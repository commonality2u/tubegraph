[[overview_of_1984_by_george_orwell | George Orwell's "1984"]] explores the severe implications of totalitarian control through the story of [[characters_and_plot_summary_of_1984 | Winston Smith]], a member of "The Party," a totalitarian regime led by "Big Brother" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Big Brother symbolizes pervasive surveillance and authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Speaking negatively about Big Brother can lead to imprisonment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Methods of Control

The Party employs various methods to maintain absolute power:

### Surveillance and Punishment
The regime keeps constant tabs on its citizens through pervasive surveillance, including informants and telescreens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. The "Thought Police" are an integral part of this control, acting as enforcers of Party mentality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Dissidents, like [[characters_and_plot_summary_of_1984 | Winston Smith]], are subjected to torture to force them to confess to fabricated crimes and realign with the Party's ideology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. The goal is to strip individuals of their internal dissent and fill them with "Big Brotha-ly love" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

### Room 101
The ultimate torture chamber, Room 101, is used to break an individual's spirit completely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. For [[characters_and_plot_summary_of_1984 | Winston]], this involves confronting his greatest fear—a cage full of rats—until he betrays the person he loves, Julia, ultimately losing his soul and embracing Big Brother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

### Doublethink
One of the Party's most insidious methods of control is "doublethink" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. Doublethink involves simultaneously holding two contradictory beliefs, making a conscious decision to accept an obvious falsehood while denying that it is a lie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. This ensures that individuals believe nonsense with the conviction of truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

> "Doublethink goes on forever. With the lie always one step ahead of the truth." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>

## Manipulation of Reality
Beyond physical surveillance, The Party's control extends to twisting reality itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. Unlike leaders who simply destroy opposing truths, such as Hitler burning books, the Party aims to reconstruct truth, akin to Stalin rewriting history to align with his agenda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. Oceania, the setting of [[overview_of_1984_by_george_orwell | 1984]], reflects Stalin's more effective methods of population control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

## Erasure of Individuality
As the Party continually recreates reality, individual qualities are systematically suppressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. Personal identity becomes non-existent if it is not validated by the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. This leads to a state where people become "soulless robots" without even realizing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

### Broader Warning
While [[overview_of_1984_by_george_orwell | 1984]] can be seen as a critique of Stalinism, Orwell intended it as a universal warning against totalitarianism for all mankind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

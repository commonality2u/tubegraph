Hayao Miyazaki's award-winning masterpiece, *[[symbolism_in_spirited_away|Spirited Away]]*, explores several profound themes through the journey of its protagonist, Chihiro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## A Coming-of-Age Story
*[[character_analysis_of_spirited_away|Spirited Away]]* functions as a coming-of-age story, a common narrative tradition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>. The film portrays a young girl transported to a strange place where she must navigate various challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>.

At the beginning of the film, Chihiro is depicted as naive, inexperienced, timid, and whiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>. Her initial reaction to her new school, for example, is negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>. It is through solving problems and assisting others that Chihiro develops self-reliance and empathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>. This transformation illustrates her journey from an inexperienced child to a more capable individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>.

## Greed and Overconsumption
Beneath the surface narrative, the film presents a cautionary tale about greed and overconsumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>. This theme is particularly relevant to postwar Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>. Following World War II, Japan experienced an economic boom, leading to a cultural shift towards capitalism and away from traditional values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>.

The Spirit Realm itself takes the form of an old amusement park, styled after Japan's Meiji period (late 19th to early 20th century) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>. Discarded shrines on the hillside [[symbolism_in_spirited_away|symbolize]] the diminishing importance of cultural history in favor of modern pursuits like leisure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>.

In this economically-driven environment, overconsumption leads to dire consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>.

*   **Chihiro's Parents**
    Chihiro's parents indulge in food from the spirit realm, despite its suspicious lack of vegetables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>. Their confidence in their financial means ("daddy here he's got credit cards and cash") highlights a capitalist mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>. As a result of their gluttony, they are transformed into pigs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>. Pigs are used on Earth as a symbol of capitalist cultures that could lead to the "eradication of humankind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>.

*   **The Bathhouse**
    The bathhouse furnace is also shaped like a pig, constantly consuming resources for trivial purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>. When No-Face appears, overflowing with gold, Yubaba and her staff exploit him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>. However, as the staff showers No-Face with excess, he reciprocates by showering them with stomach acid, visually representing the destructive nature of unchecked greed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>.

## Identity and Heritage
The film expresses a hope that modern Japan can achieve a balance between economic prosperity and spiritual heritage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a>. A key aspect of this hope is the emphasis on remembering one's name ("If you forget your name you'll never find your way home") and the identity of one's parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a>. These elements are crucial for forging a connection to one's ancestry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>.

## Artistic Legacy
[[cultural_references_in_spirited_away|The context of the film's creation]] also deepens its message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>. Prior to *[[character_analysis_of_spirited_away|Spirited Away]]*, director Hayao Miyazaki considered retiring and passing on the torch to the next generation of artists at Studio Ghibli, though he ultimately reconsidered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>.

Furthermore, at a time when many animated films were created using computers, *[[symbolism_in_spirited_away|Spirited Away]]* was primarily hand-drawn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:00">[06:08:00]</a>. Its narrative conveys the [[themes_of_hope_and_rebirth|hope]] that future generations will flourish and progress while respecting the history and traditions of the art form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>.

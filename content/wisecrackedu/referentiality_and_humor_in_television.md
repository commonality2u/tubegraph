This article explores how humor is constructed, particularly through referentiality, using *The Big Bang Theory* as a primary case study for what is perceived as "bad" referential humor, and contrasting it with examples from *Futurama*. It also delves into the philosophical implications of such humor, drawing on Jean Baudrillard's theories of representation.

## The Problem with *The Big Bang Theory*'s Referentiality

*The Big Bang Theory* is frequently criticized for its use of references, which are seen as profoundly bad and requiring philosophical analysis to understand their shortcomings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. The show extensively references cornerstones of "nerd culture," such as *Star Trek* and *Battlestar Galactica*, along with scientific facts and mathematical formulas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. These references are intended to emphasize that characters like Leonard and Sheldon are "diehard nerds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

However, the core issue lies in how these references function as jokes:
*   **The Reference *Is* The Joke**: When Sheldon defines friction after Penny slips in a bathtub, the "joke" is simply the fact that he's giving a scientific definition, not the content of the definition itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. The scientific explanation could be replaced with gibberish, and the joke would still "work" because the audience is meant to laugh at the *act* of referencing science, not the science itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. The show relies on the recognition of a scientific reference, not an understanding of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

### Contrast with *Futurama*

In contrast, shows like *Futurama* use references to imbue jokes with additional meaning. For example, a reference to "aleph null"—the mathematical symbol for an infinite set of countable numbers—in *Futurama* implies an impossible number of screens in a movie theater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. Here, the humor stems from the *subject* of aleph-null and the impossibility it represents, rather than just the mere reference to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. *The Big Bang Theory*, by contrast, accomplishes the opposite, draining meaning from its references <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

## Philosophical Implications: Jean Baudrillard and the Death of Meaning

The show's use of references that lack a subject was a concern for French philosopher Jean Baudrillard, who argued that such representations contribute to a state where reality has been obliterated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. Baudrillard proposed four levels of representation, or "simulacra" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01">[00:04:01]</a>:

1.  **First Level**: A perfectly accurate representation of reality, like a picture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
2.  **Second Level**: An unfaithful copy that obscures actual reality, such as a filter that makes someone look prettier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
3.  **Third Level**: A representation that deliberately hides the fact that no reality is being represented, like an artist rendering a person they've never seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
4.  **Fourth Level**: Signs and representations begin to reference other signs and representations, leading to a complete loss of any connection to original reality. This is seen in actions like photoshopping a photoshopped image or making memes of other memes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. Baudrillard believed we live in a world controlled by this fourth order of simulacra, where the reference to original reality is lost, leading him to technically consider our reality a simulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

Applying Baudrillard's framework:
*   **Optimistic View**: *The Big Bang Theory* could be considered a second-order representation—a distorted view of real nerd culture that gets details wrong but is still *about* real nerd culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.
*   **Pessimistic View**: The show is a third-order representation—a copy of something that never existed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. It presents "science without actual science" and "nerd culture without real nerds," portraying characters more like what someone who has never met a nerd imagines them to be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.

This means that references in *The Big Bang Theory* don't rely on an audience's understanding of the science or the actual workings of what's being referenced. The reality is irrelevant; as long as the audience recognizes Sheldon is being "unnecessarily smart," the joke works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. This contrasts sharply with a joke in *Futurama* about a Mobius strip, which relies on the audience laughing at the actual science referenced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

For Baudrillard, these copies divorced from reality signal the "death of meaning" and make all ideas interchangeable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. Because the jokes are "apropos of nothing," characters can "spew meaningless nonsense under the guise of a meaningful joke" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. The show's fictional game, Mystic Warlords of Ka’a, exemplifies this, quickly descending into utter nonsense where the specific words don't matter as long as they sound like a reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. The show functions by selling an empty joke under the guise of a meaningful one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

## The Nature of Laughter: Superiority Theory

If *The Big Bang Theory*'s references ultimately point at nothing, the question arises: what exactly are people laughing at? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54">[00:07:54]</a> Analysis suggests the show largely achieves humor by "sh*tting on its characters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.

This aligns with the **Superiority Theory of Humor**, one of the earliest theories in the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:33">[09:33]</a>:
*   **Plato**: Laughter is a form of scorn directed at those unaware of their own faults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37">[09:37]</a>.
*   **Thomas Hobbes**: Laughter is a result of our competitive nature, stemming from triumphing over others or witnessing their downfall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:45">[09:45]</a>.
*   **Descartes**: Laughter proceeds from perceiving a "small evil" in someone considered deserving of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55">[09:55]</a>.

These [[philosophical_analysis_of_humor | philosophers]] generally agree that laughter often comes at the expense of others to make oneself feel superior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:05">[10:05]</a>.

However, *The Big Bang Theory* differs from shows like *Seinfeld* because its characters are not portrayed as inherently horrible people deserving scorn; showrunner Chuck Lorre even described them as "extraordinary people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:12">[10:12]</a>.

## Impact on Nerd Culture

The overarching problem is that *The Big Bang Theory*, instead of uplifting nerd culture, tends to tear it down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:30">[10:30]</a>. By merely paying "lip service to nerdom" and mechanically inserting references for their own sake, the show "reveals its contempt for real nerds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:37">[10:37]</a>. The specific details of nerd culture are deemed irrelevant, as long as the characters "sound like wanky assholes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:46">[10:46]</a>. This ultimately does a disservice to actual nerds, presenting them as caricatures who are simply "dumped on" rather than reflecting their true identities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11">[11:11]</a>.

## Plot Summary

The story follows ten-year-old Chihiro who, with her parents, accidentally stumbles into a magical land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. After her parents are transformed into pigs for overeating enchanted food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>, Chihiro seeks employment at a bathhouse run by the "wrinkly old cronut" Yubaba, who changes Chihiro's name to Sen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. A character named Haku warns Sen not to forget her real name, as he did <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

During her time at the bathhouse, Sen cleans a "stink spirit" who rewards her with a magical "turd infused with ipecac" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. She later uses this item to help a poisoned Haku, who is revealed to be a dragon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>, and to purge the monstrous No-Face of his excesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. Sen eventually remembers her name and her parents, successfully identifying them and returning to the human world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

## [[character_analysis_of_spirited_away | Chihiro's Coming-of-Age]]

The film is a coming-of-age story that portrays a young girl transported to a strange place where she must navigate challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. Initially, Chihiro is naive, inexperienced, timid, and whiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. Her journey, marked by solving problems and helping others, symbolizes her gaining self-reliance and empathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

## Critiques of Greed and Overconsumption

Beneath the narrative of renewal and transformation, *Spirited Away* presents a cautionary tale about greed and overconsumption, particularly in the context of postwar Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

*   **Economic Boom and Cultural Shift:** After World War II, Japan experienced an economic boom that led to a cultural shift towards capitalism and away from traditional values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.
*   **Spirit Realm as Old Amusement Park:** The Spirit Realm, styled after an old amusement park from the Meiji period (late 19th to early 20th century), symbolizes the relegation of [[cultural_references_in_spirited_away | cultural history]] in favor of modern pursuits like leisure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. Discarded shrines on the hillside further emphasize this fading of traditional spiritual heritage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.
*   **Parents as Pigs:** Chihiro's parents transforming into pigs after consuming food from the spirit realm symbolizes a dire consequence of overconsumption in an economically-driven environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. Pigs were commonly used as a critical symbol of capitalist cultures that could lead to the eradication of humankind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.
*   **Bathhouse Furnace:** The bathhouse furnace, also shaped like a pig, symbolizes constant gobbling of resources for minimal gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
*   **No-Face's Excesses:** No-Face, overflowing with gold and showering staff with stomach acid after being showered in excess, illustrates that overindulgence and unchecked consumption lead to self-destruction and harm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

## Importance of Identity and Heritage

The film emphasizes the importance of finding a balance between economic prosperity and spiritual heritage in modern Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.

*   **Remembering One's Name:** Much emphasis is placed on remembering one's name, as well as the identity of one's parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. This symbolizes the forging of a connection to one's ancestry and cultural roots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

## Artistic Legacy

The film also contains [[symbolism_and_literary_references_in_the_lego_movie | symbolism]] regarding artistic legacy and the future of animation.

*   **Miyazaki's Consideration of Retirement:** Prior to making *Spirited Away*, director Hayao Miyazaki considered passing the torch to the next generation of artists at Studio Ghibli <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.
*   **Traditional Animation:** While many animated films at the time were visualized using computers, *Spirited Away* was drawn using a more traditional, elaborate system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. This artistic choice conveys the hope that future generations will flourish and progress while respecting the history of the art form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

The third season of *Rick and Morty* consistently highlights the meaninglessness of existence, asserting that nothing truly matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. This presents a unique challenge for the show: how can characters experience [[character_development_in_rick_and_morty | growth]] when there is no inherent meaning to their actions or lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>? The series offers a novel solution that transcends simple nihilism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>, primarily through the maturation of Beth Smith, the matriarch of the family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## Beth's Existential Crisis in "The Rickchurian Mortydate"

In the Season 3 finale, "The Rickchurian Mortydate," Beth's central subplot involves her questioning whether she accepted Rick's offer to be replaced by a clone, and if she herself is, in fact, the clone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. To confront this dilemma, she seeks help from Jerry, with whom she rekindles their relationship by recreating one of their first dates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. Her concern that she might be a clone leads her to the woods with her family, where Rick intervenes to convince her she is not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

### Radical Freedom and Rick's Influence

Rick previously informed Beth about the implications of her intelligence: "When you know nothing matters, the universe is yours" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Rick's typical advice for dealing with this revelation is "Don't think about it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. This profound understanding grants Beth "radical freedom" to choose her destiny—whether to stay with or leave her family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. This freedom, regardless of the choice, promises her solace and a sense of calm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

The episode suggests Beth chose to stay, leading to a newfound happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. She appears to be a better mother to Summer, loves Jerry, and has reunited her family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. This reconciliation with Jerry, a character often portrayed as a "helpless parasite" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>, might seem unusual to some viewers.

## Amor Fati: The Cure for Nihilism

Beth's paradigm shift and her reconnection with Jerry can be understood through the philosophical concept of *Amor Fati* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

### Understanding Amor Fati

*Amor Fati*, a Latin phrase meaning "Love of Fate," was employed by Friedrich Nietzsche to describe the affirmation of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. It is linked to the thought experiment of "Eternal Recurrence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. This concept asks whether one would willingly relive every moment of their life—the good, the bad, and everything in between—for eternity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. To desire this eternal reliving is the ultimate affirmation of life and the essence of *Amor Fati* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>, serving as Nietzsche's strategy to escape the crushing weight of nihilism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

### Beth's Embrace of Her Past and Present

Given her "Rick-like disillusionment-causing intelligence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>, Beth must confront her past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. With Jerry, she relives a small part of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. Although she may have disliked her life, including her initial date with Jerry, the second time around she embodies the Nietzschean "Yes-Sayer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. This is not about rewriting the past or denying past misery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>; rather, *Amor Fati* means not shunning the "ugly aspects of our lives" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

Beth explicitly tells Jerry she is no longer the woman he married <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. Her acceptance of Jerry, despite his perceived "simplicity," suggests she finds this quality beneficial given her family's tendency to use intelligence to justify unhealthy behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

Another instance of *Amor Fati* occurs when Beth believes Rick intends to replace her. Her reaction implies an embrace of her current reality:
> Brushing aside the Blade Runner-yness of it all, Beth is also functionally saying: Yes, a version of Beth may have chosen to leave, but I embrace being left with my family rather than dwell on what could have been <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

Even with infinite universes and choices, Beth chooses to stay in her current reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. For Nietzsche, the reasoning behind human actions is often incomprehensible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. While Beth longs to know who she is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>, Nietzsche would suggest that regardless of whether she was cloned or if anything matters in infinite versions of herself, the only thing that truly matters is loving her fate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. This appears to be the choice Beth has made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

## Beth as the Ubermensch

While Rick is often portrayed as a Nietzschean *Übermensch* at war with a meaningless cosmos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>, his actions often lean towards self-destructive "dicking around" rather than creating new meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. Beth, however, when confronted with the meaninglessness of the cosmos, finds happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. This act of finding happiness and affirming her life in the face of meaninglessness is the true mark of an *Übermensch* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. Her journey demonstrates a profound [[parallels_between_rick_and_beth | growth]] and a unique resolution to the show's pervasive nihilism.

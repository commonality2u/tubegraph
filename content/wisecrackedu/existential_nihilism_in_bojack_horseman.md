The Netflix series *BoJack Horseman* presents itself with colorful animation, talking animals, and Hollywood glamour, suggesting a typical happy-go-lucky cartoon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. However, this veneer hides a dark and depressing reality, fitting for a show focused on the disillusionment that comes from looking beneath the surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. The show reveals the ugly, narcissistic truth behind the dazzling façade of "Hollywoo" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Characters like Mr. Peanutbutter demonstrate a feigned interest, studio executives are only focused on money, and award ceremonies are meaningless, often only rewarding those with established names <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. As Charlotte describes it, "Hollywoo's a real pretty town that's smack on top of all that black tar. By the time you realize you're sinking, it's too late" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

Beyond Hollywood, the show uses "Hollywoo" as a metaphor for existence itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Just as the façade of Hollywoo covers a hollow industry, the trappings of daily life conceal the meaninglessness of existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. This concept, known as [[existential_nihilism_through_bojack_horseman|Existential Nihilism]], is foundational to *BoJack Horseman* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. If life is truly meaningless, a central question arises: how does one cope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>?

## Part 1: Distract Yourself

A primary coping mechanism for the anguish of a meaningless world is distraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Naomi Watts articulates this need to "do something light and fun to distract me from the deep well of sadness that is my life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

*   **Princess Carolyn** consistently distracts herself with her demanding job and her compulsive need to fix the lives of those she cares about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. Despite complaining about work dominating her life, she cannot handle free time and quickly finds a way to return to the "Hollywoo grindstone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
*   **Todd**, BoJack's best friend, remains happy as long as he has something to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. When left without a task, he immediately spirals into existential despair, questioning his purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. He manages to keep himself busy by composing a space opera, building his own Disneyland, and starting various businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
*   **Mr. Peanutbutter** lives in a constant state of distraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. Though seemingly a "moron" to BoJack, he is more self-aware than he appears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. He philosophizes, "The universe is a cruel uncaring void. The key to being happy isn't the search for meaning. It's to just keep yourself busy with unimportant nonsense. And eventually... you'll be dead" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
*   **BoJack** himself lives a life defined by distractions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. The show often jokes about the triviality of his days, sometimes not even showing what he's doing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. For years after "Horsin' Around," BoJack drifted in a near-constant state of distraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. However, a "mild anxiety attack" forces him to confront his lack of responsibilities, leading to the question often posed to celebrities: "They have everything, so how could they not be happy?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

### Blaise Pascal's Influence

The 17th-century philosopher Blaise Pascal, considered a precursor to the Existentialists, addressed this very question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. Pascal argued that when humans have too much time to think, they inevitably contemplate their own insignificance, leading to unhappiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. He stated, "I have discovered that all the unhappiness of men arises from one single fact: that they cannot stay quietly in their own chamber" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. Our "natural poverty of our feeble and mortal condition" is so miserable that nothing can comfort us when we think of it closely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

Pascal believed humans possess a natural psychological defense mechanism: easy distraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. When distracted, we stop thinking about our existence and can be, if not happy, at least functional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. He likened this to kings: "Yet, when we imagine a king attended with every pleasure he can feel, if he be without diversion and be left to consider and reflect on what he is, this feeble happiness will not sustain him" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

Like a king, BoJack lacks serious struggles to occupy his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. He constantly tries to distract himself to avoid confronting his reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. This charade collapses when he reads Diane's book, "One Trick Pony," which offers an honest reflection of himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. Forced to face his true self, BoJack confronts his self-deception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. The book highlights how he became famous to "be constantly surrounded by distraction and wouldn't have to be alone with yourself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

Pascal's solution for those beyond distraction was to turn to God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. However, *BoJack Horseman* portrays a "post-God-Is-Dead world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. The Christmas Special uses Santa Claus as a stand-in to discuss the non-existence of God, with BoJack stating, "He's a lie that grown ups made up because we like to believe that there's an order to the universe and that good behavior will lead to happiness but the fact is that just isn't true" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

Without God, BoJack's first inclination is to return to distraction, but the show illustrates the tragic consequences of forcing distraction after the illusion is broken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. Secretariat's advice to a young BoJack was essentially, "Don't Think About It": "When you get sad...you run... straight ahead... and..and you keep running forward no matter what... Don't you stop running and don't you ever look behind you. There's nothing for you behind you. All that exists is what's ahead" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. But Secretariat himself, once disqualified from racing and unable to keep his thoughts at bay, could not outrun the truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. Similarly, BoJack drags Sarah Lynn on a months-long bender that ends with her fatal overdose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.

## Part 2: Radical Freedom

From the outset, BoJack rejects responsibility, stating, "I'm responsible for my own happiness? I can't even be responsible for my own breakfast" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. He wishes to escape the consequences of his terrible life choices, asserting, "I didn't do anything wrong because I can't do anything wrong. EVERYTHING IS MEANINGLESS! NOTHING I DO HAS CONSEQUENCE!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

After his first bender, BoJack asks Diane, "Am I just doomed to be the person that I am? The person in that book? I know that I can be selfish and narcissistic and self destructive but underneath all that, deep down I'm a good person and I need you to tell me that I'm good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.

BoJack fears what 20th-century French philosopher [[jeanpaul_sartres_radical_freedom_as_depicted_in_bojack_horseman|Jean-Paul Sartre]] called "Radical Freedom," a core concept of his philosophy, [[absurdism_and_existentialism_in_the_series|Existentialism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. The catchphrase of [[absurdism_and_existentialism_in_the_series|Existentialism]] is "Existence Precedes Essence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. An object's essence, for Sartre, is its purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. For example, a hammer is created with the purpose of hammering, so its essence precedes its existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. While a Christian might view a human as a tool created by God with a purpose, an [[existential_nihilism_through_bojack_horseman|Existential Nihilist]] believes humans simply exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

Unlike a hammer or a Gentle Farms chicken, BoJack's existence has no inherent purpose; there's nothing he is meant to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. He has total control over every choice he makes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. This is Sartre's "Radical Freedom," which is not meant to be comforting: "man is condemned to be free... Condemned, because he did not create himself, yet is nevertheless at liberty, and from the moment that he is thrown into this world he is responsible for EVERYTHING he does" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.

As Diane tells BoJack, "That's the thing, I don't think I believe in 'deep down.' I kinda think all you are is just the things that you do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. There is no "good BoJack" deep down; he is entirely defined by his past choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. Todd reinforces this, telling BoJack, "You are all the things that are wrong with you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.

While this perspective may seem bleak, it offers BoJack hope: he is not "doomed to be the person in that book" forever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. He possesses the freedom to change his actions and himself, though it is entirely up to him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. The show provides an optimistic take on Sartre's ideas by using water as a metaphor for BoJack's Radical Freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. Though often overwhelmed by water, BoJack eventually recognizes it as a medium of incredible opportunity, not just a scary force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.

## Part 3: Embrace The Absurd

When Mr. Peanutbutter's brother falls ill, he undergoes his own existential crisis, observing, "Come to work, clock in, you put sugar in your coffee and watch it slowly disappear into nothingness. But the sugar doesn't know why. Sugar didn't ask to be born" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. However, he quickly realizes, "None of this matters!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. BoJack receives similar advice from his old writing partner, Cuddly Whiskers, who abandoned his "Hollywoo" life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. Cuddly Whiskers finds happiness by embracing that "An Oscar is meaningless. It's all meaningless. Only after you give up everything can you begin to find a way to be happy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.

Mr. Peanutbutter's and Cuddly Whiskers' paths to happiness, arising from the realization of [[existential_nihilism_through_bojack_horseman|nihilism]], invoke the 20th-century French thinker [[albert_camus_absurdism_and_its_reflections_in_bojack_horseman|Albert Camus]] and his philosophy of [[absurdism_and_existentialism_in_the_series|Absurdism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. For Camus, the universe is irrational and meaningless, yet humans desperately seek reason and meaning within it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. This discrepancy is "The Absurd" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>. Upon becoming aware of The Absurd, one has three choices: return to the daily cycle and ignore it, commit suicide, or Camus's preferred option—rebellion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. Rebellion means accepting the absurd and choosing happiness anyway, defying the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.

Camus illustrates these ideas in his essay, *The Myth of Sisyphus*, about a man condemned to push a rock up a hill daily, only for it to roll back down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. Sisyphus becomes Camus's "Absurd Hero" when he recognizes the absurdity of his task but chooses to be happy despite it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.

The show directly references *The Myth of Sisyphus* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. Princess Carolyn notes, "I have to push a boulder up a hill and then have it roll over me time and time again" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. A recurring symbol is the baboon jogging up the hill outside BoJack's house, daily repeating the same task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>. He tells BoJack, "It gets easier. Everyday it gets a little easier. Butcha gotta do it everyday. That's the hard part" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.

At the end of Season Three, BoJack confronts the meaningless loop of his life when he encounters the young actress from "Ethan Around," who wants to be famous like him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>. As Camus describes, "It happens that the stage set collapses... At the end of the awakening comes, in time, the consequence: Suicide or recovery" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. BoJack runs out of the stage set and begins to drive into nowhere, a repeated attempt to escape the absurd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. When he releases the steering wheel, he submits to the Absurd and to suicide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. However, seeing the Wild Horses presents an alternative: embracing the absurd, carrying out the meaningless task, and finding happiness regardless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. Like Sisyphus, these horses embrace running purely for its own sake, serving as absurd heroes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.

## Conclusion

The show offers one potential solution to BoJack's struggle for meaning: family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. Many scenes BoJack watches from "Horsin' Around" revolve around the in-show family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. During his first major bender, he envisions himself as a simple family man <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>. His attempt to sleep with Penny at the end of Season 2 illustrates his desperation to start over and choose the domestic life he could have had with Charlotte <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>. The Wild Horses may symbolize not only the "Absurd Hero" but also the "herd" and a sense of belonging that BoJack lacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>. While the show seems prepared to explore this theme of family more deeply, it's suggested that even family may not be enough to fill the void <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>.

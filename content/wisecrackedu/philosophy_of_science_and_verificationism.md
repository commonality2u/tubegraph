## The Crisis of Knowing
Society is experiencing a "crisis of knowing" where trust in experts, including scientists, physicians, and government agencies, has rapidly eroded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This phenomenon, exemplified by the Flat Earth movement, highlights a larger issue: a general ignorance of how science works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. Understanding the philosophy of science can help address this problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

### What is the Philosophy of Science?
The [[Philosophy and Absurdism in Rick and Morty|philosophy of science]] is a branch of philosophy that asks fundamental questions about science, such as:
*   How do we distinguish science from non-science? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>
*   How should evidence be weighed when testing a hypothesis? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>
*   What constitutes acceptable evidence? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>
*   Essentially, "how do we know if we know shit?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>

While the [[falsification_and_scientific_method|scientific method]] is a component, it only scratches the surface of this complex field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. There are many philosophies of science, each with unique strengths and weaknesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. A lack of understanding about these frameworks allows for the misuse of scientific language, as seen in movements like Flat Earthers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

## Verificationism
In the early 1900s, a group of logical positivists proposed a scientific doctrine called **verificationism** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. This model posits that something is scientific if and only if it can be verified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. If a statement cannot be verified, it is not considered science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

For example:
*   A philosophical statement like "The meaning of life is 'be excellent to each other'" is not science because it cannot be verified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
*   A simple statement like "This swan is white" can be verified by observing the swan and having others replicate that observation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. In this model, if one wanted to verify the Earth's shape, they could observe it from space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. Flat Earthers sometimes allude to this idea by questioning direct, personal verification of the Earth's roundness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.

### Problems with Verificationism
A significant challenge for verificationism arises with universal statements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. For instance, the statement "All swans are white," which was widely accepted in Europe before the 1600s, poses a problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. Even if thousands of swans have been observed and all were white, one can never truly verify that *all* swans in existence are white <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. This problem was starkly illustrated by the discovery of black swans in Australia in the 1690s, which disproved the universal "all swans are white" statement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

The strict application of verificationism, requiring individuals to personally verify every fact, would be extremely limiting for scientific progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. This crisis for verificationism eventually led to the proposal of a new approach by Karl Popper: [[falsification_and_scientific_method|falsification]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

_Macbeth_ by William Shakespeare is described as a classical tragedy about a "righteous brutha who balls till he falls" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. The play primarily explores how "unchecked ambition and lust for power" lead to a character's demise, making Macbeth his "own antagonist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

## The Seeds of Ambition

The play begins with Macbeth, a general, and Banquo encountering "three witches" who deliver prophecies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. The witches declare that Macbeth will one day become king <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, and that Banquo's descendants will also become royals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. This prophecy immediately fuels Macbeth's ambition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## The Path to Regicide

Macbeth's ambition is significantly spurred on by his wife, [[lady_macbeths_influence | Lady Macbeth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. She pushes him to take action and seize the throne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Convinced by her, Macbeth murders King Duncan while the king is asleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. They then frame the two chamberlains by planting the bloody knife on them while they are passed out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

When Macduff discovers the king's body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>, Macbeth kills the chamberlains to prevent them from speaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Duncan's sons, Malcolm and Donalbain, flee due to paranoia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. With them out of the way, Macbeth becomes king <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

## Escalating Tyranny and Downfall

Macbeth's reign is marked by increasing paranoia and violence. Fearing the witches' prophecy about Banquo's descendants, Macbeth arranges for Banquo and his son Fleance to be killed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. While Banquo is killed, Fleance escapes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

Seeking further guidance, Macbeth consults the "three witches" again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. They deliver three new prophecies:
*   An armored head warns him to beware Macduff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
*   A bloody child states that no one "born of a woman" can harm him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
*   A crowned child holding a tree says he is safe until Great Birnam Wood moves to the castle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

Upon learning that Macduff has gone to England, Macbeth brutally orders the murder of Macduff's entire family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. Later, Macbeth learns that his wife, [[lady_macbeths_influence | Lady Macbeth]], has died by suicide, unable to cope with her guilt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

Malcolm returns with an army that advances towards Macbeth's castle using shields from Birnam Wood, fulfilling the prophecy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. Macduff, seeking revenge for his family, confronts Macbeth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. Macbeth, confident in the prophecy, asserts that Macduff, being "born of a woman," cannot harm him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. However, Macduff reveals he was born via C-section, effectively not "born" naturally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. Macduff then beheads Macbeth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>, and Malcolm reclaims his throne, ending Macbeth's tyrannical rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

## The Causes of Macbeth's Downfall

The play explores the complex reasons behind Macbeth's [[Tragic Consequences of Power Lust | downfall]]:
*   **Unchecked Ambition** Macbeth's own "unchecked ambition and lust for power" are significant factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
*   **Influence of Others**
    *   [[lady_macbeths_influence | Lady Macbeth]] is seen as a catalyst, as she "put a fire under his ass to merc the king" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
    *   The [[Role of the Witches in Macbeth | witches]] can be blamed for "feedin his ambition and givin him a big ol head" with their prophecies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   **Societal Norms** Scottish society of the time is also implicated, with a prevailing sentiment that one must "grab all the power you can, no matter who you gotta kill for it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. Initially, Macbeth received "mad props for butcherin his enemies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
*   [[Themes of Fate and Free Will | **Fate**]] Some interpretations suggest that Macbeth is not to blame at all, but is merely a "puppet" controlled by fate, making him act foolishly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. If Macbeth had "no choice," then his actions are seen as meaningless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

Shakespeare uses imagery of "clothes that donâ€™t fit good" to symbolize how Macbeth is living "way outta his depth" due to the combined pressure of fate, society, and his own ambition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

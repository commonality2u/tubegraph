The enduring popularity of the television series *The Office* is linked to its reflection of the widespread "bullsh*t" that has permeated professional lives and the economy as a whole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. This concept aligns with the work of anthropologist David Graeber, who argues that [[the_concept_of_nonsense_and_bs_jobs_within_the_office_and_real_life | BS jobs]] are proliferating throughout the developed world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>.

## Defining a "BS Job"

David Graeber defines a BS job as:
> "A form of paid employment that is so completely pointless, unnecessary or pernicious that even the employee cannot justify its existence even though as part of the conditions of employment the employee feels obliged to pretend that this is not the case" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>.

This definition highlights that while a job might "suck" (like cleaning toilets for minimum wage), it's not a BS job if someone genuinely needs to do it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>. The key distinction is the perceived pointlessness by the employee themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>.

## Dunder Mifflin as a Case Study

*The Office* portrays a branch of the struggling paper company Dunder Mifflin, where characters often sit around doing nothing at their desks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>. The series mocks familiar [[workplace_dynamics_and_character_archetypes_in_the_office | office archetypes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a> and speaks to anxieties about the changing American economy, where digitization and e-commerce have reshaped industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>.

Life at Dunder Mifflin is characterized by:
*   **Useless meetings**: Such as making acronyms like "Bow Body Bow Body" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>.
*   **Obsolete work**: A job nearing obsolescence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:00">[04:38:00]</a>.
*   **Random directives**: Following arbitrary directives from superiors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>.
*   **Search for meaning**: Employees desperately trying to find meaning in their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>.

Many employees are aware of the general pointlessness of their work, as Dunder Mifflin struggles to compete with modern chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>. Much of the day is dedicated to "nonsense meetings" or office romance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>.

### Character Examples of BS Jobs
*   **Jim Halpert**: Fills his time with distractions and pranks on Dwight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:00">[06:06:00]</a>, despite being seen as smart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>. He even moved his desk an inch at a time throughout a day to waste time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:00">[06:26:00]</a>.
*   **Pam Beesly**: Spends work time planning her wedding and conspiring with Jim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41:00">[06:41:00]</a>, and even invents a job for herself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:00">[06:46:00]</a>.
*   **Kevin Malone**: An accountant who can barely do math, he remained employed for years because firing him would be uncomfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:00">[06:50:00]</a>.
*   **Dwight Schrute**: Revels in bureaucracy, obsessing over rules, and inventing pointless bureaucratic structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:00">[07:10:00]</a>.
*   **Gabe Lewis**: Holds a "director" title but wields no power and cannot fire anyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>.
*   **Andy Bernard**: As manager, he spends months away from the office on a boat without anyone noticing, and without him, everyone else seems to excel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>.
*   **Michael Scott**: Explains Dunder Mifflin's business model as simply buying paper cut and dyed from a manufacturer and selling it for more, leading children to question its superfluity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15:00">[08:15:00]</a>. He is convinced his job is to break up monotony for staff well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:40:00">[10:40:00]</a> and feigns busyness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:04:00">[11:04:00]</a>.

## The Paradox of BS Jobs

Graeber highlights the paradox that a free market, theoretically, should eliminate such waste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:45:00">[08:45:00]</a>. Despite market pressures leading to layoffs and company sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:54:00">[08:54:00]</a>, the Scranton branch of Dunder Mifflin succeeds in spite of its inefficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:00">[09:14:00]</a>.

Culturally, there's an expectation to work 40 hours a week, leading to a "culture of looking busy" where managers create pointless tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:44:00">[09:44:00]</a>. Graeber argues that if you're not suffering at your job, it's not deemed worthy of fair compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:00">[10:04:00]</a>. This leads to optimizing suffering rather than efficiency, and hiring more useless people to ensure others who have nothing to do can appear busy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:10:00">[10:10:00]</a>.

## Harmful Psychological Effects

Pointless jobs are not just wasteful; they are "incredibly harmful to our psyche" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:21:00">[11:21:00]</a>. Graeber documents individuals who experienced depression, anxiety, and guilt from being paid to do nothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:26:00">[11:26:00]</a>. People derive pleasure from "being the cause," or having an effect on the world, even in a small way, and BS jobs rob them of this pleasure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:45:00">[11:45:00]</a>.

> Graeber invokes Dostoevsky, who theorized that "the worst torture one could possibly devise would be to force someone to endlessly perform an obviously pointless task" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:57:00">[11:57:00]</a>.

Many Dunder Mifflin employees are thwarted from "being the cause" by managers, bureaucracy, or the inanity of their tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:10:00">[12:10:00]</a>.

## Coping Mechanisms in *The Office*

The show explores how characters cope with their pointless professional lives, often by finding agency in other ways:
*   **Jim**: Finds agency through pranks on Dwight, admitting he'd "throw myself in front of a train" if paper were his career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:28:00">[12:28:00]</a>.
*   **Pam**: Copes through distraction, love, and family, noting it's not a "little girl's dream to be a receptionist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:57:00">[12:57:00]</a>.
*   **Stanley**: Endures with the hope of retirement, where he can carve wooden birds, and through "pretzel day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:02:00">[13:02:00]</a>.
*   **Oscar**: Ends the show running for state senate, a role where he could "theoretically produce change" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:23:00">[13:23:00]</a>.
*   **Kevin**: Finds happiness running a bar where he can competently bring joy to guests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:29:00">[13:29:00]</a>.
*   **Michael**: Denies the superfluous nature of his job by convincing himself of its paramount importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:37:00">[13:37:00]</a>, and his hatred for Toby stems from Toby infringing on his ability to be the cause in his own office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:44:00">[13:44:00]</a>. His need for love drives him to frame his job in grandiose terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:21:00">[14:21:00]</a>.
*   **Dwight**: Embraces the inanity, clinging to pomp and circumstance, and bureaucratic titles, desiring to be a "petty dictator" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:21:00">[15:21:00]</a>.

## Prevalence and Categories of BS Jobs

In 2013, the year *The Office* ended, a Harvard Business Review survey found that half of 12,000 professionals felt their job lacked meaning, and a British poll indicated 37% of workers found their jobs "utterly useless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:09:00">[16:09:00]</a>. Graeber theorizes that BS jobs persist partly because their existence seems antithetical to capitalism, and societally, people don't want to admit such a thing is possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:28:00">[16:28:00]</a>. He compares it to the Soviet Union inventing jobs for full employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:42:00">[16:42:00]</a>.

Another reason for the spread of BS jobs is the [[the_rise_of_the_service_economy_and_its_implications_on_job_satisfaction | rise of the service economy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:50:00">[16:50:00]</a>. While traditional service jobs remain steady, there's been a boom in administrators, consultants, clerical, accounting, and IT staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:04:00">[17:04:00]</a>â€”sectors where BS jobs proliferate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:13:00">[17:13:00]</a>.

Graeber categorizes BS jobs into several types:
*   **Flunkies**: Employees who exist solely to justify a manager's position or inflate their prestige <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:21:00">[17:21:00]</a>.
*   **Goons**: Those who exist only because other companies have similar roles (e.g., legal or marketing departments) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:28:00">[17:28:00]</a>.
*   **Duct Tapers**: Individuals who clean up the messes created by inefficient systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:32:00">[17:32:00]</a>.
*   **Box Tickers**: Those who exist solely to verify that some other (often non-existent) actual work is being done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:42:00">[17:42:00]</a>.
*   **Task Masters**: People who create BS work for other BS employees to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:49:00">[17:49:00]</a>.

As a company that doesn't actually make paper, Dunder Mifflin squarely exists within this service economy, justifying higher prices through customer service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:54:00">[17:54:00]</a>.

Ultimately, *The Office* resonates because its characters successfully cope with their BS jobs, often by finding love or simply leaving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:22:00">[18:22:00]</a>, offering an escapist fantasy where minimal work doesn't lead to being fired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:29:00">[18:29:00]</a>.

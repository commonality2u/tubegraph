*South Park* consistently analyzes, parodies, and dissects current events, making its satire particularly poignant due to its topicality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. While often appearing as a series of "dick and fart jokes," the show's core references can be quite profound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Satire of Disaster Films

*South Park* frequently uses disaster films as fodder for its episodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. The show's over-the-top hyperbole in these parodies [[the_films_satire_on_militarism_and_audience_perception | challenges the current trend of media fearmongering]] with doomsday warnings and apocalyptic scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

Notable parodies include:
*   "Pee" takes aim at films like *2012* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. In this episode, earthquakes and tsunamis of urine at "Pi Pi’s Splashtown" threaten children's lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.
*   "Pandemic" and "Pandemic 2: The Startling" spoof POV disaster movies such as *Cloverfield* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. Here, Giant Guinea Creatures terrorize the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.
*   "Two Days After the Day After Tomorrow" parodies *The Day After Tomorrow* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>, featuring a flood in Beavertown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.

In these episodes, a tiny event often sparks a disproportionate calamity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. For example, too many people peeing in a water park leads to a tsunami, or a single boating accident causes the town to believe an ice age is imminent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

## Critique of Media Sensationalism

*South Park*'s disaster episodes [[audience_complicity_in_media_narratives | consistently riff on the reactionary nature of the media, panic, and subsequent news coverage]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.
*   In "Two Days After the Day After Tomorrow," news reports inflate the death toll of Beaverton to "hundreds of millions" despite the town's population being only in the hundreds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.
*   Later, Chicago is reported to have 600 billion casualties, directly referencing news reports that inflated initial death tolls during Hurricane Katrina <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

The show offers a scathing indictment of current journalistic practices, which merely circulate news without fact-checking or independent verification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. The mention of people looting, raping, and committing acts of cannibalism without any actual reporting highlights this issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>, even predating what the show later deemed a "post-fact world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.

Similar to disaster narratives that instantly seek a cause or responsible party, the people of South Park are often less concerned with helping victims and more interested in assigning blame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. When Stan tries to admit he "broke the Damn," no one listens because it doesn't fit their narrative of blame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.

*South Park* takes common tropes of disaster films—thinly connected plot points, sketchy scientific discourse, shaky handheld cameras, and ridiculous, over-the-top catastrophe sequences—and pushes them to extremes. This serves to [[the_films_satire_on_militarism_and_audience_perception | reveal the inanity of both the disaster genre and contemporary journalism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.

## Broader Social Commentary

Following in the traditions of satirists like Jonathan Swift and Mark Twain, Trey Parker and Matt Stone paint a bleak picture of society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>. *South Park* "disembowels popular culture" and "cannibalizes the tropes and references that circulate through American discourse," re-presenting them to create a new understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.

The film *Idiocracy*, released in 2006, serves as a cultural artifact that embodies a perceived gradual degeneration of society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. Allegedly, Fox tried to bury the film due to concerns sponsors might be upset by its content, such as a Carl's Jr. advertisement stating, "Carl's Jr. F*** you, I'm Eating" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Despite these efforts, *Idiocracy* has become a cult classic, appreciated not only for its humor but also for its political prescience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

In *Idiocracy*'s America, a pro-wrestler becomes president, politics devolves into shouting matches, people gamble for healthcare, and corporations feign care for consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. The film is rooted in the real world in which it was written, made during the Bush era, and contains jabs at Bush's base of supporters, particularly in the Southern U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

## Corporate Infiltration in Idiocracy

One of Mike Judge's observations in *Idiocracy* that appears increasingly relevant is the infiltration of corporate culture into personal lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>.

*   **Corporate Slogans and Personal Interactions**: The movie features phrases like "Welcome to Costco, I love you," which seems only a few degrees separated from modern corporate social media accounts that emulate human emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>.
*   **Branding of Identity**: Characters in the film are named after brands, such as Frito, Dr. Lexus, Formica, Velveeta, Hormel, and President Dwayne Elizondo Mountain Dew Herbert Camacho <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>. Beef Supreme is also mentioned, humorously imagined as an unreleased Taco Bell masterpiece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.
*   **Corporate Control and Mergers**: Taco Bell has potentially merged with AOL and the U.S. Government to provide long-distance phone service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. Carl's Jr. is depicted as having the authority to take custody of children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>. The House of Representin' is even sponsored by "Uhmerican EXXXPress" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>.
*   **Government Officials as Spokespeople**: The film features a Secretary of State who explicitly states, "I'm the Secretary of state, brought to you by Carlâ€™s Jr." and explains that they are paid every time they say it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>.

## Real-World Corporate Influence

Mike Judge's depiction of corporate infiltration was not invented out of thin air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>. While corporate lobbying dates back to at least the 18th century, the election of a Vice President who was formerly a CEO of an oil company brought new fears of corporate influence on American politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>. Examples include:

*   Obama's economic advisors, who resembled a "who's who" of Goldman Sachs alumni <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>.
*   Criticism of a Verizon executive chairing the FCC and trying to eliminate Net Neutrality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>.

*Idiocracy* imagines a sports drink company buying the FDA and FCC to push its agenda, which is presented not as a prophecy but as "on-the-nose hyperbole about how politics already works" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>. The rise of branded content, where companies pay for articles that appear as public discourse (e.g., an airline paying Buzzfeed for "10 Must-See Travel Destinations"), further diminishes the distinction between public discourse and private companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>. This means no one can escape corporate influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>.

## The Spectacle-ization of Politics

This diminishing gap between corporations and public life has contributed to the [[the_role_of_appearances_in_politics_based_on_house_of_cards | spectacle-ization]] of politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>. Corporations, media, and government have combined to create a "grotesque Frankenstein where only sex and violence can capture the public imagination" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>.

In *Idiocracy*, politics has devolved into shouting matches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>, and the justice system becomes a farce based on nonsensical appeals to common sense, resembling a gladiatorial fight combined with a monster truck rally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. Retail HJs, porn, balls-kicking, and farts are depicted as the primary means of entertainment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

## Conclusion

*Idiocracy* is described as a "hilarious snapshot of early 2000's paranoia" about the world's direction, though its paranoia is sometimes misdirected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>. Regardless, it functions as a cautionary tale about what happens when people "cede their ability to think critically and just become mindless consumers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>. The film highlights how audiences can find complicity and enjoyment in excess.

The enduring popularity of *[[the_popularity_of_the_office_and_its_cultural_impact | The Office]]*, which remained the most streamed show on Netflix for years, is baffling to some, given its off-air status for over six years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Part of the show's "secret sauce" is its reflection on the prevalence of "bullsh," or actual BS, which has permeated professional lives and the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Unlike shows where characters might sit in a cafe all day, *The Office* depicts characters doing nothing all day, but at a desk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. The show's appeal is argued to stem from its depiction of the "prevalence of complete and utter BS" in modern work and the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

## Defining "Bullshit Jobs"

[[anthropologist_david_graebers_theory_on_bs_jobs | Anthropologist David Graeber]] proposes that "BS jobs" are proliferating throughout the developed world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. He defines a BS job as "a form of paid employment that is so completely pointless, unnecessary or pernicious that even the employee cannot justify its existence even though as part of the conditions of employment the employee feels obliged to pretend that this is not the case" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. This definition seems to capture the essence of life at Dunder Mifflin, where employees sit in useless meetings, follow random directives, and desperately try to find meaning in a job nearing obsolescence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

While some jobs might simply "suck," like getting minimum wage to scrub toilets, a BS job is distinct because its existence is fundamentally unjustifiable even to the employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. Many Dunder Mifflin employees are aware of their work's general pointlessness; the company struggles against modern chains, and management fails to adapt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. Despite the threat of downsizing, much of the workday is spent on nonsense meetings, office romance, and other distractions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

Indeed, [[anthropologist_david_graebers_theory_on_bs_jobs | Graeber]] often documents individuals who believe their BS job wouldn't be missed if it disappeared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. A prime example is Andy, who spends months away from the office as manager without anyone noticing a drop in productivity; in fact, the branch seems to excel without him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

## The Paradox of BS Jobs in a Market Economy

[[anthropologist_david_graebers_theory_on_bs_jobs | Graeber]] highlights the paradox that a free market theoretically promises to eliminate such waste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. If a job were truly pointless, market pressures should correct it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. Dunder Mifflin faces these pressures, experiencing layoffs, mergers, and sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. Yet, the Scranton branch continues to succeed despite its rampant inefficiency, incompetent managers, and employees who often don't remember their job titles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.

Culturally, there's an expectation to be in the office for 40 hours a week, even if there's little real work to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. This leads to a "culture of looking busy" and managers creating pointless tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. Employees often claim their jobs are important, if only to justify their rent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. [[anthropologist_david_graebers_theory_on_bs_jobs | Graeber]] suggests a general sense that if one isn't suffering at their job, it's not worth fair compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. Thus, efficiency is sacrificed for "optimizing suffering" to prove worthiness of a paycheck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.

## The Rise of the Service Economy

[[anthropologist_david_graebers_theory_on_bs_jobs | Graeber]] theorizes that the rise of the service economy is another reason for the spread of BS jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>. While traditional service jobs like waiters and barbers have remained stable, the broader service economy, encompassing administrators, consultants, clerical staff, accountants, and IT professionals, has boomed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>. Not all these jobs are BS, but this sector is where BS proliferates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>.

[[anthropologist_david_graebers_theory_on_bs_jobs | Graeber]] categorizes BS jobs into several types:
*   **Flunkies**: Employees existing solely to justify a manager's position or inflate their prestige <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>.
*   **Goons**: Roles existing because other companies have them, such as legal or marketing departments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>.
*   **Duct Tapers**: Those who clean up the messes created by inefficient systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>. Michael Scott, at one point, explicitly states, "I am the toilet of this office. I flush away annoying problems so others can keep their hands clean" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>.
*   **Box Takers**: Employees who verify that actual work is being done, even if it's not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>.
*   **Task Masters**: Those who create "BS work" for other "BS employees" to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>.

Dunder Mifflin, a company that doesn't actually manufacture paper, fits squarely within this service economy model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>. They justify their higher prices with customer service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>, and Michael Scott's goal is to hire and inspire people, not necessarily for business growth, but to fulfill his own need for love by creating a pseudo-family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>.

## Implications on Job Satisfaction and the Psyche

[[anthropologist_david_graebers_theory_on_bs_jobs | Graeber]] argues that pointless jobs are not merely wasteful but "incredibly harmful to our psyche" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. He documents individuals suffering from depression, anxiety, and guilt due to being paid for doing little <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. This issue extends beyond government work into the private sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>, with people remaining unhappy even when they have perks like long lunches or company-funded travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>.

Instead, [[anthropologist_david_graebers_theory_on_bs_jobs | Graeber]] suggests people derive pleasure from "being the cause," meaning having a tangible effect on the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>. Pointless jobs deprive individuals of this pleasure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. Drawing on Dostoevsky's theory of torture, [[anthropologist_david_graebers_theory_on_bs_jobs | Graeber]] notes that endlessly performing an obviously pointless task is one of the worst forms of torment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. Many Dunder Mifflin employees are thwarted from "being the cause" by managers, bureaucracy, or the inanity of their tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.

The show often focuses on how characters cope with their meaningless professional lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>. Jim, bored with his job, finds agency and "being the cause" by pranking Dwight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. Pam copes through distraction, eventually finding love and family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. Stanley looks forward to retirement and "Pretzel Day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. By the series finale, Oscar runs for state senate, and Kevin finds happiness competently running a bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.

Michael Scott, on the other hand, denies the superfluousness of his job by believing in its paramount importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. His extreme dislike for Toby seems to stem from Toby infringing on Michael's ability to "be the cause" in his own office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>. Michael's need for love and respect, driven by a lonely childhood, leads him to grasp at meaning by framing his job in grandiose terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.

A 2013 Harvard Business Review survey found that half of 12,000 professionals felt their job lacked meaning, and another poll indicated that 37% of British workers considered their jobs "utterly useless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. [[anthropologist_david_graebers_theory_on_bs_jobs | Graeber]] attributes the continued existence of BS jobs partly to their antithetical nature to capitalism, as society is unwilling to admit such waste is possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>. He suggests that, like the Soviet Union inventing jobs for full employment, modern societies have found a similar outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>.

The show's enduring appeal lies in its escapist fantasy, where characters aren't fired for minimal work, and they successfully cope with the BS, often by finding love or simply leaving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>. This suggests that for many, happiness in life may involve finding a better job or achieving a domestic life fulfilling enough to outweigh work misery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:42">[00:18:42]</a>.

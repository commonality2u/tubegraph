William Shakespeare's *Macbeth* is presented as a classical tragedy about a once-righteous character who ultimately falls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. A central theme explored in the play is the extent to which [[character_analysis_of_macbeth_and_lady_macbeth | Macbeth's]] actions are a result of his own choices, or if he is merely a puppet of [[predestination_vs_free_will | fate]] and external forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

## The Influence of Prophecy and External Forces

The narrative begins with [[character_analysis_of_macbeth_and_lady_macbeth | Macbeth]] and Banquo encountering three [[role_of_the_witches_in_macbeth | witches]] who deliver prophecies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. These prophecies state that [[character_analysis_of_macbeth_and_lady_macbeth | Macbeth]] will become king and that Banquo's descendants will also be royalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. Later, [[character_analysis_of_macbeth_and_lady_macbeth | Macbeth]] seeks out the [[role_of_the_witches_in_macbeth | witches]] again for new prophecies:
*   An armored head warns him to beware Macduff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
*   A bloody child states that no one "born of a woman" can harm him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
*   A crowned child holding a tree proclaims he is safe until Great Birnam trees advance towards the castle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

These prophecies play a significant role in fueling [[character_analysis_of_macbeth_and_lady_macbeth | Macbeth's]] ambition and dictating his subsequent actions, leading to the question of whether he is merely acting out a predetermined destiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

## Blame and Responsibility

The play presents multiple perspectives on who is to blame for [[character_analysis_of_macbeth_and_lady_macbeth | Macbeth's]] tragic downfall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
*   **Lady Macbeth's Influence:** [[character_analysis_of_macbeth_and_lady_macbeth | Lady Macbeth]] is depicted as a strong catalyst, urging [[character_analysis_of_macbeth_and_lady_macbeth | Macbeth]] to assassinate King Duncan to seize the crown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. Her instigation raises questions about [[character_analysis_of_macbeth_and_lady_macbeth | Macbeth's]] sole culpability for his "boot-leg fate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
*   **The Witches' Role:** The [[role_of_the_witches_in_macbeth | witches]] are also considered a source of blame for "feedin his ambition and givin him a big ol head" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.
*   **Societal Pressure:** Scottish society of the time is implicated, as the prevailing mindset encouraged individuals to "grab all the power you can, no matter who you gotta kill for it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. This societal acceptance of violence for power further complicates the idea of individual free will, as [[character_analysis_of_macbeth_and_lady_macbeth | Macbeth]] was initially praised for his violent acts against enemies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

## Macbeth as a Puppet of Fate

Some interpretations suggest that [[character_analysis_of_macbeth_and_lady_macbeth | Macbeth]] is not to blame at all, but rather that "fate slingin him around like a puppet, making him act like a serious fool" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. This perspective highlights the question of whether he truly has choice in his actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

### Meaninglessness and Lack of Choice
After the death of [[character_analysis_of_macbeth_and_lady_macbeth | Lady Macbeth]], [[character_analysis_of_macbeth_and_lady_macbeth | Macbeth's]] reflections on life emphasize a sense of meaninglessness:
> "Cuz if Macbeth ain’t got no choice, then all this sh*t is straight meaningless." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>

This sentiment underscores the tragic realization that if [[predestination_vs_free_will | fate]] is truly in control, then human agency is rendered futile.

### Symbolism of Ill-Fitting Clothes
Shakespeare employs the imagery of "clothes that don’t fit good" to symbolize [[character_analysis_of_macbeth_and_lady_macbeth | Macbeth's]] struggle and the idea that he is "livin way outta his depth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. This symbolism reinforces the notion that [[character_analysis_of_macbeth_and_lady_macbeth | Macbeth]] is overwhelmed by the combined pressures of [[predestination_vs_free_will | fate]], society, and his own ambition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

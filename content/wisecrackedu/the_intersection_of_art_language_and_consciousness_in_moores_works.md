Alan Moore, a prolific author of acclaimed comics such as *Watchmen*, *Miracleman*, and *The Killing Joke*, identifies as a "ritual magician" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. His understanding of magic is not about parlor tricks, but rather a profound philosophical system rooted in Hermeticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. For [[alan_moore_and_his_philosophy_on_magic_and_hermeticism | Moore]], magic is intrinsically linked to art, language, and consciousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Defining Magic: Consciousness, Language, and Art

[[alan_moore_and_his_philosophy_on_magic_and_hermeticism | Moore]], a student of Hermeticism, views it less as a religion and more as a set of practices aiming to understand the world through alchemy, astrology, and theurgy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. Theurgy, in this context, involves achieving spiritual perfection to grow closer to God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. Hermetic teachings, based on the mythical Hermes Trismegistus (a blend of Hermes and Thoth, gods of Language and Wisdom), emphasize the core connection between language and understanding as the heart of magic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

In his upcoming work, *The Moon and Serpent Bumper Book of Magic*, [[alan_moore_and_his_philosophy_on_magic_and_hermeticism | Moore]] defines magic as "a purposeful engagement with the phenomena and possibilities of consciousness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. He posits that reality can be categorized into the material (physical stuff like matter and energy) and the immaterial (mental models formed by our brains from sensory input) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. We never experience material reality directly; our brains construct an immaterial model of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

## Art and Language as Bridges Between Realities

Art serves as a prime example of how the material and immaterial interact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. [[alan_moores_influence_on_comics_and_the_significance_of_his_works_like_jerusalem | Moore]]'s intangible idea for *Watchmen* became a tangible form through Dave Gibbons' artwork, demonstrating how a thought can have a physical effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. Conversely, language can alter perception; simply mentioning Doctor Manhattan's appearance can conjure an image in a reader's mind, acting as a "genuine spell" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. For [[alan_moore_and_his_philosophy_on_magic_and_hermeticism | Moore]], magic is precisely this bridge between the material and the immaterial, with "art, language, symbols" serving as the tools of this "wizardry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. He states that "magic is intrinsically connected with art, language and consciousness to the point where these four things almost become different aspects of the same phenomenon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.

### Storytelling as Spell-Craft

This principle is evident in illusions like the rabbit-duck image, where a simple statement can change one's fixed perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. [[the_impact_of_storytelling_and_imagination_on_human_culture_and_consciousness | Storytelling]], therefore, is a form of "spell-craft" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>, capable of both casting and dispelling illusions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. As an anarchist, [[alan_moore_and_his_philosophy_on_magic_and_hermeticism | Moore]] views money as a destructive illusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. In *Miracleman*, the character abolishes money, declaring it "imaginary" and real only if believed in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

In *Promethea*, [[alan_moores_influence_on_comics_and_the_significance_of_his_works_like_jerusalem | Moore]] illustrates how changing one's thought about something can magically alter it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. When protagonist Sophie changes her approach to the demon-king Asmodeus from anger to humane respect, his appearance shifts to human, as "expectation creates perspective" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. Even Doctor Manhattan in *Watchmen* is a magician in this sense, his external appearance being a reflection of his internal self-perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

## Macrocosm, Microcosm, and the Tree of Life

[[alan_moores_influence_on_comics_and_the_significance_of_his_works_like_jerusalem | Moore]] uses *Promethea* as a grand spell, telling a story about "everything" to change collective perceptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. This aligns with the Hermetic principle of "macrocosm and microcosm," expressed as "As above, so below" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. This principle suggests that every level of reality reflects every other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. Understanding a part of the pattern allows understanding of the whole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

The structure of *Promethea* is deliberately based on the Kabbalah’s Tree of Life, which [[alan_moore_and_his_philosophy_on_magic_and_hermeticism | Moore]] sees as a "roadmap to all reality, including our inner lives" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.
*   **Bottom rung**: Mere perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.
*   **Above that**: Imagination (the ability to form mental models) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.
*   **Further up**: Capacity for art and language (tying ideas to sounds, symbols, pictures, and stories) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.
*   **Highest levels**: Emotion and reason <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.

At the macroscopic level, the physical universe is the "basest sphere of the world’s soul," above which is the collective unconscious, culminating at "The All. The One. God." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. The series' thirty-two issues correspond to the ten Spheres and twenty-two Paths of the Tree of Life, making the series itself a macrocosm and a particular issue a microcosm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

## Solve et Coagula: Deconstructing and Reconstructing Perception

Another Hermetic principle [[alan_moore_and_his_philosophy_on_magic_and_hermeticism | Moore]] employs is "Solve et Coagula" ("Separate and Combine"), which involves breaking something down to understand how its parts fit together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. Doctor Manhattan's arc in *Watchmen* exemplifies this, as he learns to move beyond merely separating humans into "abstract arrangements of atoms" to conceptually recombining them into "holistic four-dimensional objects" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.

In *Promethea*, Sophie defeats a writer by understanding that his power over the land of fiction comes from being a collective pen name, which she can break down into separate styles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.

[[alan_moores_influence_on_comics_and_the_significance_of_his_works_like_jerusalem | Moore]] applies "Solve et Coagula" to language itself in *Jerusalem*, breaking written words into their phonetic and graphetic components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>. He crafts dialogue that appears as "gibberish" but makes sense phonetically, forcing readers to perceive multiple layers of meaning simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. This technique is designed to train the reader to perceive more dimensions than they normally would, in a text about how the universe itself has more dimensions than are normally perceived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>. This process "magically chang[es] how our mind models the world by changing the language with which our minds construct that model" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>.

## The World's End: A Leap of Consciousness

For [[alan_moore_and_his_philosophy_on_magic_and_hermeticism | Moore]], when a universally accepted way of viewing the world ends, the "World ends" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. In *Promethea*, Sophie brings about the Apocalypse by explaining Hermetic principles, causing everyone to perceive the immaterial and material worlds as equally "real" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. This mirrors [[alan_moore_and_his_philosophy_on_magic_and_hermeticism | Moore]]'s belief that humanity is "amphibious," living in both matter and mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. *Promethea* aims to make people more aware of the "vast immaterial realm," tempting them to explore it, akin to a "great Devonian leap from sea to land" – from matter to mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.

[[alan_moore_and_his_philosophy_on_magic_and_hermeticism | Moore]] believes that humanity's ideas about the world originated from a similar "leap from matter to mind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>. Representation, through language, allowed for "humanity’s first ‘purposeful engagement with the phenomena and possibilities of consciousness,’" from which sprang "the entirety of human culture: writing, painting, song, music, theatre, science, medicine and even politics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. Thus, the world, as we know it, can end in the same way it began <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.

In 2016, [[alan_moore_and_his_philosophy_on_magic_and_hermeticism | Moore]] released his "magnum opus," [[alan_moores_influence_on_comics_and_the_significance_of_his_works_like_jerusalem | Jerusalem]], intending it as a "ten-year ritual working" to have a "beneficial effect upon the consciousness of its readership" and bring about a "world-wide Revelation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>. This ambitious work seeks to have the reader experience higher states of consciousness as they are described, similar to how the Heptapods' language in *Arrival* affects perception of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. By replicating linguistic styles found in works like *Finnegans Wake*, [[alan_moores_influence_on_comics_and_the_significance_of_his_works_like_jerusalem | Moore]] explores how certain forms of "insanity" might lead to a perception of external [[human_understanding_of_reality | reality]] closer to the truth than conventional "sanity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. Doctor Manhattan's simultaneous perception of all moments in his life, while "different" from "sane" individuals, is considered by [[alan_moore_and_his_philosophy_on_magic_and_hermeticism | Moore]] to be *more* sane, as time is regarded as a "stubbornly persistent illusion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.

## Conclusion

For [[alan_moore_and_his_philosophy_on_magic_and_hermeticism | Moore]], magic is not supernatural but deeply integrated with human cognition. It is the active, purposeful engagement with consciousness through the tools of art and language. If [[alan_moore_and_his_philosophy_on_magic_and_hermeticism | Moore]] is correct, magic is as real as our imagination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>. The Revelation in *Promethea* emphasizes that imagination is "the only thing we can really be certain isn’t imaginary," the source of all human culture and creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>. Art and language, born from this imagination, are the true "wizard’s wands," capable of shaping our [[human_understanding_of_reality | reality]] and consciousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

*Django Unchained* is a film that offers a clever and nuanced [[criticism_of_slavery_in_django_unchained | criticism of slavery]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. Beyond its typical Quentin Tarantino hallmarks, the movie provides subtle commentaries on slavery, particularly through the lens of [[critique_of_character_agency_in_the_film | character agency]] and the act of "acting out of slavery" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>.

## Agency in the Context of Slavery

Academic debate surrounds the question of [[societys_impact_on_personal_agency | agency]] for enslaved individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. While some perspectives suggest that slaves were entirely stripped of their humanity, others explore the forms of freedom they were able to exert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>. Historical examples of slave resistance include work slowdowns, arson, and even murder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>. However, the horrific retaliations for such acts often dissuaded many from rebellion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>. In *Django Unchained*, acting serves as a primary means through which characters, particularly Django and Stephen, manifest their [[societys_impact_on_personal_agency | agency]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>.

## Django's Strategic Performance

Django's journey is heavily reliant on his ability to "play a character" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>. As bounty hunter King Schultz prepares him for their mission to trick Calvin Candie and rescue Broomhilde, Django is given a specific wardrobe to complete his role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>.

His [[themes_of_existential_freedom_and_choice | agency]] is expressed through the decisions he makes while enacting this role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>. These decisions, such as berating other slaves, lashing out at Candie's crew, or appearing to approve when a runaway slave is attacked by dogs, are not depicted as morally good or bad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>. Instead, they represent the choices he makes within the limited [[societys_impact_on_personal_agency | agency]] granted to him for survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>.

This [[comparison_between_realism_and_theatricality_in_film_acting | acting range]] proves crucial later when Django outsmarts a gang of Australians to regain his freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>. He performs convincingly, even using props like a handbill, to manipulate the Australians into handing him a gun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>.

## Stephen's Performed Power

Perhaps the most striking example of [[societys_impact_on_personal_agency | agency]] through acting is Calvin Candie's head house slave, Stephen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>. Stephen's intense hatred for Django <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a> likely stems from envy: Stephen achieved power within the system of slavery, while Django gained freedom by breaking out of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>.

However, both Stephen and Django employ dramatic arts for personal gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>:
*   **Escape from Labor** Stephen performed his way out of the harsh field labor into the relative comfort of Candie's home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>.
*   **Verbal Disagreement** He reached a point where he could even snap back and disagree with his master <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>.
*   **Performed Laughter** Stephen uses exaggerated laughter at Candie's jokes to gain trust and influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>.
*   **Strategic Revelation** This influence is evident when Stephen, not Candie, realizes Schultz and Django's deception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>.
*   **Non-Verbal Acting** Stephen also performs a fake limp, requiring a fake cane, to appear physically weak and disarm suspicions about his capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>.

While Stephen is depicted as a villain, his actions are contextualized by the severe limitations of slavery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>. He served his white master's interests over his fellow slaves, but he might not have had other options to gain any form of freedom or power within his circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>. Stephen is presented as trying to manifest his own power with the extremely difficult cards he was dealt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>.

Ultimately, *Django Unchained* uses the [[the_influence_of_historical_acting_styles_on_modern_cinema | role of acting]] as a powerful means to explore [[societys_impact_on_personal_agency | agency]] and [[themes_of_existential_freedom_and_choice | choice]] within the oppressive system of slavery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>. This perspective contributes to the film's sharp [[criticism_of_slavery_in_django_unchained | criticism of slavery]] and white supremacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>.

[[analysis_of_ari_asters_midsommar | Director Ari Aster]]'s 2019 film *Midsommar* presents a chilling portrayal of a Midsummer festival in the Swedish countryside. While the film is a horror story, it raises questions about the authenticity of its depicted rituals compared to real Swedish traditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Fictional Depictions in Midsommar
*Midsommar* is not concerned with total anthropological fidelity, and many of its more shocking elements are not part of genuine Swedish Midsummer celebrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.
*   **Bloodbaths and Sacrifices** The film's depiction of a bloodbath where grandpas jump off cliffs or foreigners are burned to a crisp is not characteristic of the real holiday <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. According to Poe Tidholm, author of *Celebrating the Swedish Way*, there have never been any sacrifices on Midsummer, even in ancient times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
*   **Sexual Rituals** The "weird sex stuff" in the film, including Christian's ritualistic encounter, was entirely the twisted brainchild of [[analysis_of_ari_asters_midsommar | Aster]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
*   **Psychedelics** While celebrating Swedes do enjoy drinks, they are "far more likely to get boozy than they are to trip balls" on psychedelics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

## Authentic Elements and Research
Despite the fictional liberties, [[analysis_of_ari_asters_midsommar | Aster]] conducted extensive research, spending months drawing from Swedish traditions, folklore, and Norse mythology to create the film's environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
*   **Midsummer Traditions**
    *   Real Midsummer is a light and happy tradition celebrating summer and fertility, involving dancing around maypoles, decorating with ferns and plants, and visiting holy springs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
    *   Härga, the rural village in the film, is a real place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.
    *   Much of the film's imagery, including the maypole, eating herring, and wearing flower wreaths, is consistent with real Swedish Midsummer celebrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
    *   The somewhat creepy paintings on the barn walls are true to real agrarian Swedish societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.
    *   The blessing of crops is a tradition plucked from James George Fraser's 19th-century anthropological study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.
    *   Baby-making is a significant part of Midsummer, leading to a peak in Swedish births about nine months after the summer solstice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
*   **Runic Alphabet** [[analysis_of_ari_asters_midsommar | Aster]] learned the Scandinavian runic alphabet. Every item of Härga clothing is decorated with specifically chosen runic symbols and a hieroglyphic language invented for the film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.
    *   Christian's robe during the fertility ceremony features the upward arrow "Tiwas" symbol, associated with the Nordic god Tyr, representing bravery, masculine energy, and virility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. Tyr's sacrifice of his hand is fitting for Christian's fate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.
    *   Dani's dress has two runes: the R-shaped "Rivo" for journey, and the hourglass-shaped "Thauggaz" which can mean new beginning or loss of hope, both relevant to her character arc <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
*   **Love Rituals**
    *   Härga young women are seen picking different types of flowers, mirroring the real-life tradition where Swedes pick seven different kinds of flowers to put under their pillow to conjure dreams of their future mate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.
    *   [[analysis_of_ari_asters_midsommar | Aster]] insisted that the "love spells" like a pubic hair in a pie and menstrual blood in a drink came from actual Swedish folklore, though confirming these practices has been difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

## Norse Mythology and Viking Folklore
[[analysis_of_ari_asters_midsommar | Aster]] also drew inspiration from long-debated Viking mythology and folklore for the film's darker aspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
*   **Sacrifices** Certain historical accounts from the prehistoric Viking period depict sacrifices of animals and humans, said to occur every nine years. While disputed by scholars, these accounts suggest such sacrifices, if they happened, likely predated 1050 A.D. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
*   **Bear Carcass** Christian being placed inside a bear carcass before being burned alive relates to Norse mythology. Viking men donned bear skins before battle, believing the skins protected them from fire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
*   **Blood Eagle** The gruesome "blood eagle" ritual, where Simon's lungs are splayed open, is a reenactment of a Viking torture ritual first documented in 865 A.D. Scholars are unsure if this ritual was physically possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

## Conclusion
[[analysis_of_ari_asters_midsommar | Aster]] deliberately combined truth and fiction, old and new mythology, and history to construct *Midsommar*'s unsettling world where "ritualized human sacrifice is as normal as sourdough bread" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. This blend allows the film to comment on [[modern_secular_perspectives_versus_traditional_rituals_in_midsommar | modern secular aversion to mystical traditions]], showcasing a society's fear and aversion to ritual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.

Harper Lee's *To Kill A Mockingbird* serves as a direct [[social_commentary_on_violence_and_societal_structure | criticism]] of the American South during the Depression era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

## Systemic Corruption and Injustice

The book highlights that institutions such as the courts, schools, and even the church in the South were controlled by corrupt individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. A key example is the unjust conviction of Tom Robinson, who was found guilty of rape despite clear evidence of his innocence, simply "Cuz' he black" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Defense lawyer Atticus Finch demonstrated in court that it was actually Bob Ewell's daughter who had made advances on Tom, leading to her father's violent retaliation against her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

Another instance of societal manipulation occurs when town authorities cover up Boo Radley's stabbing of Bob Ewell, deciding that Ewell "fell on his knife" to protect Boo, comparing it to "Shootin' a mockingbird" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. This highlights the town's willingness to bend the rules when it suits them, contrasting with their rigid application against Tom Robinson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

## Societal Ideals and Maturation

The novel also critiques the deeply ingrained Southern racism and ignorance, as initially embodied by Scout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. However, through her interactions with Boo Radley and Tom Robinson, Scout matures and develops a more realistic understanding of people, highlighting the theme of learning valuable lessons through exposure to those who are different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. Her "paradigm shiftin' moments" teach her that individuals like Boo and Tom are simply trying to navigate life like everyone else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

The character of Jem, particularly his crippled arm, serves as a metaphor for America's "jacked up justice system" and its "backward ass ideals" from its inception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. This symbolizes a disabling scar on the nation that, while it may heal, will leave a lasting impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

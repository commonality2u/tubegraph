[[Deadpools Popularity and Success | Deadpool’s popularity and success]] in mainstream media is unprecedented, with the film becoming the highest-grossing R-rated movie ever and the biggest opening for Ryan Reynolds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This success is notable as the character shirks the traditional superhero formula; Deadpool is not fighting for the greater good, is not selfless, nor is he family-friendly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. As a [[Philosophical influences on Marvel characters | Marvel character]] who is an overt ripoff of a DC competitor, Deadpool constantly makes fun of the medium he inhabits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. His popularity reflects an old trend in media, tied to a 400-year-old book <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## The Postmodern Merc with a Mouth

Deadpool is set apart from the rest of the [[Philosophical influences on Marvel characters | Marvel Universe]] by a few defining features: he is an inveterate wiseass, knows he is a superhero, constantly breaks the fourth wall, and comments on comic book tropes and culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. He takes nothing seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Even the film's ad campaign was designed in a "Deadpoolian" fashion, trolling partners with Valentine's Day ads and setting up self-referential jokes, including a Tinder profile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

The best way to describe Deadpool is as a [[Postmodernism and Self Awareness in Deadpool | postmodern]] work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. [[Postmodernism and Self Awareness in Deadpool | Postmodernism]] in arts and philosophy typically rejects grand narratives that traditionally made sense of the world, such as the battle of good against evil, democracy versus communism, or the inherent promise of technological progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. [[Postmodernism and Self Awareness in Deadpool | Postmodern]] works often "thumb their nose at tradition" and embrace being "meta" and self-referential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

Deadpool is hyper-aware of himself and his place in the superhero genre <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. The film is filled with jokes about Ryan Reynolds, including references to *The Green Lantern* and his "Sexiest Man Alive" status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. While traditional superhero films feature the triumph of good over evil, Deadpool, in postmodern fashion, disregards this, opting for revenge and love instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

This tension between old world narratives and postmodernism is explored in the film through several subversions:
*   Colossus attempts to rope Deadpool into the role of a traditional, family-friendly superhero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
*   The Dopinder subplot subverts classic narratives of courtly love, showing that kidnapping a rival is more effective than chivalry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
*   Blind Al is a deranged version of the "deformed protagonist takes refuge with benevolent blind benefactor" narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
*   Deadpool's love interest is a prostitute turned stripper, not a "fair maiden" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

Deadpool can be seen as a spiritual successor to *Don Quixote*, a 400-year-old novel considered a proto-[[Postmodernism and Self Awareness in Deadpool | postmodern]] work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. *Don Quixote* also made fun of the heroes of its era, employed meta-narratives, and featured a fictional author retelling a story within a story, with the author constantly breaking the fourth wall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. *Don Quixote* was written during a time of radical skepticism, just before the Enlightenment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>, and similarly aimed to simply "have a few laughs" at society's expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. Deadpool signals a similar disenchantment with "old righteous narratives" in contemporary society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

## Ironic Distance and Cynicism

The self-awareness seen in Deadpool is increasingly taking a cynical tone in culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. Joss Whedon criticizes this trend, exemplified by a scene in *Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom* where Indiana Jones's self-referential moment about his gun is an "inside joke" for the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. Whedon believes this "self-reference for the sake of self-reference" has engulfed modern film, television, and literature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

This cynical self-awareness is evident in:
*   The *Tarzan* trailer, where Jane overtly references her "tired role" as a damsel in distress, apologizing for using recycled tropes instead of innovating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.
*   *Star Trek Into Darkness*, which justifies its ending by saying "Hey—remember this great scene in cinema? Now it’s opposite day!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.
*   *22 Jump Street*, which has the same plot as *21 Jump Street* but relies on the audience identifying with Ice Cube calling out the repetition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.

Hollywood, as a "decrepit machine fueled by the ideas of yesteryear," acknowledges its lazy clichés with a "wink and a nod" or uses irony to undercut dramatic moments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. Deadpool employs both tactics, breaking the fourth wall to include the audience in the joke and avoiding serious drama <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. Hollywood maintains familiar structures but distances the audience from sincerity to make them feel new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

Deadpool's humor is largely driven by this sense of cynicism and ironic distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. He remains unphased in high-stakes situations, and even combat scenes are undercut by self-aware humor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. Deadpool is "immune to criticism" because he is defined by his cynicism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. He deconstructs any trope that would give meaning to film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. His core motivation, Wade Wilson's journey to become "hot again" to reclaim his lost love, is a shallow endeavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. Deadpool evades criticism because he has no moral scruples or values to defend, and his identity is purely reactionary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. He risks nothing and simply makes fun of everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

Deadpool also has "0 fucks to give," as evidenced by its self-deprecating ad campaign and its acknowledgment of its own glaring flaws, such as the overuse of superhero tropes or budgetary constraints (e.g., Negasonic Teenage Warhead being the equivalent of a "Walmart bargain bin DVD") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. However, the question remains whether a movie is "good" simply because it is aware of and apologizes for its lacking qualities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.

## Cultural Implications

This trend poses a danger: it never creates anything new, leading to an "endless spiral of meta" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. Deadpool shares similarities with hipster culture, which ironically loves clichés, endlessly recycles culture, and constantly positions itself against the mainstream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. Douglas Haddow described the danger of the hipster as "the end of Western civilization itself," a culture lost in the superficiality of its past and unable to create new meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. Deadpool does not reinvent the superhero genre; it exists only to make fun of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.

The core problem with Deadpool and similar films is that while "bashing the system" may feel good and make us laugh, it is ultimately powerless and does not change the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. As Slavoj Zizek notes, "cynical distance, laughter, irony, are, so to speak, part of the game. The ruling ideology is not meant to be taken seriously or literally" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. Hipsters see themselves as countercultural by embracing clichés like PBR and ironic mustaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. Similarly, Deadpool perceives itself as countercultural by celebrating its own played-out clichés and overused storyline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.

This cultural impasse reflects a society unsure of its direction, having "beaten the Commies" and with its music, film, and literature dominating the world market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. Deadpool can say "Fuck it" because he does not fear death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. If life is limitless, how can anything be taken seriously, and how can there be consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>? This "fuck it" attitude, similar to the initial approach to the Deadpool comic book, arises when there's a belief that the product is either uncancellable or, conversely, about to be cancelled, leading to writing as if nothing matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.

The question remains whether Deadpool merely uses fourth-wall breaking to put a "shiny makeover over the same old shit," functioning as the "ultimate cynical film," or if it truly achieves something new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.

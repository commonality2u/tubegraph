Film analysis involves studying the details of a film, such as a single shot, a needle drop, a line of dialogue, or a sudden cut, to reveal layers of meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Seemingly insignificant choices can convey more in under twenty seconds than other films manage in two hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Analysis of *The Wolf of Wall Street*'s Closing Shot

The closing shot of *The Wolf of Wall Street* is a simple push-in and crane-up that, according to some interpretations, changes the meaning of the entire film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. As a client describes "the pen," his voice is drowned out by solemn music, marking a sudden shift from the poppy, upbeat hits previously used to underscore the film's debauchery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

Throughout most of its runtime, *The Wolf of Wall Street* revels in Jordan Belfort's excess and lifestyle, which is paid for by defrauding investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. Unlike similar films where corrupt brokers are punished, *The Wolf of Wall Street* lacks overt moralizing; Belfort's prison sentence is a "cakewalk" and he doesn't serve his full term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. In the end, "nothing has changed" as Belfort continues to sell and people continue to buy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

The final shot can be interpreted in several ways, adding to the film's complexity as a "true totem of our culture of excess" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

### Interpretation One: A Mirror to the Audience and Culture

One interpretation is that the final shot holds up a mirror to the moviegoers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. The backlight behind the seminar evokes a projector shining on the back of an audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. This suggests that the blame for the moral depravity in the film lies not solely with Jordan Belfort, but with the audience and the culture that enables and encourages his behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

Belfort states that people want to "get rich quickly" and "want something for nothing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. His scam wouldn't work if the audience didn't share his dream of instant wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. Director Martin Scorsese is essentially calling out the audience for having spent three hours "partying with Jordan," laughing and reveling in his exploits, and vicariously wishing they could live his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. This highlights a [[cultural_critique_in_cinema | cultural critique]] inherent in the film's conclusion.

### Interpretation Two: Money as a False Religion

The scene, with many people staring intently at one person and hanging on his every word, can be seen as reminiscent of religious worship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. Martin Scorsese, a devout Catholic, has frequently explored his faith in his films <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. However, in *The Wolf of Wall Street*, characters worship money instead of traditional faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

The camera focuses on the "painfully average faces" of these people, who are desperate and "plain-looking," seeking meaning and desiring that which can elevate them above their mundane existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. Scorsese might be cynically likening the transformative power of faith to the transformative power of money, with the caveat that "The Almighty never promised a million bucks in eight easy steps" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

### Interpretation Three: The Pleasure of Being Taken Advantage Of

A more sinister interpretation suggests that by solemnly portraying a crowd that worships Jordan despite his detestable actions, Scorsese implies that people actually enjoy being taken advantage of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. This aligns with the philosophy of Jean-Fran√ßois Lyotard, who famously suggested that, historically, the English unemployed found a perverse enjoyment in their grueling conditions, "the mad destruction of their organic bodies," and "the decomposition of their personal identity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

This closing image could indicate the voluntary submission of the masses, who not only tolerate white-collar criminals stealing their money but find a "perverse enjoyment" in their banal existence under the heel of figures like Jordan Belfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

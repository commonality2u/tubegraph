*Breaking Bad* Season Number One, created by Vince Gilligan, introduces viewers to Walter White, a 50-year-old man who decides to manufacture methamphetamine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. The series critiques struggling American healthcare and economic systems, highlighting how both the highly educated Walter and Jesse Pink-man fail to thrive within them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

## Walter White's Economic Struggles

Despite appearing to live what was once naively called the "[[american_dream_and_moral_declined_in_breaking_bad | American Dream]]", Walter White struggles financially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. He can only bring home "sub-par bacon," a significant failing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. Even though Walter makes "socially acceptable moves," the [[american_dream_and_moral_declined_in_breaking_bad | American Dream]] has failed him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. His decision to enter the illegal drug trade offers him "exciting growth opportunity" and a "very, very relaxed dress code" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Walter's expertise in chemistry, which offers insight into his troubled psyche, also hints at his own metamorphosis from a chemistry teacher to a volatile substance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

## Jesse Pink-man's Marginalization

Walter's partner, Jesse Pink-man, is portrayed as an underachiever who struggles with basic tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. Throughout Season One, Jesse attempts to achieve societal legitimacy but is routinely marginalized by various groups, including business professionals and his own parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. The duo's shared incompetence in criminal matters is reflected by the background television programming they watch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

## The Healthcare System's Failure

Walter's drastic actions, such as manufacturing methamphetamine, are ironically taken to earn money for his cancer treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. However, this pursuit transforms him into a "societal cancer" himself, as he gains energy while contributing to the deterioration of others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. Only by operating outside the law can Walter achieve the respect and mobility he desperately desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

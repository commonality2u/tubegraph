The concept of meaninglessness, particularly through the lens of absurdism, is a central theme explored in *Rick and Morty*, especially highlighted in the season 3 premiere, "The Rickshank Redemption" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. The show often goes beyond mere [[nihilism_and_existential_themes_in_rick_and_morty | existential themes]] to actively subvert audience expectations for meaning or hope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.

## Absurdism in *Rick and Morty*

*Rick and Morty* deeply engages with [[philosophy_and_existentialism_in_rick_and_morty | existential themes]], often showing Rick's creations despairing over their existence, exhibiting resentment towards their creators, and Morty grappling with his unique life philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:02">[00:40:02]</a>. Beyond this, the show also delves into "Absurdism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>.

According to French philosopher Albert Camus, human existence is cruel and absurd because humans seek meaning in a universe that remains silent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:03">[01:11:03]</a>. Camus famously used the image of a man pushing a boulder up a mountain for eternity as a metaphor for the human condition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:04">[01:22:04]</a>. In this spirit, *Rick and Morty* presents an absurd, meaningless multiverse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:02">[01:28:02]</a>.

Rick Sanchez consistently trivializes everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:04">[01:32:04]</a>, not believing in concepts like love or tradition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:03">[01:38:03]</a>. His companionship with Morty is even alleged to be a means to hide his genius brain waves from the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:02">[01:48:02]</a>. "The Rickshank Redemption" further emphasizes themes of the arbitrary nature of social systems, mockery of sentimentality, and overall pointlessness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:02">[01:54:02]</a>.

## Subverting Meaning: From Season 2 to Season 3

While both absurdism and [[cosmic_nihilism_and_its_depiction_in_rick_and_morty | existentialism]] contend that we live in a meaningless world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:03">[02:13:03]</a>, the transition from Season 2 to Season 3 definitively establishes *Rick and Morty* as an "absurd" work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:03">[02:18:03]</a>. This is achieved by dangling meaning and hope in front of the audience, only to rip it away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.

At the end of Season 2, Rick momentarily steps away from his sociopathic behavior to have a heartfelt moment at Birdperson's wedding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>. This emotional sincerity is immediately undercut when Tammy is revealed to be a spy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>. Unlike Rick's usual cynicism, this subversion comes from an external force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>. Later, after seeing the hardships his family faces due to him, Rick seemingly sacrifices himself to the Galactic Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:01">[03:07:01]</a>. This cliffhanger suggests a potential shift, hinting that Rick might be grappling with living with meaning despite knowing life's meaninglessness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>.

This potential for Rick to create meaning in a meaningless world echoes a philosophical debate: it's an idea championed by many existentialists but firmly rejected by Camus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:03">[03:39:03]</a>. Camus criticized authors like Fyodor Dostoevsky for proposing absurd worlds where characters understand life's frivolity, only to "chicken out" and retreat to the comfort of meaning, such as religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>. For Camus, an absurd work *does not provide a reply* to existence, unlike existentialists who might resort to hope or creating meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:02">[04:14:02]</a>.

While Season 2's ending might have suggested *Rick and Morty* would retreat into meaning and sentimentality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>, "The Rickshank Redemption" definitively doubles down on the absurd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>.

### The Mockery of Meaning in "The Rickshank Redemption"

The season 3 premiere actively mocks the audience's desire to find meaning and hope in Rick's actions:
*   **Rick's Imprisonment as a Ploy**: Rick's seemingly selfless imprisonment was merely a strategic ruse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:04">[04:54:04]</a>. The show responds to the prospect of a humanized Rick with a promise of an even darker journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>.
*   **Jokes on Meaning-Seeking**: The humor in "The Rickshank Redemption" largely stems from the *audience's attempt* to draw meaning, rather than just the inherent meaninglessness of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:04">[05:14:04]</a>.
*   **Fake Origin Story**: Rick presents a memory of his family's brutal murder as the origin of his deranged scientist persona <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:04">[05:30:04]</a>. This classic anti-hero tragic backstory baits the audience to empathize, but it's revealed to be a complete ruse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:04">[05:46:04]</a>.
*   **Undermined Altruism**: Rick saving Earth from the Galactic Federation might seem like a heroic act for a "greater good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:04">[06:08:04]</a>, but Summer's comment suggests the new world order is equally undesirable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:19:02">[06:19:02]</a>.
*   **Disregard for Family**: The idea that Rick cares about Morty and Summer is repeatedly toyed with. He rushes to rescue them from the Council of Ricks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:05">[06:30:05]</a>, then exhibits casual disregard for Summer's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:04">[06:42:04]</a>, only to reveal it was part of a strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>. Ultimately, he admits he only saved them so Beth wouldn't kick him out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:04">[06:55:04]</a>.

## The Szechuan Sauce and the Absurd Hero

The culmination of this meaninglessness is Rick's obsessive quest for the Szechuan dipping sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:04">[07:07:04]</a>. Rick is not motivated by family, justice, or love, but a forgotten promotional condiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>. The show suggests his entire series arc will be dedicated to this absurd quest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:02">[07:20:02]</a>.

This love for Szechuan sauce signifies nothing; it's a reflection of the absurdity of being driven by *anything* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:39:00">[07:39:00]</a>. In a world devoid of meaning, an absurd quest for plum-flavored McNugget sauce is as valid as any other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:49:00">[07:49:00]</a>. The quest itself is meaningful only as a joke about meaninglessness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:03">[08:00:03]</a>.

Camus defines an "Absurd hero" as someone who understands and finds happiness in the pointlessness of it all, fully comprehending the "lucid indifference" of the cosmos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:07:02">[08:07:02]</a>. This description aligns with Rick, whose knowledge of the vast multiverse where anything can happen defines his existence, leading him to reduce morals to genetic programming and yearn for Szechuan sauce despite his omnipotence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:02">[08:23:02]</a>.

However, a key difference exists: Camus's absurd heroes find happiness, while Rick is clearly in great pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:03">[08:44:03]</a>. Perhaps Rick's true arc will not be to care more or be nicer, but to genuinely enjoy life's absurdity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:00">[09:01:00]</a>.

The ultimate joke *Rick and Morty* plays on its audience is the prospect of Rick ever finding genuine meaning, specifically highlighted by the Szechuan sauce. If one believed Rick's self-sacrifice indicated a belief in family, justice, or anything else, they were "had" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:01">[09:17:01]</a>.

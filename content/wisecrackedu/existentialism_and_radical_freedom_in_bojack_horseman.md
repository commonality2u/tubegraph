*BoJack Horseman*, despite its colorful animation, talking animals, and Hollywood glamour, hides a dark and depressing reality beneath its lighthearted veneer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. The show focuses on the disillusionment that comes from looking beneath the surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, revealing the ugly, narcissistic truth behind the dazzling façade of "Hollywoo" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This industry is described as a "pretty town that’s smack on top of all that black tar," where by the time you realize you’re sinking, "it’s too late" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

More broadly, Hollywoo serves as a metaphor for existence itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Just as the façade of Hollywoo covers up the reality of a hollow industry, the trappings of daily life cover up the meaninglessness of existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. This idea, known as [[existential_nihilism_and_bojack_horseman | Existential Nihilism]], is foundational to the show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. The central question *BoJack Horseman* explores is how to cope if life is truly meaningless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

## Part 1: Distract Yourself

A primary way characters in *BoJack Horseman* cope with the anguish of a meaningless world is through distraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

*   **Princess Carolyn** consistently distracts herself with her job and her compulsive need to fix the lives of those she cares about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. Despite complaining about work, she cannot handle free time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a> and finds ways to return to the Hollywoo grindstone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   **Todd** is happy as long as he has "something to do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. Without a task, he immediately spirals into existential despair, questioning his purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. He keeps busy by composing a space opera, building his own Disneyland, and starting numerous businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.
*   **Mr. Peanutbutter** lives in a constant state of distraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. Though seemingly unintelligent, he reveals a deep self-awareness: "The universe is a cruel uncaring void. The key to being happy isn't the search for meaning. It's to just keep yourself busy with unimportant nonsense. And eventually... you'll be dead" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
*   **BoJack** himself lives a life of trivial distractions, often making the show joke about not showing what he does half the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. For years after "Horsin' Around" ended, he drifted in a near-constant state of distraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

### The Problem with No Distraction

In the first episode, BoJack has an anxiety attack that sends him to the hospital, leading Princess Carolyn to note he "doesn't do anything but take it easy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. The show poses a common question about celebrities: with everything, why aren't they happy? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>

This query was addressed by 17th-century philosopher Blaise Pascal, a precursor to the Existentialists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. Pascal believed that when humans have too much time to think, they contemplate their own insignificance, leading to unhappiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. He stated, "I have discovered that all the unhappiness of men arises from one single fact: that they cannot stay quietly in their own chamber" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. Pascal identified distraction as a natural psychological defense mechanism, allowing humans to be functional, if not happy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

Pascal applied this to kings, stating that even a king with every pleasure, "if he be without diversion and be left to consider and reflect on what he is, this feeble happiness will not sustain him" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. Similarly, BoJack, having no serious struggles, spends his life trying to distract himself from the reality of his situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

The "charade" of BoJack's distraction collapses when he reads Diane's book, "One Trick Pony" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. He is forced to confront an honest reflection of himself, including his self-deception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. The book highlights how his fame allowed him to be "constantly surrounded by distraction and wouldn't have to be alone with yourself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

With his distraction gone, Pascal would suggest turning to God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. However, Hollywoo is portrayed as a "post-God-Is-Dead world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. The Christmas Special uses Santa Claus as a stand-in for discussing the non-existence of God, stating he's "a lie that grown ups made up because we like to believe that there’s an order to the universe and that good behavior will lead to happiness but the fact is that just isn’t true" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

Attempting to force distraction after the illusion is broken leads to tragedy in *BoJack Horseman* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>:

*   **Secretariat** gives young BoJack advice to "run straight ahead... no matter what" and "don't you ever look behind you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. However, after being disqualified from racing, he can no longer outrun the truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.
*   **Sarah Lynn** is dragged on a months-long bender by BoJack, which tragically ends in her overdose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.

## Part 2: [[themes_of_existential_freedom_and_choice | Radical Freedom]]

From the outset, BoJack rejects responsibility, stating, "I’m responsible for my own happiness? I can’t even be responsible for my own breakfast" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. He desires to escape the consequences of his "terrible life choices," proclaiming, "EVERYTHING IS MEANINGLESS! NOTHING I DO HAS CONSEQUENCE!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. After his first bender, he asks Diane, "Am I just doomed to be the person that I am? ...I know that I can be selfish and narcissistic and self destructive but underneath all that, deep down I'm a good person and I need you to tell me that I'm good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.

BoJack is afraid of what 20th-century French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre called "[[themes_of_existential_freedom_and_choice | Radical Freedom]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>, a core concept of his [[themes_of_existential_freedom_and_choice | Existentialism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. A key tenet of [[themes_of_existential_freedom_and_choice | Existentialism]] is "Existence Precedes Essence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. An object's essence, its purpose, comes before its existence (e.g., a hammer is made for hammering) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. For a Christian, humans are created by God with a purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

However, for an [[existential_nihilism_and_bojack_horseman | Existential Nihilist]], humans and horsemen "exist just because" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. There is no underlying purpose for BoJack's existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. There is nothing stopping him from stealing the D from the Hollywood sign or doing drugs, and nothing forcing him to do those things either <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. BoJack has "total control over every choice he makes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

This is Sartre's "[[themes_of_existential_freedom_and_choice | Radical Freedom]]," which is not meant to be comforting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>:

> "That is what I mean when I say that man is condemned to be free. Condemned, because he did not create himself, yet is nevertheless at liberty, and from the moment that he is thrown into this world he is responsible for EVERYTHING he does.” <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>

Diane encapsulates this idea, telling BoJack, "I don’t think I believe in 'deep down.' I kinda think all you are is just the things that you do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. There is no "good BoJack" deep down; he is "entirely defined by the choices he's made so far" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. As Todd puts it at the end of Season 3, "You are all the things that are wrong with you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.

While unsettling, this offers BoJack hope: he is not "doomed to be the person in that book" forever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. He possesses the freedom to change his actions and himself, though it is "entirely up to him to do so" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. The show provides an optimistic take on Sartre, using water as a metaphor for BoJack's [[themes_of_existential_freedom_and_choice | Radical Freedom]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. Initially overwhelmed by water, BoJack eventually recognizes it as "a medium of incredible opportunity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.

## Part 3: Embrace The Absurd

Mr. Peanutbutter's path to happiness after realizing nihilism, and Cuddly Whiskers' abandonment of his Hollywoo life to find happiness after recognizing its meaninglessness, invoke [[albert_camus_and_absurdism_in_bojack_horseman | Albert Camus]] and his philosophy of Absurdism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. For Camus, "the universe is irrational and meaningless" while humans are desperate to find reason and meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. This discrepancy is "The Absurd" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.

Upon becoming aware of The Absurd, one has three choices:
1.  Return to the cycle of daily life and avoid thinking about it.
2.  Commit suicide.
3.  Rebellion: "accept the absurd and be happy anyway, because screw the universe for thinking it can control how you feel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.

Camus illustrates this in his essay *The Myth of Sisyphus*, about a man condemned to push a rock up a hill daily only for it to roll back down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. Sisyphus becomes Camus’s "Absurd Hero" when he recognizes the absurdity but chooses happiness despite it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.

*BoJack Horseman* directly references *The Myth of Sisyphus*, with Princess Carolyn stating she has "to push a boulder up a hill and then have it roll over me time and time again" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. There is also a recurring symbol of a baboon jogging up the hill outside BoJack’s house, telling him, "Everyday it gets a little easier... Butcha gotta do it everyday. That's the hard part" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.

At the end of Season 3, BoJack faces the "meaningless loop of his life" when a young actress from "Ethan Around" tells him she wants to be like him and famous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>. As Camus describes, "It happens that the stage set collapses... At the end of the awakening comes, in time, the consequence: Suicide or recovery" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. BoJack runs out of the stage set and drives into nowhere, submitting to the Absurd and seemingly to suicide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. However, seeing wild horses, he is presented with an alternative: "Embrace the absurd carry out your meaningless task and be happy in spite of it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. Like Sisyphus, these wild horses embrace running purely for its own sake, finding happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.

## Conclusion

The show briefly offers [[the_concept_of_family_in_bojack_horseman | family]] as a possible solution to BoJack's struggle for meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. Scenes from his old show, "Horsin' Around," revolve around an in-show family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>, and BoJack has visions of himself as a simple family man <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>. His desperate attempt to start over with Penny illustrates his desire for the domestic life he could have had with Charlotte <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>. The Wild Horses may represent not just the Absurd Hero, but also a herd and a sense of belonging that BoJack lacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>. While the show seems to explore this theme of [[the_concept_of_family_in_bojack_horseman | family]] more, the video suggests that even [[the_concept_of_family_in_bojack_horseman | family]] may not be able to fill the void <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>.

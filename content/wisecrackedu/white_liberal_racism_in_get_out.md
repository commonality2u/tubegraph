Jordan Peele's social thriller *Get Out* uniquely explores race in America by targeting white liberals, rather than conventional subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. The film follows Chris Washington as he meets his white girlfriend Rose's parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Initially, it depicts awkward social interactions with white liberals, but it quickly shifts to a horrific scenario where Rose's parents host a slave auction, with a white man intending to implant his brain into Chris's body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

> "You have been chosen because of the physical advantages you enjoyed your entire lifetime. With your natural gifts and our determination, we could both be part of something greater. Something perfect." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>

The story was conceived by Peele after reflecting on the belief held by many Americans that the Obama presidency signaled a 'post-racial' era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. The film posits that this supposed "post-racial" liberalism is far more terrifying than commonly imagined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

## The Critique of "Post-Racial" Liberalism
*Get Out* confronts Chris with white people who claim to be "totally not racist" and to have "moved beyond" racism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. This disavowal, the film argues, paradoxically strengthens a suspicious relationship with black people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. The attempts of these characters to demonstrate their "not racist" stance only serve to further alienate Chris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

The Armitage family, in particular, exhibits an unnatural eagerness to discuss "black people stuff" around Chris, seemingly as proof of their non-racism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

> "By the way, I woulda voted for Obama for a third term if I could. Best president in my lifetime, hands down." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>

This tendency to "over-perform" acceptance of black culture only reinforces the perceived differences between them and makes Chris deeply uncomfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. This behavior allows any actual racism to be excused, provided one demonstrates being "down" with black culture and anti-racist concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

> "Cmon, I get it. White family, black servants, it's a total cliche." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>

## [[negrophilia_and_black_identity | Negrophilia]] and the Black Body
The film's second act reveals a pervasive white fascination with Chris’s blackness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Party guests inquire about the experience of being black in America and even declare that "black is in fashion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. This phenomenon can be understood through the concept of [[negrophilia_and_black_identity | negrophilia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

[[negrophilia_and_black_identity | Negrophilia]], a term that emerged in 1920s Paris, described the enthusiasm for black culture among the "hipsters" of the era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. According to writer Petrine Archer-Straw, for these Parisians, blackness symbolized "modernity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

> "Such a privilege to be able to experience another person's culture, ya know what I'm sayin?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>

However, this fascination had a problematic aspect: "Black personalities were either lionised or demonised in a manner that denied normality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. Black individuals could not simply exist as normal people; they were confined to stereotypes, either as brilliant artists or uncultured animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. *Get Out* illustrates both sides of this: Chris is celebrated for his cultural background, yet simultaneously subjected to dehumanizing comments like being called a "f***ing beast" if he "really pushed [his] body" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. Ultimately, the film argues that the white perspective dictates how black people are defined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

[[negrophilia_and_black_identity | Negrophilia]] in the film extends beyond cultural desire to a desire for the black body itself, both sexually and athletically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. This desire is problematic because it's not about understanding black people but rather using them to satisfy one's own desires, akin to "collecting them" rather than truly understanding them as humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

## Literal Colonization: The Coagula Procedure
*Get Out* takes [[negrophilia_and_black_identity | negrophilia]] to an extreme, portraying the literal colonization of the black body through the Coagula procedure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. Grandpa Armitage, unable to move past being bested by Jesse Owens, had his brain implanted into an athletic black body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. Similarly, Grandma Armitage's brain was placed into Georgina's body to allow her to "play dress up as a beautiful black woman" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. Chris faces a similar fate, auctioned off to a blind man who desires his "award winning photographer’s eyes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

The film highlights the extreme nature of liberal racism when Chris's new owner denies his purchase is racially motivated:
> "Please don't lump me in with that, I don't give a s*** what color you are. What I want is deeper. I want those things you see through." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>

## The Psychological Experience: The Sunken Place
The film provides insight into the psychological experience of black Americans navigating white America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. Chris's anxiety about meeting his girlfriend's parents and being one of the only people of color at the party demonstrates his struggle to navigate an overwhelmingly white space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.

Philosopher Frantz Fanon's experience as a black man in 20th-century France resonates with Chris's situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. Fanon described the "white man’s eyes" as a burdensome weight, causing discomfort and a feeling of being out of place in a white-dominated world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. Like Fanon, Chris is burdened by the effort to fit into a world from which he is fundamentally excluded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. He is forced to be two people simultaneously: a black man with his own identity and Rose's black boyfriend who must be agreeable no matter how absurd the questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

To navigate this, Chris must silence his own identity, a process made literal by the "Sunken Place" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. The Sunken Place is a hypnotic state where one's mind is separated from their body, leaving them to passively view their experiences "through a screen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. Jordan Peele explained that "The Sunken Place means we’re marginalized. No matter how hard we scream, the system silences us" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. This suggests that societies built on inequality inevitably silence those on the margins, forcing them to temper their true identities to "go with the flow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

### [[double_consciousness_and_structural_racism | Double Consciousness]]
The Sunken Place can be understood through sociologist W.E.B. Du Bois's concept of [[double_consciousness_and_structural_racism | double consciousness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. [[double_consciousness_and_structural_racism | Double consciousness]] is the internal conflict experienced by African Americans in a structurally racist society, leading them to view themselves through the perspective of the dominant white societal force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. Chris is repeatedly evaluated by white society's standards and desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>, leading to what Du Bois calls a "two-ness" in the black soul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. This imposition creates confusion about the authenticity of one's experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>, leaving Chris feeling like a helpless spectator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. The Sunken Place acts as a metaphor for Chris's life as a helpless spectator, a fear made literal by the Coagula procedure which threatens to permanently cast his black consciousness into the background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.

## Resistance and Emancipation
Chris ultimately avoids this fate by plugging his ears with cotton picked from his chair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. This act subverts poet Audre Lorde’s famous insistence that "the master’s tools will never dismantle the master’s house" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>. While Lorde suggested it was futile for the oppressed to use the oppressor's logic, *Get Out* shows Chris using cotton, a symbol of slavery, to assert his identity and escape a new form of enslavement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>. He also repurposes a bocce ball, arguably a symbol of the white elite, to take out Jeremy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>. Further, Chris uses a mounted deer, a symbol of his earlier powerlessness, to attack Dean, signifying his overcoming of that fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. Chris's escape from this near-enslavement is a radical assertion of his black identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.

## The True Monster
While Chris escapes the "Armitage plantation of horrors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>, the film's most terrifying moment arises from an unexpected source: the arrival of the police <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. The film's original ending depicted this devastating "worst-case scenario," but Peele chose a more triumphant conclusion for the final cut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>. The tension between the police sirens and Chris's friend Rod's arrival serves as a stark reminder that the real monster in *Get Out* is not a fictional boogeyman, but rather "the horrors of the system itself"—something that cannot be heroically defeated at a film's conclusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.

## Macbeth

Macbeth is initially introduced as one of the king's generals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Upon hearing the witches' prophecy that he will one day be king <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, Macbeth becomes "all geeked up bout bein big baller" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

After murdering King Duncan, Macbeth is described as "straight trippin after doin the deed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>, indicating his immediate distress and guilt. He then murders the chamberlains to prevent them from speaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a> and subsequently becomes king <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

As king, Macbeth grows paranoid, fearing that Banquo's lineage, as prophesied, will inherit the throne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. This paranoia leads him to send assassins to kill Banquo and his son Fleance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. Seeking more guidance, he revisits the [[role_of_the_witches_in_macbeth | three witches]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>, receiving new prophecies that seemingly guarantee his safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

Upon learning that Macduff has fled to England, Macbeth acts "ice cold" by ordering the murder of Macduff's entire family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. Despite the approach of Malcolm's army, Macbeth remains initially unconcerned, relying on the witches' prophecies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. His confidence shatters when he realizes the army's shields fulfill the prophecy of Birnam Wood moving to the castle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. Facing Macduff, he attempts to use the prophecy that "nobody born of a woman can touch him" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>, only to be defeated when Macduff reveals he was born by C-section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. Macbeth is then beheaded by Macduff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

The play presents Macbeth as a "classical tragedy about a once righteous brutha who balls till he falls" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. His downfall is primarily attributed to his [[themes_of_ambition_and_power_in_macbeth | unchecked ambition and lust for power]], which makes him his own antagonist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

## Lady Macbeth

Lady Macbeth is portrayed as an intensely ambitious and forceful character. Upon hearing of the prophecy for Macbeth, she scolds him for "wasting time" and urges him to "get off yo lazy white ass and take dat sh*t" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. She successfully convinces Macbeth to murder King Duncan while he sleeps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>, and she takes charge of framing the chamberlains by placing the bloody knife on them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

Later in the play, Lady Macbeth takes her own life because she "couldn’t get that blood off her hands" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>, suggesting that the guilt eventually consumed her.

## Influence and Responsibility

The play raises questions about the extent of Macbeth's responsibility for his "boot-leg fate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. Lady Macbeth is explicitly blamed for "put[ting] a fire under his ass to merc the king" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. The [[role_of_the_witches_in_macbeth | witches]] are also implicated for "feedin his ambition and givin him a big ol head" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

Scottish society of the time is also considered a contributing factor, as it promoted the idea that "you ain’t got a pair unless you grab all the power you can, no matter who you gotta kill for it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. Furthermore, Macbeth was initially celebrated for "butcherin his enemies at the beginning of the play" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

Some interpretations suggest that Macbeth is not to blame at all, but rather that [[fate_and_free_will_in_macbeth | fate]] controlled him "like a puppet, making him act like a serious fool" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. This perspective implies that if Macbeth had no choice, his actions become "straight meaningless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Metaphor of Ill-Fitting Clothes
> Shakespeare uses the image of ill-fitting clothes to symbolize how Macbeth is "livin way outta his depth" due to the overwhelming pressure from [[fate_and_free_will_in_macbeth | fate]], society, and his own ambition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

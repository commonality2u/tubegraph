*House of Cards* (the American version) delves into a dark and scandalous world of politics, chronicling [[character_analysis_of_frank_and_claire_underwood | Frank and Claire Underwood's]] relentless quest for power and the presidency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Its popularity can be linked to increasing public cynicism about the current state of American politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Unlike many American political dramas that either uncritically portray the system or offer a morally righteous character triumphing over a broken government, *House of Cards* rejects this narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Instead, it presents a process where raw power and cunning consistently prevail, posing the driving question: is there more to politics than pure spectacle? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>

## Aesthetics, Theater, and Politics

In the cynical world of *House of Cards*, characters are constantly maintaining an image, both publicly and privately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. The show's creators are notably obsessed with [[the_concept_of_aesthetics_and_theater_in_house_of_cards | aesthetics]], art, and beauty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Important political dealings often occur amidst reflections on art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>, and [[character_analysis_of_frank_and_claire_underwood | Claire's]] meticulously manicured appearance and wardrobe are frequently discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. However, once these "pretty aesthetics and art references" are peeled away, the world of *House of Cards* seems to reveal nothing substantial beneath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

The show's preoccupation with aesthetics also manifests in its frequent tributes to theater, particularly William Shakespeare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. [[character_analysis_of_frank_and_claire_underwood | Frank]] frequently uses soliloquies and asides, a theatrical device favored by Shakespeare, to explicate his inner thoughts to the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. The show's plot and characters often echo Shakespearean classics like *Macbeth* and *Richard III*, which inspire [[character_analysis_of_frank_and_claire_underwood | Frank's]] charming asides about his terrible behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. Even Petrov, during his White House visit, quotes Gorbachev quoting *Richard III*'s famous opening line: "...of an end to our winter of discontent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

Theater, aesthetics, and art collectively underscore a fundamental concept in the show: appearance drives politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. Politics is presented as theater, or at least a form of performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. For example, [[character_analysis_of_frank_and_claire_underwood | Frank]] visits his father specifically to "seem more human" before revealing his true, manipulative intentions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. His breaking of the fourth wall, addressing the viewer directly, blurs the distinction between the show, reality, and the theatrical nature of politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

### Politics as Entertainment

Contemporary commentators lament the transformation of politics into entertainment, where catchphrases and slogans supplant genuine political argument <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. This trend is evident in *House of Cards*, where [[character_analysis_of_frank_and_claire_underwood | Frank]] destroys Michael Kern's career over an op-ed he didn't write, and Kern self-destructs due to his inability to keep pace with media sensationalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. [[character_analysis_of_frank_and_claire_underwood | Frank]] even fabricates an incident—a brick through his window—to symbolize a supposed threat from "out of control teachers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

### The Realm of Appearances According to Hannah Arendt

German philosopher Hannah Arendt posits that the realm of appearances *is* the realm of politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. For Arendt, attempting to strip away appearances to uncover a core "truth" is futile because appearances and reality are intrinsically linked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. This idea stems from the ancient Greek Polis, where politics meant engaging in the Agora, a public space where individuals' words, rhetoric, and deeds were judged by their peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. In this context, one's political life was synonymous with how they appeared to others, much like an actor's performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

Arendt further argues that for humans, "appearance—something that can be seen or heard by others as well as ourselves, constitutes reality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. [[character_analysis_of_frank_and_claire_underwood | Frank Underwood]] grasps this concept, declaring, "We are nothing more or less than what we choose to reveal. What I am to [[character_analysis_of_frank_and_claire_underwood | Claire]] is not what I am to Zoe, just as Zoe is not to me, what she is to her father" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. This statement can be interpreted as [[character_analysis_of_frank_and_claire_underwood | Frank]] being a sociopath, with his revelations serving as carefully crafted manipulations designed to gain favor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

## The Problem of Sincerity and Hypocrisy

A common criticism of [[character_analysis_of_frank_and_claire_underwood | Frank]] is his lack of sincerity and frequent use of deception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. The notion that appearances are deceptive and unreliable is an ancient one, exemplified by Plato’s allegory of the cave, which suggests a "true" world exists behind misleading shadows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. Karl Marx utilized this Platonic distinction in his "Theory of Ideology," and even *The Matrix* rehashes this ancient idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. Modern commentators who complain about political media becoming a "grotesque spectacle" that conceals reality are essentially continuing this millennia-old argument <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

However, [[character_analysis_of_frank_and_claire_underwood | Frank]] and Arendt undermine this tradition by asserting that appearance *is* reality; there is no authentic reality hidden behind the world of appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. If viewers find it difficult to hate [[character_analysis_of_frank_and_claire_underwood | Frank Underwood]], it's because he lacks a stable, singular identity to despise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. He presents different personas to different people: a good husband to [[character_analysis_of_frank_and_claire_underwood | Claire]], a manipulative murderer to Zoe, a kind boss and lover to Meechum, a supportive friend to Freddy, a job creator, and a liar to almost everyone else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

The concept of hypocrisy, defined as acting inconsistently with stated beliefs or putting on "false appearances," is central to [[the_concept_of_aesthetics_and_theater_in_house_of_cards | the concept of aesthetics and theater in House of Cards]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. The term itself originates from the Ancient Greek word for "playacting," reinforcing the idea of politics as mere theater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. While history and even religious texts condemn hypocrites, the show suggests that the "search for true motives in politics" can have disastrous consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

Arendt warns that "The search for motives, the demand that everybody displays [their] innermost motivation... transforms all actors into hypocrites and 'hypocrisy' begins to poison all human relations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. The solution, for Arendt, is to recognize our inability to distinguish between "being and appearance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. When the façade of appearances is stripped away, it doesn't reveal a "real" person but merely "more mystery" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.

### Claire's Authenticity

In contrast to [[character_analysis_of_frank_and_claire_underwood | Frank]], [[character_analysis_of_frank_and_claire_underwood | Claire's]] portrayal suggests something authentic lies beneath her mask, which she suppresses to maintain her quest for power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. For instance, after Zoe Barnes's death, [[character_analysis_of_frank_and_claire_underwood | Claire]] immediately applies makeup, symbolizing how aesthetics suppress her true feelings of disgust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. Her affinity for art, like photography and origami, indicates a yearning for authentic self-expression and a desire to stop performing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

## Politics as Spectacle and Information as Commodity

*House of Cards* notably lacks democracy as a central tenet, reducing the political system to backroom dealings and media manipulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. [[character_analysis_of_frank_and_claire_underwood | Frank]] views Congress as a game of chess where pieces should be concealed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>, and public opinion is merely a variable to be manipulated or dismissed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. Even the media, ostensibly integral to democracy, is part of this larger political game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. Zoe Barnes is fed information beneficial to [[character_analysis_of_frank_and_claire_underwood | Frank's]] machinations, and Tom Yates is hired to write propaganda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.

French philosopher Jean Baudrillard takes the idea of politics as spectacle a step further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. Unlike those who argue deception masks an inner reality, Baudrillard contends that in modern media, there is no truth behind the lies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. Lies told by politicians and media gain their own independent existence, with information circulating like commodities on a stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>. [[character_analysis_of_frank_and_claire_underwood | Frank]] and Zoe literally barter for information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>.

Slugline, the new media standard in the show, prioritizes appearing edgy and bleeding-edge, to the extent that Zoe's work is not even checked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>. Baudrillard's concept of information devouring its own content is illustrated when [[character_analysis_of_frank_and_claire_underwood | Frank]] tells Zoe, "Is that true? It will be after you write it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>.

This circuit of information is seductive, as is [[character_analysis_of_frank_and_claire_underwood | Frank Underwood]] himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>. His appeal extends not only to characters like Tom Yates and Meecham but also to the viewer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. The show implies that if viewers are seduced by [[character_analysis_of_frank_and_claire_underwood | Frank Underwood]], it raises questions about society's political system: Do we enjoy the performance? Are we "doomed to fall in love with the real Frank Underwoods of the world?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>

*House of Cards* ultimately functions as a multifaceted exploration of the [[the_concept_of_aesthetics_and_theater_in_house_of_cards | politics of appearance]], whether through art or theater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>. The show challenges the ease with which appearances and reality can be disentangled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

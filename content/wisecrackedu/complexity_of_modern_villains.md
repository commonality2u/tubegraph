Villains are often considered the best part of a movie, evoking feelings of love to hate or fear, with an occasional touch of empathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Lately, there has been a noticeable shift in their portrayal, making them weirdly relatable and equipped with "cogent critiques of the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This shift is evident in characters like Killmonger from *Black Panther* and Screenslaver from *The Incredibles 2* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

[[evolution_of_film_villains | Villainy]] has consistently served as a reflection of the prevailing value systems and fears of its era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. The transformation from simple "mustache-twirling" antagonists to complex, philosophizing radicals illustrates how film villains embody the anxieties and spirit of their times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

## Historical Portrayals of Villains

### 1950s and Early 1960s: The "Other"
In the post-World War II era, particularly during the height of the Cold War, the world was often viewed in simplistic, black-and-white terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. Villains of this period were depicted as an inherent, inexplicable evil, primarily taking the form of "bad Russian people, bad Asian people, and very bad aliens" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. This "Other" was seen as intent on destroying American values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. Examples include amorphous threats like "the Blob" or the Creature from the Black Lagoon, and aliens designed to look exactly like humans, as in *The Invasion of the Body Snatchers*, which some critics interpreted as a fear of Communist infiltration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

Biblical sagas were also popular, perfectly embodying Cold War propaganda by pitting "God-fearing Americans" against "godless communists" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. Films like *Ben Hur*, *Quo Vadis*, and *The Ten Commandments* portrayed noble Judeo-Christian figures battling cruel, powerful despots of non-monotheistic religions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. These villains were one-dimensional representatives of larger "bad groups" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. Even when not explicitly foreign or pagan, they were anti-American, Communist double agents, a theme that continued into the spy mania of the 1960s with James Bond facing SMERSH agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

### Late 1960s and 1970s: Corrupt Systems and Blurred Lines
A definitive shift in villain portrayal occurred in the late 1960s and 1970s, a period marked by major social turbulence, the Civil Rights Movement, and the Vietnam War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. A startling drop in public trust in government, fueled by events like Watergate, dramatically changed movie villains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. Movies began shining a light on corrupt social systems, with evil politicians and public officials becoming prominent antagonists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

*   **[[villains_as_social_critics | Institutional Corruption]]**: Films like *All the President's Men* brought real-world scandals to the screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. Fictional accounts, such as Steven Spielberg's *Jaws*, depicted crooked mayors prioritizing profit over public safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. In *Chinatown*, a sinister billionaire suggests that his evil acts were born from circumstance, arguing that "in the right place, at the right time, theyâ€™re capable of anything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. This implied that power dynamics, rather than innate nature, created villains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.
*   **Corrupt Cops**: Corrupt police officers were a popular trope, seen in films like *Serpico*, which depicted a world where police corruption was an assumed fact, making an honest cop distrusted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. Other examples include *The Godfather*, *White Lightning*, *The French Connection*, and *The Conversation* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. Institutions had lost their "presumption of goodwill" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.
*   **Embodiment of Broken Systems**: Villains like Nurse Ratched from *One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest* turned a benevolent profession into a tool for suppressing individuality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. Similarly, in *East from Alcatraz* and *Cool Hand Luke*, those tasked with enforcing law or societal norms were recast as antagonists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.
*   **Blurred Hero/Villain Lines**: The 1970s further complicated distinctions, presenting conflicted, heavily-flawed protagonists with questionable morals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. These characters were either struggling with good and bad, or became villains due to circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. Examples include:
    *   Walter White from *Breaking Bad*, who evolves from an anti-hero to a [[villain_protagonist]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.
    *   Travis Bickle in *Taxi Driver*, a "heroic villain" swinging between violent intentions for both good and bad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.
    *   Sonny Wortzik in *Dog Day Afternoon*, a novice crook whose bank robbery is motivated by a noble cause (to fund his wife's sexual reassignment surgery), making him not a typical villain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.
    *   Despite these complexities, *Star Wars* stood out during this era for its "basic, black and white paradigm of good vs. evil" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.

### 1980s: Cartoonish Villains and Resurgent Fears
The 1980s saw a return to more cartoonish villains, often embodying the biggest threats of the time, ushering in an "us vs. them" paradigm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

*   **War on Drugs**: Villains sought "sweet drug money" in films like *Scarface*, *To Live & Die in L.A.*, and *Beverly Hills Cop* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. This portrayal of evil drug lords contrasted with the less-than-savory cops of the 70s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>. Films like *Tango & Cash* depicted roguish cops as protagonists despite engaging in violence, seen as justified against drug lords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.
*   **Cold War II**: A resurgence of Cold War anxieties led to "evil Russians" in films like *Rocky IV*, featuring the "decidedly not a charmer" Ivan Drago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. *Red Heat* featured a Soviet drug lord who was also a murderer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. The clearest example was 1984's *Red Dawn*, imagining a Soviet invasion of America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.
*   **Hints of Skepticism**: Despite the return to "the other as the enemy," some 80s villains continued to exploit corrupt institutions for personal gain, hinting at the 70s skepticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>. Gordon "Greed is Good" Gekko used the financial industry for his desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. Hans Gruber in *Die Hard* initially feigned a terrorist plot against a corporation's "legacy of greed" but was ultimately after money, demonstrating a facade of moral high ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.

### 1990s: Homegrown Terrorism and Complex Motivations
American cinema in the 90s focused on homegrown terrorists and "bombers next door," reflecting a decade dominated by headlines about domestic terrorism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. This was a prime time for complex anti-villains fighting localized battles with radical means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>.

*   **Philosophical Underpinnings**: Howard Payne in *Speed*, a former bomb squad officer turned psychopathic terrorist, was motivated not just by money but also by a sense of superiority and a philosophical desire for "meaning" and "purpose" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>. Kevin Spacey's John Doe in *Se7en* saw himself as a "chosen warrior" crusading against everyday sin, aiming to "set the example" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.
*   **Critiques of Society**: *Arlington Road* featured a villain who blended into suburbia while planning bombings, claiming to be a "messenger" pursuing a noble goal with a critique of government and "Clinton-era prosperity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>. *American Beauty* depicted the enemy as a homophobic neighbor, highlighting suburban anxieties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>. These villains often felt victimized by the system or circumstance and sought justice on their own terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>.
*   **Noble Causes and Violent Means**: Some villains had genuinely noble causes, railing against systems that wronged them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. In 1995's *The Rock*, General Hummel held San Francisco hostage to demand compensation for slain Marines' families <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>. This film posed the question of whether noble ends justify violent means, foreshadowing themes in later films <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>.

### 2000s: Nihilism and the War on Terror
The 2000s saw a new shift, as America confronted an existential threat to its safety and power, especially after 9/11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>. Christopher Nolan's *Dark Knight Trilogy* captured the popular imagination.

*   **Terrorism as Metaphor**: *Batman Begins* featured an international terrorist group, "The League of Shadows," and its leader, Ra's al Ghul, aiming to blow up Gotham's tallest skyscraper, a "remarkably-on-the-nose metaphor" for 9/11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>.
*   [[the_jokers_role_as_a_villain_and_societal_critique | The Joker]] in *The Dark Knight* became the decade's most salient villain, manifesting as "the spirit of terrorism" and the embodiment of "anarchy and chaos of a particularly destructive and nihilistic nature" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>. The film is rich with 9/11 iconography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>. Harvey Dent (Two-Face) represented how confrontation with such evil could corrupt even the noblest person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.
*   **Active Nihilism**: The Coen Brothers' Anton Chigurh from *No Country For Old Men* used a coin to decide fates, killing without greed or self-defense, embodying "principles that transcend money or drugs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>. He was an active nihilist who believed that if all morality is contrived, a coin flip was as good a way as any to decide life or death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>.
*   [[trivialization_of_violence_and_traditional_gangster_tropes | Meaninglessness of Life]]: Frank Costello in Martin Scorsese's *The Departed* refused to subscribe to rules, stating, "I donâ€™t want my society to shape me, I want to shape my society," and seeing life as a struggle where any actions to sustain oneself are excusable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>. The villainous creed of the 2000s was "no creed at all" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>.

## Complexity of Modern Villains (2010s onwards)
Today's villains reflect an increasingly divided America with low trust in government, media, and religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>. They embody "solutions that are way too radical and usually mind-bogglingly violent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>. Unlike 1950s villains who infiltrated good systems to corrupt them, modern villains often confront "objectively evil systems" that they wish to change for the better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>. The only factor making them villains is their "means of carrying out that change" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>, often involving extreme violence.

*   **[[villains_as_social_critics | Critiquing the Status Quo]]**:
    *   **Killmonger (*Black Panther*)**: Has a "legitimate critique" of how the world treats Black citizens and Wakanda's passivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>. He wants to instigate a militant uprising, but his radicalism ultimately leads to positive policy changes in Wakanda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>.
    *   **August Walker/John Lark (*Mission Impossible 6*)**: A utilitarian villain who wants to destroy a third of the world in the hopes of uniting the remaining two-thirds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:43">[00:19:43]</a>.
    *   **Thanos (*Infinity War*)**: Seeks to eliminate half the universe's population to solve resource scarcities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:03">[00:20:03]</a>.
    *   **Screenslaver (*The Incredibles 2*)**: Her motivation stems from a belief that the "endless repackaging of life into consumable media has made us all lazy passive observers" and that [[criticism_of_superhero_archetypes | superheroes]] contribute to keeping people "docile and meek" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>. Her plan is to mind-control heroes to ruin their public approval and force people to protect themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>.

These villains share an extreme plan that appeals to growing fears that the world is "screwed beyond repair" and requires drastic measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:33">[00:20:33]</a>. Audiences can empathize with their critiques of the system and their desire for change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:44">[00:20:44]</a>. In this "through the looking glass" reinterpretation of villainy, heroes are often cast as "slightly-flawed protectors of a status quo that nobodyâ€™s really happy with" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:52">[00:20:52]</a>.

Modern villains are a "weird mirror image" of 1950s villains: while the latter corrupted good institutions, "Killmonger-types" aim to effect positive change in corrupt institutions, albeit through destructive means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>. They merge the complexity and "apparent innocence of 90s villains" with the "social critiques of the 70s," opposing the nihilism of the 2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:14">[00:21:14]</a>. They believe in a cause worth fighting for, and with different approaches to social change, they might even resurface as complex heroes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a>.

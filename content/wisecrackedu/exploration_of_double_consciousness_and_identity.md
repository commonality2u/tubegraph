Jordan Peele's *Get Out* delves into the psychological experience of black Americans navigating white America, particularly through the lens of [[the_theme_of_isolation_and_seeking_authenticity | identity]] and the concept of "double consciousness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. The film portrays Chris Washington's journey as he confronts the challenges of existing in overwhelmingly white spaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.

## The Psychological Burden
The film's protagonist, Chris, experiences a profound sense of unease and alienation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. He feels like a "sore thumb" in the "creepy, confusing ass suburba," which serves as a metaphor for the emotional maze he must navigate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. Chris's interactions are often modulated for his white audience, leading him to suppress his own reactions, such as when dealing with the police or suspicions about his phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. This constant modulation forces Chris to be "two people at the same time: a black man with his own [[the_theme_of_isolation_and_seeking_authenticity | identity]], and, Rose’s black boyfriend who is nice to everyone no matter how absurd their questions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. He is caught between integrating into Rose's world and retaining his own [[the_theme_of_isolation_and_seeking_authenticity | identity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

Philosopher Frantz Fanon's experience as a black man in 20th-century France provides a parallel. Fanon described the "burdensome weight" of "the white man's eyes," which left him feeling "uncomfortable in his own body, and out of place in a world dominated by whiteness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. Like Fanon, Chris is "burdened by the weight of trying to fit in a world from which he’s fundamentally excluded" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.

## The Sunken Place
The process of silencing one's [[the_theme_of_isolation_and_seeking_authenticity | identity]] is made literal in *Get Out* through the "Sunken Place" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. This hypnotic state separates one's mind from their body, leaving them to passively view their own experiences through a screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. Director Jordan Peele clarified that "The Sunken Place means we’re marginalized. No matter how hard we scream, the system silences us" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. This implies that societies built on inequality inevitably leave those on the outside without a voice, or with only a "tempered version of their voice," where one's true [[the_theme_of_isolation_and_seeking_authenticity | identity]] must remain in the background for the sake of "going with the flow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

The "Sunken Place" also functions as a metaphor for Chris's own life as a "helpless spectator," tying back to his traumatic experience of passively watching his mother die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. The ultimate fear of losing oneself is literalized in the "Coagula procedure," where black consciousness is "literally pushed to the background to make room for the white mind," risking permanent consignment to the Sunken Place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

## [[concept_of_doublethink | Double Consciousness]]
The film's exploration of identity is further illuminated by sociologist W.E.B. Du Bois's term "[[concept_of_doublethink | double consciousness]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. Du Bois described it as the "internal conflict experienced by African Americans living in a structurally racist society" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. These societal conditions cause black people to "see themselves through the perspective of the dominant societal force, in this case, white people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. Chris is constantly evaluated by the "measuring tape of white society" and "certain forms of white desire" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. This constant examination leads to what Du Bois called a "two-ness" in the black soul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. This imposition results in confusion about the authenticity of one's experiences, leaving Chris feeling like a helpless spectator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

## Assertion of Identity
Chris's ability to resist the Coagula procedure and escape the "Sunken Place" by plugging his ears with cotton, a material associated with slavery, represents a radical assertion of his black [[the_theme_of_isolation_and_seeking_authenticity | identity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. This act re-purposes a tool of oppression to assert freedom and overcome the powerlessness he feared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.

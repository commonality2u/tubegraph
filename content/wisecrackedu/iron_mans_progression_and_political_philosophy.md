Tony Stark, also known as Iron Man, has a character arc throughout the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) that is focused on progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>. His relationships, morality, and ethics are described as highly adaptable and malleable, driven by what he considers "the greater good of mankind's necessary survival and undeniable progress" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:57">[01:03:57]</a>.

## Early Character and Objectivist Leanings
At the beginning of the first *Iron Man* film, Tony Stark is portrayed as completely self-centered, showing no concern for his "merchant of death" nickname or accusations of war profiteering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:12">[01:12:12]</a>. After witnessing the harm his weapons have caused in the hands of terrorists, Stark changes his mind and decides Stark Industries will cease weapon design and manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:20">[01:14:20]</a>.

By the start of *Iron Man 2*, while no longer personally selfish, his political philosophy, [[ayn_rands_philosophy_in_batman_v_superman | Randian objectivism]], is still explicitly founded on selfishness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:31">[01:14:31]</a>. [[ayn_rands_philosophy_in_batman_v_superman | Ayn Rand]] believed that maximizing one's own self-interest is the only rational way to live, an idea foundational to her defense of laissez-faire capitalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:39">[01:14:39]</a>. This philosophy is demonstrated in Tony's testimony before Congress:
> "You want my property? You can't have it. But I did you a big favor. I have successfully privatized world peace" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:52">[01:14:52]</a>.

## Progression to Self-Sacrifice and Political Shift
In *Avengers*, Stark progresses from being selfish to fully self-sacrificial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:57">[01:15:57]</a>. Initially, he criticizes Captain America's willingness to die in the line of duty, stating, "The only thing you really fight for is yourself... You're not the guy to make the sacrifice play, to lay down on a wire and let the other guy crawl over you. I think I would just cut the wire" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:06">[01:15:06]</a>. However, by the end of the battle, he demonstrates a willingness to self-sacrifice by flying a nuke through a wormhole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:27">[01:15:27]</a>. Although he did not lose his life, this near-death experience left him psychologically scarred, as shown in *Iron Man 3* where he suffers from severe PTSD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:33">[01:15:33]</a>. This represents a character progression as he is profoundly changed by trauma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:42">[01:15:42]</a>.

Stark's character progression in *Civil War* sees a shift in his political leanings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:49">[01:15:49]</a>. In his support for the Sokovia Accords, Iron Man abandons his previous libertarian stance in favor of increased government intervention to foster a safer and more secure society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:55">[01:15:55]</a>. This progression is gradual; initially, he supports the Accords partly because, as a futurist, he sees them as inevitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:08">[01:16:08]</a>:
> "If we don't do this now, it's gonna be done to us later" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:30">[01:16:30]</a>.

## Linear View of History and Ultimate Sacrifice
By *Avengers: Endgame*, both his personal and political progression reach their conclusions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:37">[01:16:37]</a>. Politically, he completely abandons any libertarian leanings he once held, blaming Captain America for the Snappening because he wasn't willing to violate freedoms and liberties to "make a suit of armor around the whole world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:48">[01:16:48]</a>. Personally, he fully makes the ultimate sacrifice, not merely of his life, but by doing so, he widows Pepper and leaves Morgan fatherless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:01">[01:17:01]</a>.

Stark's character, philosophy, and technology all progress fairly linearly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:14">[01:17:14]</a>. His understanding of history aligns with a linear progression from a more primitive past into a technologically and socially superior future, a view common among philosophers like Hegel, Karl Marx, and Francis Fukuyama <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:19">[01:17:19]</a>. As a futurist, Tony Stark sees history as a linear and inexorable progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:51">[01:17:51]</a>. He views the Accords as an inevitable part of this process, anticipating the need for a global defense against existential threats:
> "A hostile alien army came charging through a hole in space... We're standing 300 feet below it. We're the Avengers... that up there, that's... that's the end game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:08">[01:18:08]</a>.

Reed Richards, another Marvel hero, calls Tony Stark the "future man" at the end of history, representing what everyone else is slowly but surely advancing towards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:24">[01:18:24]</a>. This perspective makes it appropriate that Stark's character arc in the MCU is marked by straightforward linear advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:33">[01:18:33]</a>.

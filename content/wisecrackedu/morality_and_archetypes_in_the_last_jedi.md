Released in 2017, *The Last Jedi* generated significant fan backlash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Criticisms included Luke Skywalker's character portrayal, the handling of Snoke, Holdo's plan, the Canto Bight sequence, and the revelation about Rey's parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Despite the controversy, director Rian Johnson intended to revolutionize and progress the *Star Wars* franchise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## Subverting the Past

*The Last Jedi* can be interpreted as a commentary on the relationship between new *Star Wars* films and the original trilogy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Kylo Ren's struggle to live up to Darth Vader's legend mirrors the new series' pressure to meet the legacy of the original trilogy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. While *The Force Awakens* closely mimicked *A New Hope* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>, *The Last Jedi* signaled a departure. Snoke's command for Kylo Ren to remove his "ridiculous" mask <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>, followed by Ren breaking it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>, symbolically telegraphs Johnson's intent to subvert the established *Star Wars* formula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. The film's message, "Let the past die. Kill it if you have to," <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a> underscores this desire for radical change.

To advance the franchise, Johnson abrasively undermined the tropes and traditions of previous films <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. Examples include:
*   **Heroic Lineage** Unlike Luke Skywalker, who had noble blood, Rey's parents were revealed to be "filthy junk traders" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.
*   **Character Archetypes** Heroes are presented as janitors and mechanics, rather than politicians and princesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. Luke is depicted as a "failed nephew murder/Slovenian philosopher" instead of an idealistic hero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>, and Yoda is shown as a "would-be book burner" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
*   **Jedi Order** The film critiques the Jedi, presenting their legacy as "failure. Hypocrisy. Hubris" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>, highlighting their role in the rise of Darth Sidious and the creation of Darth Vader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

This subversion stems from the observation that the events of previous films did not lead to lasting progress; a nearly identical fascist order rose after the collapse of the Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. Johnson suggests that the galactic cycle of evil re-emergence is due to an "inadequate conception of good and evil" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

## Morality, Archetypes, and Jungian Philosophy

Traditionally, *Star Wars* mythology is built around stark divisions between good and evil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. George Lucas famously based the original trilogy on Joseph Campbell's "The Hero with a Thousand Faces," which details the "monomyth" – a universal story structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. Campbell's monomyth, in turn, draws from Carl Jung's concepts of the collective unconscious and "archetypes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

One such archetype is the "shadow," representing the primal or animal part of the unconscious that tends to be repressed – the "dark side" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. In the monomyth, the dark side is often embodied by a character representing the protagonist's shortcomings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. Darth Vader serves as Luke Skywalker's shadow, a constant reminder of what he could become if he failed to conquer his fear and master his passions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. Luke sparing Vader's life demonstrates the psychological battle of conquering inner demons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

While previous *Star Wars* films encouraged conquering inner demons, *The Last Jedi* presents an alternative view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. It suggests that the Force inherently promotes balance: when darkness rises, the Force amplifies the light to meet it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. This implies that a powerful Jedi order might be met by an equally powerful dark side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. Luke's criticism of the Jedi order can thus be read as partly blaming them for the cyclical rise and fall of fascist empires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. He states that the Force does not belong to the Jedi and that the idea of light dying with the Jedi is "vanity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

Jungian analyst Robert A. Johnson (not to be confused with Rian Johnson) argues that the "dark sides" should not be merely conquered or expunged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. He contends that repression leads to "accumulate the darkness" and an "ego split," forcing individuals to find scapegoats and project their "ugliness onto them," resulting in perpetual conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. *The Last Jedi* attempts to complicate the traditional good/bad distinction by suggesting that conquering evil with good has been ineffective in the galaxy, given the re-emergence of an empire-like entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. It asks if the galaxy needs to reconcile its dark side with the larger order of things, aiming for "Balance. Powerful light, powerful darkness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

This [[moral_ambiguity_in_the_wolf_of_wall_street | moral ambiguity]] is exemplified by Benicio del Toro’s character, DJ. He explores how even "good guys" can be involved with darker elements, seeing the divisions between "good" and "evil" as "made up words" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. DJ reveals that arms dealers sell weapons to both the "bad guys" and the "good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. This marks the most morally ambiguous moment in any *Star Wars* film, challenging the understanding of the rebellion as infallibly good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. Robert Johnson suggests that the inability to reconcile with one's shadow leads to violence and war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. *The Last Jedi* posits that a "system" is at play, explicitly critiquing the galaxy's military economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

## Undermining Its Own Revolution

Despite its efforts to [[critique_of_the_last_jedis_approach_to_star_wars_tropes | critique of The Last Jedi's approach to Star Wars tropes]] and challenge the established moral framework and character archetypes, *The Last Jedi* ultimately backpedals on its radical proposals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>.

Kylo Ren offers Rey a chance to end the dogmatism of the previous films, urging her to "Let it all die" – Snoke, Skywalker, the Sith, the Jedi, the rebels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>. Yet, Rey refuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. Many of the concepts the film suggests needed to "die" are subsequently reaffirmed:
*   The heroic archetype of Luke Skywalker is torn down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>, only for him to become a legend inspiring the galaxy once again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>.
*   The necessity to tear down established orders like the Jedi is proposed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>, but Rey declares, "I will not be the last Jedi" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>.
*   The desire to distance itself from the original trilogy's narrative structure is present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>, but classic lines like "Strike me down in anger, and I’ll always be with you" are echoed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>.
*   The idea of forgetting the Jedi past is introduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>, but the sacred Jedi texts are ultimately saved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>.

The film's ideological shift is perceived as inconsistent. Luke's decision to reaffirm "antiquated ideas" is attributed to his love for his sister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. While the film builds a sophisticated case for Rey teaming up with Ren – arguing that the old ways (Jedi repression, cyclical conflict) don't work and a radical change is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a> – Rey hesitates despite her faith in Ren's goodness and Luke's lesson about the Force being beyond good and evil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.

Kylo Ren is presented as a realist who understands the folly of false divisions and is arguably closer to Jungian balance, advocating for the recognition that ego and shadow are both parts of a person and interdependent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>. Rey, however, represents the old moral code of *Star Wars*, choosing to be the "good Jedi" and a "morally-pure, infallible hero" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>.

This [[impact_of_the_last_jedi_on_star_wars_mythology | impact of The Last Jedi on Star Wars mythology]] — abrasively subverting beloved elements only to revert to the status quo — is seen by some as a major flaw in the film's attempt at revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.

The *Rick and Morty* episode "Rickmancing the Stone" from Season 3 explores the concept of [[modern_alienation_in_rick_and_morty | modern alienation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. Through its depiction of a Mad Max-inspired post-apocalypse, the episode suggests that society may be incrementally destroying individual souls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. This [[alienation_and_societal_critique_in_rick_and_morty | alienation]] is examined on both a micro (family) level, as experienced by Summer and Morty, and a macro (societal) level, highlighting how individuals lose agency in their daily lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

## Jerry as the Archetype of Modern Alienation
Jerry Smith serves as a central figure in exemplifying this societal [[alienation_and_societal_critique_in_rick_and_morty | alienation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. Rick frequently emphasizes Jerry's complete lack of personal resolve, power, and agency, characterizing him as a "doormat to the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. Morty's deep resentment towards Jerry is rooted in this perceived powerlessness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

Jerry is presented as an "everyman" for the modern world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. Since the Industrial Revolution, there have been widespread complaints about a loss of control, with many individuals enduring monotonous jobs rather than engaging in independent trades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. Jerry embodies this loss of autonomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>, becoming the "pinnacle of modern stoogery" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. His existence as a "cog in a meaningless machine" is further underscored in "The Rickshank Redemption," where the Galactic Federation uses pharmaceuticals to maintain a compliant and docile populace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. Ironically, Jerry's ineptitude at being a person allows him to thrive in a society devoid of freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

A stark contrast is drawn with Jerry from Cronenberg Earth, who, when stripped of the "trappings of modern society," transforms from a "useless hack" into a "total badass" who manages to keep his marriage intact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. This comparison suggests that the structures of modern society inherently foster [[modern_alienation_in_rick_and_morty | alienation]] and, in essence, turn everyone into a version of Jerry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

## The Post-Apocalypse Becomes Modernity
The episode ingeniously illustrates this point by having Rick introduce electricity to the wasteland. This act swiftly transforms the violent, post-apocalyptic setting into a semblance of an industrialized, modern society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

*   Summer's initially violent lifestyle is replaced by everyday banalities, such as grocery shopping for human parts instead of murdering mutants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.
*   The savagery of the Death Stalkers devolves into mundane complaints about recycling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
*   Hemorrhage, a formidable murdering machine, becomes a "good-for-nothing couch potato" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

This transformation implies that modern comforts are the root cause of banal and tedious lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. Without the need to fend off mutants, people resort to trivial bickering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. The Blood Dome, a arena for violent combat, becomes a passive entertainment experience ("watching blood-dome") due to electricity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

### Critique of Modern Life
Unlike typical post-apocalyptic fiction that serves as a cautionary tale of future hardship, *Rick and Morty* uses an [[inversion_of_common_cliches_and_tropes_in_rick_and_tropes | inversion of common cliches and tropes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. As a dark show, [[rick_and_morty_as_commentary_on_modern_life | Rick and Morty as commentary on modern life]] suggests that modern life is its own distinct form of "soul crushing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. The show proposes that comforts ultimately alienate individuals from meaning, leading to different, yet equally profound, forms of misery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

> [00:06:26] "You wanted to bring civilization to a bunch of savages, now you're bummed that it's going to be boring? That's what civilization is. It makes life boring. It doesn't make it safe, it makes it boring. That's why I'm here."

This perspective raises the speculative question of whether Summer forgives Jerry because she recognizes that modernization inevitably transforms every person, even a post-apocalyptic warrior, into an inactive and alienated individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. The show hints at a possible character arc for Jerry, perhaps a "Tyler Durden moment" akin to *Fight Club*, where he could evolve from a "disaffected modern buffoon" into a man of action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

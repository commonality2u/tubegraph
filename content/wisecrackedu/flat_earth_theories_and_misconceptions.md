Flat Earthers are a growing number of individuals committed to proving the Earth is flat, a belief that has increasingly become a subject of scorn and ridicule on YouTube and social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. While the debate over whether the Earth is round was concluded centuries ago, the resurgence of Flat Earth theories speaks to a broader societal issue: a [[challenges_in_public_understanding_of_science | crisis of knowing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. There is a rapid erosion of trust in experts, including scientists, physicians, and government agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. This phenomenon highlights a societal problem that affects everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## Flat Earth Models and Beliefs

Flat Earth theories are somewhat varied in their specifics, debating concepts like whether the Earth is a dome or an infinite plane, or the distance and nature of the sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. However, they share a core belief that the Earth-as-sphere model is a deliberate misinformation propagated by shadowy agents, including NASA and world governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

One prominent model, highlighted in the Netflix documentary "Behind the Curve," suggests the Earth is a flat plane enclosed within a dome called a "firmament" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. This concept dates back to biblical stories like Genesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. In this model, the sun travels in circles above the Earth, thousands of miles away, and functions more like a flashlight illuminating part of the "globe" rather than a distant, radiating ball of fire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

Flat Earthers often raise questions to support their claims, such as:
*   Why don’t planes go to, or pass, Antarctica? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>
*   Why haven’t oil companies set up shop on Antarctica? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>
*   Why are there only composite images of the Earth, and not whole images? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>

Despite common perceptions, many Flat Earthers are smart, critical individuals who claim they became Flat Earthers by trying to debunk the theory themselves or by adhering to what they believe is the scientific method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

## The Problem of Scientific Understanding

The rise of Flat Earth theories highlights a larger societal problem: a general lack of understanding about how science works, particularly the [[philosophy_of_science_and_verificationism_vs_falsificationism | philosophy of science]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. [[philosophy_of_science_and_verificationism_vs_falsificationism | Philosophy of science]] asks fundamental questions like "how do we distinguish science from non-science?" and "how should we weigh evidence when testing a hypothesis?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. This ignorance allows for the misuse of scientific language and concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

### Verificationism

In the early 1900s, logical positivists proposed [[philosophy_of_science_and_verificationism_vs_falsificationism | verificationism]], a doctrine stating that science must be verifiable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. If a statement cannot be verified, it is not considered science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. For example, the statement "this swan is white" can be verified by sensory observation that can be replicated by others, making it a meaningful scientific statement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. Flat Earthers sometimes allude to this idea, suggesting one could verify the Earth's shape by going into space and looking at it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.

However, a major problem for verificationism arose with universal statements like "all swans are white" or "all mass exerts gravitational pull" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. One can never truly verify such a statement, as a single counterexample, like the discovery of black swans in Australia in the 1690s, could disprove it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. If applying verificationism strictly, demanding all individuals personally observe phenomena, science would be severely limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

### Falsificationism

Philosopher Karl Popper proposed [[philosophy_of_science_and_verificationism_vs_falsificationism | falsificationism]] as a solution to the crisis of verificationism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. For Popper, good science involves formulating a hypothesis and then diligently trying to prove it wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. If a hypothesis cannot be theoretically falsified, it is not science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. Confidence in a hypothesis grows if it withstands repeated attempts at falsification, though it can still be proven wrong later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

Flat Earthers claim to "test everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. However, their approach often misapplies falsificationism in two key ways:
1.  **Bad Evidence:** Their experiments, such as the Bedford Level Experiment, often fail to control for confounding variables like atmospheric refraction, leading to flawed conclusions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. When these experiments are properly controlled, they provide evidence for a round Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.
2.  **Lack of Self-Falsification:** A crucial part of Popper's idea is trying to prove *one's own theory* wrong, not just disproving others' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. Flat Earthers often resist evidence that contradicts their flat Earth hypothesis. For instance, a laser gyroscope experiment showing a 15° per hour drift (suggesting a rotating Earth) was dismissed by one Flat Earther as being affected by "heavenly energies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. The unwillingness to accept contrary evidence is a common characteristic of [[conspiracy_theories_and_societal_trust_in_experts | "woo-woo" beliefs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.

### Paradigms

A compelling criticism of [[philosophy_of_science_and_verificationism_vs_falsificationism | falsificationism]] is that tests and hypotheses do not exist in vacuums; they are part of larger systematized theories or "paradigms," a concept introduced by physicist Thomas Kuhn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. For Kuhn, science operates within unquestioned assumptions (paradigms), and contrary evidence accumulates until a "bigger, badder paradigm" emerges that can explain everything the old one could, but better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. This leads to a paradigm shift, where a new consensus is formed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>. Newton's physics, for example, accurately predicted much, but anomalies like Mercury's orbit were eventually better explained by Einstein's relativity, leading to a paradigm shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.

Flat Earthers, while tweaking their models to account for anomalies (like positing heavenly energies), do not function as true scientists because their "tweaks" are not subjected to further experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. Their model cannot perform the hundreds or thousands of things predicated on a round Earth, such as building long bridges, operating GPS, navigating airplanes, or transmitting TV via satellite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>. Thus, they do not offer a superior paradigm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>.

## "JAQing Off" (Just Asking Questions)

A common tactic used by Flat Earthers and in many modern debates is "JAQing off," or "Just Asking Questions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>. This strategy involves rapidly raising numerous questions, often with simple premises, to overwhelm and shift the burden of proof onto the opponent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>.

For instance, the question "Why aren't oil companies drilling in Antarctica?" can be answered by explaining the 1959 Antarctic Treaty, which prohibits commercial activity to preserve the environment, and the significant expense and danger of extraction in such a remote location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>. Similarly, questions about flight patterns can be explained by the distortion of projecting a sphere onto a flat image, or by practical considerations like flight duration and demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>.

While science is built on asking questions, these questions are meant to build consensus and collective understanding, not merely to "win" a debate or cast doubt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>. The tactic of JAQing off can make it appear that unanswered questions imply wrongdoing or a lack of truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>.

## Erosion of Trust and Societal Impact

The persistence of Flat Earth theories is a symptom of a larger [[conspiracy_theories_and_societal_trust_in_experts | crisis of trust]] in society, where faith in expertise of all kinds is eroding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>. Psychologists suggest that [[conspiracy_theories_and_societal_trust_in_experts | conspiracy theories]] appeal to people who feel powerless or insignificant, offering a sense that the world is rational and predictable if only they can uncover the "real" answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>. For Flat Earthers, this might be the appeal of believing we are a "special little terrarium that’s the center of the universe" rather than a tiny blue marble drifting in the cosmos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>.

This erosion of trust is not harmless. It can lead to harmful beliefs like those of anti-vaxxers, contributing to the resurgence of almost extinct diseases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>. It fosters a conspiratorial mindset where anything becomes possible, leading to irrational claims and dangerous actions like sending death threats to individuals perceived as "crisis actors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>.

Ultimately, instead of simply dismissing Flat Earthers, it is crucial to understand how science is conducted, how scientific consensus is reached, and to be critical when science is done poorly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>. This doesn't mean blind faith in experts, but rather understanding the conventions and practices that lead to scientific conclusions, evaluating experiment design, confidence levels, and how contrary evidence is addressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>.

[[Controversies surrounding American Psycho | American Psycho]] has consistently been a focal point for [[Controversies surrounding American Psycho | controversy]] since its inception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. The book by Bret Easton Ellis faced an initial publisher's cancellation due to public outrage over its depictions of [[Violence savagery and loss of innocence | violence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. The film, released nine years later, has garnered similar [[Controversies surrounding American Psycho | controversial]] reception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. This article focuses specifically on the film's [[Controversies surrounding American Psycho | controversial]] aspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

### Core Debates and Interpretations
Much of the [[Controversies surrounding American Psycho | controversy]] surrounding *[[Controversies surrounding American Psycho | American Psycho]]* stems from how audiences perceive it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Key questions arise:
*   Is the film a critique of 1980s yuppie consumerism and superficiality, or does its excess actually glorify this lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>?
*   What is the meaning behind the film's [[Violence savagery and loss of innocence | violence]], particularly towards women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>?
*   Some viewers declare *[[Controversies surrounding American Psycho | American Psycho]]* a feminist masterpiece, while others label it misogynistic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

### Depiction of Violence and Misogyny
Patrick Bateman's life, though superficially perfect, harbors deep hatred for his friends and fiancée <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. His "side hustle" involves murdering homeless men and prostitutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. After brutally murdering a business rival, Paul Allen, Bateman descends into madness, embarking on a gory killing spree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. Despite claiming to have murdered dozens, there are seemingly no bodies, and his confessions are dismissed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. For instance, when confronted by a homeless person, Bateman "brutally stabs him" instead of offering help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.

The film's [[Violence savagery and loss of innocence | violence]] is often presented in a way that viewers can find problematic:
*   It is accused of being explicitly targeted towards women and the lower-class, potentially glorifying their "grotesque deaths" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.
*   The fact that no one seems to care about the women Patrick killed, only Paul Allen, is highlighted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>.

### Feminist or Misogynistic?
There are competing views on the film's stance regarding women and [[masculinity_and_identity_in_fight_club | masculinity]]:
*   **Feminist Argument:** Guinevere Turner, one of the screenwriters, stated in a 2015 interview that she "very much" thinks *[[Controversies surrounding American Psycho | American Psycho]]* is a feminist film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. She views it as a satire about how men compete with each other in a "hyper-real universe" where women are "even less important than your tan or your suit or where you summer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. Director Mary Harron echoes this, calling the film "a great [[parody_and_satire_in_american_psycho | parody]] of [[masculinity_and_identity_in_fight_club | masculinity]]" and "a send-up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. Harron maintains it was always "an attack and satire of sexism and of male ego" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.
*   **Critique of Male Ego and Objectification:** The film showcases the "cavalier attitudes many men have for women," including Bateman's assertion that "there are no girls with good personalities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. Patrick lords over women's bodies as if he owns them, telling his assistant what to wear at work and paying women to follow his instructions in bed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. He believes he can do as he pleases with a woman's body, including killing, mutilating, and even eating them, and cynically, the film suggests he gets away with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.

### The Film's Undermining Effect
Despite its apparent deep critique of consumerism and male ego <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>, *[[Controversies surrounding American Psycho | American Psycho]]* can paradoxically uphold the very "surface value lifestyle" it rails against <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. This is because:
*   There is an undeniable allure to Patrick Bateman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a> and his lifestyle, which remains pervasive in culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. People are infatuated with his looks, apartment, and job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>, leading to articles and media on how to replicate his grooming and dining habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.
*   The film's [[parody_and_satire_in_american_psycho | parody]] of consumerism and [[masculinity_and_identity_in_fight_club | masculinity]] "both legitimizes and subverts its subject" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.
*   Patrick's more monstrous acts are often played for comedy or cut away from entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. For example, Paul Allen's murder is set to Huey Lewis and the News, and Christine's chainsaw murder shows only the "net result" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. This allows the audience to identify more with Bateman's "glitz and glamour," letting him "off the hook for his more gruesome misdeeds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.
*   By indulging in Bateman's lifestyle at the expense of his [[Violence savagery and loss of innocence | violence]], the film might undermine its own satirical depth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.

### The Film's Self-Awareness
Despite his horrific acts, Patrick Bateman is still lauded as an "anti-establishment [[perception_of_patrick_bateman_as_an_antihero | antihero]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. In a metatextual turn, this reception may be precisely what the film is about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. Patrick constantly tells others he's a murderer, but they either mishear him (e.g., "mergers and acquisitions") or dismiss it as a joke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.

Similarly, *[[Controversies surrounding American Psycho | American Psycho]]* the film has been misinterpreted as misogynistic or pro-consumer, or simply treated as a joke or [[parody_and_satire_in_american_psycho | parody]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. The issues it critiques—a status-obsessed society, sexism, and wealth inequality—remain relevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>. As Patrick Bateman states at the film's end, "This confession has meant nothing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>. Likewise, the film's cynical ridicule of society knows that its "confession too will mean nothing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>.

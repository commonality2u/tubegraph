[[summary_of_the_great_gatsby|F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby]] serves as a criticism of the anti-Calvinistic image of the American Dream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. While America might have initially been conceived as a place of mutual support, Fitzgerald's depiction of the nation is one filled with betrayal, which ultimately renders [[character_analysis_of_jay_gatsby_and_daisy_buchanan|Gatsby's]] romantic vision of the American Dream absurd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

## Gatsby's Adherence to Ideals

Despite the corrupt society around him, [[character_analysis_of_jay_gatsby_and_daisy_buchanan|Gatsby]] is portrayed as someone who remains true to his American ideals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. According to Minter, [[character_analysis_of_jay_gatsby_and_daisy_buchanan|Gatsby's]] greatness stems from "the beauty of his dream and the heroism of his efforts to move beyond it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

## [[motifs_of_dreams_versus_reality_in_the_great_gatsby|Motifs of Dreams Versus Reality]]

A significant [[motifs_of_dreams_versus_reality_in_the_great_gatsby|motif]] explored in the novel is that of [[motifs_of_dreams_versus_reality_in_the_great_gatsby|dreams versus reality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. [[character_analysis_of_jay_gatsby_and_daisy_buchanan|Gatsby]] harbors grand delusions about his future with [[character_analysis_of_jay_gatsby_and_daisy_buchanan|Daisy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

### Inability to Repeat the Past

[[character_analysis_of_jay_gatsby_and_daisy_buchanan|Gatsby]] mistakenly believes that the past can be replicated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. However, the narrative emphasizes that recovering past time is impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. Fitzgerald subtly reinforces this [[motifs_of_dreams_versus_reality_in_the_great_gatsby|motif]] through minor details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. For instance, [[character_analysis_of_jay_gatsby_and_daisy_buchanan|Gatsby]] possesses a large collection of books, most of which he has never read <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. This detail suggests [[character_analysis_of_jay_gatsby_and_daisy_buchanan|Gatsby]] is "frontinâ€™," trying to appear intelligent, but this facade is not grounded in reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

## [[symbolism_in_the_great_gatsby|Symbolism of the Green Light]]

The [[symbolism_in_the_great_gatsby|symbol]] of the green light is crucial to understanding the critique of the American Dream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. Some interpretations suggest the green light [[symbolism_in_the_great_gatsby|symbolizes]] the diminishing optimism of [[character_analysis_of_jay_gatsby_and_daisy_buchanan|Gatsby's]] dream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. Initially, at the beginning of the novel, the green light has a vibrant quality that excites [[character_analysis_of_jay_gatsby_and_daisy_buchanan|Gatsby]] about his pursuit of [[character_analysis_of_jay_gatsby_and_daisy_buchanan|Daisy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. However, by the book's conclusion, it loses its special significance, becoming "just another lame ass green light," reflecting the emptiness of his "fake ass dreams" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

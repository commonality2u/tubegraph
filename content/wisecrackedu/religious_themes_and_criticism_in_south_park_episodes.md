[[Irreverence and sacredness in South Park | Irreverence]] is a word commonly associated with [[Cultural and Social Critiques in South Park | South Park]], particularly in its treatment of religion, where "nothing is sacred" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. While critics often use the term generally, [[South Parks treatment of religion | the show's handling of religion]] is distinct, given that religion itself is typically defined by reverence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. The series challenges viewers to re-evaluate what religion means to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>, asking questions that other shows might avoid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

## Denying the Sacred and Profane Divide

From its early holiday specials featuring baby Jesus in combat with Frosty the Snowman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>, [[South Parks treatment of religion | South Park]] established a core sentiment: ordinary things can be highly significant, while seemingly momentous concepts can be trivial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. The show blurs the lines between the profound and the mundane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>:
*   The boys are unimpressed by Jesus, but fight to play him in an Easter play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
*   When meeting God, Stan asks about periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
*   The meaning of life is revealed to be Earth as an intergalactic reality show on the verge of cancellation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.
*   Jesus struggles to get viewers for his public-access talk show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
*   Satan is portrayed as a serial monogamist stuck in a bad relationship with Saddam Hussein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

Religion primarily gains importance in [[South Parks treatment of religion | South Park]] when it is manipulated for personal gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. Eric Cartman is the master of this, readily admitting, "I know enough to exploit it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. Examples of Cartman's exploitation include:
*   Becoming a wealthy tent revival preacher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
*   Finding success in Christian music by altering secular pop songs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.
*   Forming a fan club around Mel Gibson’s *The Passion of the Christ* to lead the Fourth Reich in "[[Role of antiSemitism in South Park | The Passion of the Jew]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.
*   Painting a cow to resemble a biblically prophesied red heifer to mess with Kyle, accidentally causing world peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

Despite often appearing anti-religious, creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker disagree with the impression that their show suggests religion is simply ridiculous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. Matt Stone stated, "Neither one of us is anti-religious at all. I mean I'm fascinated by religion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. The apparent anti-religious stance stems from the show's refusal to treat religion as sacred, a departure from Western spiritual traditions that emphasize honoring the sacred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

French philosopher Émile Durkheim, in *The Elementary Forms of Religious Life*, noted that Western religions typically divide the world into the sacred and the profane, with the sacred always taken seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. [[Irreverence and sacredness in South Park | South Park]] fundamentally rejects this distinction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. In "Red Hot Catholic Love" (Season 6), Father Maxie defies a "sacred Vatican Document" to expose a pedophilia scandal, a metaphor for how the Church could only evolve if it ceased to be "too sacred to investigate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

A recurring theme is that something deemed sacred can only be saved through its desecration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. This is seen in:
*   *The South Park Movie*, where Cartman and Kenny save the world by cursing out Saddam Hussein and making a deal with the Devil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.
*   "Cancelled" (Season 7), where Earth is saved for uninspiring reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

[[South Parks treatment of religion | South Park]] also suggests that the concept of the sacred itself can be flawed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. Jesus, despite literally walking the Earth, is often ignored or unrecognized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. His talk show, *Jesus and Pals*, consistently loses ratings to *Huntin’ and Killin’* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. However, when Jesus fights—something he typically avoids—he suddenly earns respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. This points to theologian Walter Wink's "myth of redemptive violence," which posits that our sense of the sacred often comes from a desire to see good triumph over evil through combat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. Jesus fights because he understands his followers project this myth onto him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>, conceding to the power of this myth even though it does not come naturally to him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

## Human Follies, Not Just Religious Ones

Beyond its casual attitude towards the sacred, [[South Parks treatment of religion | South Park]] argues that one does not need to be religious to be narrow-minded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. The show often features characters who are self-righteous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. Stan’s arc as a self-promotional activist in Season 16 episodes like "Butterballs" and "A Scause for Applause" exemplifies this, showing his enjoyment of reverence but his quick abandonment of causes once they no longer bring popularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. This contrasts with Wendy Testaburger, whose deeper motivations mean she does not care if her opinions are popular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

[[Political Correctness and its Critique in South Park | South Park]] suggests that movements driven by a desire for self-importance are likely to derail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. This applies to the New Atheism movement, depicted in the two-part episode "Go God Go," where Cartman is trapped in the 26th century amidst warring militant atheist factions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. The message is clear: human beings are inherently violent and irrational, and removing religion will not change this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. Stone and Parker's perspective is that religion is ridiculous *because* people are ridiculous, not the other way around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.

Australian science historian Margaret Wertheim, in *Pythagoras’ Trousers*, argues that Western scientific models of the universe often resemble religious ones due to a shared "hypermasculine drive for certainty and finality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. [[South Parks commentary on human nature and belief systems | South Park]], like Wertheim, suggests that refusing to accept ambiguity can make our answers to fundamental questions seem absurd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.

Ultimately, [[South Parks treatment of religion | South Park]] does not impose an answer on whether one should be religious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. Matt Stone has questioned whether a "mass delusion of a religion" is bad if it brings happiness and family cohesion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. The show explicitly supports the idea that both religious and non-religious paths can be sensible, as seen in "Red Hot Catholic Love" and "All About Mormons" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>. The conclusion of "All About Mormons" emphasizes that if a belief system works for someone and makes them happy, that is its value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.

This perspective echoes American philosopher William James’s *Pragmatism* (1907), which suggests that the nature of life—whether divinely created or not—doesn't change its inherent reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>. Unlike most series that offer an "escape route" from human ridiculousness through a particular ideology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>, [[South Parks commentary on human nature and belief systems | South Park]]'s unique philosophy is that being human is inherently ridiculous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>. The show implies that regardless of one's chosen belief system, taking oneself too seriously will inevitably lead to looking silly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>. The core question, therefore, is not whether one's belief system is a joke, but whether one is aware of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.

From: [[wisecrackedu]] <br/> 

*One Punch Man* is an example of media that employs self-aware humor, making fun of the very genres it inhabits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. It is considered a parody, distinct from satire like *Watchmen* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

## Defining Parody
Both satire and parody exist to criticize the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. However, there is a crucial [[distinction_between_satire_and_parody | distinction between satire and parody]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. While satire attacks vice or folly and seeks to persuade an audience that something is reprehensible, often subverting literary structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>, parody exaggerates certain elements of its target but ultimately affirms the literary form it inhabits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.

According to Robert Phiddian, parody accepts the logic and rules of its genre and takes them seriously as tools of criticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>. It operates from "inside of the texts and ideas it criticizes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>. Parody aims to awaken audiences to flaws in beloved things, not to demolish a flawed genre <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>. Its criticism operates on the assumption that the genre is worth improving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>.

## Parodic Elements in One Punch Man
*One Punch Man* follows Saitama, a hero capable of defeating any enemy in a single punch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. It takes archetypes of its genre and twists them around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

### Exaggeration of Tropes
The series utilizes common anime and manga tropes, such as:
*   Distorting "magical girl" tropes with a "swole ex-convict" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   Featuring a "hard-working everyman hero" who is a "debuffed version of Toku Hero Kamen Rider" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
*   Presenting a "Goku-esque world savior" who looks like a "low rent halloween costume attached to an egg" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
*   Villains deliver intentionally over-the-top monologues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.
*   Characters possess dramatic backstories and a "fighting spirit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>.
*   Incorporating elements like ocean creatures, swarms of people in suits, and Kaiju-style monsters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.

This [[parody_of_anime_tropes_in_one_punch_man | parody of anime tropes in One Punch Man]] is always in conversation with other works in the same genre, but without the judgment seen in satire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.

### The Overpowered Hero and its Consequences
*One Punch Man* makes its argument by exaggerating the overpowered hero archetype <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. While many manga heroes like Goku get stronger to match increasingly powerful villains through intense training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>, *One Punch Man* questions the necessity of other characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.

Saitama's omnipotence leads to boredom, as physical confrontations are over before they start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. He spends his time mourning his [[lack_of_conflict_and_drama_in_one_punch_man | lack of a true challenge]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. This contrasts with traditional protagonists who struggle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

### Critiquing Hero Archetypes
The show features characters like Genos, who mirrors a classic anime protagonist with a trauma and desire for revenge, but is constantly rendered a joke by Saitama's immense power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>. Despite this, Genos's appeal and desires are not diminished or treated as stupid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>.

Mumen Rider, with his classic backstory and heroic motivation to help people, constantly gets defeated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>. This provides a "message about real life," suggesting that some people "just don’t have what it takes to be a superhero" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>.

The series also critiques the "bigger monster, bigger gun" model of storytelling, exemplified by Boros constantly seeking stronger opponents while Saitama is bored by his own power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>. This [[comparison_between_mob_psycho_100_and_one_punch_man | comparison between Mob Psycho 100 and One Punch Man]] highlights *One Punch Man*'s display of how infinite power can fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>.

## Affirmation of the Genre
While *One Punch Man* criticizes a certain kind of superhero narrative, it does not disavow the value of heroes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>. It wants audiences to recognize and emulate the bravery of characters like Genos and Mumen Rider, even while acknowledging the silliness of the stories in which these lessons are found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>.

The show aims to expand the possibilities of anime storytelling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>, suggesting that the "stories we’ve told forever need a little refresh" but not complete abandonment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>. Examples of parody include *Deadpool*, *Galaxy Quest*, and *Blazing Saddles* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>.

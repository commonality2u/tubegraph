The film *Frozen* is presented as a musical exploring the "dueling properties of two of Earth’s most cherished elements — a song of ice and fire" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. This thematic core is embodied by the two main characters, Anna and Elsa.

## Anna: The Embodiment of Fire
[[character_analysis_of_elsa_and_anna | Anna]] is consistently associated with fire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>, which symbolizes warmth and passion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. Her physical appearance includes fiery red hair and freckles, or "sunspots," on her shoulders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

Throughout the film, fire is used in relation to Anna's journey and emotions:
*   She uses fire as a weapon to defend herself against a horse attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
*   When Prince Hans reveals his deceitful intentions, he extinguishes a fire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>, symbolically "extinguishing the passion Anna had for him" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

## Elsa: The Embodiment of Ice
In contrast, [[character_analysis_of_elsa_and_anna | Elsa]] is associated with ice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. She is characterized as cold and rational <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>, believing that the way to navigate life is to inhibit her feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>, echoing the mantra, "Don't feel. Don't feel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

Elsa's icy powers cause her to accidentally give Anna "brain-freeze" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a> and later freeze Anna's heart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. Her isolation, marked by hiding in her room for a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a> and later building a new ice castle that casts the land in eternal winter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>, reflects her emotional coldness and detachment.

Her transformation into a "revealing, skin-tight, transparent dress" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>, while seemingly a symbol of liberation, including potentially sexual liberation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>, comes at a cost. The film suggests that true fulfillment for Elsa, and the happiness derived from "social solidarity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>, is achieved only by embracing the love of her sister, Anna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. Ultimately, it is "the power of love" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a> that enables Elsa to reverse the eternal winter she created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

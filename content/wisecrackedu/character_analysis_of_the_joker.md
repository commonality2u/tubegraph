The Joker is introduced as an unemployed clown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a> who actively seeks to get to know Batman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. He offers not to kill people in exchange for Batman's identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. Batman eventually catches him, but not before the Joker sets up a trap involving Harvey Dent and Rachel Dawes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Even after escaping, Batman tracks him down to "spend some quality time together," highlighting their unique [[the_jokers_relationship_with_batman | relationship]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

The Joker embodies chaos, seeking to expose the "existential anarchy" beneath society's orderly facade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. He is portrayed as a nihilist, believing in nothing, not even the concept of nihilism itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. His responses are meaningless, as seen when he states, "Whatever doesn't kill you simply makes you stranger" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. Even his actions, such as putting a grenade in a manager's mouth, are revealed to be empty scare tactics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

### Deception and Motivation
The Joker offers multiple, contradictory stories about the source of his scars, all of which are lies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. The true origin of his scars is unimportant; his humor stems from the belief that everything is trivial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. His terrorist acts are not random; they are calculated to prove that morality is a sham <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. He aims to demonstrate that if physical comforts or safety are removed, humans will revert to "wild animals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. He explicitly states that humanity's "code" is a "bad joke" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

The Joker exploits humanity's innate lawlessness through various means:
*   He orchestrates bank robbers killing each other to increase their share of the loot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.
*   He gives weapons to "friends," forcing them to fight to join his team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   He threatens to blow up hospitals to cause corruption among police and incite citizens to attempt murder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

### Corruption of Harvey Dent
The Joker's ultimate achievement is the corruption of District Attorney Harvey Dent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. Dent's double-sided coin initially symbolizes his rigid adherence to justice, morality, and order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. However, after Dent becomes Two-Face, the coin is scarred on one side, transforming it into a regular, 50/50 coin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. This change reflects how Dent has been "infected by the Joker's vision" that reality is governed by "cosmic anarchy," where "the only morality in a cruel world is chance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

Season One of *Breaking Bad* examines the shortcomings of the [[the_american_dream_in_the_great_gatsby | American Dream]] through the experiences of its protagonists, Walter White and Jesse Pinkman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. The series functions as a [[critique_of_american_healthcare_and_economic_systems | critique of struggling American healthcare and economic systems]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>, demonstrating how these systems impede the success of both highly educated individuals like Walter and others like Jesse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

## Walter White's Disillusionment

Walter White, a 50-year-old who "mopes around like a real Debbie Downey Jr." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>, initially appears to embody the [[the_american_dream_in_the_great_gatsby | American Dream]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. He has a son who shares his name, a "shiny plaque on the wall," and a perceived standing within society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. However, this facade crumbles as it's revealed he can only bring home "sub-par bacon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. Despite making all "socially acceptable moves," the [[the_american_dream_in_the_great_gatsby | American Dream]] has failed Walter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

Feeling a profound sense of dissatisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>, Walter ultimately decides to "rage against the machine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a> by creating a new alter ego <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. He turns to the illegal manufacture of methamphetamine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>, seeing it as a way to attain the "respect and mobility he so desperately craves" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a> by operating "outside the law" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

## Jesse Pinkman's Marginalization

Jesse Pinkman, Walter's partner in crime, also faces significant obstacles in achieving societal acceptance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. Despite his attempts to gain legitimacy, Jesse is routinely marginalized by figures ranging from "suits on Walnut Street" to his own parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. As Walterâ€™s "chief ally," Jesse remains an "underachiever" who continues to ride Walter's "coattails" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>, symbolizing a different facet of the [[the_american_dream_in_the_great_gatsby | American Dream]]'s failure.

## The Ironic Downfall

In a stark irony, Walter's drastic measures to earn money for his cancer treatment lead him to become a "societal cancer" himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. While he gains energy for himself through his illicit activities, he simultaneously contributes to the "deterioration of other human beings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. This raises the question of whether this outcome represents the [[the_american_dream_in_the_great_gatsby | American Dream]] or simply a "waking nightmare" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

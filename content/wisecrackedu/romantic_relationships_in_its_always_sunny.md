From: [[wisecrackedu]] <br/> 

*It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia* distinguishes itself from traditional sitcoms by actively subverting customary romantic tropes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Instead of following the "classic ‘will they or won’t they’" romantic tension seen in shows like *Scrubs* (JD and Elliot), *Friends* (Ross and Rachel, Chandler and Monica), or *How I Met Your Mother* (Ted and Robin, Barney and Robin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>, "the gang" pushes romance "to the limits of dysfunction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.

For the characters of *It's Always Sunny*, "there is no happily ever after" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>. Any romantic achievement they experience merely serves as "a reminder of their fundamental lack of ability to ever be truly happy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>.

## Character-Specific Romantic Exploits

### Frank
After his divorce from Dennis and Dee's mother, Frank indulges in "pay-for-play romance" with prostitutes and strippers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. He also has a recurring romance with Artemis, who shares his "proclivities towards ‘getting weird’" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.

### Mac
Mac's romantic journey is characterized by "a string of attempts to assert his masculine heterosexual image against the gang’s overt acknowledgement of his homosexuality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>. This includes a relationship with a "transitioning woman" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a> and a "non-sexual PCP fueled fling with party-girl Dustee" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>. Mac eventually admits to being gay in a recent season, though this revelation is not a cathartic moment but rather a means to get a $10,000 scratch-off ticket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.

### Dee
Dee's romantic exploits are considered "the most pathetic of the gang" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>, largely consisting of "a series of hook ups that end with her being mocked by the gang" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>. Her former partners, including "jean shorts guy, the mentally retarded white rapper, Bill Ponderosa, and the old Korean man from the back of Mr. Kim’s restaurant," are gathered for the birth of her child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>. Dee's single flirtation with traditional sitcom romance occurs in "The Gang Misses the Boat," where she and Charlie hook up, a decision "quickly acknowledged to be a huge mistake" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.

### Dennis
Dennis is the only member of the gang who experiences any romantic success, though this is "evaluated by the metrics of his own horrifying system of seduction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>. His slightly less pathetic, yet significantly more criminal, romantic life is largely due to his "absence of emotion and inability to love" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>. In the finale of season twelve, it appears he might abandon his system for a family life, but the show's "logic of the Paddy’s universe seems to indicate a low possibility of actual growth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>.

### Charlie
Charlie is the only member of the gang to flirt with monogamy, characterized by a "fifteen-year obsession with a waitress who has filed multiple restraining orders against him" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. While a traditional sitcom would portray this obsession as "sweet," *It's Always Sunny* depicts "the darkside of rom-com love" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. Charlie's stalking of the waitress is "a full-time job" and leads him to write and produce a musical to propose to her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. The show briefly uses the trope of two people finally getting together in a recent season <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>. However, it quickly returns to form when Charlie becomes annoyed with the waitress "only hours after consummating over a decade of romantic desire" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>, and he soon accuses her of stalking him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>. The show "brutally subverts standard sitcom logic" by providing a "realistic take on what happens when obsessions become reality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>.

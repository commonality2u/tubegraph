Villains are often considered the best part of a movie, evoking feelings ranging from hatred and fear to occasional empathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Lately, film antagonists, such as Killmonger from *Black Panther* and Screenslaver from *The Incredibles 2*, have become strangely relatable, offering cogent critiques of the world that resonate with audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Villainy has historically mirrored the value systems and fears of its era, reflecting changes in society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. The evolution of film villains, from simple mustache-twirlers to complex, philosophizing radicals, reveals much about our past and present world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

## The 1950s and Early 1960s: The "Other" and Clear-Cut Evil
To understand the [[complexity_of_modern_villains | complexity of modern villains]], it's essential to explore how film villains embodied the spirit and anxieties of their times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. In the post-World War II era, particularly during the height of the Cold War, the world was often depicted in stark, black and white terms, which was reflected in villains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

Movie screens were populated with "bad Russian people, bad Asian people, and very bad aliens" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. These "Others" were portrayed as an inherent, inexplicable evil driven to destroy America and its values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. Examples include the amorphous red-for-commie Blob, the Creature from the Black Lagoon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>, or the alien infiltrators in *The Invasion of the Body Snatchers*, which some critics viewed as a metaphor for the fear of Communist brainwashing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

The 1950s also saw a resurgence of biblical sagas, which embodied Cold War propaganda by depicting a conflict between "God-fearing Americans and the godless communists" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. Films like *Ben Hur*, *Quo Vadis*, and *The Ten Commandments* showcased noble "Judeo-Christians" battling cruel, powerful despots of non-monotheistic religions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. These villains represented larger groups of "bad people" aiming to dismantle American life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

Even when not explicitly foreign or pagan, villains were often anti-American, Communist double agents in Cold War propaganda films <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. The spy mania of the 1960s, with James Bond facing agents of SMERSH, further reflected Cold War anxieties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. This era was characterized by an "us vs. them" mentality, portraying "no-good Commies" as purely evil and one-dimensional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

## Late 1960s and 1970s: Internal Corruption and Blurred Lines
A definitive shift in villain portrayal occurred in the late 1960s and 1970s, a period of major social turbulence and soul-searching in America due to the Civil Rights Movement and the Vietnam War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. This era witnessed a significant drop in public trust in government, which dramatically altered movie villains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. This is a clear example of the [[impact_of_historical_events_on_villain_portrayal | impact of historical events on villain portrayal]].

Movies from the 1970s highlighted corrupt social systems that Americans were increasingly disillusioned with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. Evil politicians and public officials became prominent, as seen in *All the President’s Men*, which brought the Watergate scandal to the screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. Fictional accounts like *Jaws* depicted institutional corruption through a crooked mayor prioritizing tourism over public safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. In *Chinatown*, a sinister billionaire suggests that his evil acts are a product of his environment, rather than innate nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

Corrupt cop films were also popular, with *Serpico* portraying police corruption as a given <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. Other films like *The Godfather*, *White Lightning*, *The French Connection*, and *The Conversation* featured corrupt police <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>, signifying a loss of goodwill towards institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. Villains began to embody these broken systems, such as Nurse Ratched in *One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest*, who turned a benevolent profession into one that diminishes individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. Similarly, wardens in *East from Alcatraz* and *Cool Hand Luke* were recast as villains against sympathetic prisoners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. In these cases, those imposing law or societal norms became the antagonists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.

The 1970s also blurred the lines between hero and villain, depicting characters as conflicted, flawed protagonists with questionable morals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. Walter White from *Breaking Bad* is cited as an anti-hero who evolves into a villain protagonist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. Travis Bickle in *Taxi Driver* is a "heroic villain" or "villainous hero" swinging between violent good and bad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. In *Dog Day Afternoon*, Sonny Wortzik is a sympathetic bank robber driven by a noble cause, unlike typical villains of the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.

Interestingly, *Star Wars* stood out in this era for its "markedly simplistic" [[good_versus_evil_in_star_wars_mythology | good vs. evil]] paradigm, contrasting with the period's trend towards more complex villains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.

## The 1980s: Cartoonish Villains and Resurgent Cold War Fears
The 1980s saw a backpedal from complex villains, returning to more cartoonish antagonists who embodied the era's biggest threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>. This ushered in an "us vs. them" paradigm, tapping into fears surrounding the War on Drugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. Villains sought drug money in films like *Scarface*, *To Live & Die in L.A.*, *Beverly Hills Cop*, and *Raw Deal* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. This depiction of evil drug lords can be seen as a counterpoint to the less-than-savory cops of 1970s films <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>. *Tango & Cash*, for instance, depicted roguish cops as protagonists despite engaging in violence, portrayed as effective against drug lords through "any means necessary" policing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.

The decade also marked a resurgence of Cold War anxieties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. "Evil Russians" had their moment, with films like *Rocky IV* featuring Soviet boxer Ivan Drago as an anti-Soviet propaganda figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. *Red Heat* presented Soviet drug lord Viktor Rostavili as a multi-layered villain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. *Red Dawn* (1984) directly imagined a Soviet invasion of America, serving as a warning against the perceived threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.

Despite this return to "the other as the enemy," hints of 1970s skepticism towards institutions persisted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>. Villains exploited corrupt institutions for personal gain, like Gordon "Greed is Good" Gekko in *Wall Street* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. Hans Gruber in *Die Hard*, initially posing as a terrorist seeking revenge against a corporation, is revealed to be primarily after money, echoing Gekko's motivations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.

## The 1990s: Domestic Terrorists and Questionable Philosophies
The 1990s saw American cinema shift from "reds" to homegrown terrorists, reflecting a decade dominated by headlines about domestic terrorism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. This was an era of disgruntled middle-class men and "bombers next door," paving the way for complex anti-villains fighting localized battles through radical means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.

Howard Payne from *Speed*, a former bomb squad officer turned extortionist, is motivated by money but also expresses a sense of superiority and a desire for "meaning" or "purpose" beyond mere cash, making him more complicated than earlier villains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>. John Doe from *Se7en* views himself as a "chosen" warrior in a crusade against everyday sin, aiming to "set the example" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>. *Arlington Road* featured a villain who, while carrying out deadly bombings, critiques government and the niceties of Clinton-era prosperity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>. *American Beauty* depicted Frank Fitts as a homophobic neighbor killing Lester after being rebuffed, portraying "trouble in suburbia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>. These villains often felt victimized by systems or circumstances, seeking justice on their own terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>.

Some villains even had genuinely noble causes, railing against systems that had wronged them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. In *The Rock*, General Hummel, a disgraced Marine general, holds San Francisco hostage to demand compensation for the families of slain Marines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>. This raised the question of whether noble ends justify violent means, foreshadowing themes in later films <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>.

## The 2000s: Nihilism and the Spirit of Terrorism
The 2000s brought a new shift in villains following 9/11 and the War on Terror, as America confronted an existential threat to its sense of safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>. Christopher Nolan’s *Dark Knight Trilogy* captured the popular imagination. In *Batman Begins*, the international terrorist group "The League of Shadows" and its leader Ra's al Ghul seek to destroy Gotham's tallest skyscraper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>.

Heath Ledger’s Joker in *The Dark Knight* became the decade's most salient villain, embodying "the spirit of terrorism" and "anarchy and chaos of a particularly destructive and nihilistic nature" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>. The film is noted for its 9/11 iconography, and the character of Two-Face represents how confrontation with the Joker's evils can corrupt even the noblest person into nihilism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>.

Anton Chigurh from the Coen Brothers’ *No Country For Old Men* also uses a coin flip to decide fates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>. He doesn't kill for greed or practical goals but is an "active nihilist" who believes that if all morality is contrived, a coin flip is as valid as any method for deciding who lives or dies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>. Frank Costello in Martin Scorsese's *The Departed* operates on the belief that life is meaningless, with actions excusable if they ensure survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>. In the 2000s, the villainous creed was often "no creed at all" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>.

## Contemporary Villains: Radical Solutions to Broken Systems
Today’s villains are a product of an increasingly divided America, reflecting a deep skepticism towards systems, whether government, media, or religious institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>. These [[villains_as_social_critics | villains as social critics]] often embody solutions that are "way too radical and usually mind-bogglingly violent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>.

Unlike 1950s villains who sought to corrupt inherently good systems, contemporary villains increasingly face "objectively evil systems" that they want to change for the better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>. What makes them villains is their extreme means of enacting change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>.

*   **Killmonger (Black Panther):** He offers a "legitimate critique" of how the world treats black citizens and Wakanda's passivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>. His villainy stems from his plan to instigate a militant uprising by shipping Wakandan weapons globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>. Despite his defeat, his radicalism leads to positive policy changes, such as Wakanda ending its isolationism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:36">[00:19:36]</a>.
*   **August Walker/John Lark (Mission Impossible 6):** This utilitarian villain seeks to destroy one-third of the world to unite the remaining two-thirds, believing "peace" requires "great suffering" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:43">[00:19:43]</a>.
*   **Thanos (Infinity War):** He aims to kill half the universe's population to solve resource scarcities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:03">[00:20:03]</a>.
*   **Screenslaver (The Incredibles 2):** This villain, who embodies [[syndromes_character_and_villainy | Syndrome's character and villainy]], uses mind-control to critique how consumable media makes people passive and how superheroes contribute to this docility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>. Her plan involves ruining superhero public approval to force people to protect themselves, which is a form of [[criticism_of_superhero_archetypes | criticism of superhero archetypes]] and [[satire_of_superhero_films | satire of superhero films]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>.

These villains share an extreme plan that appeals to fears that the world is "screwed beyond repair" and requires tearing down to fix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:33">[00:20:33]</a>. Audiences can often empathize with the villain's critique of the system and desire for change, even if their methods are abhorrent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:44">[00:20:44]</a>. Heroes in this context are often cast as slightly flawed protectors of an unsatisfactory status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:52">[00:20:52]</a>.

Contemporary villains represent a "weird mirror image" of 1950s villains: while the latter sought to corrupt good institutions, "Killmonger-types" aim for good change in corrupt institutions, albeit through destructive means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>. They merge the [[complexity_of_modern_villains | complexity of modern villains]] and sometimes innocence of 1990s villains, broaden the social critiques of the 1970s, and stand in opposition to the nihilism of the 2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:14">[00:21:14]</a>. These villains believe in a cause worth fighting for, and with different blueprints for social change, they could even be seen as complex heroes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a>.

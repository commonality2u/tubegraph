From: [[wisecrackedu]] <br/> 

Many have described *Grand Theft Auto V* (GTA V) as a [[the_distinctions_between_satire_social_commentary_and_parody_in_grand_theft_auto_v | satire]], social commentary, or sarcasm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The game extensively uses [[the_distinctions_between_satire_social_commentary_and_parody_in_grand_theft_auto_v | parody]] and [[the_distinctions_between_satire_social_commentary_and_parody_in_grand_theft_auto_v | satire]] to reflect and critique aspects of American culture and player behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

## Trevor Phillips: Mirroring Player Psychopathy

Trevor Phillips, a depraved psychopathic tweaker, serves as a key character for examining violence and the state of gaming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. Trevor exhibits extreme behavior, from violently assaulting bikers to eliminating gangs and kidnapping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

Trevor can be seen as the personification of the typical GTA player—the "shit talking crazy person" players become in sandbox worlds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. His sociopathic actions reflect the behavior most players exhibit while playing a GTA game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. This dynamic forces the player to confront the actual embodiment of their in-game actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

While some argue the game offers catharsis by allowing players to act out violent impulses virtually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>, Trevor's deliberate psychotic nature suggests a different interpretation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. It implies that when given the choice to indulge in debauchery and violent urges, people tend to reveal their "messed up" tendencies, suggesting that deep down, "we are all violent sickos" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

### Meta-gaming and Player Choice

GTA V presents a [[the_use_of_metagaming_in_grand_theft_auto_v_and_its_implications | meta-fictional]] element, functioning as "games about games" by reflecting player behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. The game allows for both violent and mundane activities, such as yoga, tennis, golf, or skydiving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. The choice to engage in boring activities like yoga versus massacring people is deliberate, highlighting player preference for destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. This suggests that players project their own psyche and desires onto the game, rather than the developers simply empowering violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

### The Torture Scene as Satire

The most controversial scene in GTA V involves Trevor torturing an informant for the FIB, where he appears to take "sick pleasure" in the act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. This scene poses a critical question: who is the real sadist—Trevor or the gamer who enjoys acting out psychopathic urges on fictional characters? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

This moment is not a passive acceptance of torture; instead, it serves to provoke "over-identification" with the sadistic desire to inflict harm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. By forcing the player to enact "advanced interrogation techniques," the game aims to elicit a strong reaction, whether it be disgust (subverting the ideology of the "war on terror") or even sadistic enjoyment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. This is a form of [[the_distinctions_between_satire_social_commentary_and_parody_in_grand_theft_auto_v | satire]], whose goal is to provoke a response, ideally leading to some kind of reform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. Trevor's "explosion of the fourth wall" forces players to confront their true psychic selves and their feelings about gruesome violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

## Michael De Santa: Reflecting American Culture and Consumerism

Michael De Santa, a retired bank robber in witness protection, provides a lens through which to discuss the clichéd California lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. His character explores themes related to the economy, capitalism, personal fitness, paparazzi, celebrity, and media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

Michael's family life is a [[representation_and_parody_of_american_culture_and_lifestyle_in_grand_theft_auto_v | parody]] of stereotypical Los Angeleanos, with his wife's affairs, his son's identity issues, and his daughter's involvement with porn stars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. Despite his criticisms of capitalism, Michael remains immersed in luxury, owning a yacht, a fancy house, and expensive cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. This highlights a superficial critique of consumption common among those in Hollywood who complain without challenging the underlying logic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.

The game's setting itself is a "tongue and cheek play" on real California locations, featuring parodies of landmarks like Venice Beach (Vespucci Beach), Hollywood (Vinewood), and the Santa Monica Pier (Del Perro Pier) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. GTA V also offers an "all out criticism" of a media-driven world, with parodies of radio, television, film, and social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. Michael's storyline ultimately critiques the emptiness inherent in the shallow, upper-class California lifestyle, built around appearance, plastic surgery, self-help, leisure, and misery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.

## Franklin Clinton: Addressing Race and Societal Double Standards

Franklin Clinton, an ambitious youth from South Los Santos, acts as a catalyst for the game's events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. His story delves into the commodification and [[race_cultural_appropriation_and_social_critique_in_grand_theft_auto_v | appropriation of black culture]] and issues of white-collar crime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

### White-Collar Crime and Police Violence

The game highlights a significant societal double standard: despite characters engaging in stock market manipulation and insider trading, they are never caught or sent to jail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>. This impunity for economic corruption stands in stark contrast to the aggressive police presence in the inner city, where the LSPD's motto is "Obey and Survive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. The LSPD is a caricature of the LAPD, satirizing its controversial history of [[the_impact_of_systemic_racism_and_societal_norms | race relations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.

### Cultural Appropriation and Player Identity

Franklin's interactions with other characters reveal complicated relations with race, as non-black characters like Trevor, Jimmy, and Devin adopt "street vernacular" when speaking to him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. Jimmy, in particular, "wears blackness like a mask," acting as a foil to Franklin's "authentic blackness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.

This theme extends to the player, who can switch to Franklin and "play an 'original gangsta'" without having to deal with the daily realities of being a person of color in America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>. GTA V confronts the desire for a guilt-free solution to [[the_impact_of_systemic_racism_and_societal_norms | racism]] by prompting players to laugh at white characters awkwardly attempting to pass as black, while the players themselves literally control a "stereotypical shadow of a black male" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>. The game self-reflexively makes the audience experience the same gratification that characters like "Jizzle" derive from the "vitality of 'black culture'," making a nuanced statement on [[the_impact_of_systemic_racism_and_societal_norms | racial politics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>.

## Conclusion

Rather than simply glorifying sex, violence, and drug use, GTA V functions as a "mirror that shows America its true nature" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>. The game's writers utilize these controversial elements to craft a masterful [[social_commentary_in_the_walking_dead | social commentary]] and criticism of American culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>. Through characters like Michael, Trevor, and Franklin, GTA V destabilizes the player's ability to believe in the seriousness of the game world, reflecting back player behavior and societal norms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>.

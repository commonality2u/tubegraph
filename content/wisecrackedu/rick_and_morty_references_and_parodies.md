The animated series [[rick_and_morty_episode_analysis | Rick and Morty]] is densely packed with references to [[scifi_horror_and_fantasy_themes_in_rick_and_morty | sci-fi, horror, and fantasy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. These range from simple homages and throwaway jokes to thought-provoking and insightful inversions of common clichés and tropes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. By observing how [[inversion_of_common_cliches_and_tropes_in_rick_and_morty | Rick and Morty inverts common cliches and tropes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>, viewers can gain a deeper understanding of the show's intelligence and why it resonates with audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. The [[significance_of_science_fiction_and_horror_references_in_rick_and_morty | significance of science fiction and horror references in Rick and Morty]] often lies in how they deconstruct established narratives and themes.

## Literary and Thematic References

### "Something Ricked This Way Comes" (Season 1, Episode 9)

This episode parodies the "deal with the devil" trope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
*   **Ray Bradbury's *Something Wicked This Way Comes***: The episode title is a direct reference to Bradbury's novel about a carnival offering a magical carousel that alters age, with a hidden catch that binds beneficiaries to the carnival's evil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   **Stephen King's *Needful Things***: The Devil's shop in the episode, named "Needful Things," is a nod to King's novel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. In King's book, people are tricked into buying seemingly valuable items at low costs, with the catch being that they must play pranks that lead to civil unrest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   **Inversion of the "Deal with the Devil"**: Traditional stories reflect consequences for selfish desires that thwart the natural order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. *Rick and Morty* subverts this moral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. Rick's scientific prowess allows characters to have whatever they want without needing to sell their soul or face a debilitating curse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Science removes mystical repercussions, allowing for seemingly consequence-free desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. Rick's science "demystifies" the trope, portraying it as a "paranoid fairy tale" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. The show suggests that "evil" is less horrifying than "pure, disinterested science" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>, as karmic retribution provides a calming assurance of cosmic justice that science negates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

### "Lawnmower Dog" (Season 1, Episode 2)

*   **1992 film *Lawnmower Man***: The episode's title is derived from this film, which centers on a gardener transformed into a genius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. In *Rick and Morty*, Rick inadvertently makes the family dog, Snuffles, intelligent enough to subjugate humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.
*   **George Orwell's *Animal Farm***: Snuffles rejects his "slave name" and adopts "Snowball," referencing the revolutionary pig in Orwell's allegorical novel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. The interspecies conflict in *Rick and Morty* mirrors the war waged by farm animals against their human masters in *Animal Farm* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. While Orwell's animals rebel against exploited labor, Snuffles rebels against the "lazy life of pethood" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.
    *   **Inversion**: In *Animal Farm*, the rebellious animals gradually transform into the very farmers they fought against, with pigs walking on two feet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. In *Rick and Morty*, a dystopian outcome is averted when Snowball realizes he is becoming everything he hated about humanity, aided by an *Inception*-like dream sequence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.
*   ***Dogworld***: The episode also references "Dogworld," a series concept by co-creator Justin Roiland, featuring a dimension run by dogs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. Rick even pitches "Dogworld" as its own show at the end of the episode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.

### Fairy Tales

*   **Demystification of Fantasy**: *Rick and Morty* frequently trivializes fantasy by subjecting it to the mundanity and harsh realities of everyday life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.
*   **"Meeseeks and Destroy" (Season 1, Episode 5)**: This episode overtly exemplifies this approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. Morty embarks on a cliché fairy tale adventure to help a poor village by enacting a story similar to *Jack and the Beanstalk* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. The original fairy tale portrays Jack robbing and killing a giant without consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. *Rick and Morty* "normalizes" this by applying realism, dispelling the "cheery optimism" of children's stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. Morty is put on trial for murder and confronted by the giant's grieving widow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. Additionally, the village's king is revealed to be a sexual predator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

## Film and Television References

### "Auto Erotic Assimilation" (Season 2, Episode 3)

This episode critiques basic values and explores Rick's psyche through popular fears of conformity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.
*   **1956 film *Invasion of the Body Snatchers***: Rick's ex-girlfriend, Unity, a hivemind collective that assimilates alien races, references this film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. The film depicts aliens replacing humans with emotionless replicas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>, similar to Unity's subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. *Invasion of the Body Snatchers* was interpreted as a commentary on the threat of the Soviet Union and the loss of individualism under Communism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
*   **Inversion of Conformity Fears**: *Rick and Morty* inverts this by showing that the "freedom" associated with individualism can be undesirable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. While *Body Snatchers* projects anxiety about Communism destroying individualism, *Rick and Morty* highlights the "not-fictional horrors of our own freedoms" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. For example, Unity's liberated denizens recall past lives as sex offenders and drug addicts, and their release from the collective leads to a "nipple-driven race war" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. This tension between individual freedom and collective existence develops Rick's character, as his egotism ultimately destroys his relationship with Unity and her society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.
*   ***Community***: A bonus reference in the episode is a recreation of *Community*, Dan Harmon's previous show, playing on TV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. Jeff Winger, *Community*'s main character, shares Rick's egotistical personality and struggles with interpersonal relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.

### "Raising Gazorpazorp" (Season 1, Episode 7)

*   **1974 film *Zardoz***: This obscure film plays a prominent role, serving as the basis for the episode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. *Zardoz* is known for its imagery of Sean Connery in a peculiar outfit and a giant floating head proclaiming, "The gun is good, the penis is evil" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.
*   **Thematic Similarities and Changes**: *Zardoz* features a giant-floating-head-god commanding savages, with one (Zed) discovering the god is a lie, a convoluted plan by immortal aristocrats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. "Raising Gazorpazorp" adapts this plot, replacing the conflict between immortals and savages with men and women, while retaining the idea that "the penis is still evil" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>, all precipitated by Morty's desire for a sex doll <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.
*   **Atheism Theme**: The *Zardoz* reference reinforces the show's general theme of atheism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. Just as Zed discovers his god is a lie and kills it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>, *Rick and Morty* constantly reminds viewers that "either there is no God, or that God isn’t all that great" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

### Horror References

*   ***A Nightmare on Elm Street***: The character Scary Terry is a "legally safe knockoff" of Freddy Krueger from this iconic horror film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.
*   **Demystification of Horror**: While Scary Terry can murder in dreams, *Rick and Morty* dispels his terror by revealing his "utterly banal" life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>. The tormentor of dreams has a "shitty home life" and fears the same "lame dreams" as ordinary people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.

### Medical and Adventure References

*   ***Jurassic Park*** and ***Fantastic Voyage***: "Anatomy Park" (Season 1, Episode 3) directly references both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.
*   **Inversion**: While *Fantastic Voyage* often portrays the human body as a wonder of the natural world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>, *Rick and Morty* presents it as a "gonorrhea infested nightmare" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Overarching Device
> One of the most prevalent humorous devices in *Rick and Morty* is "robbing fantasy of its magic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. The show trivializes everything, not just fairy tales, but also concepts like family, love, and even life itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.

*The Walking Dead* explores a multitude of issues, including politics, psychology, and humanity's relationship to death and its own nature in a post-apocalyptic setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. The show depicts the transformation of its characters, like Sheriff Rick Grimes and his band of survivors, from "coddled complainers" into "battle-tested zombie murdering badasses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. The zombie sub-genre historically offers social commentary, with zombies acting as metaphors for various societal fears, such as mindless consumers, public health crises, immigration, or corporations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. The show's exploration delves into deep philosophical questions about what it means to be alive and human when faced with extreme conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

## Defining Life and Humanity

*The Walking Dead* centers on three key philosophical boundaries: What constitutes life? What constitutes "living"? And what constitutes being human? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a> The show constantly interrogates the difference between life and death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. The title itself, "The Walking Dead," refers not only to the zombies but also to the survivors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

A crucial moment occurs at the CDC, where Dr. Jenner reveals that everyone is infected, blurring the line between "walker" and human <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. The show frequently explores this distinction, sometimes blurring, questioning, or affirming it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

Characters struggle to let go of loved ones who have turned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>:
*   Morgan cannot shoot his reanimated wife and later loses his son <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.
*   Hershel collects zombies, convinced there's still something human about them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
*   The Governor keeps his zombified daughter trapped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

The definition of life can be broken down into philosophical and biological senses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. While walkers are biologically active enough to move and groan, the philosophical question is: What constitutes a life worth living? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>

Each character has their own reasons for continuing to live:
*   **Dale** believes all life is sacred and struggles to let go, even when his wife was dying from cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.
*   **Carol** values survival as its own end, showing utter pragmatism in her actions to survive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.
*   **Rick** shares an anecdote from his grandpa, suggesting that one must pretend to be "dead" and do what is necessary to eventually "make it out alive" and "get to live" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

At the CDC, Dr. Jenner, Andrea, and Jacqui consider suicide, believing there's no point to a life devoid of meaning and full of misery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. However, philosopher Albert Camus argued that despite life's meaninglessness, only life offers freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.

Another key question is: What makes us human, or what makes us *not* a zombie? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>
*   Humans supposedly have purpose and don't hunger for flesh, unlike zombies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.
*   The show confronts this when Rick's group encounters cannibals at Terminus, raising the question of what truly differentiates survivors from zombies if they resort to aimless wandering and cannibalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

The blurry distinction between human and animal drives survivors to distance themselves from walkers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. Most survivors prefer to be killed before turning to receive a proper burial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. The show suggests that everything defining humans is stripped away, leaving only biological selves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. Rick asserts that social distinctions are gone, leaving "us and the dead" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

However, survivors desperately cling to symbols of their former humanity, such as Rick's sheriff's hat, Carol's longing for her Maytag, or Andrea's Mermaid necklace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. The show implies that elements separating human from animal include social status, possessions, and comfort like hot showers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

Aristotle argued that humans' ability to speak and reason distinguished them from animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. In *The Walking Dead*, the loss of reason and speech by zombies warrants the claim that they are no longer human <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

## [[Moral ambiguity in storytelling | Moral Lines]] and the Degeneration of Humanity

In *The Walking Dead*, zombies are not always the scariest threat; humanity's worst behaviors are constantly exhibited, including abusive partners, rapists, bandits, "The Wolves," and the cannibals of Terminus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. Terminus, named after the Roman god of boundaries, is a place where many moral boundaries are crossed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. Its inhabitants not only eat human flesh but operate with chilling bureaucracy, meticulously accounting for their victims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.

The Terminus storyline blurs several binaries:
*   Human — Zombie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>
*   Human — Animal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>
*   Good — Evil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>
*   Civilization — Barbarism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>

While the residents of Terminus have lost their humanity, they ironically exhibit bureaucracy, a "crowning achievement" of humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. The line between human and animal serves as a framework for how people live and what gets exploited, epitomized by Gareth's philosophy: "You're either the Butcher or the Cattle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.

Terminus functions as a cautionary tale: its residents were originally survivors who were terrorized and abused by bandits, leading them to adopt extreme measures for survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. This transformation suggests that morality, along with comfort, is what separates humans from animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. Glenn convinces Rick to help others trapped in Terminus, asserting that "That's still who we are" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. Dale emphasizes the importance of preserving justice and humanity, stating that "keeping our humanity? That's a choice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.

The show explores whether walkers retain a shred of their former selves, as questioned by The Governor and Milton <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. Similarly, it asks if living but morally corrupted individuals retain any sense of their former selves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>. This is further explored through Morgan, who loses his connection to reality after his family dies but is rehabilitated by a former psychiatrist, coming to believe that "no person is too far gone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. This belief leads Morgan to refuse to kill even "The Wolves," who most consider to have lost all humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.

## The [[Moral Dilemmas and Security Logic in Apocalyptic Worlds | State of Exception]] and Sovereignty

A recurring theme in the show is the struggle between dictatorship and democracy, especially when juggling survival tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. While Rick's group initially discusses decisions, violence is always an imminent backup, and in emergency situations, talking is not always expedient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. Rick openly declares a dictatorship at the end of Season 2, stating, "This isn't a democracy anymore" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>.

The term "dictatorship" originated in Ancient Rome, referring to absolute power bestowed during extreme emergencies to protect against annihilation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>. The famous example is Cincinnatus, a Roman statesman who left his farm twice to serve as dictator, saving Rome, and then immediately resigned his power to return to farming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>. Rick Grimes is presented as a modern Cincinnatus, leaving his former life to protect against threats and seemingly returning to a more peaceful existence when the threat subsides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>.

The show uses Roman connections beyond just dictatorships, including The Governor's gladiator-like fight club, Terminus (Roman god of boundaries), and a Bible verse scrawled on a wall (Romans 6:4) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>. This commentary on politics and sovereignty uses Roman history, a site of both extreme tyrants and foundational representative government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>.

According to German political theorist Carl Schmitt, the sovereign is "whoever makes the exception"—the person who can discard the law to create exceptions to the rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>. Rick Grimes is the most obvious example, declaring democracy over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. Other characters also suspend the law: Shane kills Randall against the group's will, and Carol kills flu victims to protect the prison group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>.

Italian philosopher Giorgio Agamben argues that the state of exception has become the "law of our time," where the suspension of law permeates society, as seen in the war on terror or refugee camps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>. Agamben sought to understand how Nazi concentration camps occurred, finding the answer in the state of exception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>.

Rick is portrayed as a typical modern sovereign, suspending law to achieve goals and save people, which sometimes leads him to do "really messed up things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>. The terrifying difference between Rick and Gareth is that in Terminus, the suspension of law, including basic human morality, has become permanent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>. Agamben finds it terrifying that the "Rick's of the world are only a few setbacks away from becoming Gareth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>.

The show makes it clear that such atrocities are committed in the name of survival, invoking the "us or them" logic akin to Nietzsche's "bird of prey" and "lamb" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>. Agamben states that "the camp is the space that opens up when the state of exception starts to become the rule" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>. The problem is that whether atrocities occur depends on the law enforcer as sovereign, rather than the rule of law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>.

*The Walking Dead* poses critical questions about life, humanity, and morality in extreme circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:33">[00:18:33]</a>. It leaves open whether Rick and his group will rebuild or if Rick will continue to ruin every place he encounters, ultimately questioning if the world will need to be saved from Rick himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:49">[00:18:49]</a>.

The film *The Purge* explores themes related to [[class_struggles_and_economic_disparities_highlighted_by_the_purge | social stratification]] and the imbalance of power in society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

## Government and the Purge

The government in *The Purge* decides to legalize murder, albeit for a limited period, as an "improvement" for society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This act, sanctioned by the "new Founding Fathers," is met with an "almost religious fervor" by citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. The film suggests that this system leads to a "rebirth" of the nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

## Social Stratification and Disparity

A central focus of *The Purge* is America's problems with [[class_struggles_and_economic_disparities_highlighted_by_the_purge | social stratification]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.
Although the Purge laws are presented as "race and class neutral," they disproportionately affect the disenfranchised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. Those targeted are unable to afford protection such as "diamond-edged blades or truffle-infused security systems" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. The film explicitly states, "The poor can't afford to protect themselves. They're the victims tonight" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

### The Wealthy Elite as Perpetrators

The antagonists in the film are depicted wearing "prep school attire," which signifies the "wealthy elite" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. These individuals treat the hunting of a homeless black "non-contributor" as an extracurricular activity for their college applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. This power imbalance is compared to the War on Drugs in the 1980s, where laws were "100 times harsher for crack cocaine," which affected poor black communities, compared to powder cocaine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

### Economic Implications

Despite the evident social injustices, *The Purge* presents a world where, ostensibly, "crime is down" and "the economy is flourishing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. This suggests a utilitarian justification for the Purge by the powerful, overlooking the human cost.

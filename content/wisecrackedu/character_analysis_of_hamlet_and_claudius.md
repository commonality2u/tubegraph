The play *Hamlet* by William Shakespeare opens with the kingdom of Elsinore in disarray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Hamlet

Prince Hamlet is introduced as "crunk" or upset due to his mother, Queen Gertrude, marrying his uncle Claudius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. His emotional state intensifies when the ghost of his father, the old King, reveals that Claudius murdered him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. The ghost instructs Hamlet to seek revenge and "put a toe tag on that fool Claudius" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

Initially, Hamlet's erratic behavior leads others, such as Ophelia's family, to believe he is merely "love-sick" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. To confirm Claudius's guilt, Hamlet stages a play reenacting the murder of the old King <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. Claudius's strong reaction confirms Hamlet's suspicions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. During a heated confrontation with his mother, Hamlet accidentally kills Polonius, Ophelia's father, believing him to be Claudius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. This act sets off a chain of events leading to his own death in a duel with Laertes, Polonius's son <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

### Procrastination and Internal Conflict

A significant aspect of Hamlet's character is his [[hamlets_procrastination_and_internal_conflict | procrastination and internal conflict]] regarding the task of killing Claudius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. His delay is one of the most debated subjects in Shakespearean studies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. Various interpretations exist for this hesitation:

*   Some suggest Hamlet is "too much of a sensitive bitch" to operate effectively in a "world of gangstas playing dirty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
*   Others propose he has an "Oedipal Complex," meaning he cannot bring himself to kill Claudius because Claudius has done what Hamlet unconsciously desires: killed his father and become intimate with his mother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   Another perspective suggests Hamlet is trying to "buck the system" and dismantle a "crooked kingdom overflowing with lies and treachery" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

Hamlet's character also captures the ambiguity of modernity, as he lacks a clear devotion to a single code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. His "divided mind and will" lead to ethical and metaphysical uncertainties that hinder his actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

His famous "to be or not to be" speech exemplifies this uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. Interpretations vary, with some suggesting it reflects a struggle between life and death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>, while others believe it's a choice between Christian self-denial and taking violent action to claim his throne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. The play itself presents uncertainties, such as whether Hamlet's madness is genuine or feigned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

## Claudius

Claudius is the brother of the old King and becomes the new King by marrying Queen Gertrude soon after his brother's death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. The ghost of the old King reveals that Claudius "straight iced his ass cold blooded" in a plot to gain the crown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

Claudius's guilt is publicly confirmed when Hamlet stages a play depicting the murder, causing Claudius to react by abruptly leaving the performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. He is portrayed as a calculating and treacherous individual. After Hamlet kills Polonius, Claudius devises a plan with Laertes to kill Hamlet during a duel, suggesting Laertes poison his sword and Claudius prepare poisoned wine as a backup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. In the play's climax, Laertes, dying from his own poisoned blade, confesses that Claudius is trying to poison Hamlet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. Hamlet then stabs Claudius and forces him to drink from the poisoned cup, ensuring his death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

Claudius embodies the [[themes_of_corruption_and_treachery_in_hamlet | themes of corruption and treachery]] that permeate the kingdom. The play uses imagery of "skin disease" and "ulcerous places" to symbolize how characters like Claudius, despite appearing righteous, harbor "ruin and corruption underneath" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

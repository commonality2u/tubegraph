The enduring popularity of *The Office*, which was the most streamed show on Netflix for over six years, can be attributed partly to its reflection of [[the_role_of_nonsense_in_professional_life_as_depicted_in_the_office | complete and utter BS]] that has permeated professional lives and the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:28">[01:13:28]</a>. Unlike shows that depict characters with ample leisure time, *The Office* presents characters who "sit around doing nothing all day, but this time at a desk" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:09">[01:07:09]</a>. This phenomenon aligns with anthropologist David Graeber's argument regarding the proliferation of [[bs_jobs_and_the_modern_workplace | BS jobs]] in the developed world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:05">[04:02:05]</a>.

## What is a "BS Job"?

David Graeber defines a "BS job" as "a form of paid employment that is so completely pointless, unnecessary, or pernicious that even the employee cannot justify its existence, even though as part of the conditions of employment the employee feels obliged to pretend that this is not the case" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:05">[04:08:05]</a>.

*The Office* provides a prime example of this concept, with characters at Dunder Mifflin frequently engaging in "useless meetings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>, pursuing "random BS directives of superiors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:03">[04:41:03]</a>, and struggling to find meaning in a job nearing obsolescence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:08">[04:38:08]</a>. While some Dunder Mifflin employees like Oscar and Angela perform competent work, many characters exhibit behaviors consistent with Graeber's definition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:02">[05:14:02]</a>. They are aware of the general pointlessness of their work, as Dunder Mifflin struggles to compete with modern chains and could close at any moment without significant economic impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:07">[05:27:07]</a>.

### Examples of BS Jobs in Dunder Mifflin

Much of the workday at Dunder Mifflin is dedicated to "nonsense meetings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:08">[05:46:08]</a>, trivial activities like "flonkerton" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:03">[05:59:03]</a>, and office romance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:03">[06:01:03]</a>.

*   **Jim Halpert:** Jim, often praised for being smart, spends most of his time scheming and playing pranks on Dwight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>. Despite this, he is repeatedly offered promotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:34:00">[06:34:00]</a>.
*   **Pam Beesly:** Pam often dedicates her work time to planning her wedding and conspiring with Jim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41:00">[06:41:00]</a>. She even invents the role of "office administrator" for herself to avoid being fired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:45:00">[06:45:00]</a>.
*   **Kevin Malone:** An accountant who can barely do math, Kevin remained employed for years because firing him would be uncomfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:00">[06:50:00]</a>.
*   **Andy Bernard:** As manager, Andy spends months away from the office on a boat without anyone noticing, and the branch excels in his absence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>. Graeber notes that people in BS jobs often muse that "nobody would notice, care, or be worse off if their BS job disappeared" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:00">[07:38:00]</a>.
*   **Michael Scott:** Michael, though the regional manager, often impedes productivity, yet convinces himself his job is to break up monotony for staff well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:29:00">[10:29:00]</a>. He frequently feigns busyness when it's convenient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:04:00">[11:04:00]</a>.
*   **Dunder Mifflin Itself:** Michael's explanation to children reveals the superfluous nature of the paper company: they buy paper from a manufacturer and sell it for more, leading the children to question why the manufacturer doesn't sell directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15:00">[08:15:00]</a>.

## Why Do BS Jobs Proliferate?

Graeber highlights a paradox: a free market theoretically should eliminate such waste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:45:00">[08:45:00]</a>. Despite market pressures leading to layoffs and mergers, the Scranton branch of Dunder Mifflin inexplicably succeeds despite significant inefficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:00">[09:14:00]</a>.

Societally, there's a reluctance to admit that capitalism could sustain pointless jobs, mirroring how the Soviet Union invented jobs to ensure full employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:28:00">[16:28:00]</a>.

Graeber theorizes that the proliferation of [[bs_jobs_and_the_modern_workplace | BS jobs]] is also linked to the rise of the service economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:50:00">[16:50:00]</a>. While traditional service roles remained steady, there has been a boom in administrators, consultants, clerical and accounting staff, and IT professionals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:04:00">[17:04:00]</a>. Dunder Mifflin, which does not actually *make* paper, exists squarely within this service economy, justifying higher prices through customer service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:54:00">[17:54:00]</a>.

### Categories of BS Jobs

Graeber categorizes [[bs_jobs_and_the_modern_workplace | BS jobs]] into several types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:18:00">[17:18:00]</a>:
*   **Flunkies:** Employees who exist solely to justify a manager's position or inflate their prestige <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:21:00">[17:21:00]</a>.
*   **Goons:** Roles that exist because other companies have them, such as legal or marketing departments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:27:00">[17:27:00]</a>.
*   **Duct-tapers:** Those who clean up the mess of inefficient systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:32:00">[17:32:00]</a>.
*   **Box-tickers:** Individuals who exist solely to verify that some other actual work is being done, even if it's not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:42:00">[17:42:00]</a>.
*   **Task-masters:** Those who create BS work for other BS employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:49:00">[17:49:00]</a>.

## The Psychological Impact of Pointless Work

Graeber argues that pointless jobs are not just wasteful; they are "incredibly harmful to our psyche" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:21:00">[11:21:00]</a>. He documents cases of depression, anxiety, and guilt among those paid to do little or nothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:26:00">[11:26:00]</a>. Even employees who enjoyed extensive perks like long lunches and company travel were deeply unhappy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:37:00">[11:37:00]</a>.

Graeber contends that people derive pleasure from "being the cause," or having an effect on the world, however small <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:45:00">[11:45:00]</a>. Pointless jobs deprive individuals of this fundamental pleasure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:52:00">[11:52:00]</a>. He references Fyodor Dostoevsky's theory that the worst torture would be "to force someone to endlessly perform an obviously pointless task" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:57:00">[11:57:00]</a>.

Many employees at Dunder Mifflin are "forever thwarted from being the cause," whether by management, bureaucracy, or the inanity of their tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:10:00">[12:10:00]</a>.

### Coping with Pointlessness in *The Office*

[[the_psychology_and_sociology_of_work_as_explored_in_the_office | The characters in *The Office*]] often cope with their pointless professional lives by finding other ways to "be the cause":
*   **Jim Halpert:** Bored with his job, Jim copes by playing pranks on Dwight, reveling in being the cause of Dwight's suffering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:28:00">[12:28:00]</a>.
*   **Pam Beesly:** Similar to Jim, Pam finds coping mechanisms through distraction and eventually, love and family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:45:00">[12:45:00]</a>. She notes that being a receptionist was not her childhood dream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:54:00">[12:54:00]</a>.
*   **Stanley Hudson:** Stanley endures by looking forward to retirement, where he plans to carve wooden birds, and enjoying "pretzel day" at work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:02:00">[13:02:00]</a>.
*   **Oscar Martinez:** By the end of the show, Oscar runs for state senate, a role where he could theoretically effect change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:22:00">[13:22:00]</a>.
*   **Kevin Malone:** Kevin finds happiness and competence running a bar, where he is no longer a "deadweight" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:29:00">[13:29:00]</a>.
*   **Michael Scott:** Michael denies the superfluous nature of his job by framing it in grandiose terms and attempting to be loved and respected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:37:00">[13:37:00]</a>. His "complete hatred of Toby" is rooted in Toby's infringement on Michael's ability to be the cause in his own office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:42:00">[13:42:00]</a>.
*   **Dwight Schrute:** Dwight embraces the inanity, clinging to bureaucracy, titles, and the appearance of authority to fulfill his warped view of being the cause, despite also having a successful beet farm that involves "real work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:21:00">[15:21:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

A 2013 Harvard Business Review survey found that half of 12,000 professionals felt their job lacked meaning, and a separate poll indicated 37% of British workers considered their jobs "utterly useless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:12:00">[16:12:00]</a>. Graeber asserts that culturally, we are expected to show up for 40 hours a week, even if there is little real work, leading to a culture of "looking busy" and managers inventing pointless tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:00">[09:41:00]</a>. There is a general sense, he argues, that if one is not "suffering at your job then it's not worth compensating fairly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:00">[10:04:00]</a>, thus optimizing suffering instead of efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:10:00">[10:10:00]</a>.

*The Office* serves as an "escapist fantasy" where characters manage to cope with [[the_role_of_nonsense_in_professional_life_as_depicted_in_the_office | BS]] by either finding love or simply leaving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:22:00">[18:22:00]</a>. This suggests that for many, finding a better job or a fulfilling domestic life is the primary hope in a world increasingly filled with [[bs_jobs_and_the_modern_workplace | pointless work]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:42:00">[18:42:00]</a>.

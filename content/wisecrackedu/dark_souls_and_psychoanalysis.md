The *Dark Souls* series is characterized by its intense difficulty and notoriously cryptic storyline, which has often been described as "impossibly baffling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Some speculate that the plot deliberately leads nowhere, acting as a distraction from the game's true meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## Narrative Ambiguity and [[influence_of_philosophers_and_filmmakers_on_dark_souls_narrative | Filmmaking]]

The intentional ambiguity of *Dark Souls'* narrative can be compared to the works of pioneering Italian filmmaker Michaelangelo Antonioni <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. In films like "Blow Up" and "La Aventura," Antonioni seduces the audience with an intriguing plot only to leave central mysteries unresolved, suggesting the plot serves as a distraction from a deeper character study or thematic exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Similarly, in *Dark Souls*, the narrative may exist to deflect attention, allowing meaning to be conveyed through other means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## [[visual_storytelling_in_dark_souls | Visual Storytelling]] and Identity

Hidetaka Miyazaki, the creator of *Dark Souls*, constructs meaning not primarily through explicit plot or dialogue, but through [[visual_storytelling_in_dark_souls | visual design]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. For instance, the old lady spinning yarn at the beginning of *Dark Souls 2* visually references the Norns of Norse mythology, who spin the yarns of fate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

The game's thematic core revolves around piecing together a broken past and understanding one's identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. The character creation screen even prompts players with the question: "Is this your TRUE self?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. *Dark Souls* is interpreted as a nightmarish descent into the unconscious, exploring identity and deepest desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

## [[significance_of_birth_and_rebirth_imagery_in_dark_souls | Birth and Rebirth Imagery]]

The *Dark Souls* series frequently utilizes imagery related to birth and rebirth, suggesting a deeper psychological theme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

*   **Birthing Scenes:** The first *Dark Souls* begins with a visual birthing scene, where the camera plunges into a crevice resembling a vagina, through a tunnel like an ovary, and into a womb-like pit filled with emerging beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. *Dark Souls 2* features a similar scene in reverse, starting inside a labyrinth of tunnels and requiring the player to exit through a vagina-like crevice into the light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. This "tutorial" section is depicted as a womb, from which the player "develops enough" to be born and begin their quest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
*   **Womb-like Landscapes and Items:** Throughout the games, landscapes often appear womb or ovary-like <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. In *Dark Souls 1*, the essential item "Humanity" is deliberately shaped like a vagina <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. *Dark Souls 2* is full of mother symbols from the start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.
*   **Further Birth Symbolism:** Even after escaping the initial "womb," the games continue with birth imagery:
    *   Mysterious nests and eggs transport the player <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.
    *   The Demon Ruins are covered with hideous egg monsters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.
    *   Players can be infected with an "egg head" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
    *   Pregnant monsters are hidden in cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.
*   **Bloodborne Connections:** In *Bloodborne*, characters discuss bloody birth scenes and screaming pregnant women as players collect umbilical cord parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. The game ends with a Lovecraftian baby alien <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>, and "blood dregs" suspiciously resemble semen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. The title "Bloodborne" itself alludes to these themes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.
*   **"Womb Raiding":** While "tomb raiding" is common, *Dark Souls* uniquely features "womb raiding," where players don't seem to want to escape the womb-world but rather plunge deeper into it, seeking secrets within its depths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

## [[freudian_elements_in_dark_souls | Freudian Psychoanalysis]]

The game's obsession with birth and identity is deeply rooted in Freudian psychoanalysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

### Search for Origins and the Primal Scene

Sigmund Freud believed that the complexity of identity leads individuals to look back to their very origins—even to the mother's womb and the "primal scene" of parental intercourse—as a means of understanding themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. The opening line of *Dark Souls 2*, "perhaps you’ve seen it, maybe in a dream. A murky, forgotten land," suggests a dream of this primal, inaccessible past, driving an endless search for identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

### Castration Anxiety

Despite the desire to metaphorically re-enter the mother's womb, social taboos and prohibitions prevent this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. Freud posited that the father figure is the one who enforces this prohibition, preventing access to the mother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.

*   **Phallic Guards:** *Dark Souls* is filled with metaphorical moments where the player encounters arched doorways (representing desired access) blocked by male guards wielding "big, erect, throbbing... weapons" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. These "castrating figures" wielding "phallic weaponry" (swords, spears, halberds) are nearly all the enemies in the game, blocking access to crevice-like passages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. The boss "The Penetrator" in *Demon's Souls* is an explicit example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.
*   **"You Died" Screen:** The frequent "You Died" screen, which the average player sees hundreds of times, creates a feeling of constant failure and impotence, mirroring the atmosphere of Freudian castration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. Defeat by "giant hulking male giants wielding formidable phalluses" further emphasizes this feeling of deflated manhood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.
*   **Vagina Dentata:** Female enemies also embody castration anxiety. Scorpioness Najka and Mytha the Baneful feature attractive upper halves combined with weaponized, dangerous lower halves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. Queen Queelag has monstrous teeth in place of a vagina, a direct representation of the "Vagina Dentata" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. This ancient folklore concept, later significant in psychoanalysis, symbolizes a vagina with "secretly hidden ferocious penis decapitating fangs," reinforcing the idea that attempting to re-enter the womb is a terrifying social taboo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.

Thus, *Dark Souls* visually embodies Freud’s concept of castration anxiety by presenting a strong desire and then attacking or symbolically castrating the player, leaving them feeling weak and unfulfilled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.

## The Throne of Want and Perpetual Unfulfillment

The ending of *Dark Souls 2* reverses the initial birthing scene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. After defeating more "penis wielding giant alpha males," the hero enters a vagina-like door and is welcomed into the "Throne of Want" by a comforting female voice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. The throne itself is based on a "kiln," an oven historically associated with wombs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>. This throne represents the embodiment of ultimate desire and the fulfillment of deepest, most repressed wishes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

However, the player is left with a sense of frustration and unfulfillment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. The curse is not lifted, and the mysterious female voice states that "souls will flourish anew and all of this will play out again" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. This reflects the Lacanian argument by psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan, who suggested that true fulfillment is impossible because desire ceases once an object is attained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. The Ancient Dragon in *Dark Souls 2* directly states this, saying, "the curse of life is the curse of want," implying a destiny of perpetual unfulfillment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.

## Dark Souls as a Metaphor for Life

Miyazaki has commented that the *Dark Souls* games explore the "strange crossover between life and death," posing questions about what life and death truly are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>. Through a psychoanalytic lens, *Dark Souls* can be seen as a metaphor for life itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>: development in the womb, birth, followed by endless desire, frustration, and misery, culminating in a confrontation with death and a return to the "peaceful oblivion" of the mother's womb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. The game vividly visualizes unconscious desires, complicated relationships with birth, and the endless failure to achieve fulfillment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.

Greetings, and welcome to Earthling Cinema, hosted by Garyx Wormuloid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This week's artifact is [[Sausage Party movie analysis | *Sausage Party*]], a 90-minute film by Seth Rogen and his writing partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

### The Premise of the "Great Beyond"

The story takes place in an alternate version of Earth where all food items and some hygiene products and socks are living, breathing creatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Groceries in the supermarket worship human customers as gods and believe that being purchased is like ascending to heaven, known to them as the "moon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

The protagonists, Frank the sausage and Brenda the bun, are depicted as extremely horny, but they believe they must wait to have sex until after they "die" (get purchased) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. This initial repression of desire is central to the film's eventual embrace of hedonism.

### Revelation and Disillusionment

The film shatters the saccharine tone of typical animated films by portraying the sinister reality behind its many genital metaphors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. A jar of honey mustard reveals that the afterlife is a lie, taking his own life and causing a collision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. Frank later learns from Firewater that the "Great Beyond" is actually the "Fake Beyond," meaning it's made up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. This revelation is confirmed when groceries that were purchased earlier are seen being "brutally slaughtered" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

Frank later discovers a cookbook in the supermarket, revealing the horrible things that happen to food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Barry, a small chode, returns with a congressman's severed head, proving that the "gods" can be killed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. This incontrovertible proof becomes the catalyst for the food items to challenge their long-held beliefs, which had been a form of [[Platos noble lie concept in Sausage Party | Plato's noble lie]] concocted by non-perishables to pacify society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

### Embracing Hedonism

After realizing that their supposed gods can be killed, the food items proceed to wage war on humans, murdering them all in cold blood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. Following this violent uprising, the narrative seamlessly transitions into a "store-wide, non denominational fuckfest" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

This shift underscores the film's core message. [[Sausage Party movie analysis | *Sausage Party*]] functions as a cynical parable on [[religious_themes_in_sausage_party | religion]] and its societal effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. The film ultimately argues for the embrace of hedonism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. The message is that there is "no point living your life in anticipation of some pot of gold at the end of the rainbow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. The film suggests that since existence inevitably ends in being eaten, digested, or thrown away, individuals "might as well put aside your petty differences and pursue as much pleasure as you possibly can" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

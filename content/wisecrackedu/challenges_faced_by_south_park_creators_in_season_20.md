South Park, known for its dynamic and often unhinged approach, shifted from standalone episodes to season-long serialization in recent years, a change largely praised by viewers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. While Season 19 successfully wove together themes of [[political_correctness_and_its_critique_in_south_park | PC culture]], advertising, and gentrification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, Season 20 faced significant challenges, leading to a muddled narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## South Park's Storytelling "Golden Rule"

The success of South Park's writing hinges on a strict plotline rule: eliminating "and then" plot points in favor of "but" or "therefore" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. This rule ensures a clear cause-and-effect relationship between events, preventing a "random series of events" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. Each action beginning with "therefore" or "but" indicates a consequence or reaction to the previous action, ensuring every plot point matters and the show maintains momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

For example, in the famous Mormon episode:
*   An annoyingly perfect Mormon kid moves to town <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
*   **Therefore**, he pisses everyone off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
*   **Therefore**, Stan decides to kick his ass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
*   **But**, the kid is so nice that he tells Stan to go ahead and beat him up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
*   **Therefore**, Stan doesn't beat him up and agrees to go to the kid's house for dinner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

## Impact of Political Events: The 2016 US Election

The primary challenge for Season 20 stemmed from the 2016 US presidential election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. Creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker openly admitted they, like most pollsters, expected Hillary Clinton ("turd sandwich") to win and planned the entire season around that outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. The unexpected victory of Mr. Garrison ("giant douche") forced desperate, last-minute rewrites for the episode airing the day after the election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. This event caused the show to abandon its core storytelling rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>, leading to a "clusterf**k of and thens" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. This directly demonstrates the [[impact_of_political_events_on_south_parks_plot_development | impact of political events on South Park's plot development]].

## Muddled Plotlines Post-Election

### Member Berries Storyline

The "member berries" storyline was initially set up to align with South Park's golden rule:
*   Randy tries member berries and falls into a nostalgic trance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.
*   **Therefore**, Randy realizes they are dangerous brainwashing germs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
*   Mr. Garrison, leading in polls, realizes he has no plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
*   **Therefore**, he tries to sabotage his campaign for Hillary to win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
*   **But**, his voters demand an explanation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
*   **Therefore**, Randy explains the truth about nostalgic yearning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
*   **Therefore**, Randy and Garrison set out to destroy member berries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.
*   **But**, they realize the berries won't die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.
*   **Therefore**, Randy convinces Garrison to denounce nostalgia in a speech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

This setup anticipated a Hillary victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. However, once Mr. Garrison won, the storyline became chaotic:
*   **And then** Mr. Garrison wins anyway, "out of nowhere" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
*   **And then** Caitlin Jenner barfs, reinfecting Mr. Garrison and Randy with member berries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
*   This "rewinds" the plot, with them forgetting their quest and celebrating Garrison's victory, becoming "narrative backpedaling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
*   The member berries inexplicably transform from lazy intoxicating berries into a "weird vomit inducing virus" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>, briefly stopping at a 1920s nightclub, and then turning into "Nazi Member stormtroopers" allied with Vladimir Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. This progression lacked apparent logic and justification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

### Trolling Storyline

The "trolling" subplot, featuring Kyle's dad Gerald as "skankhunt42," also suffered:
*   Gerald's trolling angers the Danes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.
*   **Therefore**, the Danes threaten to release everyone's internet history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.
*   Hillary Clinton, expecting to win, fears Trolltrace will leak her online activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.
*   **Therefore**, she needs Skankhunt42 to save her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

After Clinton loses, the narrative crumbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. Her motivation to recruit Gerald disappears, yet she confusingly recruits him anyway for a vague mission to "infiltrate Trolltrace to protect U.S. secrets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. This scene was likely recycled from the original "if Hillary had won" script, where a newly elected Hillary would fear email exposure and recruit Gerald to delete evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

To salvage the plot, the show resorted to a series of illogical twists:
*   Clinton's claim is revealed as a ruse to kidnap American trolls for email protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.
*   **And then** the Danes are just trolling the captured American trolls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.
*   **And then** the top Danish guy is also a giant troll, not even Danish, just trolling the world "for the lulz" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.

These events lacked cause and effect, becoming a "random progression of events that build without any apparent logic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

## Narrative "Hari-Kari"

The writers openly complained about the narrative hole they created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. To resolve incomplete storylines, particularly the risk of Cartman's and Gerald's internet history being revealed, the show committed "plot hari-kari" by blowing up the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. This act, with help from Elon Musk's SpaceX program, deleted everyone's secrets, simultaneously destroying the season's carefully built cause-and-effect relationships, resulting in an unsatisfying "Psych! We're blowing everything up" conclusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.

## Lost Potential

Season 20 initially explored compelling themes, such as how the internet fragments public and private selves and how a sense of privacy allows people to behave poorly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. It also brilliantly skewered internet outrage cycles, showing how trolls manipulate emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. The idea of "Trevor's axiom," an online trolling equation that creates massive reactions and brings out the worst in humanity, was introduced but never fully developed as a potential explanation for Mr. Garrison's victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

In the alternate reality where Hillary won, the season would have focused on Bill Clinton ("First Gentleman of the U.S.") dealing with his wife's perceived "crazy bitch" nature and the escalating "battle of the sexes" at South Park Elementary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. This would have given more poignancy to Cartman's fear of his girlfriend Heidi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>. However, this plotline was understandably abandoned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.

## The Future of South Park's Serialization

The creators hinted at "the end of serialization as we know it" in Season 20's finale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. While messy, Season 20 had promise, and previous serialized seasons (18 and 19) are considered some of their best work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. The challenges faced by South Park in Season 20 highlight the difficulties of creating long-form narratives that are highly reactive to real-world events.

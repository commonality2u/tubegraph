From: [[wisecrackedu]] <br/> 

George Orwell's novella, [[plot_summary_of_animal_farm | Animal Farm]], explores the corrupting influence of power and how revolutionary ideals can be twisted by those who seek control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

## The Rise and Fall of Animalism

Initially, the animals of Manor Farm rise up against their human oppressor, Farmer Jones, and establish their own society, renaming it [[plot_summary_of_animal_farm | Animal Farm]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. They lay down a new philosophy called Animalism, whose main principle is that "All animals are equal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. This initial revolution is considered "legit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

After the humans are expelled, two pigs, [[character_analysis_of_napoleon_snowball_squealer_and_old_major | Napoleon]] and [[character_analysis_of_napoleon_snowball_squealer_and_old_major | Snowball]], begin calling the shots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. However, their constant disagreements foreshadow the internal power struggles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

## The Corrupting Nature of Power

The story demonstrates how power can corrupt the mind, even leading loyal individuals like Boxer to worship a corrupt leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

### [[character_analysis_of_napoleon_snowball_squealer_and_old_major | Napoleon]]'s Seizure of Power
A key moment of corruption occurs when [[character_analysis_of_napoleon_snowball_squealer_and_old_major | Napoleon]] becomes angry about the animals siding with [[character_analysis_of_napoleon_snowball_squealer_and_old_major | Snowball]] regarding the windmill idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. He subsequently chases [[character_analysis_of_napoleon_snowball_squealer_and_old_major | Snowball]] off the farm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

### Deception and Manipulation
[[character_analysis_of_napoleon_snowball_squealer_and_old_major | Squealer]], another pig, plays a crucial role in maintaining [[character_analysis_of_napoleon_snowball_squealer_and_old_major | Napoleon]]'s power through [[themes_of_deception_and_corruption | deception]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. [[character_analysis_of_napoleon_snowball_squealer_and_old_major | Squealer]] tells everyone that [[character_analysis_of_napoleon_snowball_squealer_and_old_major | Snowball]] was nothing but a "snitch and a traitor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

Over time, the seven commandments of Animalism are gradually "twisted little by little" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. Eventually, only one commandment remains, which is altered to reflect the pigs' dominance: "all animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

### Reversion to Oppression
The pigs, realizing they cannot get all the necessary "swag" on their own, begin trading with their former human enemies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. Eventually, the pigs become so corrupt that they start behaving exactly like humans, walking on two legs and holding "whips of oppression" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. By the end, there is no discernible difference between the pigs and humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. This represents a cyclical return to the starting point of oppression, where the oppressors simply switch places <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

## Allegorical Significance
[[plot_summary_of_animal_farm | Animal Farm]] serves as an [[allegory_for_the_soviet_union_and_its_leaders | allegory for the rise and fall of the Soviet Union]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

Orwell used animals to discuss the [[allegory_for_the_soviet_union_and_its_leaders | Soviet Union]] because of the dehumanizing aspects of certain political systems, referencing Karl Marx's idea that "The worker in this human functions no longer feels himself to be anything but animal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. The book suggests that what is animal becomes human, and what is human becomes animal, highlighting the loss of humanity under oppressive power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

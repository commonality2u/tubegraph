For several seasons, *South Park* has moved away from its traditional standalone episodes to embrace [[south_park_season_19_and_serialized_storytelling | season-long serialization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This shift has largely been well-received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Success in Season 19

[[south_park_season_19_and_serialized_storytelling | South Park Season 19]] was noted for brilliantly blending themes of PC culture, advertising, and gentrification across a multi-episode arc <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Challenges in Season 20

[[south_park_season_19_and_serialized_storytelling | Season 20]] kicked off with an even more ambitious storyline, juggling the presidential election, Member Berries, a militant feminist Cartman, a "girl hating dick flashing" Butters, and extensive [[trolling_and_internet_culture_in_south_park | internet trolling]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Despite the promising setup, the season's conclusion reportedly "fizzled out into confusion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

### The "But" or "Therefore" Rule

The success of *South Park*'s [[south_parks_writing_rules_and_plot_structure | writing rules and plot structure]] relies on a strict narrative rule: each plot beat should connect to the next with a "but" or "therefore," rather than simply "and then" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
*   **"And then" leads to weak narrative**: If "and then" belongs between beats, the narrative lacks cause and effect, allowing events to be rearranged without consequence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
*   **"But" or "therefore" creates strong narrative**: Replacing "ands" with "buts" or "therefores" makes for better writing by indicating a consequence or reaction to the previous action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. This ensures every plot point matters and the show maintains momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

#### Example: The Mormon Episode
In *South Park*'s Mormon episode:
*   An annoyingly perfect Mormon kid moves to town <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>,
*   **Therefore** he pisses everyone off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>,
*   **Therefore** Stan decides to kick his ass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
*   **But** the kid is so nice, he tells Stan to go ahead and beat him up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
*   **Therefore** Stan doesn't beat him up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
*   Instead, he agrees to go to the kid's house for dinner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

### Impact of the 2016 Presidential Election

The creators, Trey Parker and Matt Stone, expected Hillary Clinton ("turd sandwich") to win the 2016 presidential election and planned [[south_park_season_19_and_serialized_storytelling | Season 20]] around that outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. When Donald Trump (represented by Mr. Garrison, the "giant douche") won, the show had to undertake last-minute rewrites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. This unforeseen outcome led the show to break its core [[south_parks_writing_rules_and_plot_structure | writing rules]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

### Storyline Breakdown: Member Berries
The Member Berries storyline initially followed the "but" or "therefore" rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
*   Randy tries Member Berries and falls into a nostalgic trance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.
*   **Therefore**, Randy realizes Member Berries are dangerous brainwashing germs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
*   Mr. Garrison, leading in polls, realizes he has no plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
*   **Therefore**, Mr. Garrison tries to sabotage his campaign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
*   **But** his voters demand an explanation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
*   **Therefore**, Randy explains the truth about nostalgia's appeal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
*   **Therefore**, Randy and Garrison set out to destroy Member Berries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.
*   **But** they realize the berries won't die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.
*   **Therefore**, Randy convinces Garrison to denounce nostalgia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

However, after Trump's victory, the narrative devolved into a "cluster f**k of and thens" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>:
*   **And then** Mr. Garrison wins anyway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
*   **And then** Caitlin Jenner reinfects Garrison and Randy with Member Berries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
*   **And then** they forget their quest to destroy the berries and get stoked on Garrison's victory, effectively "rewinding" the plot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
*   The Member Berries themselves transform without justification: from intoxicating berries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>, to a "vomit inducing virus" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>, to appearing at a 1920s nightclub <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>, to being Nazis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>, and ultimately a "tiny fruit militia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. This progression lacked apparent logic, departing from *South Park*'s usual method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.

### Storyline Breakdown: Trolling
The [[trolling_and_internet_culture_in_south_park | trolling]] subplot, centered on Kyle's dad Gerald as "skankhunt42," also suffered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. Initially, it conformed to the show's structure:
*   Gerald's [[trolling_and_internet_culture_in_south_park | trolling]] angers the Danes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.
*   **Therefore** the Danes threaten to release everyone's internet history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

However, once Hillary lost the election, the narrative crumbled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>:
*   Without her presidency to defend, Hillary Clinton no longer had a logical reason to recruit Gerald <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
*   **And then**, confusingly, she recruits him anyway for a vague mission to "infiltrate Troll Trace to protect U.S. secrets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. This scene felt disjointed and was likely recycled material from the "if Hillary had won" version of the episode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.
*   In a desperate salvage attempt, it's revealed Clinton's claim was a ruse to help the Danes kidnap American trolls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.
*   **And then** the captured American trolls are merely being trolled themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.
*   **And then** the "top Danish guy" is also just a giant troll, and not even Danish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.

This series of events demonstrates a complete abandonment of the show's basic narrative premise, as none of the actions build off previous ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. The writers themselves openly complained about the narrative hole they dug <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.

### Conclusion of Season 20's Serialization
To conclude the messy storylines, *South Park* resorted to "plot hari-kari" by literally blowing up the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. This act, involving characters from Ike to Pentagon generals, destroyed the cause-and-effect relationship built throughout the season, leading to an unsatisfying "Psych! We're blowing everything up" conclusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. The season had otherwise brilliantly analyzed internet fragmentation and outrage cycles, but failed to develop these ideas to a proper conclusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.

## Alternate Reality Season 20

According to Trey Parker and Matt Stone, if Hillary Clinton had won the election, [[south_park_season_19_and_serialized_storytelling | Season 20]] would have focused on Bill Clinton ("First Gentleman") settling into his new role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>. This would have escalated the battle of the sexes already present at South Park Elementary and given more poignancy to Cartman's fear of his girlfriend Heidi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>.

## Future of Serialization
The creators indicated the "end of serialization as we know it" in the [[south_park_season_19_and_serialized_storytelling | Season 20]] finale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. While [[south_park_season_19_and_serialized_storytelling | Season 20]] was messy, the show did some of its best work during the serialized [[south_park_season_19_and_serialized_storytelling | seasons 18 and 19]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.

Alan Moore, a prolific comic book author, proposes a fascinating philosophy regarding the nature of reality, deeply influenced by the occult tradition of Hermeticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>. To Moore, reality is not solely composed of physical elements; it is broken down into two fundamental categories: the material and the immaterial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>.

## Defining Material and Immaterial Reality

*   **The Material** encompasses all physical phenomena: matter, energy, space, time, and fundamental forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:00">[03:23:00]</a>. However, humans never experience these directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>.
*   **The Immaterial** is the mental model our brains construct based on limited sensory information received from the material world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>. This internal, subjective [[Perception of Reality]] is the immaterial realm.

## The Interplay: Bridging Matter and Mind

Moore posits that magic is the phenomenon that bridges the divide between the material and the immaterial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>. This is not the magic of pulling rabbits from hats, but a "purposeful engagement with the phenomena and possibilities of consciousness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>.

### Thoughts Manifesting in Reality

Moore illustrates this through the creation of *Watchmen*:
*   An "ephemeral idea" in Moore's mind (immaterial) was given form by artist Dave Gibbons, becoming the tangible comic book (material) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>. Moore's "intangible thought had a tangible effect on the arrangement of the atoms that became Watchmen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>.

### Reality Influencing Perception

Conversely, the material can profoundly alter the immaterial:
*   The physical sound of a voice (material) can conjure an image in someone's mind, thereby altering their [[Perception of Reality]] (immaterial) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>. Moore views this act as "casting a genuine spell" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>.

### Magic as Art, Language, and Symbols

For Moore, "magic is intrinsically connected with art, language and consciousness to the point where these four things almost become different aspects of the same phenomenon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:00">[04:38:00]</a>. These serve as the "real wizard's wands" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:00">[04:34:00]</a>.

An example is the rabbit-duck illusion, where a fixed image can be perceived in two different ways. The meaning is not fixed, and a simple suggestion (language/storytelling) can instantly change one's [[Perception of Reality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>. This is "storytelling as spell-craft" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>.

### Dispelling Illusions and Changing Perception

[[Role of Imagination and Storytelling in Perceiving Reality | Storytelling]] can also dispel illusions:
*   In *Miracleman*, the character abolishes money by announcing that it is an "empty promise" and "imaginary" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>. The belief in money makes it real, and by changing that belief, it ceases to exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>. This highlights the [[Concept of Real vs Fake | fake]] nature of social constructs.
*   In *Promethea*, protagonist Sophie faces the demon-king Asmodeus. Initially fearsome, Asmodeus's appearance shifts to that of a human when Sophie and her companions approach him "humanely and with respect," acknowledging so-called demons as part of human nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>. "Expectation creates perspective" for the magician <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:24:00">[06:24:00]</a>.
*   [[Doctor Manhattan]] in *Watchmen* externally appears as an "ageless aquamarine Adonis" because this is how he internally perceives himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:00">[06:28:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:00">[06:31:00]</a>. His [[Perception of Reality]] (internal) dictates his appearance (external).

## The Apocalypse of Perception

Moore explores what happens if a story is so complete it changes the [[Perception of Reality]] for an entire species <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:13:00">[10:13:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:18:00">[10:18:00]</a>. For Moore, when a collective way of viewing the world ends, the "World ends" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:24:00">[10:24:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:29:00">[10:29:00]</a>.

In *Promethea*, humans are described as "amphibious," living in "matter and mind" simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:32:00">[10:32:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:37:00">[10:37:00]</a>. The goal of Promethea is to make people more aware of the "vast immaterial realm," tempting them to explore it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:41:00">[10:41:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:44:00">[10:44:00]</a>. This would be a "great Devonian leap" from matter to mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:49:00">[10:49:00]</a>.

Moore believes humanity's ideas about the world began with a similar leap:
*   Representation and language allowed for concepts to stand for physical objects, leading to "humanity’s first ‘purposeful engagement with the phenomena and possibilities of consciousness’" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:02:00">[11:02:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:08:00">[11:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:17:00">[11:17:00]</a>.
*   This engagement gave rise to all human culture, including writing, painting, song, music, theatre, science, medicine, and politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:22:00">[11:22:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:27:00">[11:27:00]</a>.

Thus, if the world began with this shift from matter to mind, it could also end by changing the way it is perceived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:33:00">[11:33:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:39:00">[11:39:00]</a>. In *Promethea*, Sophie achieves this "Apocalypse" by explaining Hermetic principles, leading everyone to perceive the immaterial and material worlds as equally "real" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:43:00">[11:43:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:48:00">[11:48:00]</a>.

Moore himself attempted to herald a similar "Apocalypse" in the real world through his magnum opus, *Jerusalem*, which he considered a "ten-year ritual working" intended to have a "beneficial effect upon the consciousness of its readership" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:55:00">[12:55:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:07:00">[13:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:11:00">[13:11:00]</a>. He designed the book to make readers experience higher states of consciousness as the narrative describes them, much like the Heptapod language in *Arrival* affects Lois Lane's perception of Time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:36:00">[13:36:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:41:00">[13:41:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:46:00">[13:46:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

For Alan Moore, magic is as real as our imagination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:25:00">[16:25:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:29:00">[16:29:00]</a>. The [[Role of Imagination and Storytelling in Perceiving Reality | human imagination]] is presented as the only thing we can truly be certain isn't imaginary, as it is the source of everything from clothes and houses to entire cities and our personalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:34:00">[16:34:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:39:00">[16:39:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:51:00">[16:51:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:01:00">[17:01:00]</a>. The world itself can be seen as a "marvelous game of pretend" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:06:00">[17:06:00]</a>.

*Avengers: Endgame* served as the culmination of 21 films over more than a decade, and its satisfying conclusion resonated with audiences due in part to the way its main characters' arcs were structured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. The film explored the character arcs of Marvel's trinity: Thor, Captain America, and Iron Man, each embodying different methods of dramatizing character growth and aligning with various philosophical ideas about the arc of human history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>. This approach allowed the Marvel movies to build emotionally resonant conclusions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>.

## Thor's Cyclical Journey

Thor's character arc throughout the films is fundamentally cyclical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:27">[02:39:27]</a>. He experiences a constant process of reaching the peak of his power or status, only to be brought low and forced to learn and relearn similar lessons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:41">[02:41:41]</a>.

### Repeated Lessons and Falls

*   **Initial *Thor* Film**: Thor begins on the verge of being crowned King of Asgard. His pride and combativeness, exemplified by invading Jotunheim, lead to his exile from Asgard and loss of worthiness to wield his hammer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. While exiled on Earth, he learns humility and becomes worthy again, returning to his initial status as Prince of Asgard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.
*   ***Thor: The Dark World***: He starts triumphant, having restored peace to the Nine Realms. However, he is quickly brought low when his girlfriend is infected, kidnapped by an evil elf, and both his mother and brother die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:39">[03:17:39]</a>. Despite this, he ends the film saving all nine realms once more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>. This film is noted as fitting most "messily" into his cyclical paradigm, which may explain why it is widely considered one of the worst Marvel movies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:05">[03:37:05]</a>.
*   ***Thor: Ragnarok***: The film opens with Thor seemingly on top, saving Asgard from Ragnarök by defeating Surtur. Within a day, he plummets to his lowest point: his father dies, his hammer is destroyed, and he is sold into slavery on Sakaar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:24">[03:43:24]</a>. Through this ordeal, he learns that "Asgard is not a place, but a people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>. His arc in this film concludes with him saving the people of Asgard from Ragnarök, even as the place itself is destroyed, and he is finally crowned king <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>.
*   ***Avengers: Infinity War*** and ***Endgame***: As King Thor, he is briefly on top, but *Infinity War* begins with Thanos overpowering him and killing half his people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:37">[04:15:37]</a>. He rises again upon acquiring Stormbreaker, but quickly falls when his victory over Thanos comes too late <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>. This leads to a self-imposed exile, where he becomes a slovenly mess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:52">[04:34:52]</a>. In *Endgame*, the lesson he learns is to accept himself for who he is—a hero and a warrior—rather than who he's supposed to be (a king) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>. This leads him to abdicate the throne after helping defeat Thanos, going off on new adventures and ending "right back on top" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>.

While there is some forward progression—Thor moves from coveting kingship to no longer desiring it—the process of his growth is largely circuitous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:07">[05:07:07]</a>. Thor himself acknowledges this pattern in *Ragnarok*, telling Loki, "Oh dear brother, becoming predictable... Round and round in circles we go. See Loki, life is about... it's about growth, it's about change" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:28">[05:17:28]</a>.

## Historical and Mythological Parallels

The cyclical nature of Thor's personal arc is mirrored in the repeating patterns of Asgardian history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>. Thor's succession to the throne involves recapitulating his father's act of losing an eye in exchange for wisdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:25">[05:37:25]</a>.

Given Thor's basis in Norse mythology, this cyclical storytelling structure is particularly fitting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>. Many ancient philosophies and religions, including the Stoics, Hindus, Maya, and Aztec, viewed history at a grand scale as cyclical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:01">[05:55:01]</a>. Norse mythology, as preserved in works like Snorri Sturluson's *Prose Edda* and *Poetic Edda*, also conceived of history in a similar way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>.

In the Eddas, the first humans, Ask and Embla, emerged from wood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:15:00">[06:15:00]</a>. The current cycle of history concludes with Ragnarök, after which a new cycle begins with the only two survivors, Líf and Lífþrasir <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22:00">[06:22:00]</a>. Similarly, Richard Wagner's Ring Cycle captures this cyclicality: it begins with the Rhinegold being stolen from the Rhine Maidens and, after much turmoil and Ragnarök, ends with the gold being reclaimed by the Rhine, returning to its starting point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:29:43">[06:29:43]</a>. Neil Gaiman's recent retelling of Norse mythology makes this even more explicit, with the six gods who survive Ragnarök finding a chess set depicting the old gods and beginning to play, causing the drama to unfold "exactly as before" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:81">[06:44:81]</a>. Just as the cosmological cycle in Norse mythology continually circles back, so too does Thor's character arc <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03:52">[07:03:52]</a>.

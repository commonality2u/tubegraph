*Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice* draws heavily from Frank Miller's graphic novel, *The Dark Knight Returns* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:07">[01:37:07]</a>. This inspiration extends beyond superficial elements to the very ideological underpinnings of the characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:02">[02:02:02]</a>.

## Direct Adaptations

Several key elements from *The Dark Knight Returns* are directly adapted into *Batman v. Superman* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>:
*   An older, broken Bruce Wayne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:06">[01:45:06]</a>.
*   Superman being hit by a nuclear warhead and then healed by the sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:04">[01:47:04]</a>.
*   Robin's memorialized costume found in Batman's lair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>.
*   The central fight between Batman and Superman, where Superman attempts to reason with Batman, who refuses to listen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:06">[01:54:06]</a>.

## Philosophical Inspiration: Ayn Rand's Objectivism

Beneath the narrative of both *The Dark Knight Returns* and *Batman v. Superman* lies an unlikely philosophical inspiration: Ayn Rand's *The Fountainhead* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:02">[02:02:02]</a>. Frank Miller cites Rand as a significant influence on his work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:02">[02:34:02]</a>.

### The Randian Hero and Batman

Both Miller and Zack Snyder are drawn to Rand's depiction of male heroes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:06">[02:48:06]</a>. In *The Fountainhead*, Howard Roark is presented as an "ideal man" who achieves his goals without compromising his integrity, even if it leads to conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:05">[02:53:05]</a>. This Randian hero is defined by "ethical egoism," the belief that the best course of action is always what is in one's best interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:07">[03:05:07]</a>. Achieving happiness, a central tenet of Rand's philosophy, Objectivism, is only possible through pursuing self-interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:02">[03:14:02]</a>.

Rand's "Ideal Man" is a radical individualist, unwilling to bend, smarter than others, and aesthetically pleasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:04">[03:22:04]</a>. This description perfectly fits Miller's Batman: a super-rich, handsome playboy with a genius intellect who refuses to bend to anyone's will but his own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:08">[03:30:08]</a>. Batman's adherence to Randian egoism enables the ideological conflict with Superman, representing individualism versus collectivism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>.

In *The Dark Knight Returns*, Batman faces constant obstruction from the U.S. Government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>. Superman, in Miller's work, is portrayed as the anti-Rand figure: a self-sacrificing, morally righteous character committed to "good," which labels him as a "Government Stooge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>. The drama of Miller's graphic novel largely stems from these differing ideologies: Batman's individualism versus Superman's conformism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>. Miller successfully instilled the spirit of Rand's theories to create a compelling internal conflict between the two titans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:00">[04:35:00]</a>.

## Adaptation in *Batman v. Superman*

### Batman's Portrayal
*Batman v. Superman* largely aligns with Miller's Randian take on Batman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>. Ben Affleck's Batman is handsome, almost supernaturally athletic, smarter than everyone else, and a complete individualist who refuses to bend his will to anyone, including the judicial process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>. He even brands criminals so they will be attacked in prison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>.

Batman's concern about the "God-like" Superman in the film can be interpreted as a nod to Rand's atheism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:00">[05:29:00]</a>. From a Randian perspective, any kind of God figure undermines ethical egoism, as it questions how one can make choices based on their own rationality when something objectively greater exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>.

### Superman's Muddled Philosophy
While the film accurately portrays the Randian Batman, its depiction of Superman becomes muddled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>. *Batman v. Superman* attempts to make Superman relatable by emphasizing his vulnerabilities, flaws, and doubts, much like *The Last Temptation of Christ* emphasized the human side of a messianic figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>. The film shows Superman's internal struggle between being a benevolent savior and focusing solely on what matters to him, namely Lois <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>.

However, this approach botches a fundamental aspect of a rivalry between Batman and Superman: having them embody different ideologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>. Instead of making Superman the collectivist "stooge" that Miller did, the film attempts to make him relatable, leading to a problematic ambiguity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>.

The Superman of *Batman v. Superman* appears burdened by his responsibilities, unlike Christopher Reeve's iconic portrayal, who saved people simply because it was the right thing to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:00">[06:10:00]</a>. The film constantly undercuts the perception of Superman as a purely benevolent, Christ-like hero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:34:00">[06:34:00]</a>.

Superman's crisis in the film manifests as two warring identities: the classic benevolent "Superman the God" and "Superman the Man," which for Snyder means a Randian Objectivist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>. This is exemplified when he flies to the Middle East to save Lois but leaves other innocents to die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03:00">[07:03:00]</a>.

The film's muddled message is further evident through the advice given by Martha Kent and the ghost of Jonathan Kent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>. Martha suggests that there's no difference between choosing to be a benevolent Messiah or a self-involved Objectivist, as long as it's Clark's rational choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:26:00">[07:26:00]</a>. Jonathan Kent's story about saving his farm from a flood, only for the water to flood another farm upstream, is used to dismantle the notion of selfless heroism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:40:00">[07:40:00]</a>. He implies that true moral righteousness comes from bettering oneself, pursuing self-interest, and protecting loved ones because they bring happiness—ethical egoism in a nutshell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:00">[08:22:00]</a>.

Ultimately, Superman doesn't make a clear choice between being a Messiah or a Randian hero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:37:00">[08:37:00]</a>. He sacrifices himself in a Messianic fashion while also stating his actions are for Lois, combining both ideologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:00">[09:05:00]</a>.

## Ideological Conflict: Muddled
The film's framing as an ideological conflict between Batman and Superman is undermined because no genuine ideological conflict exists due to Superman's ambiguous philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:27:00">[09:27:00]</a>. While the initial meeting hints at the differing beliefs—Bruce questioning Superman's role as a savior due to his distrust of superhumans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:44:00">[09:44:00]</a>, and Clark viewing Batman as a vigilante who needs to be checked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:00">[10:00:00]</a>—the film immediately upends this dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:14:00">[10:14:00]</a>. By using Objectivism to make Superman more relatable, the film ends up with almost no ideological difference between the two characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31:00">[10:31:00]</a>.

The film, which is based on source material showcasing a clear ideological divide, instead presents a "Randian Hero" (Batman) versus a "Maybe Sort-of Randian Hero who can't decide if he wants to be the divine savior the world wants him to be" (Superman) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:41:00">[10:41:00]</a>. In the end, *Batman v. Superman* presents no clear preference of heroics, instead pushing the message of "MORE HEROES" to form the Justice League <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:59:00">[10:59:00]</a>. This muddled philosophy results in a narrative that is ambitious but ultimately a mess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:24:00">[11:24:00]</a>.

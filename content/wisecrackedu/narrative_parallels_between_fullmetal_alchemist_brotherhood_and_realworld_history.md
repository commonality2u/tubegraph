## Amestris as a Reflection of Pre-World War II Germany
The country of Amestris in *Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood* is depicted as being reminiscent of pre-World War II Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>. This includes its portrayal as a militant nation expanding beyond its borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:45:00">[11:45:00]</a>. The Amestrian army features a blond-haired, blue-eyed force whose uniforms resemble those of the SS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:49:00">[11:49:00]</a>. The "Might is Right" motivation of Nazi Germany is also evident in Amestris, with General Raven invoking Social Darwinism to justify mass extermination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:58:00">[11:58:00]</a>.

The series' chief antagonist, "Father," controls the Amestrian state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:12:00">[10:12:00]</a>. His goal is to assume the mantle of God, a pursuit for which he has used alchemy, numerous military conflicts, and millions of innocent lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:14:00">[10:14:00]</a>. This portrayal showcases the [[impact_of_historical_events_on_villain_portrayal | impact of historical events on villain portrayal]].

### Führer King Bradley and Authoritarianism
The title "Führer" for King Bradley immediately raises eyebrows, drawing a clear [[comparison_to_historical_figures_like_stalin_and_hitler | comparison to historical figures like Stalin and Hitler]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:37:00">[11:37:00]</a>. Bradley, a homunculus, views his own wife as nothing more than an expendable pawn for his grand scheme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:32:00">[11:32:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:35:00">[11:35:00]</a>.

### Human Experimentation and Dr. Josef Mengele
Amestris' human experiments draw a chilling parallel to the operations of Auschwitz's lead doctor, Dr. Josef Mengele <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:10:00">[12:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:17:00">[12:17:00]</a>. The show depicts:
*   Raising babies in underground laboratories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:18:00">[12:18:00]</a>.
*   Stitching together people and animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:21:00">[12:21:00]</a>.
*   Ripping souls from bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:24:00">[12:24:00]</a>.

These acts mirror Mengele's wanton cruelty and morbid scientific curiosity, such as allegedly stitching two gypsy girls together and establishing a kindergarten for his younger experiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:26:00">[12:26:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:34:00">[12:34:00]</a>.

## The Ishbalan War of Extermination
Amestris' most brutal conflict, "The Ishbalan War of Extermination," was fought to further "Father's" plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:24:00">[10:24:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:28:00">[10:28:00]</a>. State Alchemists made their largest military impact in this war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33:00">[10:33:00]</a>. The devastating force of alchemy in Ishbal is compounded by the "scientific language" used to explain what is essentially genocide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:45:00">[10:45:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:51:00">[10:51:00]</a>. Even the "good guys" in the narrative couch these atrocities in sterile scientific terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:54:00">[10:54:00]</a>.

This sanitizing nature of scientific language escalated the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:06:00">[11:06:00]</a>. Führer King Bradley rejected a ceasefire offer from the high priest of Ishbala, stating that "The Law of Equivalent Exchange" wouldn't allow it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:12:00">[11:12:00]</a>.

## Philosophical Commentary on Science and State
Philosopher Paul Feyerabend, who fought as a Lieutenant in World War II and earned an Iron Cross, witnessed firsthand the scientific arguments made by a dictatorship for war and genocide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:46:00">[12:46:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:53:00">[12:53:00]</a>. This experience likely led him to propose a separation between science and state, with ultimate power resting in democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:58:00">[12:58:00]</a>.

Feyerabend's critique highlights how scientists often view themselves as objective observers, yet their funding frequently comes from corporations or the state, giving them little say over the application of their discoveries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:20:00">[08:20:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:32:00">[08:32:00]</a>. This reflects the military's control over alchemy in Amestris, where one of the three state-appointed tenets of Alchemy is to literally obey the military <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:52:00">[07:52:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:59:00">[07:59:00]</a>. State Alchemists are even referred to as "dogs of the military" or "human weapons" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a>.

The series explores the [[science_vs_faith_in_fullmetal_alchemist_brotherhood | conflict between science and faith]] through this lens, presenting a cautionary tale about blind adherence to any single ideology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:00:00">[15:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:26:00">[15:26:00]</a>. It suggests that unquestioning acceptance, whether of science or faith, can lead to disastrous results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>.

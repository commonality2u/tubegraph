William Shakespeare's *Macbeth* explores the complex interplay between [[determinism_and_free_will | fate]] and human agency, prompting questions about individual responsibility for one's destiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. The play is presented as a classical tragedy of a "once righteous brutha who balls till he falls" due to unchecked ambition and lust for power, making him his own antagonist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>.

## Prophecy and Predetermination

The narrative introduces the concept of [[determinism_and_free_will | fate]] through the prophecies of three witches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. They foretell that Macbeth will become king <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a> and that Banquo's descendants will also reign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. Later, the witches provide Macbeth with further predictions:
*   An armored head warns him to beware Macduff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>.
*   A bloody child states that no one born of a woman can harm him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>.
*   A crowned child holding a tree predicts his safety until Great Birnam trees reach the castle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>.

These prophecies fuel Macbeth's ambition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a> and are presented as a force "slingin him around like a puppet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>.

## Influence of External Factors

While the witches' prophecies set the stage, other external factors contribute to Macbeth's downfall:
*   **Lady Macbeth's Influence**
    Lady Macbeth actively encourages her husband's ambition, pushing him to murder King Duncan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. She convinces him to "shank King Duncan" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a> and later frames the chamberlains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. Her influence is significant enough that she is seen as partially responsible for his "boot-leg fate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.
*   **Societal Pressures**
    Scottish society itself is implicated, with a prevailing sentiment that one must seize power by any means necessary, including murder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>. Macbeth's initial acts of violence, such as "butcherin his enemies," were initially praised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>.

## Macbeth's Agency and Choice

Despite the external pressures and prophecies, Macbeth makes conscious choices that lead to his tragic end:
*   He chooses to murder King Duncan, encouraged by Lady Macbeth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
*   He murders the chamberlains to prevent them from "dodg[ing] the heat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>.
*   He orders the assassination of Banquo and Fleance to secure his lineage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>.
*   He "gets ice cold and kills his whole family" after hearing Macduff fled to England <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>.
*   He engages in a final battle with Macduff, despite the warnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>.

These actions suggest that Macbeth is not merely a puppet of [[determinism_and_free_will | fate]] but also an active participant in his downfall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>.

## The Question of Blame and Meaninglessness

The play directly raises the question of who is truly to blame for Macbeth's "boot-leg fate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. While some argue Macbeth is solely responsible for his actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>, others contend that he is "ain’t to blame at all" due to [[determinism_and_free_will | fate]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>.

This tension culminates in Macbeth's reflection on life after his wife's death, implying a lack of choice and a sense of meaninglessness:
> "To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow,  
> Creeps in this petty pace from day to day,  
> To the last syllable of recorded time;  
> And all our yesterdays have lighted fools  
> The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!  
> Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player  
> That struts and frets his hour upon the stage  
> And then is heard no more. It is a tale  
> Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,  
> Signifying nothing." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>

If Macbeth "ain’t got no choice, then all this sh*t is straight meaningless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>. The play suggests that the combined pressures of [[determinism_and_free_will | fate]], society, and Macbeth's own ambition create a burden "more pressure on him than he can handle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>.

## Symbolism of Ill-fitting Clothes

Shakespeare employs the imagery of "clothes that don’t fit good" to symbolize Macbeth's struggles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>. This imagery suggests that he is "livin way outta his depth" due to the immense pressures and responsibilities associated with the kingship he sought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>. This reinforces the idea that he is not suited for the role, implying either a misjudgment of his own free will or the inescapable nature of his predetermined trajectory.

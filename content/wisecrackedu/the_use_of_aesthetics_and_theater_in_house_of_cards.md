*House of Cards* delves into the dark and scandalous world of politics, chronicling Frank and Claire Underwood’s ruthless quest for power and the presidency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Unlike many American political dramas that offer morally righteous characters and redemption, *House of Cards* rejects this narrative, instead presenting a process where raw power and cunning consistently prevail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. The show challenges the audience by asking if there is more to politics than pure [[politics_as_spectacle_in_house_of_cards | spectacle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. This question is explored through the series' pervasive use of aesthetics and theatrical elements, suggesting that [[the_role_of_appearance_and_reality_in_house_of_cards | appearance constitutes reality]] in the political sphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

## Aesthetics, Theater, and Politics

In the cynical world of *House of Cards*, characters meticulously maintain their public and private images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. The show's creators demonstrate an obsession with aesthetics, often featuring important dealings conducted while characters reflect on art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Claire's appearance, for example, is carefully manicured, with her wardrobe being a frequent subject of dialogue and real-life fashion discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. However, the show implies that once these "pretty aesthetics and art references" are peeled away, there is "nothing" behind the world of *House of Cards* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

This preoccupation with aesthetics is deeply intertwined with the show's frequent tributes to theater, particularly William Shakespeare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. Frank Underwood often employs soliloquies and asides, a theatrical device heavily used by Shakespeare, to explicate his inner thoughts directly to the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. The show's plot and characters are reminiscent of Shakespearean tragedies like *Macbeth* and *Richard III*, which serve as inspiration for Frank's charming, yet terrible, asides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. Even the character Petrov quotes Gorbachev, who in turn quotes Richard III's famous opening line, "end to our winter of discontent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

Theater, aesthetics, and art collectively highlight the fundamental concept that [[the_role_of_appearance_and_reality_in_house_of_cards | appearance drives politics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. The show suggests that politics is essentially theater, or its own form of performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. An example of this is Frank's visit to his father, which he undertakes specifically to "seem more human" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. Frank's direct address to the viewer, breaking the fourth wall, serves to blur the distinction between the show itself, reality, and the inherent theatricality of politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

### Politics as Performance

*House of Cards* depicts politics as a realm of staged performances and manipulated narratives. Contemporary commentators lament that politics has devolved into entertainment, where catchphrases and slogans supplant genuine political argument <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. This is mirrored in the show:
*   Frank destroys Michael Kern’s career over an op-ed Kern didn’t write, as Kern struggles to keep pace with media sensationalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
*   A brick through Frank’s window, fabricated by Frank himself, becomes a symbol against "out of control teachers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

German philosopher Hannah Arendt's view, as presented in the show, posits that the realm of appearances *is* the realm of politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. For Arendt, stripping away appearances to find a "core" is pointless because appearance and reality are the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. This concept originates from the ancient Greek Polis, where political life was judged solely by how one appeared to others—like an actor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. Frank Underwood explicitly understands this, stating, "We are nothing more or less than what we choose to reveal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

The show challenges the long-held idea, dating back to Plato’s allegory of the cave, that appearances are deceptive and conceal a "true" reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. Frank and Arendt undermine this tradition by asserting that appearance *is* reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. This perspective explains why audiences struggle to hate Frank Underwood: he embodies no stable identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. He is multifaceted: a sometimes good husband, a manipulative murderer, a kind boss, a supportive friend, a job creator, and a liar to many <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

### Hypocrisy and Authenticity

The concept of hypocrisy is central to the show's exploration of [[the_role_of_appearance_and_reality_in_house_of_cards | appearance and reality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. Frank is the "epitome of a hypocrite," someone who acts inconsistently with stated beliefs and puts on "false appearances" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. The term "hypocrite" itself originates from the Ancient Greek word for "playacting," further linking politics to theater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. Frank declares, "The road to power is paved with hypocrisy..." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.

However, the show, through Arendt's philosophy, argues that the historical "hunt for hypocrites" has often led to negative outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. The search for "true motives" in politics is deemed impossible due to its inherent aesthetic nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. Arendt suggests that demanding inner motivations transforms all actors into hypocrites, poisoning human relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. For Arendt, the solution lies in recognizing our inability to distinguish between "being and appearance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.

While Frank embodies this fluid identity, Claire’s portrayal suggests a yearning for something authentic beneath her political mask <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. Her immediate turn to applying makeup after Zoe Barnes' death suggests that aesthetics suppress her true feelings of disgust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. Claire seeks authenticity in art forms like photography and origami, and is drawn to the genuine bohemian lifestyle of a photographer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.

The show uses the intermingling of art, theater, and aesthetics to challenge traditional notions of how reality operates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. It suggests that appearances and reality are not easily disentangled, even if the perpetual lying of politicians is not inherently good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

## Conclusion

*House of Cards* is a show rich with incredible layers, particularly in its exploration of [[the_role_of_appearance_and_reality_in_house_of_cards | the politics of appearance]] through art and theater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>. It ultimately prompts viewers to consider whether this emphasis on performance and manipulation is a negative development in politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>.

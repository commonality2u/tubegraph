At first glance, *The Purge* may appear to be a typical horror film with a decent concept, questionable acting, and violent carnage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. However, beyond the creepy masks and violence, the film highlights the dehumanizing policies of our current social landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. With a closer look, *The Purge* can be considered a commentary on our sociopolitical existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>, serving as a thinly veiled allegory for America's corrupt politics, rigged economic systems, and culture of violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Neoliberalism and the Politics of Disposability

The societal order depicted in *The Purge* is best described as [[neoliberalism_and_economic_critique_in_the_purge | Neoliberalism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. The basic idea of [[neoliberalism_and_economic_critique_in_the_purge | neoliberalism]] is that the government should create policies that promote the free flow of goods and protect corporate interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Each *Purge* movie reflects a different facet of the [[neoliberalism_and_economic_critique_in_the_purge | neoliberal]] economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>, bringing into focus the conditions of characters' respective economic classes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

This economic system breeds a [[dehumanization_and_disposability_as_presented_in_the_purge | politics of disposability]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. Thinkers Henry Giroux and Brad Evans explain that people become disposable under an economic system characterized by the privatization of healthcare, deregulation of banks, and erosion of government safety nets like social security and welfare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

## Economic Class Impacts Across the Films

The films illustrate how different economic classes experience The Purge:

*   **The Original Purge** (2013) is about the impact of the event on an upper-middle-class suburban family, the Sandins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Their "burb" problems include a homeless guy infiltrating their gated community, jealous neighbors trying to kill them, and a daughter involved with an older man who tries to kill her father <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. For the Sandins, the idea of dealing with violence against the poor is unacceptable because "Things like this are not suppose to happen in our neighborhood" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
*   **The Purge: Anarchy** (2014) focuses on the economic problems of a working-class family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. Eva Sanchez struggles to make ends meet, cannot afford medicine for her father, and desperately needs a raise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. The inner city is depicted as full of Purge traps, gangs, and abductions for a "Running Man" style event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. The comparison between the settings of the first two films can be understood as a metaphor for "white flight" â€“ the retreat of upper-class white folks from cities to sheltered, poverty-free suburbs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. This abandonment exposes those left in the inner city to disproportionate amounts of crime, homelessness, and poverty, or in the case of the films, Purging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   **The Purge: Election Year** (2016) addresses the consequences of the holiday on small business owners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. Joe finds his Purge insurance premiums inexplicably going up, a common occurrence when there are no government checks to stop insurance companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. Unable to afford the increased rates, Joe must protect his deli himself with little more than a shoddy rolling steel door, eventually losing his life because of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

These examples illustrate the injustices not only of The Purge but of our economic system in general <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

## Who Benefits and Who Suffers?

People who prosper under [[neoliberalism_and_economic_critique_in_the_purge | neoliberalism]] benefit from The Purge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>, while those who are negatively impacted by [[neoliberalism_and_economic_critique_in_the_purge | neoliberalism]] are also negatively impacted by The Purge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. The upper-middle class largely profits from "murder night" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. For instance, the Sandins' home remodel is paid for by the security home systems James sold, based on the fear manifested by The Purge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

In contrast, the working class does not fare as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. Since Eva Sanchez's boss won't give her a raise, her family can only protect themselves with flimsy two-by-fours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

### The [[dehumanization_and_disposability_as_presented_in_the_purge | Politics of Disposability]] in Practice

In the original *Purge*, suburbanites view entire groups of people as superfluous and disposable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. The bloody stranger is referred to as "swine" and "filth," justifying his incapacitation and torture as a means to save James Sandin's family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. It is only when the stranger volunteers to sacrifice himself that James finally sees him as fully human <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

In *The Purge: Anarchy*, the unchecked price of medication forces Papa Sanchez to "sell" his life to the rich so his family can be eased of economic hardship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. As a disposable object, his life is deemed more valuable to his family than his existence as an actual person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. As Eva explains, "It's how the wealthy Purge, baby. They buy poor and sick people and they take them in their homes and they kill them where they're safe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. This concept is mirrored in *Rick and Morty*, where Rick comments that people subject the poor to inhuman conditions because there's no chance of it hurting them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

The New Founding Fathers of America (NFFA), who sanction The Purge, have legalized murder for twenty years to decrease the poor population, which in turn keeps government spending down on welfare, healthcare, and housing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. The elderly, infirm, poor, and "non-contributors" are sacrificed for economic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. This elimination of the population is paralleled in the real [[neoliberalism_and_economic_critique_in_the_purge | neoliberal]] economy, where certain populations are exposed to a "slow death" through inability to afford medicine, poor diet, or exposure to environmental hazards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

## Historical Justifications for Population Control

The justification for The Purge traces back to Reverend Thomas Robert Malthus's 1798 book, *Essay on the Principle of Population* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. Malthus argued that a growing population would create massive food shortages because production could not keep up with demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. His solution was to employ laws that keep birth rates low and death rates high through famine, disease, and wars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. Caleb Warrens, head of the NFFA in *The Purge: Election Year*, echoes this Malthusian logic: "Idealistic pigs! They want the impossible. Everyone to HAVE. SOME cannot have. NOT enough to go around" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

However, Friedrich Engels critiqued Malthus, arguing that the issue isn't increasing population but an economic system that doesn't value workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. Engels believed Malthus's model was merely an excuse to be cruel to poor people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. With their elaborate Purge ceremonies, the NFFA clearly takes "being a dick to poor people" to the next level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.

## Conclusion

The genius of *The Purge* lies in its visceral exposure of how the [[neoliberalism_and_economic_critique_in_the_purge | neoliberal]] economy generates profit in a predatory manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. The privileged profit immensely from weapon sales, insurance, private bodyguards, and home security systems, while the poor must fight simply to survive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. The Purge movies present an opportunity to peek into a not-so-distant dystopia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.

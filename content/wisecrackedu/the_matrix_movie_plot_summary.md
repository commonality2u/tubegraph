His life changes when he is approached by individuals who begin to tell him what to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. After hearing arguments from both sides, Neo chooses to swallow a pill given to him by a man he has known for only a short time, opting for the group with "cooler sunglasses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

It is revealed that Neo's entire reality is a simulation, and the actual future depicts a "grimy sewer" where people wear rags and are constantly attacked by "robot jellyfish" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## [[Literary allusions in The Matrix | Literary and Philosophical Allusions]]

[[Literary allusions in The Matrix | The Matrix]] incorporates various literary allusions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. Neo's room number, 101, is reminiscent of Room 101 from George Orwell’s *1984*, a torture chamber where prisoners are brainwashed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. Neo conceals illegal programs within a copy of *Simulacra and Simulation* by Jean Baudrillard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. This postmodern book discusses the decay of reality and its replacement with simulated images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. Morpheus quotes this text when he welcomes Neo to the "Desert of the Real" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

The film frequently uses mirrors, including Morpheus's sunglasses, to indicate themes of reflection, perspective, truth, and illusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. The Oracle instructs Neo to "know thyself," acting as a mirror for his self-reflection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

Philosophically, the film draws inspiration from Plato's "Allegory of the Cave," where prisoners mistake shadows for reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. Similarly, when Neo learns the truth about his world, his eyes hurt and he becomes ill, akin to the prisoner overwhelmed by the sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

[[nicolas_cages_unique_acting_style | Nicolas Cage]]'s acting career is one of the most debated among leading Hollywood stars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. While some, like Ethan Hawke, call him the only actor to evolve the craft since Marlon Brando, and David Lynch dubbed him the "jazz musician of acting," others find his performances bewildering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. His unique approach to acting is a result of various influences and a deliberate rejection of conventional norms.

## Rejection of Method Acting
Cage, the nephew of director Francis Ford Coppola, is known for his extensive filmography, with over 73 films <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. He initially embraced method acting, even having two teeth removed for his role as an injured veteran in 1984's *Birdy* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. This technique, stemming from Constantine Stanislavsky's ideas about realism, attempts to help actors channel "emotional truth" from within and is a significant part of the [[role_of_method_acting_in_cinema | role of method acting in cinema]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

However, Cage quickly grew tired of the method acting style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

## Search for a New Style
Cage embarked on a quest for a form of acting that went "beyond" traditional methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. In 1990, he expressed his desire to reintroduce a "more surreal or experimental style" into acting, moving away from "literalism," which he perceived as a "dead end" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

### *Vampire's Kiss* as a Laboratory
The 1988 film *Vampire's Kiss* became a "laboratory" for these new ideas, providing a low-stakes indie setting for his experiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. In this film, Cage's performance, which included unusual speaking patterns, running, and eating a live cockroach, led to widespread memes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. This film marked the beginning of the "Nic Cage weâ€™ve come to know and meme," characterized by bold, daring choices that utilize his physicality, including "patently goofy facial expressions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. His unapologetically performative quality can be confusing in naturalistic films but works well in movies that push the limits of reality, such as *Moonstruck*, *Mandy*, and David Lynch's *Wild At Heart* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.

## Specific Influences and Techniques

### Kabuki
Cage takes inspiration from Kabuki, a Japanese avant-garde performance art that combines acting, dancing, and singing with extreme stylization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. This influence explains his tendency to ad-lib made-up lyrics, as seen in *Leaving Las Vegas* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. Lindsay Gibb argues that Cage's "Western Kabuki" style, with its appreciation for the hyper-performative, leads him to adopt a different voice for every character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. Cage himself describes his vocal experimentation as an attempt to use his voice in a "heavy metal or operatic or baroque way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.

### German Expressionism
Cage also draws inspiration from German Expressionism, widely considered the first true film movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>. This genre explored the horrors of post-World War I Germany through highly-emotional, subjective storytelling, with dream-like horror films depicting nightmarish worlds and twisted villains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>. Cage watched classic German Expressionist films like *Nosferatu* and *Metropolis* as a child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. He has described how specific hand motions, such as a famous gesture in *Moonstruck*, were inspired by these films <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>, and has modeled characters' physical attributes after figures from this style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.

### Nouveau Shamanism
For his role as Johnny Blaze in *Ghost Rider*, Cage adopted what he termed "nouveau shamanism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. This involved integrating "Afro-Caribbean techniques" and sewing "thousand-year-old Egyptian artifacts into his clothing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. He also prepared by "painting his face white and black like a voodoo priest" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. These techniques were intended to trick him into believing he was a character from another dimension with special powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>.

### Physicality and Detailed Planning
Cage's "insane attention to the details of body movement" is evident in his portrayal of twin brothers in *Adaptation*, where he created distinct movements for each character by adjusting his spine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>. Many of his famously ridiculous moments are meticulously planned, "move by move by move," including the alphabet recitation scene in *Vampire's Kiss*, where every hand clap, hip thrust, pout, and holler was carefully thought out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.

## Underlying Philosophy: Defiance of Realism
Cage's approach to acting defies the conventional emphasis on realism that has dominated Hollywood, which is a key part of [[the_debate_over_realism_in_film_acting | the debate over realism in film acting]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. Cinema scholar Carole Zucker argues that the expectation for film acting to adhere to "gestural and psychological verisimilitude" presents a "limited vision of performance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. Cage, by deliberately refusing to conform to realism, challenges why it remains the primary benchmark for good acting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>.

His performances, which are often perceived as weird because they fall outside this narrow view, force audiences to reconsider their expectations, especially since film, with its close-ups, is an intimate art form where viewers typically expect performers to behave realistically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. However, Cage "specifically refuses to do just that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>. He continuously takes on roles and genres, pulling from diverse and often radical influences, not necessarily to improve his reputation, but to push boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.

*One Punch Man* stands out among anime due to its unusual lack of drama and conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. The show is unique because, after only one or two episodes, viewers know how most will conclude: with a powerful punch and a yawn from the titular hero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. While the series offers a humorous take on anime, it also subtly comments on humanity's civilizational trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. This unique structure allows it to explore the importance of conflict for both fictional narratives and human experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

## Saitama's Invincibility and Boredom

The protagonist, Saitama, began his hero work with enthusiasm after being a disillusioned job-seeker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. However, three years later, the thrill is gone because he has become so overwhelmingly powerful that he can defeat any adversary with a single blow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. Saitama, who claims to be a "hero for fun," doesn't seem to enjoy it much due to the absence of challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. This scenario is likened to playing *Mortal Kombat* against someone who offers no challenge, making it unenjoyable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

While boredom is a prevalent theme, the show primarily focuses on the concept of conflict itself, imagining a world without it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. This highlights conflict's crucial role in human experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

## The Role of Conflict in Storytelling

The [[one_punch_man_as_a_parodic_work | abnormal story structure]] of *One Punch Man* is central to its message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. Traditional narratives, from horror to action, are driven by conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. Screenwriting expert Robert McKee notes in his book *Story* that "the music of story is conflict," which propels the narrative forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. Without conflict, characters lack motivation and purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

Conventional tales feature overarching problems that give characters purpose, forcing them to change and grow as they overcome obstacles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. The original *Star Wars* trilogy serves as an example, where Luke Skywalker faces constant challenges that lead to his development as a character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

## Saitama's Lack of Development

Unlike Luke Skywalker, Saitama experiences no such development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. He decimates any conflict with a single punch, and because he knows he cannot lose, he doesn't even benefit from the fear of defeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. Without adversity, he has nothing to strive for, remaining largely the same throughout the series, apart from a brief flashback to his origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. Even his training regimen, which typically depicts character growth, is an unchanging routine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

This [[character_study_of_saitama_and_his_motivations | character study of Saitama and his motivations]] shows that his immense power forecloses opportunities for change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. His powers are mundane, acquired through simple exercise, which offers no secret to reveal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. His motivations are also mundane; he's "just doing all this for fun!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. This ease in achieving superhero status undermines the struggles of supporting characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

## Focus on Supporting Characters and the Deus Ex Machina

Since Saitama is immune to conflict, many episodes shift focus away from him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. He is often absent during major battles or relegated to a passive observer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. Instead, the show establishes the backstories of supporting characters and places them in challenging situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.

Genos, for instance, has a classic character arc as a wandering warrior seeking power and revenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. Even villains like Dr. Genus have developed motivations, stemming from their struggles or dismissals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. However, all these struggles are invariably undercut by Saitama's single, lackluster punch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

Saitama functions as a "human deus ex machina" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. A deus ex machina is a plot device where an external element resolves a seemingly unsolvable problem, as seen in *War of the Worlds* where aliens are defeated by Earth's bacteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. In *One Punch Man*, when situations are most dire, Saitama consistently appears to save the day with his unbeatable punch, rendering others' struggles irrelevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. This [[critique_of_superhero_tropes | critiques superhero tropes]] by removing the stakes.

For example, when Vaccine Man's rage peaks, Saitama floors him with one punch, evaporating all dramatic tension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. Similarly, in Episode 2, Genos's character is developed as he fights Mosquito Girl, showing perseverance and a desire to minimize collateral damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. Just as Genos prepares a self-destructive, climactic act, Saitama arrives and effortlessly destroys the villain, making Genos's struggle pointless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

## The Anti-Catharsis Effect

When conflict fizzles out prematurely, the audience is deprived of "catharsis," the emotional release of repressed emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. Viewers emotionally connect with narratives, celebrating victories and commiserating with defeats, building up to an emotional payoff at the climax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. Philosopher Richard Kearney explains that stories allow us to "repeat the past forward," revisiting our own experiences through characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. We feel sympathy for Genos's loss or encouragement for the Mumen Rider because we relate to their predicaments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.

*One Punch Man* is the "anti-catharsis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. Despite appearing similar to Japanese kaiju movies, Saitama's minimal-effort victories prevent any dramatic tension or emotional investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. The show deliberately plays the role of "emotional spoiler," priming the audience for a big release only to deny it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. For example, Mumen Rider's earnest struggle against a powerful foe should be a moment of triumph, but Saitama's intervention renders it anticlimactic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

## Philosophical Commentary on Modern Life

Beyond humor, the show highlights what is missing in a life devoid of conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. Japanese theorist Masahiro Morioka notes that civilization's drive to minimize pain and discomfort has inadvertently "drained value from our lives" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. While reducing pain seems beneficial, Morioka suggests it causes us to "lose the opportunity of experiencing the joy of life that comes from encountering an unwanted situation and being forced to transform ourselves to find a new way of thinking and being" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.

*One Punch Man* illustrates Morioka's philosophy through Saitama <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>. Saitama's first battle against Crablante had meaning because he had to struggle to win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. This contrasts sharply with his present-day consideration of pre-packaged crab, symbolizing how modern life has removed hardship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. Saitama's frustration stems from his inability to change and progress through failure and pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. Without meaningful hardship, his life lacks purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>.

This idea is reinforced when Saitama reacts to the Paradisers' manifesto, which advocates for success without effort ("food, clothing, and shelter... free of charge for those who do not work") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. Saitama finds this vision of "paradise" boring, reflecting his own experience of being "too strong" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>. Morioka concurs, stating that a society free of pain might lead people to "los[e] sight of joy, and forget[ting] the meaning of life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.

Even when Saitama finally seems to meet a genuine challenger in the Season 1 finale, it's revealed he was holding back, ultimately rendering the conflict meaningless with his "Serious punch" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>.

## Conclusion

Through Saitama's "dead fish stare," *One Punch Man* delivers a warning: over-comfort can drain life of its value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>. The show suggests that embracing failures, pain, and suffering is essential, as without them, life loses its meaning and purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.

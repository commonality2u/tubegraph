The film *[[critique_of_societal_systems_in_the_purge | The Purge]]* presents a fictional scenario where all crime becomes legal for 12 hours annually, an event described as "Halloween for adults" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. This concept is not entirely unique, drawing parallels to real-world ritualistic festivals such as Mardi Gras, Carnival, and even Halloween <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

## Violation of Social Norms

At their core, these events, including [[critique_of_societal_systems_in_the_purge | The Purge]], are designated times when people are permitted to violate social norms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. While [[critique_of_societal_systems_in_the_purge | The Purge]] focuses on murder and theft, unlike the dancing and feasting associated with Carnival before Lent, the underlying concept remains the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

## Reaffirming Social Structures

It might appear that these events are designed to undermine the power of law and religion over people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. However, the opposite is true: they actually serve to reaffirm these social structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

In the context of [[critique_of_societal_systems_in_the_purge | The Purge]], the ruling leaders, known as the "NFFA," are not challenged by the ritual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. Instead, the chaos of the night makes people long for the return of law the next day, likened to a "Purge hangover" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

Just as a ritual like Carnival exists to make people accept the tenets of Christianity, [[critique_of_societal_systems_in_the_purge | The Purge]] serves to make people accept the tenets of the ruling social ideology, which is described as Neoliberalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. The series effectively uses "murder night" to expose how this economic system generates profit in a predatory manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

*The Last Jedi* generated significant fan controversy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Common criticisms include Luke Skywalker's portrayal, Snoke's quick demise, Holdo's plan, the Canto Bight sequence, Rey's parents being "red herrings," and the film's "Marvel humor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Beyond surface-level complaints, the film aimed to revolutionize Star Wars but ultimately fell short <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## An Attempt at Revolution: "Killing the Past"

The relationship between Kylo Ren and Darth Vader can be interpreted as a meta-commentary on the new Star Wars films' relationship with the original trilogy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. *The Force Awakens*, like Kylo Ren, was burdened by the pressure of living up to the original trilogy's legacy, mimicking *A New Hope* beat for beat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

However, in *The Last Jedi*, Snoke tells Kylo Ren to remove his mask, stating he is "no Vader," and Ren subsequently breaks it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. This, coupled with Luke throwing his lightsaber away, signals [[rian_johnsons_attempt_to_revolutionize_the_star_wars_franchise | Rian Johnson's attempt to revolutionize the Star Wars franchise]] by telegraphing that the film would not be a rehash but a radical subversion of the Star Wars formula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. The implied message is that for new Star Wars to thrive, the old Star Wars must die, echoing Kylo Ren's sentiment to "let the past die" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. [[rian_johnsons_approach_to_star_wars_canon | Johnson]] sought not to recycle but to progress the franchise and its galaxy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

## Subverting Star Wars Tropes

To achieve this progress, [[critique_of_the_last_jedis_approach_to_star_wars_tropes | Johnson abrasively undermined the tropes and traditions]] that defined previous Star Wars films <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>:
*   **Rey's Parents** Unlike Luke Skywalker, who was of "noble blood," Rey's parents are revealed to be "degenerate winos" and "filthy junk traders" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.
*   **Hero Archetypes** Heroes are depicted as janitors and mechanics, not politicians or princesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
*   **Luke Skywalker** He is no longer the idealistic hero but a "failed nephew murder/slovenian philosopher" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.
*   **The Jedi Order** Yoda transforms from a symbol of Jedi piety to a "would-be book burner," and the Jedi Order is presented as having failed due to "hypocrisy" and "hubris," allowing the rise of Darth Sidious and the Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

[[critique_of_the_last_jedis_approach_to_star_wars_tropes | The film criticizes the prior events]] for not leading to true progress, as a "nearly identical Nazi-inspired fascistic order has risen" after the Empire's collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

## Reimagining Good and Evil

[[morality_and_archetypes_in_the_last_jedi | Johnson suggests that the cyclical re-emergence of evil]] stems from an inadequate conception of good and evil, challenging the "stark divisions" that formed the core of Star Wars mythology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

*   **Joseph Campbell's Monomyth and Carl Jung's Archetypes** George Lucas based the original trilogy on Joseph Campbell's "The Hero with a Thousand Faces," which outlines a universal story structure called "the monomyth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. Campbell's work, in turn, is based on Carl Jung's concepts of the "collective unconscious" and "archetypes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.
*   **The Shadow Archetype** *The Last Jedi* attempts to redefine the relationship to the "shadow" archetypeâ€”the repressed, primal "dark side" of the unconscious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. In the monomyth, the shadow is embodied by a character representing the protagonist's fears, like Gollum for Frodo, or Darth Vader for Luke Skywalker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. Luke confronting Vader was an emotional and psychological battle, with sparing his life signifying the conquering of inner demons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. However, *The Last Jedi* proposes a different approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

*   **Balance in the Force** While earlier films suggested balance in the Force is desirable, *The Last Jedi* implies the Force inherently promotes balance: "When the darkness rises, the force amplifies the light to balance it out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. This suggests that a powerful Jedi Order might be met by an equally powerful dark side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. Luke's criticism of the Jedi Order hints that they are partly to blame for the cyclical rise and fall of "fascist empires" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. The film posits that the dark side is not something to be conquered, as this would cause the Force to "overcorrect" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.

*   **Jungian Interpretation of Repression** Jungian analyst Robert A. Johnson (not Rian Johnson) suggests that repressing our "dark sides" leads to "accumulate[d] darkness" and an "ego split" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. Suppressing darkness forces projection onto scapegoats, leading to endless conflict, as seen in the original Star Wars with Luke's inner demons projected onto Darth Vader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. [[morality_and_archetypes_in_the_last_jedi | Rian Johnson sought to complicate the classic good/bad distinction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

*   **Moral Ambiguity and the Military Economy** The character DJ represents the film's most morally ambiguous moment, challenging the "purely good Rebels" versus "purely evil oppressors" distinction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. He reveals that arms dealers sell to both "bad guys" and "good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. The film critiques the galaxy's military economy, including the exploitation and animal rights violations associated with it, even involving heroes like Princess Leia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>.

## The "Backpedal"

Despite its efforts to "kill the past" and the film's moral lens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>, *The Last Jedi* ultimately backpedals on its revolutionary ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. Rey rejects Kylo Ren's offer to end the "dogmatism of the previous films" by joining him to "let it all die" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.

Many of the subverted elements are reaffirmed:
*   **Heroic Archetypes** The "legend of Luke Skywalker" lives on, inspiring the galaxy, even if it's based on a lie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>.
*   **The Jedi Order** Despite Luke's earlier declaration that "it's time for the Jedi to die," Rey asserts, "I will not be the last Jedi" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.
*   **Narrative Structure** The film reverts to the established narrative structure, echoing lines like "Strike me down in anger, and I'll always be with you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.
*   **Jedi Past** The Jedi books are saved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.

This ideological shift occurs without compelling plot-driven reasons, with Luke's change attributed vaguely to his love for his sister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>. The film makes a "psychologically sophisticated case" for Rey to team up with Ren, given that the "old way doesn't work" and the galaxy is stuck in a cycle of conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. Ren, understanding his good and bad sides and the "folly of the false division," is arguably closer to Jungian balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. He offers Rey the reconciliation of ego and shadow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>. However, Rey ultimately represents the "old moral code of Star Wars," choosing to be a "morally-pure, infallible hero" who suppresses her darkness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>.

In conclusion, *The Last Jedi*'s attempt to revolutionize Star Wars by abrasively subverting its core elements, only to revert to the status quo, is seen as "less cool" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.

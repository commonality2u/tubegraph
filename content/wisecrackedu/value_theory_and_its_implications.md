The animated series *South Park*, created by Matt Stone and Trey Parker, frequently lampoons the financial world and explores various concepts of value [00:00:38]. Despite being an ad-supported business, *South Park* is unafraid to critique the systems that sustain it [00:00:31]. Through several episodes, the show delves into different aspects of value theory, challenging conventional understandings of worth in economics, social dynamics, and personal relationships.

## Challenging Biases: Perceived Value in "Gnomes"

In the episode "Gnomes," *South Park* sets up a classic "David-and-Goliath" scenario between the corporate coffee chain Harbucks and the local, mom-and-pop shop, Tweek Brothers [00:00:51]. The show challenges the natural bias towards "the little guy" by revealing that the small business owner, Mr. Tweek, can be "a total asshole" [00:01:12]. Mr. Tweek is shown exploiting his own son and children for media sympathy to keep his business afloat [00:01:20].

The idea that a small business could be driven by "impure capitalist motive" is an unconventional message [00:01:37]. The townspeople of South Park initially stereotype the rivalry as an "innocent family business versus" a large corporation, shouting down arguments in favor of big business with immature responses rather than reason [00:01:43]. This illustrates how [[Exploration of Human Beliefs and Perception | bald-faced appeals to emotion]] can "disguise the cold, hard mechanisms of profit" [00:02:10]. Mr. Tweek, despite his folksy marketing, proves to be a more "cutthroat capitalist" than his rival [00:02:23]. The children protagonists become pawns, forced to voice his anti-corporate sentiments [00:02:38].

The people of South Park demonstrate a "programmatic response" where "small business good. Big corporation bad," without truly understanding Mr. Tweek's practices or the quality of Harbucks' coffee [00:03:07]. This is attributed to the backfire effect, where new, contrary information is dismissed if it threatens a basic belief structure [00:03:29]. "Gnomes" thus lampoons hardwired biases, demonstrating that small businesses, like small children, can be as "scummy" as their larger counterparts, just less prolific [00:03:46]. Ultimately, both small and large businesses are "geared towards making a profit," even if the path to that objective is ambiguous [00:03:58].

## Exploring Forms of Value in "Cash for Gold"

The episode "Cash for Gold" satirizes the exploitation of the elderly for profit, particularly through the Home Shopping Network [00:04:20]. Stan's grandpa falls victim to television scams draining his retirement, while Cartman's opportunism leads him to exploit the same scams [00:04:35]. Through these angles, the episode examines "the predator and the prey through the lens of value theory" [00:04:49].

The episode introduces multiple forms of value beyond simple financial worth, such as social, emotional, or historical value [00:05:01]. These alternative values can be "situational and fluid," depending on intrinsic and extrinsic factors [00:05:08].

### Financial Value vs. Actual Value
When Stan's grandpa gives him a bolo tie bought for $6000, Stan quickly discovers its market value at a local appraiser is only $15 [00:05:18]. Subsequent opinions diminish its financial worth to that of a "seven-layer burrito at Taco Bell" [00:05:30].

Dean, the Home Shopping Network host, manipulates viewers by using his authority to convince them they are getting "amazing deals," despite selling items that have "pretty much a piece of crap" material or resale value [00:05:55]. This "disconnect," where "high perceived value married to low actual value," is the "mechanism that drives any great scam" [00:06:21]. While a "labor-oriented view of economics" might consider production effort, *South Park* suggests a more nuanced idea: value is determined "not by quality or by effort of production, but by the nature of supply and demand" [00:06:29]. Dean excels at exploiting this demand [00:06:44]. For Dean, there is "literally no useful value beyond the financial frame of value" [00:07:05].

### Emotional and Historical Value
Conversely, emotional value is clearly demonstrated through Stan's grandpa's story about his dog [00:07:13]. His "reckless purchases" are revealed to have little to do with market value; instead, Grandpa is trying to "add emotional and historical value to himself" by creating lasting memories and sentimental connections [00:07:44].

The episode shows how fluid notions of value question "the true value of nearly everything" [00:08:00]. An Academy Award, for instance, loses its "perceived cultural value" when it's melted down for resale [00:08:07]. Stan's gift to his grandfather, a framed photo, possesses "astronomic emotional value but low market value" [00:08:15].

## Brand Value and Appearance in "Go Fund Yourself"

"Go Fund Yourself" explores the loose relationship between labor and profit by depicting the South Park kids launching a successful [[Brand identity and modern economics | brand]] "that doesnâ€™t even bother to put a business behind it" [00:08:36]. Their company, the Washington Redskins, thrives on "modern Kickstarter culture," accepting donations for "no effort at all" [00:08:58].

The episode suggests that, in the age of social media, "the success of a brand or company can now be rooted purely in its appearance rather than in its function" [00:09:15]. A central argument is that "what a business does is less valuable to that business than the relative power of its brand" [00:09:25]. Even the search for "the perfect startup name" carries more weight than any actual objective [00:09:36].

This mirrors the argument of philosopher Jean Baudrillard, who in *Simulacra and Simulation* (1981) posited that previous definitions of value were inadequate [00:09:51]. According to Baudrillard, value is determined "purely as the appearance of value" [00:10:02]. An item or brand is valued "as it exists as an image in relation to other things that are also images" [00:10:15]. This implies that value is solely determined by relationships between things or within a set of things [00:10:24]. Therefore, having "a great brand" becomes more important than making "great stuff," and being "trendy for investors" outweighs making "fat stacks of cash" [00:10:31]. *South Park* portrays this concept to "absurd heights," where ultimate success lies in "not doing anything at all" [00:10:49].

However, the episode also shows the limitations of this model: the Washington Redskins venture collapses due to the brand's "missteps on a social issue" [00:11:26]. A business built "only on aesthetics" has "no foundational beliefs to hold to" when public opinion turns against it [00:11:36]. Even a business doing "almost nothing" can be threatened by "doing or saying or being the wrong thing at the wrong time" [00:11:45].

## Social Value in the Digital Age: "You Have Zero Friends"

"You Have Zero Friends" examines the "absurdities of our growing social media economy" and again tackles "the true meaning of value" [00:12:09]. The episode questions whether friendships and "social worth" are measured by "likes" and Facebook connections or by interactions in "meatspace" (the real world) [00:12:28].

The protagonists initially quantify their social status "solely by their collections of online friendships" [00:12:40]. In this framework, "Facebook friendships, like money, create an easily measurable hierarchy of personal value" [00:12:55]. Cartman, predictably, views relationships as "status symbols by which to elevate some people over others" [00:13:11].

This recalls Baudrillard's *The Consumer Society*, where he warned that a "transactional approach to relationships 'leads to an individual lack, since everything possessed is relativized in relation to others'" [00:13:20]. Cartman's view begins to infect Kyle, who prioritizes his social media cache even after receiving real-world support from Stan [00:13:35]. Kyle even drops a "socially toxic" friend from his Facebook roster "to salvage his own social standing" [00:14:03].

*South Park* asks, "who are we, really, when our online presence outweighs our real-world engagements?" [00:14:12]. Characters like Wendy and Randy require internet validation for their relationships, demonstrating a "disjunction between our digital and real-world lives" that threatens to place a "greater premium on our digital behavior," making physical life seem less significant [00:14:40]. While many seek to "pump up their digital lives at the expense of their meat space lives," some, like Kip, desperately try to force digital friendships into the real world [00:15:06]. The argument for cultivating an online brand is that, despite lacking authenticity, "your cyber-influence casts a much wider net than you do alone" [00:15:18].

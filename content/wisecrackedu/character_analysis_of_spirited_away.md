## Chihiro / Sen
Chihiro is introduced as a ten-year-old human female who, along with her parents, gets lost in the woods and accidentally stumbles into a magical land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. Initially, she is portrayed as naive, inexperienced, timid, and whiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>, exemplified by her negativity about her new school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

After her parents are transformed into pigs for overeating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>, Chihiro seeks employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. She is hired by Yubaba at her bathhouse, but her name is changed to Sen as a "show of bad faith" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. She is warned by Haku not to forget her real name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>, a key theme emphasizing the importance of identity and ancestry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

Her journey is a coming-of-age story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a> where she gains self-reliance and empathy by solving problems and helping others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. Her acts of kindness include successfully cleaning a stink spirit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>, using a "turd infused with ipecac" from the spirit to help a poisoned Haku <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>, and giving the rest of the turd to No-Face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. Her love for Haku is stated to have broken a curse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. She eventually remembers falling into the Kohaku River, which helps identify Haku as a river spirit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. At the end of the film, she successfully identifies her re-humanized parents, regaining her name and enabling their return home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

## Haku
Haku is initially introduced as a "dreamboat" who warns Sen not to forget her real name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>, as he himself cannot remember his own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. He can transform into a dragon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. Haku gets poisoned, and part of the "turd" from the stink spirit is given to him by Sen, causing him to vomit a "shiny little Egg MacGuffin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. Later, Chihiro's memory of falling into the Kohaku River reveals that Haku is short for Kohaku and is a river spirit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

## Chihiro's Parents
Chihiro's "parental units" get lost in the woods with her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. They consume suspicious food from the magical land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>, losing their "kosher status" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a> and being transformed into pigs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. Pigs are described as a "critical symbol of capitalist cultures that would bring about the eradication of humankind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. Their transformation serves as a cautionary tale of greed and overconsumption related to postwar Japan's economic boom and cultural shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. They are eventually re-humanized after Chihiro identifies them correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

## Yubaba
Yubaba is described as a "wrinkly old cronut" who hires Chihiro to work in her bathhouse and changes her name to Sen "as a show of bad faith" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. She is depicted as greedy, as she and her workers "milk that proverbial horse for every last fluid ounce" when No-Face shows up "overflowing with gold" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. At the end, Yubaba gives Sen a final quiz to identify her parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

## No-Face
No-Face initially appears paying for food with gold, which is stated to be the "very foundation of a transactional ecosystem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. He is later given the rest of the "turd" by Sen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>, which causes him to vomit excessively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. While the bathhouse staff showers No-Face with excess, he in turn showers them with stomach acid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>, symbolizing the dire consequences of overconsumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

In gratitude, the spirit bestows upon her a "little turd infused with ipecac" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

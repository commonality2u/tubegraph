Death Note follows Light Yagami, a model student, as he discovers the Death Note—a supernatural notebook capable of killing anyone whose name is written in it while picturing their face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. Initially, Light intends to use the Death Note to create a world devoid of crime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. This premise quickly leads to a profound exploration of Light's character and his [[Philosophical exploration of justice in Death Note | moral transformation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

## Light Before the Death Note

Before encountering the Death Note, clues about Light's moral compass and sense of obligation exist. He expresses internal conflict, stating, "There must be something wrong with me to even consider it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Yet, he also feels a strong sense of duty, believing, "This world is rotting and those who are making it rot deserve to die. Someone has to do it so why not me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

## Light as Kira

Upon discovering the Death Note, Light quickly adopts the public persona of "Kira," aiming to become the God of a new world free of crime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. As Kira, Light operates under an "ends-justify-the-means" philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. The goal of becoming a "crime-zapping uber-tyrant" justifies almost any action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. This includes shamelessly using his girlfriend to distract the police and maximize his kill count <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>, as well as eliminating non-criminals who hinder his plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. He proudly claims, "I am justice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a> and <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>, expressing happiness with the power and his vision of creating a perfect world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

## Light's Moral Transformation (Without Memories)

A significant aspect of Light's [[Philosophical exploration of justice in Death Note | moral transformation]] occurs when he temporarily forfeits ownership of the Death Note, losing his memories of being Kira <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. During this period, his personality and sense of [[Philosophical exploration of justice in Death Note | justice]] noticeably change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. He transitions from a "by any means necessary" mindset to a more considerate one, refusing to exploit Misa’s feelings for information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. He states, "To me, exploiting another person's feelings for personal gain is unforgivable and I won't allow myself to stoop that low" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. This contrasts sharply with his previous manipulation of Misa for years when it was convenient for his killings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. Without the Death Note, Light shows enough respect for Misa to avoid leading her on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

## Reversion to Kira

However, this transformed personality is conditional. The moment Light touches the Death Note again and regains his memories and powers, his Kira persona immediately returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. He promptly moves in with Misa to gain "bonus killing power," effectively throwing out the concept of "treating people well" in favor of his capital-J [[Philosophical exploration of justice in Death Note | Justice]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. The show depicts countless examples of this tension between Light's pre- and post-notebook personalities, though they merge more as the series progresses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

## Internal Conflict and Anonymity

Light's internal struggle is often portrayed through conversations he has with himself, where he grapples with moral and practical dilemmas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. This split personality echoes the ancient Greek story, The Ring of Gyges, where a man gains invisibility and immediately abuses his power for personal gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. Plato's *Republic* uses this fable to question the nature of [[Philosophical exploration of justice in Death Note | justice]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. Glaucon argues that people only value [[Philosophical exploration of justice in Death Note | justice]] for its ability to make them look good, implying that someone with [[Role of anonymity and identity in understanding justice in Death Note | anonymity]] would naturally act "like an asshat" because their actions cannot be scrutinized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

This directly relates to Light's character, as he takes joy in actions far worse than "breaking the royal bro code" while maintaining a façade of "normal" morality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. The show poses the key question: "What does [[Philosophical exploration of justice in Death Note | Justice]] mean when nobody's looking?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a> This theme is underscored by Light's pseudonymity as Kira <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

## Light's Conception of Justice

Light believes he possesses true knowledge of [[Philosophical exploration of justice in Death Note | justice]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. He envisions a new world and himself as the one passing "righteous judgment on the wicked" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. His concept of [[Philosophical exploration of justice in Death Note | justice]] aligns with "ideal theory," which posits that to correct societal injustices, one must first define what [[Philosophical exploration of justice in Death Note | "justice"]] is in a perfect world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>. For Light and Mikami, this ideal world involves "a lot of people being dead" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.

Light considers himself a martyr <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>, willing to sacrifice his mind and soul to become the god of his new world and ensure peace and happiness for the greatest number of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. He acknowledges that this path means becoming "more and more Kira, slowly killing Light Yagami" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>, and that he would have to contend with a "rotten self" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. His brand of [[Philosophical exploration of justice in Death Note | justice]] is an "Old Testament-style bloodbath where sinners get punished and blasphemy is the biggest sin of all" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. The distinction between Light and Kira becomes less important as the series progresses, as Kira represents Light’s ideal: a perfectly just world, achieved by any means necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.

## Conclusion

Light Yagami's moral transformation is central to *Death Note*'s [[Philosophical exploration of justice in Death Note | exploration of justice]]. The show uses Light's journey—from a student with a strong sense of obligation to the ruthless Kira, and his temporary reversion when stripped of the Death Note—to constantly challenge definitions of [[Philosophical exploration of justice in Death Note | justice]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. The ambiguity of who truly represents [[Philosophical exploration of justice in Death Note | justice]] by the end of the series is what makes *Death Note* so poignant, offering no definitive answer but instead opening more doors than it closes regarding the meaning and implications of [[Philosophical exploration of justice in Death Note | justice]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>.

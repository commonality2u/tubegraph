Nicolas Cage's acting career is one of the most disputed among leading Hollywood stars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. Often perplexing audiences, his performances raise the question: Is he "Deep or Dumb?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

## Public Perception and Memes

Cage's performances have often left movie-lovers "befuddled" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. His portrayal of Peter in the 1988 film *Vampire’s Kiss*—characterized by unusual speech patterns, unique running, and even eating a live cockroach—spawned "twenty million memes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. In recent years, Cage has become as well-known for the ridiculous memes he inspires as for the roles he plays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. His "wild reactions and bug-eyed expressions" confuse audience expectations and, when taken out of context in memes, make his performances seem ridiculous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.

Despite this, opinions on his acting vary widely. Ethan Hawke has called him the only actor to evolve the craft since Marlon Brando, while David Lynch dubbed him the "jazz musician of acting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

## Career Controversies and Choices

As the nephew of director Francis Ford Coppola, Cage is considered one of Hollywood's hardest-working actors, with over 73 films in his repertoire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. His financial difficulties are suggested as a reason for his apparent inability to turn down any paying gig <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>, leading him to appear in "stinkers, weirdly-great indie films, big action films and everything in between" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. This refusal to be typecast also makes him difficult to categorize, positioning him as both a leading man and a character actor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

Cage's distinctive style, which critics often deem "out of control" or "over the top," runs counter to the prevailing emphasis on realism in film acting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

### Departure from Realism

Initially embracing [[the_impact_of_method_acting_and_other_techniques_on_Cages_performances | method acting]]—even having two teeth removed for his role in 1984's *Birdy*—Cage quickly grew tired of the style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. He sought a form of acting that went "beyond" literalism, which he viewed as a "dead end" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. *Vampire's Kiss* served as his "laboratory" for experimenting with these new ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

Cage's performances are intentionally performative, utilizing exaggerated physicalities, goofy facial expressions, and distinct vocal experimentations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. He consciously draws inspiration from diverse sources such as:
*   **Kabuki:** A Japanese avant-garde performance art, influencing his tendency to ad-lib made-up lyrics and adopt a different voice for each character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.
*   **German Expressionism:** An early film movement known for highly-emotional, subjective storytelling and twisted villains, inspiring specific hand motions and character physicality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.
*   **Nouveau Shamanism:** For his role as Johnny Blaze in *Ghost Rider*, he integrated Afro-Caribbean techniques and wore thousand-year-old Egyptian artifacts, even painting his face like a voodoo priest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. These methods were meant to trick him into believing he possessed special powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.

### Impact of His Style

While his "unapologetically performative" quality can be confusing in naturalistic films like *Vampire's Kiss*, it often thrives in surreal worlds that can accommodate his bold choices, such as *Moonstruck*, *Mandy*, and David Lynch’s *Wild At Heart* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. His "dialed-up style" can work if the filmmaker and other actors are "in on it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

Nicolas Cage defiantly refuses to conform to realism, raising the question of why realism is the benchmark for good acting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>. Film, as an intimate art form, leads audiences to expect performers to behave realistically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>. Cage "specifically refuses to do just that," which can be maddening to watch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>.

### Contrast with Christian Bale

Comparing Cage's Peter in *Vampire’s Kiss* to Christian Bale’s Patrick Bateman in [[Controversy_surrounding_American_Psycho | *American Psycho*]], both films satirize 1980s corporate yuppie culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. However, Bale's Bateman has become an iconic antihero, strangely revered despite his murderous tendencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>. In contrast, Cage’s Peter is "so inaccessible, so clearly performative," that he poses no risk of becoming sympathetic to the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>.

Ultimately, Cage's acting style is "compelling," "different," and "controversial," making Hollywood "a lot more interesting" with his presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>.

*Mob Psycho 100*, from the mind of Japanese manga artist ONE, explores what it means to live a fulfilling life by examining the unique challenges faced by an [[influence_of_omnipotent_characters_on_storytelling | overpowered protagonist]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Unlike Saitama from *One-Punch Man*, Shigeo Kageyama, known as Mob, finds a way to make peace with his abilities and achieve satisfaction despite them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Mob's Struggle with Power

Mob is a middle schooler born with psychic powers that grant him a near-godlike ability to manipulate the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. He works for Reigen Arataka, a con man who masquerades as a powerful psychic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. Reigen instructs Mob never to use his powers against another human, warning that misusing such great power could lead to self-destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. Mob represses the rage that fuels his powers, which occasionally gets away from him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. When other superpowered humans, called 'espers', attack his friends, Mob is torn between defending his loved ones and his promise not to harm others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

## The Pitfall of Egocentricity

Unlike Mob, most espers in the series are profoundly egocentric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. They view themselves as "main characters" of an unfolding story, rather than ordinary people with limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. Teru, a 'shadow leader' from a rival middle school, uses his powers to bully others, seemingly gaining all the attention, respect, and power a teenager could desire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. Similarly, Dimple, a power-hungry ghost, points out that Teru appears to have used his psychic powers for a "good life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

However, Mob doesn't desire Teru's superficially perfect life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. He believes an easy life built on innate gifts would be "pointless," as the things he truly wants—like muscles or the ability to understand girls—require effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

## Edmund Burke and The Sublime

Taking a cue from Reigen, Mob understands that accepting limitations can positively influence one's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. This idea aligns with the philosophy of Irish philosopher Edmund Burke, known for his description of "the sublime" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. The sublime is the feeling of experiencing oneself as infinitesimally small in the face of vast, uncontrollable forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. It suspends or destroys egocentricity through an overwhelming display of power, like staring at a mountain range or sailing through a thunderstorm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

Burke believed such experiences were vital for a healthy life, forcing individuals to use mental and spiritual capacities that remind them they are not the center of the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. Avoiding challenging scenarios that enable the sublime can lead to an unhealthy state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. He argued that the sublime exercises parts of the mind and body that "tense up" in response to fear, which are vital for well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

### The Dangers of "Relaxed State"

Burke stated that "Melancholy, dejection, despair, and often self-murder, is the consequence of the gloomy view we take of things in this relaxed state of body" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. In other words, becoming too "relaxed" about one's place in the universe can lead to profound unhappiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

This is the trap most espers in *Mob Psycho 100* fall into <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. Like the Paradisers in *One-Punch Man*, [[relatable_villains_and_social_critiques | Teru and the leaders of Claw]] possess a massive sense of entitlement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. This entitlement, far from bringing happiness, leaves them miserable when the real world fails to give them what they falsely believe they deserve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. One esper laments, "It's hard to live...surviving's a chore, even though I'm so special. It's obvious I'm amazing, why won't you just acknowledge that? I'm a gift! This planet should put me on a pedestal and worship me! That is the only world that is worthy of me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

Mob recognizes that these espers have no substance beyond their powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>: "If you take away your psychic powers, there'll be nothing left. You'll be empty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. Their dependence on powers for [[toxic_selves_as_a_narrative_device | identity]] and worth makes them intolerant of any attack on their constructed self-image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. Teru, for example, breaks down when Mob refuses to fight back, stating, "As long as I used my powers, everything went just the way I wanted...And yet, you took my world...Your existence...destroyed that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. He perceives Mob's refusal as a direct assault on his self-perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

## The Necessity of "Labour" and Challenges

Like Saitama's strength, the espers' abilities are a double-edged sword <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. Left unchecked, they foster a belief of inherent superiority, leading to deep dissatisfaction regardless of power or status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. These espers need a reality check—a reminder that they are subject to the same rules as others, which means experiencing the sublime to humble their egos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.

Burke described the sublime as a "terrifying but ultimately pleasant feeling" resulting from the healthy exercise of mind, body, and spirit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. A mind that never experiences its own insignificance is weak, allowing "melancholy, dejection, despair" to take root <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. He claimed that "labour [is] a thing absolutely requisite to make us pass our lives with tolerable satisfaction" and that "labour is a surmounting of difficulties" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

Unlike the deluded espers, Mob desires to engage in the difficult "labour" of integrating himself into the world and society, rather than trying to transcend it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. He finds allies in the Body Improvement Club, who also believe that "surmounting of difficulties" is key to a fulfilling life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. They choose to challenge their weakest parts, rather than relying solely on innate strengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.

## The Sublime as a Catalyst for Change

Espers avoid "difficulties" by using their psychic powers to gain social status and uphold a false sense of self-worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. They must be "shaken and worked" by external forces to find true fulfillment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

Teru is a clear example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. When Mob defeats him, Teru is overwhelmed, feeling terror and utter helplessness—emotions Burke identified as key components of the sublime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. Stripped naked, hoisted into the sky by Mob's runaway powers, Teru experiences the fear of death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. After pleading for Mob to stop, he is cast into the sky, dwarfed by clouds and an endless vista, reminiscent of Romantic art that portrayed small human subjects facing vast natural forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. This realization brings Teru peace: "Oh. I guess...I'm just an average person after all..." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

Reigen similarly exposes the remaining "Scars" to the sublime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. Using Mob's transferred powers and his own rhetoric, Reigen crushes their delusions of grandeur by reminding them that even with powers, they are not special: "You're nothing more than a commoner. You're just part of the masses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>. He forcibly drags them back to reality, showing them their insignificance and setting them on a healthier path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.

For the espers, the key to freedom is realizing they are still human, "small and vulnerable as the rest of us" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. As the show's theme song suggests: "If everyone is not special...Maybe you can be what you want to be..." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.

## Mob's Path to Reality

While Mob genuinely wants to be normal, he too is plagued by a delusional self-image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. As a 14-year-old, he clings to the delusion that he must be in total control of his world, responsible for everything that happens during his unconscious psychic episodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. This causes him to repress his emotions out of fear of his rage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>, paradoxically giving him less control over his explosions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. The weight of this responsibility is incredibly painful, leaving him overwhelmed by a feeling of powerlessness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.

His delusion is a "more benevolent version of the other espers' greedy desire for godhood" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>, as he believes he has to protect everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>. It takes Reigen, an adult Mob respects, to remind him that he is just a kid and doesn't always have to bear the world on his shoulders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>: "When things go south, it's okay to run away" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>.

This idea shocks Mob into an experience of the sublime, allowing him to feel his own insignificance and temporarily transfer his powers to Reigen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>. In doing so, he finally comes to terms with his abilities and can focus on living a good life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>.

## Conclusion

Both *One-Punch Man* and *Mob Psycho 100* ask what constitutes a good life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>. Saitama's and Mob's struggles with their powers reveal that a fulfilling existence is not as simple as getting whatever one desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>. In the ONE-iverse, happiness is the result of deliberate struggle and growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>. As Mob puts it: "fight on fight on fight on" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>.

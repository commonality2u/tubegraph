[[Rick and Morty episode analysis | *Rick and Morty*]] frequently trivializes aspects people hold dear, including religion, which is a regular victim of Rick's contempt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. While the show often reduces religion to superstition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>, the episode "Get Schwifty" complicates this by exploring how individuals rationalize such thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## "Get Schwifty": A Case Study

The episode "Get Schwifty" features a giant floating head, known as a Cromulon, which demands humanity "SHOW ME WHAT YOU GOT!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. This event causes earthquakes, sinkholes, fires, and massive flooding on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. The show uses this scenario to satirize the opportunistic nature of organized religion, as churches prioritize faith, money, and repairs over addressing the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

### The Headism Cult and its Origins

A cult called Headism emerges due to a "cosmic problem in point of view" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. With no understanding of what a Cromulon is or what "show me what you've got" means, people naturally form this cult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. The Headists, for instance, send "unwantables" to the gods on "Ascension Day," reminiscent of the crucifixion of Christ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

### Beyond Simple Indictment: Critique of Belief Structures

Instead of merely being a scathing indictment of religion and the arbitrary nature of faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>, the episode offers a more complex critique. It targets the reasoning behind belief structures themselves, exposing fallacies in various things people believe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

## Common Logical Fallacies Depicted

"Get Schwifty" specifically highlights two common logical fallacies, both of which conflate correlation with causation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

### Cum Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc (Correlation Implies Causation)

This fallacy is the mistaken belief that two things occurring simultaneously are causally related, even if they are unrelated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.
*   The Headist religion begins when Principal Vagina prays to the Head at the same time the cataclysmic events subside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. The reality is that the Heads stop the destruction because they are pleased with Rick's impromptu performance of "Get Schwifty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
*   When Principal Vagina attempts to ascend Beth and Jerry, the Heads begin booing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. The Headists assume this is due to their actions, but the Heads are actually displeased with Rick's terrible performance without Morty and a nuclear strike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. Subsequently, the Headists try to ascend Principal Vagina to appease the Heads, unaware that the Heads are indifferent to their rituals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

### Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc (False Cause)

This fallacy suggests that because one event precedes another, the first event must be the cause of the second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.
*   The President of the United States believes that musicians like The Dream, Billy Corgan, Randy Newman, and Pharrell are dead simply because he names them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

### Aristotle's Contribution

The concept of logical fallacies was first systematically listed by Aristotle, who aimed to identify arguments that sound convincing but are logically flawed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

## The Human Brain and Rationalization

The episode posits that people don't just adopt silly beliefs out of pure irrationality; rather, they over-rationalize their thinking to the point of absurdity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.
*   [[Science and rationalism in Rick and Morty | Cognitive psychologists]] suggest that pseudo-scientific belief systems, such as doomsday cults or conspiracy theories, are resilient because they are sustained by the structure of the human brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. These systems persist and spread through appeals to rationality, not through deception or the supposed stupidity of the masses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.
*   The human brain is naturally inclined to seek logical conclusions and simple explanations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. People tend to believe what aligns with their existing worldview, consuming and sharing information that confirms their political beliefs or creating elaborate justifications for supporting their favorite sports teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. This phenomenon is known as **confirmation bias**: the tendency to seek out and interpret information that confirms one's own beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. Confirmation bias also explains why people may overlook significant flaws in their belief systems for personal benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.

### Universality of Fallacies

These fallacies and biases are not exclusive to religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. Post hoc rationalization is an inherent part of the human cause-and-effect thought process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Even the audience can be fooled by the brain's tendency to accept logical fallacies, as demonstrated by Rick's snake and wristwatch trick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. This trick plays on the brain's desire to attribute event A as the cause of event B, when in reality, the outcome is staged (a particle beam in the wristwatch and a snake holster on the leg) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

## Satire and Broader Implications

[[Rick and Morty references and parodies | *Rick and Morty*]] highlights the irony that cosmic events leading to the formation of a religion can be based on woefully inaccurate interpretations, where belief structures are built on something as mundane as a reality TV show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

The show takes this concept further by challenging the human ability to make predictions and understand the complexity of existence itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. This aspect distinguishes [[Philosophy and existentialism in Rick and Morty | *Rick and Morty*]] from contemporary satire, as nothing, not even belief, is safe from its critique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

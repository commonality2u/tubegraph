The *Rick and Morty* episode "Pickle Rick" explores themes of freedom and choice through the lens of [[philosophers_influencing_existential_and_cosmic_nihilism | existential philosophy]], particularly the ideas of Jean-Paul Sartre <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>. While partly conceived from a writer's room brainstorm ("Rick is a pickle!") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>, Rick's transformation is primarily a means to avoid family therapy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>. This deliberate avoidance serves as a gateway to discussing how Rick's actions relate to [[jeanpaul_sartres_radical_freedom_as_depicted_in_bojack_horseman | Sartre's philosophy of radical freedom]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>.

## Rick's Avoidance and Parallel with Beth

Rick's extreme measure of turning into a pickle is an attempt to evade dealing with his emotions in therapy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>. This behavior parallels Beth's stonewalling of her school-appointed therapist, as both characters strive to maintain emotional distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>. Dr. Wong, the therapist, observes a "specific dynamic" between Beth and Rick that doesn't reward vulnerability and may punish it, potentially impacting Beth's marriage and her children's emotional well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.

This episode continues a season-long emphasis on serialized arcs, where Rick's actions, such as staying in Mad Max land to avoid his daughter’s divorce, consistently involve running away from reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>.

## Dr. Wong's Monologue on Choice

A pivotal moment for understanding the philosophical implications comes from Dr. Wong's monologue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>:

> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a> "I think it's because the only truly unapproachable concept for you is that it's your mind within your control. You chose to come here. You chose to talk. To belittle my vocation, just as you chose to become a pickle. Each of us gets to choose."

This statement challenges Rick's perception of control and freedom, highlighting that despite his vast abilities, he struggles with acknowledging his own choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.

## Jean-Paul Sartre and Radical Freedom

The show connects Rick's predicament to the ideas of [[philosophers_influencing_existential_and_cosmic_nihilism | Jean-Paul Sartre]], a key figure in [[the_philosophy_of_nihilism_and_existentialism | existential philosophy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>. For Sartre, the absence of God means individuals are "radically free" to define their own existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>.

### Bad Faith and Finitude

Sartre argued that people often avoid this radical freedom by making choices based on social pressures or perceived roles, which he termed "bad faith" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>. This involves denying the importance of one's finite choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>. An example of acting in bad faith is shown through the song from *West Side Story*, where characters blame their upbringing for their actions rather than taking responsibility for their choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>.

Sartre also introduced the concept of "finitude," meaning there's a fixed amount of choices one can make in life, and each choice prevents other possibilities (e.g., choosing to be a truck driver means not being a teacher) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.

### Rick's Infinitude and Bad Faith

Rick's situation is unique because he deals with "infinitude" rather than finitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>. His access to infinite timelines means he believes he doesn't need attachment or to take responsibility for his choices, as he has ostensibly made them all in infinite versions of himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>.

However, Dr. Wong asserts that justifying actions with the multiverse or god-like intelligence is not a solution, because intelligence helps make a decision, but the individual still has to *make* the decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>.

> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a> "The only connection between your unquestionable intelligence and the sickness destroying your family, is that everyone in your family, you included, use intelligence to justify sickness."

Despite being the "master of his universe," Rick paradoxically struggles to come to terms with his own choices, which are uniquely his own regardless of infinite versions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>. His chosen method of dealing with infinite choice – "don't think about it!" – leads him to turn into a pickle to avoid the appearance of choice, thereby acting in bad faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>.

This season of *Rick and Morty* consistently explores ideas of agency, juxtaposing Jerry's powerlessness with Rick's all-powerful nature, yet still highlighting Rick's struggle with making genuine choices and facing consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>.

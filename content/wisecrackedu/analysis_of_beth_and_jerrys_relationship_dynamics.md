The third season of *[[rick_and_morty_episode_analysis | Rick and Morty]]* often highlights the meaninglessness of existence, suggesting that nothing truly matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This presents a unique challenge for character development in the series: how can characters grow when meaning is absent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>? The show offers a novel solution, moving beyond pure nihilism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>, with significant [[character development and anticharacter development in rick and morty | growth]] observed not in the titular protagonist, but in Beth Smith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## Beth's Existential Crisis and Rekindled Love

In "The Rickchurian Mortydate," Beth is fresh from the events of Episode 9, where she was offered the choice to be replaced by a clone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. This leads her to question her own identity and whether she is, in fact, a clone herself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. To resolve this existential doubt, Beth seeks assistance from [[character_analysis_of_jerry_in_rick_and_morty | Jerry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. [[character_analysis_of_jerry_in_rick_and_morty | Jerry]] attempts to help by recreating one of their first dates, which surprisingly rekindles their love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. Despite this, Beth remains worried she might be a clone, leading her to run off into the woods with her family, where Rick intervenes, initially appearing to kill [[character_analysis_of_jerry_in_rick_and_morty | Jerry]] to convince Beth she isn't a clone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

Rick previously informed Beth that her intelligence, much like his own, means that "nothing matters," and "the universe is yours" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. His typical response to this cosmic indifference is "Don’t think about it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. Faced with this revelation, Beth is granted "radical freedom to choose her destiny" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. This freedom provides her solace regardless of whether she chooses to stay with or leave her family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. The episode implies that Beth chooses to stay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>, resulting in a newfound sense of happiness and a more loving relationship with [[character_analysis_of_jerry_in_rick_and_morty | Jerry]], bringing the family back together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

### The Paradox of Loving Jerry

For some viewers, Beth's sudden rekindling of love with [[character_analysis_of_jerry_in_rick_and_morty | Jerry]], described as a "helpless parasite," might seem peculiar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. While concepts like Sartre's bad faith and radical freedom, or alienation vs. agency, could be applied from earlier discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>, a new explanation is proposed: *Amor Fati* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

## Amor Fati: The Cure for Common Nihilism

*Amor Fati*, a Latin phrase coined by Friedrich Nietzsche, means "Love of Fate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. It signifies the affirmation of life, being a "Yes-Sayer" to all of existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. This concept is linked to the thought experiment of "Eternal Recurrence": imagining one's entire life repeating infinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. To embrace this eternal repetition – the good, the bad, and everything in between – is the ultimate affirmation of life, or *Amor Fati* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. It serves as Nietzsche's strategy to transcend the despair of nihilism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

Given Beth's intellectual capacity and her [[psychological_analysis_of_rick_and_jerry_in_rick_and_morty | Rick-like]] tendency towards disillusionment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>, she is forced to confront her past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. By reliving a part of her past with [[character_analysis_of_jerry_in_rick_and_morty | Jerry]], particularly their first date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>, Beth embodies this Nietzschean "Yes-Sayer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. *Amor Fati* does not mean denying or rewriting past miseries, but rather embracing and not shunning the "ugly aspects of our lives" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

Beth explicitly tells [[character_analysis_of_jerry_in_rick_and_morty | Jerry]] that she is "no longer the woman he married" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. While [[character_analysis_of_jerry_in_rick_and_morty | Jerry]] may be perceived as simple or foolish, his "simplicity" might be what Beth needs to counteract a family history of using intelligence to justify destructive behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

## Embracing Fate and Present Reality

Another moment reflecting *Amor Fati* occurs when Beth believes Rick has come to "retire" her, effectively suggesting she embraces her present reality rather than dwelling on what could have been <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. Even in a multiverse with infinite versions of herself and infinite choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>, Beth chooses to affirm and stay in *this* reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

Nietzsche also wrote about the impossibility of "knowing oneself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>, a struggle Beth faces: "I'm out of excuses to not be who I am. So, who am I? What do I do?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. According to Nietzsche, the reasons for our actions are impenetrable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. Therefore, Beth fretting about whether she was cloned or if any of it matters in infinite versions of herself ultimately doesn't matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>; the only path is to "love our fate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. This appears to be the choice Beth makes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

## Beth's Ubermensch-like Development

While Rick is often portrayed as a Nietzschean *ubermensch* at war with a meaningless cosmos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>, he frequently engages in self-destructive behavior rather than creating new meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. Beth, conversely, confronts the meaninglessness of the cosmos and finds happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. This act of finding meaning and happiness in a meaningless world is arguably more *ubermensch*-like <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. Her decision to embrace her life with [[character_analysis_of_jerry_in_rick_and_morty | Jerry]] and her family, despite its imperfections, demonstrates a powerful affirmation of existence.

The *Bioshock* trilogy is recognized for its effectiveness at [[integration_of_philosophical_concepts_in_bioshock_games | integrating philosophical concepts]] into its plot, flaunting a level of intellectual sophistication rarely seen in games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. The original *Bioshock* game, in particular, delves deeply into the economic and societal implications of a radical free market system.

## Andrew Ryan and Objectivism

The underwater city of Rapture in the original *Bioshock* serves as a digital homage to "Galt's Gulch," a concept from Ayn Rand's novel *Atlas Shrugged* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Rapture was founded by Andrew Ryan, whose name is an anagram for "Ayn Rand," and whose political philosophy is directly drawn from Rand's concept of [[ayn_rands_objectivism_and_its_influence_on_bioshock | Objectivism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

[[ayn_rands_objectivism_and_its_influence_on_bioshock | Objectivism]] is presented as a guide to living a worthy life, with its main tenets including reality, reason, self-interest, and capitalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. Rand believed that actions should be determined solely on the basis of intellect, rejecting mystical or divine guiding forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. Andrew Ryan echoes this atheistic view:
> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a> "I believe in no God â€“ no invisible man in the sky. But there is something more powerful than each of us: a combination of our efforts, a Great Chain of industry that unites us."

Ryan acts as a mouthpiece for Rand's condemnation of coercive governments, advocating for a society where government policies do not violate individual autonomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. This philosophy promotes an ethics of egoism or radical self-interest, where individuals ought to work hard for their own happiness and not treat others as mere means to an end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

Rapture was established on the belief that the "communist parasites" in the world above were freeloaders who unjustly took from the "captains of industry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. Ryan, much like John Galt in Rand's work, was frustrated by working hard without receiving what he believed he deserved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. He rejected external claims on individual output, whether from government, religion, or communal ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

## Laissez-faire Capitalism and Deregulation in Rapture

Both Andrew Ryan and Ayn Rand were proponents of laissez-faire capitalism, the idea that a good government exists only to protect individual rights and should not interfere in personal lives or the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. In Rapture, this ideology is reflected in the severely under-regulated plasmid market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. The belief was that an unfettered market would provide the best options for consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

Andrew Ryan's recordings reveal the extreme consequences of this deregulation:
> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a> "There has been tremendous pressure to regulate this plasmid business. There have been side effects: blindness, insanity, death. But what use is our ideology if it is not tested? The market does not respond like an infant, shrieking at the first sign of displeasure. The market is patient, and we must be too."

## The Downfall of Rapture

The ruinous state of Rapture in *Bioshock* suggests that a society run purely by these tenets is doomed to fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. The central resource, ADAM, became a major point of contention and led to a civil war between Ryan and Fontaine (Atlas) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

Under Ryan's free market ideals, ADAM was completely deregulated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. This resulted in a population riddled with addiction and severe side effects, leading to rampant chaos and instability within Rapture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. Furthermore, the process of using Little Sisters as "mules" for magical sea slugs to create ADAM demonstrates treating sentient beings as mere tools for one's own goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. This practice, in particular, would have been disapproved of by Rand, despite her focus on self-interest, as [[ayn_rands_objectivism_and_its_influence_on_bioshock | Objectivism]] posits that one should not treat others as mere means to an end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. The narrative thus critiques the extreme application of laissez-faire capitalism, showing its potential to degrade society when divorced from ethical considerations regarding human dignity and social welfare.

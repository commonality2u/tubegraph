The briefcase in Quentin Tarantino's film *Pulp Fiction* serves as a key plot device, driving the initial actions of two main characters, Vincent and Jules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Contents
The briefcase belongs to the kingpin boss and is stated to contain his "favorite orange light bulb" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Role in the Plot
The retrieval of this briefcase is the primary objective of hitmen Vincent and Jules at the beginning of the film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. During their mission, Jules consumes processed animal carcass and reads from the Bible before engaging in team-building exercises with Vincent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. The events surrounding the briefcase's retrieval are presented with a "cavalier attitude about human-on-human violence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>, where the hitmen's casual gossip undercuts the suspense of their dangerous task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

## Symbolic Interpretations
The specific nature of the briefcase's contents, an "orange light bulb," is explicitly mentioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. The film's broader themes highlight that life is "random and filled with outrageous coincidence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>, and that trivial things are often "important-ized" while important things are "trivialized" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. While the film downplays serious situations, the briefcase itself is primarily presented as the object of a specific mission, with its contents being a notable, yet seemingly mundane, item.

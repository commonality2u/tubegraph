The animated film *The Incredibles* explores humanity's reactions to individuals who exhibit qualities of greatness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. The movie presents [[themes_of_greatness_and_mediocrity_in_the_incredibles | themes of greatness and mediocrity]] within society.

## The Suppression of Greatness

In the film, superpowered individuals are forced to conceal and suppress their abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. This suppression is depicted as a necessity to avoid persecution by a society of "inferior beings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

> "Right now, honey, the world just wants us to fit in, and to fit in, we've just gotta be like everybody else." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>

This societal pressure to conform illustrates the concept of "herd morality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. This idea, attributed to "Freddy Nietzchmeister" (likely a reference to Friedrich Nietzsche), posits that society often demonizes and inhibits the exceptional in favor of appeasing the basic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

The Incredibles observe with frustration as society rewards non-achievements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. They witness new ways being created to celebrate mediocrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>, and there's a pervasive insistence that everyone is special <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

> "Everyone's special, Dash." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>
> "Which is another way of saying no one is." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>

This forced equality comes at a cost, taking a psychological toll on exceptional individuals and ultimately harming society at large <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. An example of this harm is when young Buddy (later Syndrome), a "normie," interferes with Mr. Incredible's plan, allowing a culprit to escape and nearly causing a train full of "normies" to be killed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. This demonstrates what happens when "mediocrity gets in the way of excellence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

## Natural vs. Manufactured Greatness

Buddy's transformation into Syndrome initially suggests that ordinary people can achieve greatness through grit, determination, and effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. Syndrome builds an "empire of technological innovation" from the bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

However, the film quickly challenges this notion by proving Syndrome's "manufactured greatness" to be inferior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. Instead, it is the Incredibles, whose superpowers are natural and require no effort, who save the day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

The film ultimately implies that greatness cannot be aspired to; one must be born with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. As one character states, "It's in your blood" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.

## The Justification of Elite Status

The film concludes with the idea that great people deserve great things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. The Supers reclaim their "rightful place at the top of the societal food chain by virtue of their god-given gifts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

Examples include:
*   Dash being allowed to dominate his school athletic program, provided he's not too obvious with his cheating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.
*   Violet immediately being propositioned by "the dreamiest boy on campus" after a new haircut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

In contrast, Syndrome, who was fighting for equality in a world of superheroes, is ultimately "murdered" by The Incredibles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

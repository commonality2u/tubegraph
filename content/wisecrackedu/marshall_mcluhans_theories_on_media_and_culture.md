Marshall McLuhan, a prominent media theorist, speculated about the internet and its potential impact even before its widespread adoption, referring to the future information superhighway as "global media networking" in his final work, *The Global Village* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:54:00">[09:54:00]</a>.

## The Death of Monoculture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:03:00">[10:03:00]</a>
One of McLuhan's predictions regarding this new development was the "death of monoculture," which signifies a shift towards everyone consuming culture individually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:03:00">[10:03:00]</a>. This results in people choosing culture "Ã  la carte" to fit their specific interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:10:00">[10:10:00]</a>.

## Robotism: A Shift in Thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:14:00">[10:14:00]</a>
McLuhan identified this personalized cultural consumption as a symptom of what he termed "robotism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:14:00">[10:14:00]</a>. He described robotism, or right hemisphere thinking, as the capacity to be a conscious presence in multiple places at once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:17:00">[10:17:00]</a>.

McLuhan theorized that technology was pushing humanity towards a confrontation between two distinct ways of thought:
*   **Left Hemisphere Thinking** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:29:00">[10:29:00]</a>: Associated with hierarchical reasoning and visual space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:29:00">[10:29:00]</a>. This mode of thought assumes shared culture and rules, such as the widely accepted belief that Nazis are evil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:50:00">[10:50:00]</a>.
*   **Right Hemisphere Thinking (Robotism)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:37:00">[10:37:00]</a>: Associated with more primitive intuitions and acoustic space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:37:00">[10:37:00]</a>. This mode rejects shared ideas, leading individuals to develop their own belief systems and behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:59:00">[10:59:00]</a>.

McLuhan posited that technology is accelerating society's movement towards right hemisphere thinking and robotism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:45:00">[10:45:00]</a>. While the specific neuroscience of left and right brain thinking has been debated and questioned by recent scientists, McLuhan's insights into the hidden effects of technology remain insightful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:06:00">[11:06:00]</a>.

## Loss of Shared Culture and the Ruling Center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:21:00">[11:21:00]</a>
According to McLuhan, the daily loss of shared culture means that while some monoculture vestiges (like popular TV shows or movies) still exist, people are largely free to consume content via highly personalized suggestion algorithms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:21:00">[11:21:00]</a>. This societal splintering creates space for both positive developments, such as a YouTube channel analyzing philosophy and culture, and negative behaviors, like Nazism, to flourish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:33:00">[11:33:00]</a>.

McLuhan attributed this phenomenon to the loss of a "ruling center" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:49:00">[11:49:00]</a>. He described culture as becoming organized "like an electric circuit," where "each point in the net as central as the next" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:57:00">[11:57:00]</a>. In this decentralized system, "electronic man loses touch with the concept of a ruling center as well as the social restraints based on interconnection" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:01:00">[12:01:00]</a>, leading to constant dissolution and reformation of hierarchies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:08:00">[12:08:00]</a>.

The "ruling center" refers to the collective set of beliefs that society shares to ensure its proper functioning, such as the agreement that kindness is good and harming others based on ancestry is bad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:13:00">[12:13:00]</a>. As this shared agreement weakens, previously suppressed undesirable behaviors can emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:27:00">[12:27:00]</a>.

In this electrical circuit analogy, every point contributes to the whole, and the circuit can be reorganized at any point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:36:00">[12:36:00]</a>. Similarly, in modern culture, there is no fixed ethical center, with individuals deriving their ethics from diverse digital sources like Facebook, Twitter, 4chan, Snapchat, or YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:46:00">[12:46:00]</a>. This prevents a universal agreement on rules and behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:56:00">[12:56:00]</a>.

Historically, [[cinema as a tool for propaganda and cultural influence | cinema]] served as a defining cultural force, appealing to this ruling center and conveying narratives and ideals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:08:00">[13:08:00]</a>. While not always positive (as seen with Nazi propaganda films like Riefenstahl's *Triumph of the Will* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:19:00">[13:19:00]</a>), movies largely helped to solidify societal ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:21:00">[13:21:00]</a>. However, with the rise of robotism and the cultural acceleration it brings, [[cinema as a tool for propaganda and cultural influence | cinema]]'s ability to relay critical social messages has diminished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:27:00">[13:27:00]</a>.

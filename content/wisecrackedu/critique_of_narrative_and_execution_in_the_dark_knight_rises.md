*The Dark Knight Rises*, released in 2012, is noted for its intellectual ambition, though not all of it fully pans out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. While not considered a bad film, it "pales in comparison to its predecessor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. Much of the disappointment stems from a smart setup that leads to questionable execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Intellectual Ambition

One of the film's strongest elements is the unexpected [[influence_of_charles_dickens_a_tale_of_two_cities_on_the_dark_knight_rises | influence of Charles Dickens' *A Tale of Two Cities*]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. The film replicates most of the book's major themes, including [[social_inequality_and_its_depiction_in_the_dark_knight_rises | social inequality]], [[themes_of_resurrection_truth_versus_lies_and_doubling_in_the_dark_knight_rises | resurrection]], and [[themes_of_resurrection_truth_versus_lies_and_doubling_in_the_dark_knight_rises | doubling]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

The film's thematic adaptation from a classic novel to a comic book movie is considered "most graceful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. However, the film's narrative begins to stumble when it attempts to juggle these new themes borrowed from *A Tale of Two Cities* with those established in *The Dark Knight* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

## Narrative Issues and Unfulfilled Themes

### The Noble Lie (Truth vs. Lies)

A central theme in *The Dark Knight* is "truth versus lies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. *The Dark Knight Rises* picks up on this thematic thread, aiming to explore what happens when a noble lie is exposed to the truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

However, the film "not really" lives up to this challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.
At the beginning of *The Dark Knight Rises*, the noble lie manifests as the Dent Act, legislation granting police increased power against organized crime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. This act is presented as working wonders, effectively cleaning up Gotham's streets and eliminating organized crime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

When Bane reveals the truth about Harvey Dent being a false idol and the Dent Act being based on a lie, it leads to social unrest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. The film suggests that revealing the truth leads to negative outcomes, as exemplified by Alfred's revelation to Bruce about Rachel choosing Dent, which drives Bruce towards a suicide mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.

Ultimately, the film "doubles back" to the conclusion of *The Dark Knight*, with everything being fixed only when the truth is buried and another lie is established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. This happens when Batman fakes his death, creating a new image of sacrifice for Gotham to revere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. The film concludes in the "same spot" as *The Dark Knight*, reinforcing the necessity of a lie to uphold faith in justice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>. A potential development of this theme would have been to show how toxic lies lead to corruption, making truth beneficial, an opportunity the film misses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

### The Theme of Pain

The theme of pain in *The Dark Knight Rises* is similarly criticized for developing for nearly three hours only to bring the narrative back to its starting point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. Bruce Wayne initially is "stricken with physical pain and the pain of losing Rachel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. He overcomes this pain by healing his back and escaping the Lazarus pit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>. However, he ultimately gives into pain again by abandoning his role as Batman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>.

### [[Social_inequality_and_its_depiction_in_The_Dark_Knight_Rises | Social Inequality]]

The film's third major theme is social inequality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>. While *A Tale of Two Cities* effectively portrays the decadence of the elite leading to social unrest, *The Dark Knight Rises* presents a "vague, muddy, and almost nonsensical display of the social tensions" that lead to Bane's false revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>.

Bane claims Blackgate Prison symbolizes the Dent Act's oppression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. While harsh, with overcrowding and no parole under the Dent Act, it's not depicted as the "gratuitous cruelty" seen in *A Tale of Two Cities* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. The overwhelming success of the Dent Act in curbing organized crime makes these issues seem minor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>.

The analogy between Blackgate and the Bastille during the French Revolution, or the Dent Act to "Lettres de Cachet" (warrants for detention without proof), is flawed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>. Blackgate does not exhibit the same abuses of authority (e.g., imprisoning for religion or criticism) as the Bastille, and the Gotham police are not shown abusing their authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>. This lack of justification for the revolution makes the film's depiction of the uprising problematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>.

The film hints at economic disenfranchisement leading orphans to join Bane's army, but provides "zero indication" of how the Dent Act or Blackgate contribute to the poor's struggles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>. The only elite corruption shown is Daggit attempting to steal from Bruce Wayne, which is "the rich screwing over the rich," not the poor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>. This has led some to interpret the film as "anti-Occupy Wall Street propaganda," depicting a society seeking vengeance on the rich for no reason, and setting up "kangaroo courts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>.

The lack of established reasons for the rebellion makes it appear that the film portrays activists as "easily manipulated fascistic clowns" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>. This is seen more as an issue of "underdeveloped worldbuilding" rather than a politically charged moralizing statement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>.

## Conclusion

Despite its shortcomings, *The Dark Knight Rises* is not considered a bad film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>. The film's "SO many subplots, so many characters, and so much ambition, and it being so long" likely contributed to some elements becoming messy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>. The elaborate social unrest scenario being a fabrication by the League of Shadows further complicates the film's attempts at grounding itself in themes like the French Revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>. With more finessing and attention to world-building, the film could have been a more fitting conclusion to the trilogy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>.

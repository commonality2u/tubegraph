Season 3, Episode 7 of *Rick and Morty*, "The Ricklantis Mixup" (also known as "Tales from the Citadel"), presents a complex and dismal political world within the Citadel of Ricks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The episode provides a critical lens on modern politics, particularly regarding hope, resistance, and revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## World-Building and Political Commentary

After the events of "The Rickshank Redemption," the Citadel of Ricks is rebuilding, holding democratic elections for the first time since the dissolution of the Council of Ricks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. The episode's world-building brilliantly mirrors contemporary political climates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. This is exemplified through:
*   A news organization akin to "CNN" that trivializes dissent to uphold the status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
*   An inner city ravaged by drugs and guns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
*   A "Hogwarts" for disenfranchised Mortys designed to teach them to accept their unfortunate circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

## Crushing of Hope and Resistance

The episode features several subplots that illustrate how any political or personal optimism for change is systematically crushed by a "cruel and indifferent reality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>:
*   **Evil Morty's Ascent:** Evil Morty gains power on a platform of unity and change, only to reveal his true totalitarian intentions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
*   **Corrupt Justice System:** A newly graduated police Rick, reminiscent of *Training Day* and *L.A. Confidential*, confronts the corrupt underbelly of the Citadel, forcing him to abandon his ideals and compromise the very justice system he intended to protect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
*   **Orphaned Mortys' Lost Dreams:** A group of orphaned Mortys embark on an adventure in the style of *Stand By Me*, but their hopes and dreams are ultimately sent into a literal trash dump via a "wish portal" that turns out to be a "garbage portal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. Slick Morty's sacrifice for a better world appears to have no actual bearing on the overall narrative, serving to highlight the naivety of believing change can be achieved through such means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.
*   **Assembly Line Rick's Failed Rebellion:** A Rick, after realizing he's wasted his life on an assembly line, revolts, but his triumph is swiftly undermined by the powerful entities controlling the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

## [[modern_alienation_in_rick_and_morty | Alienation]] and the True Class Divide

The episode extensively builds upon themes of [[alienation_and_societal_critique_in_rick_and_morty | alienation]], demonstrating how modern society estranges individuals from the world and each other, leading to a sense of emptiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. Many versions of Rick, the universe's smartest man, are shown reduced to the drudgery of modern life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

The society within the Citadel is deeply divided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>, with soaring numbers of "displaced Mortys" and plummeting "Rick satisfaction levels" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. While there appears to be a divide between Ricks and Mortys, Evil Morty reveals that this is a distraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. The true divide is not between Ricks and Mortys, but rather between the "Rich vs. The Working Class" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>, specifically "between the Ricks and Mortys that like the citadel divided, and the rest of us" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

### Universal [[modern_alienation_in_rick_and_morty | Alienation]] and Systemic Control

Despite the Ricks forming an apparent ruling class, everyone, including Ricks, is a victim of [[modern_alienation_in_rick_and_morty | alienation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. They are told they are special but are stripped of their unique qualities, becoming mere cogs in an assembly line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. Even the police Ricks view themselves as "working stiff Ricks" whose "assembly line is justice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

Ricks are victims not only of powerful individuals but also of an "impenetrable system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. This is most vividly depicted through Simple Rick:
*   **Simple Rick Wafers:** Simple Rick, a Rick who found completion in his daughter, has that moment captured and looped in his mind, with the resulting brain secretions used to flavor "Simple Rick's Simple Wafers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. This commercialized "simple life" is a fantasy, a "commodity form" that reinforces the system by requiring work at an assembly line to afford it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.
*   **Commodification of Rebellion:** When an assembly-line Rick rebels by killing his boss and attempting to escape with a portal gun, his rebellion is immediately commodified into "Simple Rick Freedom Wafer Selects" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. The system distills the joy of rebellion into a consumable form, ensuring that "freedom from the system entraps you in the system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

Sociologist George Ritzer's perspective is invoked, suggesting that enchantment with and disenchantment from the modern world are not easily distinguished and exist in a reciprocal relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. The fantasy of "unplugging" through products like Simple Rick Wafers further entrenches individuals in the very system they seek to escape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. Ritzer states that "Fantasies draw people into the new means of consumption, and those fantasies can be rationalized in order to further draw people in" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

## Conclusion

The episode's overarching message is dark: in a terrifying political reality, the most one can hope for is the illusion of making a difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. Evil Morty, despite initially campaigning for class consciousness and unity against the ruling elite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>, ultimately uses this as mere "lip service as a means to power" through a brutal purge of his opponents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. This reinforces the cynical view that real progress or escape from systemic control is, perhaps, unattainable within this depicted reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.

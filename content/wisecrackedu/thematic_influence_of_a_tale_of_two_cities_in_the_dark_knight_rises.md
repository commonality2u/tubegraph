*The Dark Knight Rises*, released in 2012, is noted for its intellectual ambition, even if not all of it "pans out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. One of the film's most unexpected and strongest influences comes from Charles Dickens' *A Tale of Two Cities* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. The film replicates several major themes from the book, including social inequality, resurrection, and doubling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Social Inequality

The most evident thematic parallel with *A Tale of Two Cities* is social inequality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. Dickens' book, set during the French Revolution, portrays a decadent aristocracy abusing the poor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Similarly, *The Dark Knight Rises* depicts a class conflict through Bane's "false revolution," where he claims to liberate the city and return control to the people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Catwoman's line, "There's a storm coming, Mr Wayne," directly echoes the book's third part, "track of a storm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

Bane claims Blackgate Prison symbolizes the oppression of the Dent Act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>. Blackgate is described as overcrowded, with men and women sharing cell blocks, and criminals under the Dent Act not receiving parole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. This aligns with the Bastille during the French Revolution, and the Dent Act is meant to parallel the French "Lettres de Cachet," which allowed detention without proof or reasonable suspicion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>. The Bastille became a symbol of the King's excessive authority, where people could be imprisoned for religious beliefs, criticizing the government, or offending noblemen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>.

However, the film's portrayal of social inequality is described as "vague, muddy and almost nonsensical" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. Unlike *A Tale of Two Cities*, the film fails to adequately display the decadence and corruption of the elite that would genuinely lead to social unrest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>. There is no evidence that the Dent Act, which is supposed to be the product of a [[the_concept_of_the_noble_lie_in_the_dark_knight_rises | noble lie]], is corrupt or that its enforcement is gratuitously cruel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. In fact, the Dent Act is shown to be effective in fighting organized crime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

While a character mentions orphans joining Bane's army due to economic conditions, the film provides no indication how the Dent Act or Blackgate disenfranchise the poor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:15:04]</a>. The only elite corruption shown is Daggit attempting to steal Wayne Enterprises, which is "the rich screwing over the rich, not the rich screwing over the poor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:15]</a>. This lack of justification for the rebellion makes the film appear to paint activists as "easily manipulated fascistic clowns," leading to [[critiques_of_worldbuilding_and_political_symbolism_in_the_dark_knight_rises | critiques of worldbuilding and political symbolism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:47]</a>.

## Resurrection

The theme of resurrection is central to both texts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. In *A Tale of Two Cities*, Dickens uses "recalled to life" to signify characters metaphorically brought back from the dead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:46]</a>. For example, a main character is "recalled to life" after 18 years in the Bastille upon seeing his daughter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:53]</a>.

*The Dark Knight Rises* mirrors this:
*   **Bruce Wayne**: Metaphorically "recalled to life" when Catwoman steals his fingerprints, forcing him out of eight years of self-imposed isolation at Wayne Manor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:02:03]</a>. He is further "resurrected" when he rebuilds his strength and climbs out of the Lazarus Pit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:51]</a>. His final "resurrection" comes when he is revealed not to be dead, receiving a second chance at a more rewarding life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:03:03]</a>.
*   **Catwoman**: Reflects Carton's arc in *A Tale of Two Cities*, where he gains meaning by sacrificing himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:21]</a>. Catwoman overcomes her selfishness to save Batman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:28]</a>.
*   **Officer Foley**: Sacrifices his life to save Gotham after previously being complacent with the takeover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:35]</a>.
*   **Lazarus Pit**: Carton quotes the story of Lazarus from the Bible, who Christ resurrected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:44]</a>. Bruce's escape from the "Lazarus Pit" directly alludes to this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:51]</a>.
*   **Symbolism**: The film's title, *The Dark Knight Rises*, evokes a "Phoenix rising from the ashes," with the film's poster swapping a phoenix for the bat symbol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:09]</a>. Chapter 23 of *A Tale of Two Cities* is also titled "Fire Rises," a phrase directly quoted in the film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:17]</a>.

Gordon even reads a line from the end of *A Tale of Two Cities* about Carton's sacrifice at Batman's funeral, "It is a far far better thing that I do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:31]</a>.

## Doubling

The theme of doubling is prominent in both works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. *A Tale of Two Cities* famously opens with contrasting pairs like "it was the best of times, it was the worst of times" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:51]</a>. The book features two Mannettes, two cities (London and Paris), Darnay has two trials, and Darnay and Carton look alike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:04:02]</a>.

In *The Dark Knight Rises*, this theme is reflected through:
*   **Two Cities**: Gotham and Bane's underground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:07]</a>.
*   **Batman and Bane**: Two League of Shadows alumni who both deal with "unbearable pain," one born into privilege and the other in "hell" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:17]</a>.
*   **Blake and Batman**: Two orphans with anger issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:25]</a>.
*   **Body and Soul**: A constant reminder of the division between the body and the soul through torture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:34]</a>.
*   **Stryver**: Both texts feature a capitalist named "Stryver" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:22]</a>.

This makes *The Dark Knight Rises* arguably "the most graceful thematic adaptation from a classic to a comic book movie in existence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:40]</a>. However, the film struggles to integrate these new themes from *A Tale of Two Cities* with the established themes from its predecessor, *The Dark Knight* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:49]</a>.

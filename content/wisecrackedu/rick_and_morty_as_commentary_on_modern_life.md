From: [[wisecrackedu]] <br/> 

The third season *Rick and Morty* episode, "Rickmancing the Stone," explores the concept of [[modern_alienation_in_rick_and_morty | modern alienation]] through a post-apocalyptic setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This idea, while present in previous episodes, is further developed, touching on the notion that society may be "slowly destroying our souls" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. The episode acts as a [[satire_and_social_commentary_in_rick_and_morty | social commentary]], suggesting that modern life can be inherently soul-crushing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.

## Exploring Alienation

The show tackles [[alienation_and_societal_critique_in_rick_and_morty | alienation and societal critique]] on both micro and macro levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
*   **Micro Level**: Summer and Morty experience "family kind" alienation, particularly in dealing with their parents' divorce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Summer seeks a place where civilization has crumbled to feel alive, disillusioned by her tension with Jerry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Morty vents frustration through a "revenge-driven arm," eventually learning to let go <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
*   **Macro Level**: The series examines the [[alienation_and_societal_critique_in_rick_and_morty | alienation of society as a whole]], highlighting how individuals lose agency in their daily lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

### Jerry as the Modern Everyman

Jerry serves as a prime example of this societal critique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. Rick frequently emphasizes Jerry's lack of "personal resolve, power, agency" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>, labeling him a "doormat to the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Morty's resentment stems from Jerry's perceived powerlessness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

Jerry is portrayed as the "everyman of the modern world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>, reflecting a long-standing complaint about the loss of control since the Industrial Revolution, where people often toil in monotonous jobs instead of having their own trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. This loss of autonomy is a recurring theme in various cultural works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

> "Jerry is the pinnacle of modern stoogery" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

His existence as a "cog in a meaningless machine" is emphasized in "The Rickshank Rickdemption," where the Galactic Federation uses pharmaceuticals to keep everyone compliant and docile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. Ironically, Jerry "thrives in a society devoid of freedom" due to his inability to assert himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

### Cronenberg Jerry: An Alternative

The series contrasts the "main" Jerry with "Cronenberg Earth" Jerry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. When stripped of "the trappings of modern society," Cronenberg Jerry transforms from a "useless hack in a loveless marriage" into a "total badass who seems to be keeping his marriage together" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. This contrast suggests that modern society's comforts are "inherently alienating and create Jerrys out of all of us" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

## Post-Apocalyptic Society as Critique

In "Rickmancing the Stone," Rick introduces electricity to the Wasteland, causing it to rapidly resemble a modern industrialized society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. The consequences include:
*   Summer's violent lifestyle is replaced by "everyday banalities," such as grocery shopping for human bits instead of murdering mutants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.
*   The "savagery of the Death Stalkers" is reduced to "complaining about recycling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
*   Hemorrhage, formerly a "murdering machine," becomes a "good-for-nothing couch potato" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

This transformation implies that modern comforts contribute to "banal, terrible lives" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. Without external threats, people resort to "bickering about trivialities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. For example, instead of engaging in the Blood Dome, people now merely watch "blood-dome" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

Unlike typical post-apocalyptic fiction that warns of future horrors, *Rick and Morty*, with its dark tone, argues that "modern life is its own special brand of soul crushing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. Comforts ultimately "alienate us from meaning," leading to different forms of misery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. The episode raises the question of whether Summer forgives her father because she realizes that modernization transforms everyone into an "actionless lump" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

The show frequently references popular cinema <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. Speculation suggests that Jerry might undergo a significant character arc, potentially having a "Tyler Durden moment" akin to *Fight Club*, evolving from a "disaffected modern buffoon to a man of action" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

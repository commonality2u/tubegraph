Director [[analysis_of_ari_asters_midsommar | Ari Aster]] stunned horror fans with his 2018 film *Hereditary* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Expectations were high for his follow-up, *Midsommar*, which contemporary horror director Jordan Peele called "the most idyllic horror film of all time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Peele, known for social commentary in his own films like *Get Out* and *Us* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, sparked the question of whether *Midsommar* holds deep meaning or is merely shocking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Plot Summary
[[analysis_of_ari_asters_midsommar | Midsommar]] introduces Dani, a young woman, and her unsupportive boyfriend Christian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. After Dani's sister and parents die in a tragic incident, Christian, motivated by guilt, reluctantly invites her on a trip to Sweden with his anthropology grad school friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. They visit a remote Swedish commune for a once-every-96-years Midsummer festival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

Upon arrival, strange events unfold: two elders commit suicide by jumping off a cliff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>, a woman puts a pubic hair in Christian's pie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>, and people dance while hallucinating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. The British guests, sensing danger, disappear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Christian's friends are killed off in horrifying ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. Meanwhile, Dani wins a stone dance competition, is crowned May Queen, and is celebrated by the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. Christian is coerced into a sex ritual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>, which Dani witnesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. At the climax, Dani chooses Christian as the final human sacrifice, watching him and others burn with a smile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

## [[comparison_of_midsommars_depiction_of_rituals_to_real_swedish_traditions | Fictionalized Depiction of Swedish Midsummer]]

[[analysis_of_ari_asters_midsommar | Midsommar]]'s portrayal of the Midsummer festival is not anthropologically accurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. The actual Swedish Midsummer is a light, happy tradition celebrating summer, involving activities like eating herring, drinking aquavit, staying up late, dancing around maypoles, decorating with plants, and visiting holy springs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. It is primarily a fertility celebration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. Poe Tidholm, author of *Celebrating the Swedish Way*, clarifies that human sacrifices have never occurred during Midsummer, even in ancient times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. The "weird sex stuff" and intense psychedelic use are also largely [[analysis_of_ari_asters_midsommar | Aster]]'s inventions, though baby-making is a traditional part of the holiday, leading to a surge of births nine months after the summer solstice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

Despite creative liberties, [[analysis_of_ari_asters_midsommar | Aster]] conducted extensive research, incorporating real Swedish traditions, folklore, and Norse mythology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. The village name, Härga, is real <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>, and imagery like the maypole, agrarian barn paintings, eating herring, and wearing flower wreaths are authentic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. The blessing of crops is drawn from James George Fraser's 19th-century anthropological study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. [[analysis_of_ari_asters_midsommar | Aster]] also learned the Scandinavian runic alphabet, incorporating specific runic symbols on Härga clothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. For example, Christian's robe for the fertility ceremony features the Tiwaz symbol, associated with the Nordic god Tyr, representing bravery and virility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. Dani's dress has the "Rivo" rune for journey and "Thauagaus" for new beginning or loss of hope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

The film's death rituals are inspired by long-debated Viking mythology depicting sacrifices of animals and humans, though scholarly consensus suggests human sacrifices, if they occurred, were rare and ceased by 1050 A.D. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. Christian's fate of being burned alive inside a bear carcass reflects Norse beliefs about bears protecting against fire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. Simon's "blood eagle" torture is a gruesome reenactment of a Viking ritual, though its historical possibility is debated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. Elements like picking flowers to dream of a future mate are real <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>, while Maya placing a carved love rune or putting menstrual blood in Christian's drink are [[analysis_of_ari_asters_midsommar | Aster]]'s interpretations of folklore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

## Modern Secular Detachment: Christian and the "Dude Bros"

Christian and his friends represent a modern, secular perspective, approaching the Härga people with condescending distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. They act like anthropology students observing a thesis subject, sneaking photos of religious texts, and viewing rituals as if watching animals in a zoo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>. Mark, one of the friends, exemplifies this detachment by urinating on a sacred tree, unable to comprehend the villagers' outrage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.

Their reactions mirror an audience alienated from the value of ancient rituals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. The film suggests that modern society often views ritual acts as "primitive and potentially barbaric" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>. The fact that the film's "boogeyman" is a deeply religious Swedish community, rather than a typical serial killer, speaks to society's aversion to ritual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>. The characters' and the audience's shock stem from a modern, comfortable nihilism, as theologian David Bentley Hart describes it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>.

## [[themes_of_community_and_belonging_in_midsommar | Embracing Traditional Rituals: Dani's Transformation]]

In contrast to the detached male characters, Dani's journey offers a different perspective on ritual. She begins the film entrenched in a "cold, alienating secular society" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. Her world is depicted with muted colors, lonely city streets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>, and a profound lack of comfort after her family's death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. Her boyfriend Christian is superficial, trying to escape her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>, forgetting her birthday <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>, and pressuring her to take hallucinogens despite her panic attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. She lacks love, empathy, and [[themes_of_community_and_belonging_in_midsommar | community]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.

Upon encountering the Härga, Dani is initially wary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>, but she is gradually "seduced by the warmth of their [[themes_of_community_and_belonging_in_midsommar | community]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. The Härga move and behave in unison, like parts of a single organism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. This idea of "shared catharsis" is central: when an elder survives a cliff jump, the tribe moans in collective pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. Similarly, during Christian's sex ritual, the women moan in unison with Maya, sharing her pleasure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. As [[analysis_of_ari_asters_midsommar | Aster]] states, their language is empathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.

Dani's immersion into the cult is reflected in her physical transformation and increasing participation in rituals. Her dark clothing is replaced by traditional Härga attire, culminating in a full dress and flower wreath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. She takes hallucinogens in a shared, ritualized motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>, eventually joining the Maypole dance, where she smiles for the first time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.

The pivotal moment occurs after Dani witnesses Christian's infidelity. She cries uncontrollably, just as she did after her family's death, but this time, a group of Härga women cry in tandem with her, sharing her emotional burden and providing complete empathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. This collective expression of grief is a stark contrast to the isolation she experienced before. Dani's integration into the cult is also mirrored by her "increased immersion into nature" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>, culminating in her being covered in bright blossoms as May Queen, symbolizing her surrender to this agrarian society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. Her final act of choosing Christian for sacrifice, and smiling as he burns, signifies her complete allegiance to the Härga and her freedom to start anew in a [[themes_of_community_and_belonging_in_midsommar | community]] where she feels she belongs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.

## The Value of Ritual

[[analysis_of_ari_asters_midsommar | Aster]]'s [[analysis_of_ari_asters_midsommar | Midsommar]] both plays into and subverts modern secular aversion to mystical traditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. While the rituals are depicted as horrific, they serve a "very rational purpose: to build [[themes_of_community_and_belonging_in_midsommar | community]] and a sense of [[themes_of_community_and_belonging_in_midsommar | belonging]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. The film suggests that while modern society may find such acts primitive, they offer something Dani desperately lacked: complete acceptance, genuine reciprocity, and total empathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>. Thus, [[analysis_of_ari_asters_midsommar | Midsommar]] is a "shocking reassertion of the value of ritual" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>, presenting a compelling argument for their profound role in human connection, even if the methods are unsettling.

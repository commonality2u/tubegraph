The popular animated series *Rick and Morty* sparks a common question: Is brilliant scientist Rick Sanchez destined to be miserable because of his intelligence, and conversely, is it better to be like the less intelligent Jerry? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>

Nineteenth-century author Fyodor Dostoevsky once stated in *The Idiot*, “It is better to be unhappy and know the worst, than to be happy in a fool’s paradise.” <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a> This sentiment seems to capture the dynamic between Rick's despondency, driven by his knowledge that "nothing matters," and Jerry's often oblivious happiness in what could be termed a "fool's paradise." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>

## The Tortured Genius Stereotype

The stereotype of the tortured genius is prevalent in pop culture, making one wonder if it's an overblown concept. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a> The media often highlights the connection between brilliance and madness, almost implying that depression is a prerequisite for success. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a> However, many brilliant individuals do not suffer from mental illness and live "normal" lives. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>

### Intelligence and Mental Health: A Complex Relationship

Some studies suggest a correlation between high intelligence and a predisposition to certain mental health issues. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>

In 2017, Dr. Ruth Karpinski conducted a study where 3,700 Mensa members were asked about their mental health. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a> More than a third reported experiencing depression, which is five times the national average. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a> This means that for every 100 Mensa members, over 30 might be depressed, compared to 6-7 "regular" people. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>

However, this study had caveats: <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>
*   Participants self-reported their well-being. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>
*   Approximately 10% of those reporting depression had not received a formal diagnosis from a doctor. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>
*   Mensa members may not be representative of all intelligent people. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>

Despite these points, there might be a biological basis for why highly intelligent people are prone to depression. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a> Karpinski proposed that individuals with IQs of 130-plus possess "hyper brains," allowing them to comprehend the world's problems, uncertainties, and possibilities more easily. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>

This "hyper brain" concept is rooted in the work of psychiatrist Dr. Kazimierz Dabrowski, who observed that his exceptionally smart patients tended to over-contemplate everything, particularly negative aspects. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a> They also appeared to experience deeper depression compared to intellectually average individuals. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a> Dabrowski called these traits "overexcitability," viewing them as predictive of one's potential to achieve their ideal self. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a> He stated, “One who manifests several forms of overexcitability sees reality in a different, stronger and more excitable manner.” <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>

Dabrowski identified five types of overexcitability: <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>
*   Excessive energy or nervousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>
*   Deep appreciation for things like art or music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>
*   Extreme curiosity or an active mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>
*   A vivid imagination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>
*   Extreme and complex emotional experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>

Rick Sanchez exemplifies all these traits. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>

### [[existential_depression_and_intelligence | Existential Depression]]

Some psychologists suggest that people who think with "hyper brains" are more prone to [[existential_depression_and_intelligence | existential depression]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a> This involves feelings of hopelessness stemming from the belief that life is ultimately meaningless. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a> Dr. James Webb, who studies gifted children, notes that while it can affect anyone after a crisis, [[existential_depression_and_intelligence | existential depression]] is more likely to occur spontaneously in people with above-average intelligence. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a> Rick often demonstrates this, expressing a sense of futility and boredom despite his vast power. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>

## Intelligence, Wealth, and Happiness

While some studies suggest a link between intelligence and depression, others indicate that intelligence can unlock opportunities that lead to a healthier and sometimes happier life, particularly through increased wealth. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>

Many studies on IQ and depression highlight that higher intelligence correlates with greater wealth and, consequently, better health. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a> However, it can be difficult to determine causation, as criticisms of IQ tests include the observation that children from affluent families are more likely to be tested in the first place. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>

Despite this, the link between achievement, money, and intelligence challenges the idea that genius inherently leads to misery. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a> Some studies have even found that a higher IQ is associated with greater happiness. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a> For instance, a UK study of over 6,800 people found a positive correlation between IQ and self-reported happiness. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>

## Social Isolation and the "Crisis of Self"

High intelligence can often be accompanied by eccentricity, as exemplified by Rick Sanchez. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a> Some researchers believe this intensity is a hallmark of high IQ individuals. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a> However, these eccentricities can be off-putting to "normal-minded" people, leading to social isolation. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a> The effort to conform and minimize intensity can result in a "crisis of self," where individuals feel lost and confused about their true identity. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a> Rick is often in a perpetual crisis of self, constantly an oddball on Earth who must compromise his nature for his family. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>

In contrast, Jerry, while not an eccentric genius, also struggles with fitting in due to his lack of social and survival skills. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a> Rick highlights that Jerry often relies on pity to survive, whereas Rick leverages his knowledge and intimidation. <a class="yt=" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>

## Conclusion

The question of whether it's better to "know the worst and be unhappy" (like Rick) or be "happy in a fool’s paradise" (like Jerry) is subjective, and psychology does not offer a definitive answer. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>

However, the limited evidence suggests that while one might be less prone to [[existential_depression_and_intelligence | existential depression]] as a "Jerry," one is more likely to live a better life overall as a "Rick." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a> This highlights the complex [[impact_of_intelligence_on_mental_health | impact of intelligence on mental health]] and overall well-being.

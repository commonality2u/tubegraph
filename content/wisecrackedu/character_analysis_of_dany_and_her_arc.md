Dany's character arc in the film *Midsommar* showcases a profound transformation from a state of emotional isolation and trauma to one of belonging and communal catharsis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35:05">[07:35:05]</a>.

## Dany's Initial State: Isolation and Trauma

At the beginning of the film, Dany is depicted as firmly "ensconced in a cold, alienating secular society" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:40:53">[07:40:53]</a>, characterized by "icy, lonely city streets" and "muted" colors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46:17">[07:46:17]</a>. Following the horrific loss of her entire family, she receives little comfort from those around her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:58">[07:50:58]</a>. Her boyfriend, Christian, only remains with her out of guilt and to appear like a good person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:12">[01:04:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:19">[07:54:19]</a>. This environment is "absent of community and emotional support" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58:39">[07:58:39]</a>.

Dany's detachment is visually emphasized; she is often shown alone in her house, with phone calls being her primary mode of communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:01">[08:01:01]</a>. During a phone call with Christian, the camera remains squarely on her face without a cut to him, implying he is "not fully present" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:07:07">[08:07:07]</a>. Conversations reflected in mirrors further suggest that people are not genuinely connecting, instead presenting "superficial public face[s]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:20:06">[08:20:06]</a>. Christian constantly tries to avoid her, forgets her birthday, and pressures her to take hallucinogens despite her history of panic attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:28:13">[08:28:13]</a>. It becomes clear that what Dany is lacking is "love, empathy, and community" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:56:06">[08:56:06]</a>.

## Transformation Within the Hårga Community

Upon arriving at the Hårga commune, Dany is initially "extremely wary and frightened" of their rituals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:04:22">[09:04:22]</a>. However, she is gradually "seduced by the warmth of their community" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:08:44">[09:08:44]</a>, along with the influence of hallucinogens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:10:39">[09:10:39]</a>. The Hårga's unity is striking; they "move in tandem as if they’re all dancing to the same piece of choreography" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:13:30">[09:13:30]</a>, behaving "like different parts of the same organism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:18:29">[09:18:29]</a>. This concept of "shared catharsis, both in pain and pleasure, is present throughout the film" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:21:49">[09:21:49]</a>. For instance, when an elder survives a leap from a cliff, the tribe moans in unison, sharing the collective pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:25:34">[09:25:34]</a>. Similarly, women moan in unison with Maya during Christian's sex ritual, "as if sharing her pleasure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:39:10">[09:39:10]</a>. As director Ari Aster states, their language is "empathy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>.

An elder woman's explanation that "life is a circle, a recycle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:14:03">[10:14:03]</a> becomes particularly appealing to Dany, who has recently lost her entire family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:21:47">[10:21:47]</a>. Her increasing immersion into the Hårga culture is mirrored by changes in her attire, transitioning from "dark, real-world clothing to an apron, and eventually a full dress and flower wreath" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:37:12">[10:37:12]</a>. During the maypole dance, she takes hallucinogens in a ritualized manner, sharing the experience with the Hårga women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:46:27">[10:46:27]</a>. Despite being "slightly off rhythm," she is drawn into the dance, and the "dizzying experience is the first time we see her truly smile" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:55:00">[10:55:00]</a>, signifying her integration into the "singular Hårga organism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:03:00">[11:03:00]</a>.

The most pivotal moment occurs after Dany witnesses Christian's sex ritual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:08:00">[11:08:00]</a>. She bursts into "uncontrollable tears" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:13:00">[11:13:00]</a>, echoing her earlier grief, but this time, "a group of Hårga women... cry in tandem with her, as if sharing her emotional load and completely empathizing with her pain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:18:00">[11:18:00]</a>.

Dany's growing "inculcation into the cult is mirrored by her increased immersion into nature" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:28:00">[11:28:00]</a>. This is initially depicted psychedelically, with her hallucinating her hands and feet growing grass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:34:00">[11:34:00]</a>. As May Queen, she becomes increasingly adorned with flowers, culminating in a "gown and crown of bright blossoms" that almost entirely engulf her, symbolizing her "surrender to nature and this agrarian society" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:40:00">[11:40:00]</a>.

## Conclusion of the Arc: A New Beginning

Dany's newfound fidelity to the Hårga society is solidified when she chooses Christian as the ninth sacrifice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:55:00">[11:55:00]</a>. As she observes the burning, she experiences both pain and, like the Hårga, "joy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:02:00">[12:02:00]</a>. She is witnessing the "vestiges of her former life crumble" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:08:00">[12:08:00]</a> and "can't help but smile as she is free to start anew in a community where she can belong and be seen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:10:00">[12:10:00]</a>. This conclusion, while "creepy as hell," makes for "pretty great cinema" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:16:00">[12:16:00]</a>.

The animated series *Rick and Morty* frequently explores themes of [[philosophical_themes_in_rick_and_morty | philosophical themes]] and [[rick_and_morty_story_structure | story structure]], often deconstructing traditional narrative tropes. One notable example of its unique approach to character development is seen in Season 3, Episode 6, "Rest and Ricklaxation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This episode addresses character development in a way that is both satisfying and the opposite of what is typically seen in regular television <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Anti-Character Development

A clever aspect of "Rest and Ricklaxation" is its use of "anti-character development" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Series co-creator Dan Harmon adheres strictly to his version of Joseph Campbell's "The Hero's Journey" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. A relevant part of this structure is when protagonists confront their "shadow"â€”a dark reflection of themselves they must overcome, similar to Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. Traditionally, overcoming this shadow leads to the hero gaining new insight, such as Logan sacrificing himself to overcome selfishness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a> or Luke Skywalker sparing Darth Vader to overcome temptation towards the Dark Side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

"Rest and Ricklaxation" employs this structure, with Toxic Morty and Toxic Rick serving as literal "shadow" versions of their healthy selves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. However, instead of overcoming their toxic personality traits, the episode is a journey for Rick and Morty to reunite with their worst selves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

*   **Healthy Morty** is portrayed as a smooth operator with many friends who ultimately needs to rediscover his self-loathing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
*   **Healthy Rick** appears as a thoughtful super-genius who needs to rediscover his narcissism and irrational care for Morty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

This "anti-character development" suggests that the "regular" kind of character development can be "pretty creepy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

## Commentary on Mental Health

The "anti-character development" in the episode serves as a commentary on mental health in society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. "Rest and Ricklaxation" questions what it truly means to be mentally healthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. The episode parodies certain "healthy" attitudes promoted by self-help gurus and popular media, particularly the idea of eliminating all unpleasant or painful thoughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

Many "Insta-llectuals" advocate for uncritically loving oneself, saying yes to everything, and believing in oneself without question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. *Rick and Morty* demonstrates that fully embodying these ideals can make an individual seem like a "coked-out weirdo" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

### Compulsory Happiness and Self-Help

The show touches on sociologist William Davies' concept of "compulsory happiness," as discussed in his book *The Happiness Industry* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. Davies suggests that in the modern world, there's an alliance between corporations, managers, and advertisers promoting a definition of mental health that serves capitalist society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. This type of happiness involves cheerfully accepting the status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a> and requires constant self-improvement to be a "better consumer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

Healthy Morty exemplifies this, spouting platitudes seemingly from a self-help book and demanding others adopt his new lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. When confronted with real problems, his response is to dismiss them as "unhealthy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

The problem with this self-help philosophy, according to the episode, is that many things it aims to erase, like self-doubt and sadness, are important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. For Morty, self-doubt prevents him from becoming a "full-on sociopath" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. Healthy Morty indeed becomes a sociopathic stockbroker, akin to a "Wall Street fat cat with too much self-esteem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

## The Return to Authenticity

Rick realizes that some "less desirable" parts of ourselves, despite causing pain, are essential to being truly healthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. Jessica's reaction upon Morty's return, "Good to have you back," suggests that Morty's authentic, self-hating self is, in fact, his better self <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

### Perceived Inconsistency

Despite the powerful message, a minor complaint noted about the episode is a perceived inconsistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. While the "toxic" parts are purged based on subjective definitions of toxicity, Healthy Rick states he's proud to be Morty's grandpa, yet later claims his attachment to Morty is irrational and toxic, allowing him to be nonchalant about Morty's potential demise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. This raises a question about whether Rick's love for Morty is toxic or healthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. This complex [[character_analysis_of_rick_and_jerry_from_rick_and_morty | character analysis of Rick and Jerry from Rick and Morty]] is a recurring theme.

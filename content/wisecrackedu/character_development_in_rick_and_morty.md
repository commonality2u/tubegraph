While many stories, particularly films, focus on [[rick_and_morty_story_structure | character development]] and transformation, television series often aim to preserve the status quo to encourage continued viewership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>. Showrunners Dan Harmon and Justin Roiland masterfully employ this television-specific [[rick_and_morty_story_structure | story structure]] in *Rick and Morty* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>.

## Dan Harmon's Story Circle and Television
Dan Harmon's "story embryo" for narratives, applicable from *The Odyssey* to a simple joke, outlines an 8-step journey for a character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>:
1.  A character is in a zone of comfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.
2.  They want something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.
3.  They enter an unfamiliar situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>.
4.  Adapt to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>.
5.  Get what they wanted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>.
6.  Pay a heavy price for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>.
7.  Then return to their familiar situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>.
8.  Having changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>.

However, this structure adapts for television <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>. While a movie aims to provide a temporary high, television seeks to keep viewers watching indefinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>. This means television shows prioritize preserving the status quo over significant [[character_development_and_anticharacter_development_in_rick_and_morty | change]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>. Harmon notes that television "swaps out any meaningful and therefore potentially television-subverting truth with the basic, eternal 'truth' that [[character_development_and_anticharacter_development_in_rick_and_morty | change]] is unnecessary" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.

The adjusted 8-step structure for a TV episode reflects this:
1.  "I (the protagonist)" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>
2.  "Notice a small problem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>.
3.  "And make a major decision" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>.
4.  "This changes things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>.
5.  "To some satisfaction, but" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>.
6.  "There are consequences" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>.
7.  "That must be undone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>.
8.  "And I must admit the futility of [[character_development_and_anticharacter_development_in_rick_and_morty | change]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>.

## Futility of Change in *Rick and Morty*
Every [[rick_and_morty_episode_analysis | episode of Rick and Morty]] adheres to this format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>. This means that while characters may face new situations, their internal state often remains unchanged.

### Rick Sanchez and the Status Quo
*Rick and Morty* exemplifies the principle of preserving the status quo, particularly through the character of Rick Sanchez:
*   **Adaptation vs. Internal Change** In the traditional story circle, Step 4 ("Adapt to it") involves characters confronting their neuroses and psychological baggage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>. However, in television, this stage is "much less about internal change and more about external change" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:45:00">[06:45:00]</a>. Rick rarely experiences true internal transformation.
*   **Lack of Self-Correction** In "The Ricks Must Be Crazy" (Season 2, Episode 6), Rick encounters Zeep Xanflorp, a scientist who is essentially a "carbon copy" of Rick himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:58:00">[06:58:00]</a>. Zeep's actions mirror Rick's hypocrisy, leading to a situation where a "normal character" would "own up to their own hypocrisy and begin to change" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a>. Yet, Rick does not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:00">[07:23:00]</a>. Instead, he shamelessly parrots the same objections Morty had made to him earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:24:00">[07:24:00]</a>.
*   **Awareness Without Desire for Change** The "beauty" of *Rick and Morty* lies in Rick's complete awareness of his shortcomings coupled with his "no desire to fix them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:10:00">[12:10:00]</a>. The episode "The Ricks Must Be Crazy" draws parallels between Rick and Zeep, making them equally problematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:17:00">[12:17:00]</a>. The final confrontation is not Rick battling his "demons in attempt to change" but "just Rick fighting Rick" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:36:00">[12:36:00]</a>.
*   **The Futility of Fulfillment** Step 8 ("Change or the futility of it") typically sees the hero reaching fulfillment and integrating new skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:59:00">[12:59:00]</a>. However, for television, "The hero can never be fulfilled" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:16:00">[13:16:00]</a> to ensure continued desire for adventure and story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:18:00">[13:18:00]</a>. The episode concludes with Rick re-enslaving an entire planet for his car battery, all to get ice cream, fully embracing the "futility of [[character_development_and_anticharacter_development_in_rick_and_morty | change]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:40:00">[13:40:00]</a>. Morty and Summer are left "shellshocked by the normalcy of the situation after all theyâ€™ve been through" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:44:00">[13:44:00]</a>.

While *Rick and Morty* parodies pop culture and plays with audience expectations, its core [[rick_and_morty_story_structure | structure]] aligns with other TV shows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:51:00">[13:51:00]</a>. However, it uses this circular structure to highlight the "depressing, crippling futility of [[character_development_and_anticharacter_development_in_rick_and_morty | change]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:13:00">[14:13:00]</a>.

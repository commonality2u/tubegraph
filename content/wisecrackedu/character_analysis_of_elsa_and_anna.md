*Frozen*, an Academy Award-winning film, features the central characters of sisters Elsa and Anna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>, whose relationship and individual journeys form the core of the narrative. The film explores [[themes_of_love_and_independence_in_frozen | themes of love and independence]], as well as [[symbolism_of_ice_and_fire_in_frozen | symbolism of ice and fire]], through their character arcs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

## Elsa

Elsa is presented as a princess afflicted with a "rare, human condition called 'unexplained mutant ice powers'" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Her powers lead to an accidental "brain-freeze" for her younger sister, Anna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Fearing that Anna's subsequent lobotomy might be "contagious," Elsa retreats into her room for a decade, exclaiming, "Don't touch me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. After her parents' death, she assumes the throne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

Her character is strongly associated with [[symbolism_of_ice_and_fire_in_frozen | ice]], representing a "cold and rational" demeanor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. Elsa believes the solution to life's challenges is to "inhibit her feelings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>, leading her to isolate herself. Following an argument with Anna, Elsa runs away and constructs an ice castle, inadvertently plunging the land into eternal winter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. During her self-imposed exile, she sheds her traditional attire for a "revealing, skin-tight, transparent dress," which is suggested to signify "liberation, perhaps even sexual liberation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

Initially, Elsa expresses a desire for solitude, as seen in her intention to "Turn away and slam the door!" to solicitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. However, her true fulfillment and happiness emerge "only by embracing the love of her sister" and experiencing "social solidarity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. She ultimately realizes the "power of love," enabling her to reverse the winter and restore balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. The film concludes with Elsa embracing "open gates," signifying a commitment to never closing them again and no longer shutting out her sister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

## Anna

Anna is introduced as Elsa's younger sister, who suffers a "brain-freeze" due to Elsa's powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a> and subsequently undergoes a "lobotomy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. Her childhood is marked by an "uneventful" and isolated existence with Elsa, separated by a door <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

Anna is characterized by her warmth and passion, symbolized by her association with [[symbolism_of_ice_and_fire_in_frozen | fire]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. She has "fiery red hair and freckles" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a> and uses fire as a weapon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. Her initial impulsiveness is evident when she decides to marry Prince Hans after only two conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>, an act Elsa immediately objects to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. When Hans reveals his true intentions, he "extinguishes a fire," symbolizing the end of Anna's passion for him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

Anna's heart is "frozen with a capital 'F'" by Elsa's magic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>, and it can only be thawed by an "act of true love" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. Despite a suggestion to "kiss Kristoff," Anna ultimately performs an "act of true love" for Elsa when her sister is in trouble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. This highlights the film's progressive message that "redemption arrives in the form of sisterly love, rather than that of a charming prince" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. The concept of "love at first sight" is shown to be "trivial and misguided" through her experience with Hans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>, and she and Kristoff "take it slow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. Anna's persistent desire for connection is encapsulated by her plea, "Please don't slam the door" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>, reflecting the film's emphasis that "all people require connection" and that "a solitary person is considered incomplete" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

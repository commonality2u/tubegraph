*Frozen* is presented as a musical exploring the dueling properties of ice and fire, which manifest in its two central characters: Elsa and Anna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

## Elsa

Elsa is a princess afflicted with a "rare, human condition" of "unexplained mutant ice powers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. After accidentally giving her younger sister, Anna, a "brain-freeze," Elsa fears her powers are contagious, leading her to hide in her room for a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This isolation is further solidified when her parents die, leaving her to become queen after three years of inaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

Elsa is strongly associated with ice, embodying coldness and rationality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. She believes the solution to life's challenges is to suppress her feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. Her flight from the kingdom after refusing Anna's marriage to Hans results in her constructing an ice castle and casting the land in eternal winter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

Her transformation into a "revealing, skin-tight, transparent dress" suggests liberation, possibly even [[societal_and_cultural_messages_in_frozen | sexual liberation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. However, it is only through embracing the love of her sister that Elsa finds "real fulfillment" and happiness, emphasizing the importance of social solidarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. This realization of "the power of love" enables her to reverse the winter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

## Anna

Anna is presented as a character embodying warmth and passion, symbolized by her association with fire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. She has "fiery red hair" and "sunspots" (freckles) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. Her initial impulsiveness is seen in her decision to marry Prince Hans after only "two conversations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. This quick engagement is later proven misguided when Hans reveals his true intentions to seize the throne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

When Elsa accidentally zaps Anna, freezing her heart, the condition can only be thawed by an "act of true love" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. Despite being encouraged by Olaf to kiss Kristoff as an "act of true love," Anna instead performs it on Elsa when her sister is in trouble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

## Sisterly Relationship and Themes

The film's narrative strongly emphasizes the bond between the sisters. Their childhood is marked by a door separating them, symbolizing Elsa's self-imposed isolation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. This [[symbolism_of_doors_in_frozen | motif of doors]] and gates runs throughout the film, culminating in the line, "We're never closing them again," signifying Elsa's commitment to no longer shut Anna out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

*Frozen* is progressive in that the heroes' "redemption arrives in the form of sisterly love, rather than that of a charming prince" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. The adage of "love at first sight" is critiqued and proven "trivial and misguided" through Anna's courtship with Hans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. Even with Kristoff, there is no definitive wedding, as they "take it slow," challenging typical Disney relationship portrayals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. This aligns with a broader [[critique_of_disneys_portrayal_of_relationships | critique of Disney's portrayal of relationships]].

The movie suggests that "independence is a mistake," reinforcing a "mob mentality" that "all people require connection" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. A solitary person is considered incomplete and in need of "fixing," with the medical staff stating, "We need each other to fix us up and round us out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. This highlights the [[societal_and_cultural_messages_in_frozen | societal and cultural messages in Frozen]] about the necessity of human connection.

From: [[wisecrackedu]] <br/> 

In *Rick and Morty*'s third season, the series prominently features [[the_concept_of_meaninglessness_in_rick_and_morty | meaninglessness]] as a central theme. The show consistently highlights that existence is devoid of inherent purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This perspective is articulated through statements like "Nothing you think matters matters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, and the idea that personal experiences are not special due to their infinite repetition across infinite realities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Authentic moments of love or emotion are frequently introduced only to be "ripped right out from under us" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

### The Challenge of Character Growth

This pervasive [[nihilism_and_cosmic_pessimism_in_rick_and_morty | nihilism]] presents a unique challenge for character development: how can characters grow when there is no meaning? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a> The show offers a novel solution that goes beyond simply spiraling deeper into despair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This growth is primarily observed not in the titular protagonist, Rick, but in the matriarch of the Smith family, Beth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

### Beth's Existential Journey in "The Rickchurian Mortydate"

In the Season 3 finale, "The Rickchurian Mortydate," while Rick and Morty engage in a conflict with the President <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>, the more significant subplot involves Beth's personal struggle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Beth grapples with the question of whether she accepted Rick's offer to be replaced by a clone, leading her to doubt her own identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

Beth's intelligence often leads her to a "Rick-like disillusionment-causing intelligence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. Rick's counsel to her regarding her intelligence and the [[the_concept_of_meaninglessness_in_rick_and_morty | meaninglessness]] of the universe is:
> "Am I evil? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a> Worse. You’re smart. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a> When you know nothing matters the universe is yours and I’ve never met a universe that was into it." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>

Rick's general advice is "Don't think about it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. Faced with this overwhelming reality, Beth is presented with "radical freedom to choose her destiny" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. This freedom is meant to bring her solace regardless of whether she chooses to stay with or leave her family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

The episode suggests Beth chooses to stay with her family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a> and finds a newfound sense of happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. She appears to be a better mother and rekindles her love for Jerry, bringing the family back together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

### Amor Fati: A Cure for Nihilism

To explain Beth's paradigm shift and her reconnection with Jerry, the concept of "Amor Fati" is introduced as a "cure for common [[nihilism_and_cosmic_pessimism_in_rick_and_morty | nihilism]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

Amor Fati, a Latin phrase used by Friedrich Nietzsche, means "Love of Fate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. It is about the affirmation of life and being a "Yes-Sayer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. This concept is linked to Nietzsche's thought experiment of "Eternal Recurrence," which posits the idea of infinitely reliving one's entire life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. To "want to relive everything that’s happened in your life for eternity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>, including the good and the bad, is considered the ultimate affirmation of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. This idea forms part of Nietzsche's strategy to escape the "crushing [[cosmic_nihilism_and_its_depiction_in_rick_and_morty | nihilism]] of existence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

Beth's experience in the episode mirrors this. Worried she might be a clone, she is forced to confront and question her past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. She relives a part of her past with Jerry, recreating one of their first dates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. While she may have previously disliked aspects of her life, including that date, this time she embodies the "Nietzschean Yes-Sayer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. Amor Fati does not imply rewriting the past or believing "everything is a blessing in disguise," but rather embracing "the ugly aspects of our lives" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. Beth acknowledges she is no longer the woman Jerry married <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>, but finds value in the "simplicity" that Jerry offers, which may be what she needs after a family history of using intelligence to justify sickness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

Another "amor fati-esque moment" occurs when Beth believes Rick has come to "retire" her, a functional acceptance that even if a version of her chose to leave, she embraces remaining with her family instead of dwelling on what might have been <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. Despite the existence of infinite universes and choices, she desires to stay in this one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

### Knowing Oneself and Nietzschean Philosophy

Nietzsche also wrote about the "impossible task of 'knowing oneself'" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. Beth overtly expresses this struggle, asking, "Who am I? What do I do?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a> For Nietzsche, the underlying logic for human actions is "impenetrable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. This applies to Rick, whose true motivations are rarely clear to the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. Regardless of whether Beth was cloned or if any of her choices matter in infinite versions of herself, Nietzsche would argue it "really doesn't matter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>; the only imperative is to "love our fate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. This appears to be the choice Beth makes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

### Rick vs. Beth: The Ubermensch

While Rick is often portrayed as a [[nietzschean_philosophy_and_its_application_in_rick_and_morty | Nietzschean ubermensch]], warring with the [[the_concept_of_meaninglessness_in_rick_and_morty | meaningless]] cosmos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>, his actions often manifest as self-destructive "dicking around" rather than the creation of new meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. In contrast, Beth, when confronted with the [[the_concept_of_meaninglessness_in_rick_and_morty | meaninglessness]] of the cosmos, finds happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. This ability to find contentment within meaninglessness is deemed more "ubermenschy" than Rick's approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

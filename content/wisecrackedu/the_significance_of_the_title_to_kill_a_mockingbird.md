The title of Harper Lee's novel, *To Kill a Mockingbird*, holds significant symbolic weight, representing the destruction of innocence and the harm caused to those who are blameless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

## The Symbolism of the Mockingbird

The true meaning of the title is elaborated upon in a quote from page 90 of the book <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. A mockingbird is depicted as a creature that only provides enjoyment through its "next level beats" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. Therefore, "only a jive-ass fool would pop a cap in a mockingbird" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>, as they do no harm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

## Application in the Narrative

The concept of "killing a mockingbird" applies directly to two key characters in the [[summary_of_to_kill_a_mockingbird | summary of To Kill a Mockingbird]]:

### Boo Radley
When Boo Radley saves [[character_analysis_of_scout_jem_and_dill | Scout]] and [[character_analysis_of_scout_jem_and_dill | Jem]] from Bob Ewell, he kills Ewell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. The town authorities decide to rule Ewell's death as an accident, stating he "fell on his knife" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Boo Radley "gets off Scott free" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. This decision is justified by [[character_analysis_of_scout_jem_and_dill | Scout]]'s understanding that "icing him" (Boo Radley) "would be like 'Shootin' a mockingbird'" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Reporting Boo Radley for the killing would do no good and would only remove "one more true blue playa" from the neighborhood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

### Tom Robinson
The conviction of Tom Robinson for a crime he did not commit serves as another instance of "popping another mockin' bird" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. Tom Robinson was an innocent man accused of rape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>, and despite evidence proving his innocence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>, he was convicted "cuz' he black" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. This tragic event highlights the unjust targeting of a harmless individual.

> [!NOTE] The novel is a direct criticism of the South during the Depression, particularly the "crooked ass crackas" running the courts, schools, and churches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. The title underscores the theme of injustice against innocent individuals within such a society.

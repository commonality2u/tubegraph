*The Catcher in the Rye* by J.D. Salinger tells the story of [[holdens_struggle_with_adulthood_and_society | Holden Caulfield]], a 16-year-old white boy, as he recounts the events that led to his confinement in a mental hospital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. His narrative offers a deep dive into his struggles with authenticity, society, and his own mental state.

## Initial Disillusionment and Departure
Holden's journey begins around Christmas when he is expelled from his "prissy private school" for failing all his classes, except English <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. His old teacher, Spencer, advises him to "get his sh#% together" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. After a physical altercation with his roommate Stradlater, who was "mackin" a girl Holden knew, Holden leaves his school and heads to New York City <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## Encounters in New York City
In New York, Holden checks into the Edmont Hotel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. He admits to the reader that he has never had sexual intercourse, despite claiming to always be "swimmin in trim" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. He decides to hire a sex worker named Sunny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. However, when Sunny arrives, Holden hesitates, stating he only wants to talk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. A dispute over money ensues, leading to Sunny's pimp, Maurice, assaulting Holden and taking his money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. These interactions highlight his [[exploration_of_hedonism_and_disillusionment | disillusionment]] and inability to connect authentically with others, even in seemingly straightforward encounters.

## The Catcher in the Rye Ideal
Holden eventually decides to visit his younger sister, Phoebe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. Phoebe asks him what he wants to be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. Holden reveals his vision of being a "catcher in the rye" â€“ standing in a large field of rye full of children, catching any "little homies who bout to fall off" a cliff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. This aspiration represents his desire to protect innocence from the "bent-ass shit of adulthood" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. His strong connection with [[the_role_of_phoebe_and_holdens_connection_with_children | Phoebe]] is evident, as she is described as the only one he can "keep it real with" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

## Further Isolation and Breakdown
After his parents return home, Holden slips out to meet his old teacher, Mr. Antolini <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. Holden leaves abruptly when he suspects Mr. Antolini of inappropriately touching him while he slept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. At this point, Holden is on the verge of "straight los[ing] his sh**" and decides to leave town <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. Phoebe expresses a desire to join him, but he refuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. After Phoebe's strong reaction, Holden apologizes and takes her to the zoo, finding enjoyment in watching her on the carousel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

## Holden's Mental State and Struggle
Holden seeks "stability and acceptance in a broken society" filled with "fakin" people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. His failure to find this leads him to "buck the system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. [[symbolism_in_the_catcher_in_the_rye | Symbolism]] plays a significant role in conveying his internal state; his hunting hat, worn backward, signifies that his values are the reverse of societal norms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>, foreshadowing his role as the "Catcher in the Rye" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

His aversion to adulthood is also represented by his thoughts on the glass cases in the Museum, implying he doesn't want to join the "fake-ass adults" and wishes to "freeze time" like the figures behind the glass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. Holden possesses a "legit desire to search for beauty in human contact" but struggles to find it in a world he perceives as ugly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. This makes him "one of the loneliest playas in all of literature," because he "keeps it so real, while errybody else frontin'" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

Despite his harsh critiques, Holden admits to being "the most terrific liar you ever saw in your life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. He presents a tough exterior but possesses a gentle soul, evidenced by his concern for the ducks in Central Park when the water freezes over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. Ultimately, Holden "pays the price for bein too soft in a world twisted by deceit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>, ending up in a psych ward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

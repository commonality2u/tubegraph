## South Park's Narrative Evolution
For three seasons, *South Park* departed from its usual standalone episodes to embrace season-long serialization, which has been largely successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Season 19 effectively wove together themes of PC culture, advertising, and gentrification across multiple episodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. However, Season 20, which premiered with an even more ambitious [[Narrative structure and the golden rule in storytelling | storyline]] involving the presidential election, "member berries," and internet trolling, ultimately "fizzled out into confusion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## South Park's "Golden Rule" of Storytelling
The "secret sauce" behind *South Park*'s effective writing is a "strict order to the madness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>, governed by a rigid plotline rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

The rule states that if the words "and then" can be placed between the beats of a [[Narrative structure and the golden rule in storytelling | story outline]], the [[Narrative structure and the golden rule in storytelling | narrative]] is flawed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. Good *South Park*-approved writing replaces "and thens" with "buts" or "therefores" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

### "And Then" Example
A poor [[Narrative structure and the golden rule in storytelling | storyline]] lacking [[Narrative structure and the golden rule in storytelling | cause and effect]] can be illustrated with "stick figure John":
> "John adopts a stray dog, and then John wins the lottery, and then John becomes a Scientologist." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>
This [[Narrative structure and the golden rule in storytelling | story]] has a "sucky [[Narrative structure and the golden rule in storytelling | narrative]]" because the actions are random and lack consequences, meaning they could be rearranged without altering the overall plot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

### "But" or "Therefore" Example
In contrast, *South Park*'s "Mormon episode" exemplifies the "buts or therefores" rule:
> "An annoyingly perfect Mormon kid moves to town, therefore he pisses everyone off, therefore Stan decides to kick his ass. But the kid is so nice, that he tell Stan to go ahead and beat him up. Therefore Stan doesn't beat him up. Instead, he agrees to go to the kids house for dinner." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>
Each action beginning with "therefore" or "but" signifies a consequence or reaction to the preceding action, ensuring every plot point is significant and the show maintains momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

## How the US Election Impacted Season 20
The creators, Trey Parker and Matt Stone, expected Hillary Clinton to win the election and planned Season 20's [[Narrative structure and the golden rule in storytelling | storyline]] around that outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. The unexpected victory of Mr. Garrison (representing Donald Trump) forced last-minute rewrites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>, leading the show to break its core [[Narrative structure and the golden rule in storytelling | narrative]] rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

## Season 20 Plotlines Breaking the Golden Rule

### Member Berries Plotline
Initially, the member berries plot followed the "but/therefore" rule:
*   Randy tries member berries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>, therefore Randy realizes member berries are dangerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
*   Mr. Garrison realizes he has no plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>, therefore he tries to sabotage his campaign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
*   Voters demand an explanation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>, therefore Randy tells Garrison the truth about his popularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
*   Randy and Garrison set out to destroy member berries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>, but they won't die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.
*   Therefore, Randy convinces Garrison to give a speech denouncing nostalgia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

This established a clear setup for a Hillary Clinton victory, adhering to *South Park*'s [[Narrative structure and the golden rule in storytelling | golden rule of storytelling]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. However, after the unexpected election result, the plot became messy and reliant on "and thens" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>:
*   "And then Mr. Garrison wins anyway, out of nowhere" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
*   "And then Caitlin barfs, reinfecting Mr. Garrison and Randy with member berries" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
This resulted in "[[Narrative structure and the golden rule in storytelling | narrative]] backpedaling" as characters unlearned lessons about nostalgia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. The member berries' purpose became muddled, transforming from lazy, intoxicating fruits to a vomit-inducing virus, then appearing in a 1920s nightclub subplot, and finally being revealed as Nazi-like "member stormtroopers" allied with Vladimir Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. The show offered no justification for these transformations, instead presenting a "random progression of events that build without any apparent logic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

### Trolling Plotline
The trolling subplot, featuring Kyle's dad Gerald as "skankhunt42," also initially followed the rule:
*   Gerald's trolling angers the Danes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>, therefore the Danes threaten to release everyone's internet history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.
*   Hillary Clinton, confident of winning, finds out "troll trace" might leak her online activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>, therefore she needs to recruit Gerald <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

However, after Clinton lost the election, the [[Narrative structure and the golden rule in storytelling | narrative structure]] "start[ed] to crumble" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. Clinton confusingly recruits Gerald anyway, with a vague mission to infiltrate troll trace to protect U.S. secrets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. This scene felt "weird and disjointed" because it was likely recycled from the original "if Hillary had won" version of the episode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. In that version, a newly elected Hillary, fearing email exposure, would recruit Gerald, and he would agree to protect his own identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.

To salvage the plot in the "President Garrison" world, the show made Clinton's claim a ruse: she was helping the Danes kidnap American trolls to protect her emails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. This was followed by a series of confusing "and thens":
*   "And then turns out they're just trolling the American trolls they captured" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.
*   "And then this top Danish guy wasn't trying to punish the trolls, he's also just a giant troll trolling the world for the lulz" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.
*   "And also he's not even f**king Danish" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

These events lacked [[Narrative structure and the golden rule in storytelling | cause-and-effect]], resulting in a "random, increasingly complicated laundry list of plot points" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.

## Consequences of Breaking the Rule
The season concluded with "plot hari-kari" where the internet was "blown up" to resolve Cartman and Gerald's storyline about their internet history being revealed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. This act destroyed the season's [[Narrative structure and the golden rule in storytelling | cause-and-effect relationship]] and prevented a satisfying conclusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.

The show had successfully analyzed how the internet fragments public and private selves and enables anonymous bad behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. It also brilliantly satirized outrage cycles that drive internet culture, suggesting that simmering outrage could have been a more compelling explanation for Mr. Garrison's victory than member berries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. "Trevor's axiom," an equation for creating a massive internet reaction, was briefly mentioned as potentially explaining Garrison's election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.

## Lost Potential: Alternate Reality Season 20
Had Hillary Clinton won, *South Park*'s Season 20 would have likely focused on Bill Clinton settling into his role as the "terrified First Gentleman of the U.S." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>. This would have escalated the battle of the sexes already present at South Park Elementary, and given poignancy to Cartman's fear of his girlfriend Heidi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>. This storyline was largely abandoned due to the election outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.

## Future of *South Park*'s Narrative
The creators hinted at "the end of serialization as we know it" in the Season 20 finale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. While Season 20 was messy, earlier serialized seasons (18 and 19) featured some of the show's best work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.

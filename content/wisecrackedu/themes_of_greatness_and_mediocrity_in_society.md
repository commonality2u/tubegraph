*The Incredibles*, a Pixar film written and directed by Larry Bird, explores humanity's reaction to individuals who exhibit qualities of greatness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. The film is set fifteen years after superpowered humans (Supers) were forced into hiding by an "unstoppable foe" — lawyers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This premise allows for an examination of societal attitudes towards exceptionalism versus the desire for conformity.

The film delves into various [[philosophical_themes_and_societal_critiques_in_the_incredibles | philosophical themes and societal critiques]], particularly concerning the suppression of the exceptional and the celebration of the ordinary.

## The Suppression of Greatness

Supers are compelled to conceal and suppress their abilities to avoid persecution by a society of "inferior beings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. This societal pressure is articulated within the film:
> "Right now, honey, the world just wants us to fit in, and to fit in, we've just gotta be like everybody else." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>

This behavior illustrates what is referred to as German philosopher Freddy Nietzchmeister's concept of "herd morality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. This idea suggests that society "demonizes and inhibits the exceptional in favor of appeasing the basic bitches" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

## The Celebration of Mediocrity

*The Incredibles* highlights the frustration of exceptional individuals as society increasingly rewards non-achievements and insists that everyone is special <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
> "It's not a graduation — he is moving from the fourth grade to the fifth grade. They keep creating new ways to celebrate mediocrity, but if someone is genuinely exceptional—" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>
> "This is not about you, Bob." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>
> "Everyone's special, Dash." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>
> "Which is another way of saying no one is." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>

## Consequences of Forced Equality

Such enforced equality comes at a significant cost, imposing a "psychological toll" on exceptional individuals and ultimately harming society at large <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. An example of this is when young Buddy (later Syndrome), an ordinary person, interferes with Mr. Incredible's attempt to capture Bomb Voyage, allowing the culprit to escape and nearly causing a train full of "normies" to be killed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. This incident illustrates the film's point that "mediocrity gets in the way of excellence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

## Born Great vs. Manufactured Greatness

Buddy's transformation into Syndrome initially suggests that ordinary people can achieve greatness through "grit, determination," and effort, as he builds an empire of technological innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. However, this theory is quickly undermined as Syndrome's "manufactured greatness" is proven inferior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. The film argues that "one cannot aspire to greatness — one must be born with it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. It is the Incredibles, whose superpowers are natural and require "without the indignity of effort," who are truly capable of saving the day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.
> "You'll know what to do. It's in your blood." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>

## The Deservingness of Greatness

Ultimately, *The Incredibles* conveys the message that "great people deserve great things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. The Supers reclaim their "rightful place at the top of the societal food chain by virtue of their god-given gifts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. Examples of this include:
*   Dash being allowed to dominate his school athletic program, provided he subtly conceals his cheating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.
*   Violet receiving a new haircut and immediately being "propositioned by the dreamiest boy on campus" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

In stark contrast, Syndrome, who fought for equality in a world of superheroes, is ultimately murdered by the Incredibles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

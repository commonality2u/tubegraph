*South Park* Season 19 offers a [[social_critique_using_popular_media | social critique]] through its serialized narrative, commenting on America's current political climate and significant social changes [00:00:38]. A clever aspect of this season is its layered commentary, focusing not only on the modern social condition but also on the show itself [00:00:56]. The season explores how *South Park*'s signature vulgar sensibility might survive in a politically correct world, interpreting town changes as a meta-commentary on the show facing change [00:01:19].

## Neoliberalism as the Driving Force
The season connects advertising, PC culture, and gentrification through the concept of [[neoliberalism]] [00:03:02].

> [00:03:33] "In a nutshell, [[neoliberalism]] is an economic ideology that stresses personal freedoms and market solutions to address society’s problems."

Philosopher Henry Giroux outlines the tenets of [[neoliberalism]]:
*   Consumerism is the most important duty as a citizen [00:02:48].
*   Individual freedoms trump public freedoms [00:02:52].
*   All public social issues are addressed on a private level [00:02:54].

[[neoliberalism]] aims to make everything marketable [00:03:20]. This ideology connects to gentrification—the market's way of addressing "shitty neighborhoods" by selling overpriced goods without fixing underlying poverty [00:03:23].

## The Insidious Nature of Advertising
*South Park* Season 19 explicitly highlights how ads use PC culture for their own gain [00:04:10]. The show suggests that ads represent the "grossly inhuman forces of neoliberal capitalism," capable of assimilating or destroying everything, often operating behind the scenes and barely noticeably [00:04:15].

The presence of ads taking human form, such as Leslie and PC Principal, creates anxiety about whether friends, family, or even beloved TV shows are merely ads or sponsored content [00:04:20]. This raises the question of how individuals can discern their own ideas from those planted by clever commercials in a world permeated by advertising [00:04:42].

The danger of ads lies in their ability to "cover up the reality of the situation, to distract us" [00:04:48]. In a world dominated by ads, everything is reduced to marketable, packaged versions, including cultures and social acceptance, which become more of a brand than genuine tolerance [00:04:53].

## Cooptation and the Brand of Inclusion
[[neoliberalism]] excels at cooptation, a process of assimilating elements once outside the system to serve capitalism's needs [00:05:20]. Identities and diversity are absorbed, transforming multiculturalism into a "trendy brand to be purchased" [00:05:29].

For example, *South Park* depicts the town adopting "marks of tolerance" (e.g., having a Whole Foods, gay kids) to attract businesses and residents and appear progressive [00:05:44]. Whole Foods itself transcends being merely a place to buy organic food, becoming a symbol of lofty ideals bought into with every purchase [00:06:22]. This type of [[impact_of_branding_and_social_media_on_business | branding]] benefits both retailers and television [00:06:33].

The show makes it clear that the "spectacle of inclusion is good for business," as seen when characters like Craig and Tweek receive money for being perceived as gay [00:06:42]. This "spectacle of inclusion" becomes a commodity in the [[neoliberal]] economy, allowing consumers to feel righteous by "fork[ing] over some cash" [00:06:53].

## Advertising, PC Culture, and Narcissism
Slovenian theorist Slavoj Zizek posits that modern political systems can be more dangerous due to their pleasant facade [00:07:03]. Political correctness, in this view, becomes a form of self-discipline that doesn't truly overcome issues like racism or misogyny; instead, it acts as a "nice paint job over the same old discriminatory reality" [00:07:42].

In this new "progressive" world, individuals might spend hundreds at Whole Foods but feel good after donating a dollar to charity, allowing them to "wash [themselves] of the guilt with a token gesture of charity" [00:08:06]. Zizek argues that this "Whole Food style charity" represents a marriage between inaction and action, where change and rebellion become commodities [00:08:32]. Criticism is disarmed, allowing individuals to be "good neoliberal consumer[s]" while still feeling like they are fighting the system [00:08:45]. Zizek describes this as "inter-passivity," where change is sought "all the time so that, globally, things will remain the same" [00:08:58].

*South Park* targets this hypocrisy, showing the town's true feelings about the poor when homeless people surround Whole Foods [00:09:18]. Multiculturalism becomes a "badge to wear, to buy into, rather than a real political project" [00:09:30]. This leads to a meta-criticism: does token inclusion truly foster inclusivity, or is it a "shell of actual diversity that is meant to boost ratings rather than understand another culture?" [00:10:04] Ultimately, this display of tolerance often serves to make "white liberals feel good" rather than genuinely helping marginalized communities [00:10:17].

The show also links this phenomenon to narcissism. PC culture, for characters like Cartman, becomes a means to protect their ego [00:13:46]. Randy's charity morphs into giving iPads to children in developing countries, not to feed them, but to "protect the fragile egos of people like Randy" [00:13:19]. This "Whole Foods activism" is portrayed as being a "sell-out to the system while making meaningless gestures to protect your own sense of self-worth" [00:13:39].

The [[neoliberal]] emphasis on consumerism centered on the individual fuels mass self-obsession, creating a "cult of victimhood" [00:14:34]. For the show's PC crowd, the mistaken idea is that not being a victim of harassment means someone entertaining their "illusions of grandeur," leading to the privileged aspiring to victimhood [00:14:54].

## South Park's Self-Awareness
While *South Park* lampoons the "shallow versions" of PC culture propagated in mainstream media, it does not necessarily hate every aspect of it [00:15:22]. The creators, Matt Stone and Trey Parker, acknowledge their own privileged position, stating, "We're two privileged straight white boys who have theirs laughs about things we've never had to deal with" [00:15:42]. The show recognizes the difficulty of "not wanting to seem like a bigot while avoiding the trappings of phony inclusion" [00:15:59].

As a television show, *South Park* itself needs ads [00:16:33], highlighting the very system it critiques.

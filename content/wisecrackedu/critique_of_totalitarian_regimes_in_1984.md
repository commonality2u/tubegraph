George Orwell's novel, [[1984_summary_and_themes | "1984"]], offers a critique of totalitarian regimes, focusing on the control exerted by "The Party" and its leader, [[critique_of_government_and_propaganda_in_a_dystopian_setting | Big Brother]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. The book serves as a warning against the potential for humanity to become "soulless robots" if societal changes are not made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

## Methods of Control

### Surveillance and Punishment
[[critique_of_government_and_propaganda_in_a_dystopian_setting | Big Brother]] represents the pervasive surveillance keeping tabs on citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Dissent, such as expressing negative thoughts about [[critique_of_government_and_propaganda_in_a_dystopian_setting | Big Brother]], can lead to imprisonment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. The "Thought Police," secretly a part of [[critique_of_government_and_propaganda_in_a_dystopian_setting | Big Brother's]] crew, are instruments of this control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

### Psychological Manipulation and Torture
The regime aims to "realign" individuals with the [[critique_of_government_and_propaganda_in_a_dystopian_setting | Party's]] mentality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. This is achieved through brutal torture, compelling individuals like [[character_analysis_of_winston_smith | Winston Smith]] to admit to false crimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. The goal is to strip away individuality and fill the person with "[[critique_of_government_and_propaganda_in_a_dystopian_setting | Big Brotha]]-ly love" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Room 101 represents the ultimate torture, forcing victims to betray their deepest loyalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. Ultimately, [[character_analysis_of_winston_smith | Winston's]] soul is taken, leaving him only with love for [[critique_of_government_and_propaganda_in_a_dystopian_setting | Big Brother]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

### Doublethink
A core method of control is "doublethink," which involves holding two contradictory beliefs simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. This means consciously believing obvious falsehoods while simultaneously denying that they are lies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. The result is a conviction in nonsense as truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. As O'Brien's book states:
> "Doublethink goes on forever. With the lie always one step ahead of the truth." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>

### Reality Manipulation
Beyond surveillance, [[critique_of_government_and_propaganda_in_a_dystopian_setting | The Party]] manipulates reality itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. Unlike leaders who merely destroy truth, a truly totalitarian dictator must rebuild it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. This is exemplified by [[allegory_for_the_Soviet_Union_and_its_leaders | Stalin]], who rewrote history to align with his agenda, in contrast to Hitler who simply burned books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. Oceania, the setting of [[1984_summary_and_themes | "1984"]], reflects [[allegory_for_the_Soviet_Union_and_its_leaders | Stalin's]] more effective control methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

## Loss of Individuality
As [[critique_of_government_and_propaganda_in_a_dystopian_setting | The Party]] continually recreates reality, individual qualities are erased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. This leads to a state where a person's existence is solely defined by the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] Not Just a Critique of Stalinism
> While [[1984_summary_and_themes | "1984"]] contains elements allegorical to [[allegory_for_the_Soviet_Union_and_its_leaders | Stalinism]], the book is intended as a universal warning for all mankind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. Orwell warns that unless society changes, humanity risks becoming "soulless robots" without even realizing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

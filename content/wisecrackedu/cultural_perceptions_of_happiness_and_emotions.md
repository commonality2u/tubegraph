The 2015 Disney/Pixar film *Inside Out* received critical acclaim for its light-hearted approach to the workings of the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The film's creators consulted extensively with psychologists to ensure its whimsical world was rooted in actual science, particularly regarding [[psychological_insights_in_inside_out | psychological insights]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Psychological Insights from *Inside Out*

*Inside Out* illustrates several key psychological concepts:
*   **Emotion and Memory** Psychologists now understand how current emotions can influence and "color" past memories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.
*   **Emotion and Rational Thinking** The film highlights how emotions interact with the rational part of the brain. Contrary to the societal notion that emotions disrupt rational thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>, consulting psychologists Dacher Keltner and Paul Ekman state that brains use emotion to "organize, rather than disrupt, rational thinking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. For example, anger can increase awareness of injustice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>, fear helps avoid danger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>, and disgust prevents consuming harmful substances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
*   **Memory Retention** The brain processes information by discarding most daily details and storing new, useful, or emotionally important information in long-term memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

## Critiquing the Concept of Compulsory Happiness

While *Inside Out* offers interesting scientific insights, a deeper viewing suggests a critique of the [[concept_of_compulsory_happiness_in_modern_society | concept of compulsory happiness]] prevalent in modern society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

### Joy as a Villain

The film can be re-interpreted with Joy, the apparent hero, as the antagonist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. Joy, in her attempt to maintain Riley's happiness, inadvertently harms Riley's brain and even causes the accidental "death" of Bing Bong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. Her actions, stemming from an initial attempt to tamper with core memories, ultimately worsen Riley's situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. Joy is depicted as a "fascist," dictating and organizing other emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>, and viewing Sadness's influence on memories as negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

### Societal Pressure to Be Happy

*Inside Out* can be seen as a commentary on the [[critique_of_compulsory_happiness_in_society | compulsory happiness]] of 20th-century society, where "not being happy simply isn't an option" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. Various professionals and institutions mandate a positive outlook, even suggesting medication if necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

However, the film implicitly suggests that other emotions are productive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Many celebrated works of art, for instance, originate from artists dealing with unpleasant emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. The idea of completely suppressing emotions like depression is considered equally dangerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

This modern, distorted view of happiness is deeply ingrained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. The philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche famously stated, "Mankind does not strive for happiness; only the Englishman does that," highlighting a historical difference in the perception of happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. Modern society often conveys that happiness is a personal responsibility, a struggle within one's own mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

### Capitalism and Happiness

The structure of *Inside Out*, with its drama primarily unfolding within Riley's mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>, reflects this emphasis on internal struggle. Economic sociologist William Davies, in his book *The Happiness Industry*, argues that this [[concept_of_compulsory_happiness_in_modern_society | compulsory happiness]] is a central component of neoliberal capitalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. Davies suggests that happiness is manipulated by managers, corporations, and advertisers to encourage harder work and increased consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. Society, in this view, promotes Joy as the dominant emotion, suppressing others like anger, which could make individuals aware of injustice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

Focusing solely on individual happiness can divert attention from broader political and economic problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. "Happiness science," according to Davies, is "critique turned inwards," implying that issues like Riley's depression should also be viewed as problems of disempowerment, not just neural events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. Examples include corporate mindfulness initiatives or Silicon Valley workplaces that emphasize superficial fun while demanding long hours and repetitive work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

### The Value of All Emotions

Joy's initial actions in *Inside Out*, forcefully sidelining Sadness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>, align with this societal logic. However, the film implicitly criticizes this by showing that Joy's compulsive desire to maintain happiness leads Riley into a downward spiral of depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. It is only when Anger, Disgust, Fear, and Sadness work together in the climax that Riley begins to achieve a healthier mental state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

This suggests that emotions like sadness and anger are vital for personal growth and contribute to a more "robust" form of happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. This aligns with the Ancient Greek concept of *eudaimonia*, espoused by philosophers like Plato and Aristotle, which defines happiness not merely as the pursuit of pleasure but as the pursuit of virtue and justice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. A person seeking only hedonistic pleasure was not considered truly happy, as their inner sense of virtue would lead to internal strife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. Through this lens, *Inside Out* advocates for the integration of all emotions for genuine well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

The novel [[To Kill a Mockingbird]] by Harper Lee, set in the South during The Depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>, uses several symbolic elements to convey its themes.

## The Mockingbird

The title phrase, "Shootin' a mockingbird," is directly related to the outcome for [[characters_in_to_kill_a_mockingbird | Boo Radley]] after he saves [[characters_in_to_kill_a_mockingbird | Scout]] and [[characters_in_to_kill_a_mockingbird | Jem]] from [[characters_in_to_kill_a_mockingbird | Bob Ewell]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. The town authorities decide [[characters_in_to_kill_a_mockingbird | Ewell]] "fell on his knife" to ensure [[characters_in_to_kill_a_mockingbird | Boo]] is not implicated, as "icing him" would be "like 'Shootin' a mockingbird'" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

The significance of the mockingbird is further clarified by a quote from page 90 of the book: "Only a jive-ass fool would pop a cap in a mockingbird, cuz' all dem bitches do is just drop next level beats for your enjoyment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. This suggests that "rattin' on [[characters_in_to_kill_a_mockingbird | Boo Radley]] wouldn't do no good" because it would "only rid the hood of one more true blue playa" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. The town, having already made a mistake by convicting [[characters_in_to_kill_a_mockingbird | Tom Robinson]], aims to avoid "pop[ping] another mockin' bird" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

The mockingbird symbolizes innocence and harmlessness. To harm a mockingbird, or someone who embodies its qualities like [[characters_in_to_kill_a_mockingbird | Tom Robinson]] or [[characters_in_to_kill_a_mockingbird | Boo Radley]], is considered a grave injustice.

## [[characters_in_to_kill_a_mockingbird | Jem's]] Crippled Arm

[[characters_in_to_kill_a_mockingbird | Jem's]] crippled arm is presented as a metaphor for America's flawed justice system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. The fact that [[characters_in_to_kill_a_mockingbird | Jem]] injures his arm at a young age serves as a synecdoche for a country "born with backward ass ideals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. While such an injury might heal, it will leave a "disabling scar on the nation" that cannot be easily removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. This symbolizes the lasting impact of historical injustices, particularly racism, on the nation's integrity and future.

## Criticism of the South

The book itself is described as a "straight up criticism of the South during The Depression," highlighting how institutions like "the courts, the schools, the church: all of 'em were run by crooked ass crackas" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. This overarching critique underscores the corrupt social and legal structures of the time.

## [[characters_in_to_kill_a_mockingbird | Scout's]] Maturation

[[characters_in_to_kill_a_mockingbird | Scout's]] development throughout the novel symbolizes personal growth and enlightenment. Initially, she embodies "Southern racism and ignorance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. However, after interacting with [[characters_in_to_kill_a_mockingbird | Boo Radley]] and [[characters_in_to_kill_a_mockingbird | Tom Robinson]], she matures and "starts keepin' it real" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. Her experience exemplifies the theme of "learning valuable lessons by being exposed to people of difference" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. Through her interactions with "a crazy cracka' like [[characters_in_to_kill_a_mockingbird | Boo Radley]] and a righteous black man like [[characters_in_to_kill_a_mockingbird | T. Robinson]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>, [[characters_in_to_kill_a_mockingbird | Scout]] undergoes a "paradigm shiftin' moment," realizing that these individuals are "just be tryin' to hustle like anybody else" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. This symbolizes the breaking down of prejudice through empathy and understanding.

*The Big Bang Theory* is critiqued as being "bad, like really bad" in its portrayal of geek culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Its flaws are so significant that they require [[philosophical_analysis_of_humor_in_the_big_bang_theory | philosophical analysis]] to fully comprehend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

## [[use_of_references_in_the_big_bang_theory | Use of References]]

A significant issue with *The Big Bang Theory* is its extensive [[use_of_references_in_the_big_bang_theory | use of references]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. The show frequently references cornerstones of "nerd culture" such as *Star Trek* and *Battlestar Galactica*, as well as scientific facts and mathematical formulas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. These references are included repeatedly to emphasize that the characters are "diehard nerds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

However, the humor often stems from the mere act of referencing, rather than the content of the reference itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. For example, a joke involving Sheldon defining friction for Penny is funny because it's a reference to science, not because friction itself is inherently humorous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. The actual science is irrelevant; the humor is derived from the *fact* that they are talking about science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. The show's jokes are often described as "lazy writing" that cram in scientific explanations without requiring audience understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

### Contrasting with *Futurama*

In contrast, *Futurama*'s use of references is highlighted as a more effective approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. For instance, a *Futurama* reference to "aleph null" (the mathematical symbol for an infinite set of countable numbers) implies an infinite number of screens in a movie theater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. This provides an "easter egg" for the mathematically inclined, and crucially, the joke lies in the *impossibility* of a movie theater having infinite screens—the subject of aleph null, not just the reference to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. The reference in *Futurama* "imbues the joke with additional meaning," whereas *The Big Bang Theory*'s references accomplish the opposite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

Another example is comparing Sheldon explaining how locks work in *The Big Bang Theory* to Leela and the Professor discussing a Mobius strip in *Futurama* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. In the former, the humor does not depend on the audience understanding how locks function; it's simply about Sheldon being "unnecessarily smart" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. In *Futurama*, the humor is derived from the actual scientific concept referenced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.

## Philosophical Implications

This superficial use of references in *The Big Bang Theory* aligns with the ideas of French philosopher Jean Baudrillard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. Baudrillard described four levels of representation, culminating in a state where signs and representations refer only to other signs and representations, leading to a loss of reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. This is seen in phenomena like photoshopping a photoshopped image or creating memes of other memes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

Optimistically, *The Big Bang Theory* might be seen as a "distorted view of real nerd culture"—a second-order representation that gets details wrong but is still about actual nerd culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. However, a pessimistic view suggests it's a show about nerd culture with "no relation to reality whatsoever"—a third-order representation, "a copy of something that never existed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. It presents "science without actual science" and "nerd culture without real nerds," depicting caricatures rather than authentic individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. This leads to a "death of meaning," where ideas become interchangeable, and characters "spew meaningless nonsense under the guise of a meaningful joke" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

## [[philosophical_analysis_of_humor_in_the_big_bang_theory | Humor and the Superiority Theory]]

If *The Big Bang Theory*'s references ultimately point to nothing, the question arises: what is the audience laughing at <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>? The answer suggested is that "the show basically just sh*ts on its characters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.

This aligns with the [[philosophical_analysis_of_humor_in_the_big_bang_theory | Superiority Theory of Humor]], an early theory in Western philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. Plato believed laughter was a form of scorn directed at those unaware of their own flaws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. Thomas Hobbes modified this, suggesting laughter results from a competitive nature, triumphing over or witnessing another's downfall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. Descartes similarly viewed laughter as scorn "proceed[ing] from our perceiving some small evil in a person whom we consider to be deserving of it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. All three agree that laughter is often at the expense of others to make oneself feel good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.

However, unlike shows such as *Seinfeld*, where characters are intentionally depicted as "horrible people deserving our scorn," *The Big Bang Theory* showrunner Chuck Lorre claimed the characters are "extraordinary people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. This raises the question of why "extraordinary" characters are consistently made fun of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.

## [[critique_of_the_big_bang_theorys_portrayal_of_geek_culture | Critique of Portrayal of Geek Culture]]

Ultimately, *The Big Bang Theory* is seen as tearing down, rather than building up, nerd culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. By mechanically inserting references for their own sake and making characters sound like "wanky assholes," the show reveals "contempt for real nerds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. The result is that actual nerds, whether fans of *Buffy* or *Marvel*, see caricatures of themselves "dumped on" rather than accurate reflections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

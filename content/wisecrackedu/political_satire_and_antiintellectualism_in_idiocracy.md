*Idiocracy*, released in 2006, has garnered a cult following not only for its humor but also for its perceived [[cultural_prescience_and_criticism_in_idiocracy | political prescience]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. Despite alleged attempts by Fox to bury it due to concerns about sponsor reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>, the film has become a cultural artifact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. It depicts a future where society has undergone gradual degeneration, leading to a pro-wrestler president, politics reduced to shouting matches, gambling for healthcare, and corporations pretending to care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Film Overview: A Dystopian Future
The film follows Joe Bauers, an average man chosen for a military experiment in 2005 to be frozen for a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. Due to unforeseen circumstances, Joe and sex worker Rita remain in stasis for 500 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. Upon awakening, Joe discovers a world of "utter degradation" where he, an average individual from 2005, is now the smartest person alive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. The future is characterized by mountains of trash, a sports drink called Brawndo replacing water, and entertainment consisting primarily of "retail HJs, porn, balls-kicking, and farts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. Joe is appointed Secretary of Interior by President Dwayne Elizondo Mountain Dew Herbert Camacho and attempts to fix dying crops by suggesting water instead of Brawndo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. His success eventually leads him to become president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

## Satire of the Bush Era
*Idiocracy*, written during the Bush era, is "saturated with jabs" at President Bush's base of supporters, particularly in the Southern United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. The film includes a swipe at Fox News <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>, depicts language devolving into a mix of "hillbilly, valley-girl, inner-city slang, and various grunts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>, and shows clothing saturated with sponsors resembling NASCAR uniforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. The appeal of judges and politicians to "folk wisdom" also invokes the image of a Texas governor who seemed like a relatable figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

## Anti-intellectualism: Mike Judge's Vision vs. Reality

### Idiocracy's Depiction of Anti-intellectualism
Mike Judge's vision of a world ruled by idiots, where intelligence is scorned, is a central theme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. In the film, Joe Bauers is repeatedly called a "fag" for sounding smart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>, people struggle to count or read <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>, and the justice system is a "farce" based on nonsensical appeals to "common sense," resembling a gladiator fight combined with a monster truck rally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. Judge seemingly posited that a society of "illiterate yokels" could ruin democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

### The Rise of Pseudo-intellectualism
However, it can be argued that contemporary society does not suffer from anti-intellectualism as depicted in *Idiocracy*, but rather from *pseudo-intellectualism* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. While anti-intellectualism involves an aversion to learning and art, pseudo-intellectualism describes those who feign appreciation for scholarship and information while largely being misinformed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

Examples like Flat Earthers illustrate this: their websites contain "makings of real arguments," complex formulas, and appeals to logic, even going as far as purchasing expensive equipment to "prove" their theories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. Similarly, anti-vaxxers often cite their own "MDs and scientific articles" as proof, even if debunked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. This highlights a situation where people don't lack an appreciation for knowledge but rather disagree on how to evaluate it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. The idea that "the uneducated" are ruining everything, popular among some political circles, doesn't always "stack up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. For instance, Tea Party supporters were often wealthier and more educated than the general public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>, and "woo woo" new age beliefs spread even in "hyper-educated places like Silicon Valley" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

In this light, while *Idiocracy*'s depiction of anti-intellectualism is humorous, it might not be as prophetic as some believe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.

## Critique of Eugenics and "Too Many Babies"

[[pseudoscience_and_the_theme_of_too_many_babies_in_idiocracy | Pseudoscience and the Theme of Too Many Babies in Idiocracy]] is a key element of the film's premise. The film posits that the world's decline is due to "dumb, irresponsible people" having numerous children at a rate far exceeding "upstanding" citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. This concept echoes the historical eugenics movement, popularized by Henry Herbert Goddard's influential book *The Kallikak Family* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. Goddard's work, which tracked generations of "idiots" from a single soldier's liaison with a "tavern girl" versus his marriage to a "nice Quaker girl," promoted the idea of "feeble-mindedness" spreading like a disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. Although Goddard later renounced his work due to errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>, the eugenics movement led to forced sterilization programs across America and was even upheld by the Supreme Court <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.

Mike Judge has addressed criticism that *Idiocracy* is pro-eugenics, stating that the opening sequence, showing irresponsible parenting, emphasizes both nature and nurture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. He explicitly clarified, "I obviously don't believe in eugenics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.

Contrary to the film's premise, IQ scores have actually been increasing globally by approximately 3 points annually, a phenomenon known as the Flynn effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. Therefore, if Joe Bauers took an IQ test 500 years in the future, he would be considered unintelligent by those standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>. The film's "cultural deterioration" critique—that language, cinema, and TV are getting worse—is a "common refrain" that has historically proven untrue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. Complaints about language degeneration, for instance, date back centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>.

## Corporate Culture and Spectacle

One of Judge's observations that seems increasingly relevant is the "infiltration of corporate culture into our personal lives" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>. *Idiocracy* depicts a world where characters are named after brands (Frito, Dr. Lexus, Formica, Velveeta, Hormel, President Dwayne Elizondo Mountain Dew Herbert Camacho) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>, and corporations like Carl's Jr. can take child custody <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>. Government entities and services are sponsored, such as "The House of Representin’" by "Uhmerican EXXXPress" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>, and even long-distance phone service is provided by a merger of AOL, Time Warner, Taco Bell, and the US Government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.

This [[cultural_commentary_in_idiocracy | cultural commentary]] on corporate influence extends to politics. The election of a Vice President who was formerly a CEO of an oil company, or Obama's economic advisors being Goldman Sachs alumni, highlight existing fears of corporate power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>. The film's portrayal of a sports drink company buying the FDA and FCC to push its agenda is seen less as a prophecy and more as "on-the-nose hyperbole about how politics already works" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>. The rise of "branded content" further blurs the line between public discourse and private companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>.

This diminishing gap has contributed to the "spectacle-ization of politics," where corporations, media, and government create a "grotesque Frankenstein where only sex and violence can capture the public imagination" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>.

## Conclusion: Deep or Dumb?
*Idiocracy* functions as a "hilarious snapshot of early 2000's paranoia" about the world's direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>. While some of its predictions regarding anti-intellectualism and demographic decline might be "misdirected" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>, its commentary on pervasive corporate culture and the spectacle of politics holds significant weight. Ultimately, the film serves as a cautionary tale about the consequences of individuals ceding their ability to think critically and becoming "mindless consumers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>.

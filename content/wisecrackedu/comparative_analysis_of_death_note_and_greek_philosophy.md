The anime phenomenon *Death Note* addresses a range of philosophical topics, with one of the most interesting being [[philosophy_of_justice_in_death_note | Justice]]—what it is and how it should be applied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. While justice is a common topic in media, *Death Note* is unique not in what it says about justice, but in how it goes about saying it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. The show doesn't give a clear stance on what constitutes justice, but rather employs a unique method to constantly challenge various definitions of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. This method, particularly its resemblance to ancient Greek philosophical inquiry, is a key aspect of the series.

## Death Note as a Socratic Dialogue

*Death Note* operates as a modern Socratic Dialogue, using multiple participants to flesh out the universal question, "What is Justice?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. Much like Plato's *Republic*, a Socratic Dialogue is "far less concerned with offering a theory of justice than it is with detailing the process of exploring justice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. In the show, characters like Light and L repeatedly declare, "I am justice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>, symbolizing the clash of their competing definitions. The series shows the movement and evolution of [[different_theories_of_justice_presented_in_death_note | theories of justice]] between and within its characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

### Characters and their Philosophical Roles

Many characters, including Light, Misa, and Mikami, believe they possess true knowledge of justice, and the tension between these characters and their skeptics forms the core of the show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

*   **Light Yagami**: Light, upon discovering the Death Note, aims to create a crime-free world by killing criminals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. He adopts the persona of "Kira," the "God of the new world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. His approach is "ends-justify-the-means" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>, a quasi-utilitarian theory where the suffering of one (himself becoming "Kira") justifies peace for the greatest number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
    *   His [[moral_dilemmas_and_character_evolution_in_death_note | character evolution]] is notably tied to his possession of the Death Note <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. Without the notebook, his personality shifts from someone willing to exploit others to someone who respects Misa enough not to lead her on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. When he regains the Death Note, his Kira persona, prioritizing "Justice with a capital J" over treating people well, immediately returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.
*   **L, M, and N**: These detectives contrast Light's "ideal theory" of justice. L highlights contradictions in Kira's reasoning, arguing that killing people is an injustice, and catching Kira is an act of justice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. Their pursuit is driven by identifying injustices rather than a pre-existing ideal of a perfect society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. This aligns with "injustice theory," which focuses on identifying and correcting injustices where they occur, rather than starting from a broad definition of what is just <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. L often plays the role of inquisitor, similar to Socrates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>.
*   **Ryuk**: Light's first challenger, Ryuk, motivated by boredom, points out the contradiction in Light's argument: "But if you did that, it would make you the only bad person left" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. This immediately sets up the Socratic Dialogue that continues throughout the show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.
*   **Matsuda**: A "somewhat more surprising inquisitor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>, Matsuda raises sincere questions about the moral judgments of nearly every character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>. He questions the inherent evilness of Kira despite not condoning his actions, acknowledging the dramatic decrease in violent crime since Kira began killing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>. Matsuda constantly questions presented values and, like Socrates, first recognizes his own ignorance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>, which helps reveal the ignorance of others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>. He acts as both audience surrogate and philosophical foil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>.

## The Ring of Gyges and Anonymity

*Death Note* and *Lord of the Rings* are both descendants of the ancient Greek story, "The Ring of Gyges" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. In this fable, a man finds an invisibility ring and uses his [[role_of_anonymity_in_shaping_justice_in_death_note | anonymity]] to commit heinous acts, including seducing the queen, killing the king, and taking over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

In Plato's *Republic*, the character Glaucon, Plato's real-life brother, uses this fable to argue that Justice is merely a social contract to prevent harm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. The thought experiment suggests that people only value justice for its ability to make them look good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. Glaucon posits that with anonymity, it's natural for someone to act like an "asshat," because morality is only valued when actions can be scrutinized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. He argues that the power of the ring will inevitably lead one to be a "big bag of dicks," regardless of prior character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

This concept resonates deeply with Light Yagami's transformation and the [[role_of_anonymity_in_shaping_justice_in_death_note | role of anonymity]] in *Death Note*:
*   Light, initially a "golden boy valedictorian," takes joy in actions far worse than "breaking the royal bro code" once he gains the power of the Death Note <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
*   The show highlights that when the risk of damaging one's reputation is gone, so too is interest in justice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.
*   This theme is repeated in Light’s pseudonymity as Kira, in L and N’s namelessness, and in the anonymity of Kira supporters online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>, as support for Kira grows on the internet "where you can remain anonymous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.
*   A key question *Death Note* asks is: "What does Justice mean when nobody's looking?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>

## Conclusion

*Death Note* never abandons its original question of what makes a just world and, crucially, never gives a definitive answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>. The show suggests that if Kira were to win, his actions would be considered justice, but if caught, he would be evil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>. This "winner-gets-all morality" reveals that the war of competing moral codes was "a kind of logic game, not a kind of truth-seeking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>.

The true connection between the [[philosophy_of_justice_in_death_note | justice]] explored in Plato's *The Republic* and in *Death Note* lies not in their definitions of justice, but in their shared philosophical methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>. This method, characterized by inquiry, challenge, and the exploration of diverse perspectives through hypothetical scenarios, distinguishes *Death Note* as a show that "does philosophy rather than just borrowing it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>.

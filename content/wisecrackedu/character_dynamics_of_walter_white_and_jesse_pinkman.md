The first season of *Breaking Bad* introduces the unlikely partnership between Walter White and Jesse Pinkman, chronicling their joint venture into methamphetamine manufacture and the evolving dynamic between them.

## Initial Partnership and Motivations

Walter White, a 50-year-old man, initially appears as a perpetually moping individual who "enjoys playing with his food" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a> and is resistant to doctors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. He decides to take up a new "hobby" of manufacturing methamphetamine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Joining him in this enterprise is Jesse Pinkman, described as a "young entrepreneur who’s always bitching" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. Their partnership begins as a "bold new enterprise" offering "exciting growth opportunity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Character Traits and Influences

### Walter White's Development
[[walter_whites_transformation | Walter White's transformation]] is a central theme, with his expertise in chemistry frequently offering insight into his "changing and troubled excuse for a psyche" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. His chemistry lessons, such as the pilot episode's outline of metamorphosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>, the lecture on thalidomide chirality hinting at his shifting morality in episode 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>, and a presentation in episode 6 suggesting he himself is a "volatile substance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>, all underscore his evolving nature. Walter is driven to "edge out the competition and distinguish his product" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>, indicating a competitive and strategic mindset that shapes his approach to their illicit business.

### Jesse Pinkman's Struggles
Jesse is depicted as an "underachiever" who struggles with basic tasks, like using the bathroom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. Throughout Season One, Jesse attempts to gain societal legitimacy but is "routinely marginalized" by various figures, including his own parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. He largely "gets to keep riding Walt’s coattails and hope for the best" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

## Shared Incompetence and Societal Critique

The duo's initial "shared incompetence in criminal matters is reflected by the televisual programming seen in the background" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. Beneath its crime drama facade, *Breaking Bad* functions as a critique of "struggling American healthcare and economic systems" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>, in which both the "highly educated Walter and the highly high Jesse routinely fail to thrive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

Walter, despite seemingly living the "American Dream" with a family and accolades, cannot "manage to bring home sub-par bacon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. The failure of this conventional path for Walt leads him to "rage against the machine and create a freshly haberdashered new alter ego" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. This transformation highlights his belief that "only by standing outside the law can Walter attain the respect and mobility he so desperately craves" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

## The Ironic Outcome

Ironically, in taking "drastic measures to earn the money to treat his cancer," Walt "effectively becomes a societal cancer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. His gain of "energy for himself" comes "even as he participates in the deterioration of other human beings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>, posing the question of whether this is the American Dream or "simply a waking nightmare" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. Jesse, in contrast, remains largely a follower, dependent on Walter's initiatives.

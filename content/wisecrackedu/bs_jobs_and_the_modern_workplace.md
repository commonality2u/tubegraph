[[the_popularity_and_cultural_impact_of_the_office | The Office]] has remained incredibly popular despite being off the air for over six years, formerly holding the title of most streamed show on Netflix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This enduring appeal is attributed not just to its lovable characters and great jokes, but to its reflection on "the prevalence of complete and utter bs that has oozed its way into every single crevice of our professional lives and the economy as a whole" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

The series is a mockumentary following the Scranton, Pennsylvania branch of the struggling paper company Dunder Mifflin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. It depicts employees dealing with unsatisfying jobs, perpetual discomfort from their boss, Michael Scott, and managers who distract workers from actually doing work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. [[the_psychology_and_sociology_of_work_as_explored_in_the_office | The Office]] also mocks familiar office archetypes, from the uptight accountant to the lovable dunce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. It speaks to anxieties about the changing American economy, where generations dealt with closing factories, and later, the effects of digitization and e-commerce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

## Defining BS Jobs

Anthropologist [[david_graebers_theory_on_the_proliferation_of_pointless_jobs | David Graeber]] argued that BS jobs are proliferating throughout the developed world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. He defines a "BS job" as:
> "a form of paid employment that is so completely pointless, unnecessary or pernicious that even the employee cannot justify its existence even though as part of the conditions of employment the employee feels obliged to pretend that this is not the case" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

This definition appears to be the crux of life at Dunder Mifflin, characterized by useless meetings, acronym-making, following random directives, and desperately trying to find meaning in a job nearing obsolescence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. A key distinction is that a BS job is different from a job that merely "sucks," like getting minimum wage to clean toilets, which is still necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

### Dunder Mifflin as a Case Study

While some Dunder Mifflin employees, like accountants Oscar and Angela, perform competent work, the office largely fits Graeber's description of BS jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. Many employees are aware of the general pointlessness of their work, as Dunder Mifflin struggles to compete with modern chains and management is unwilling or unable to adapt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. Much of the workday is dedicated to "nonsense meetings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>, "flonkerton" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>, and office romance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

Examples of BS jobs and roles within Dunder Mifflin:
*   **Jim Halpert**: Fills his time with pranks on Dwight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>, often praised for being smart despite spending most of his time scheming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.
*   **Pam Beesly**: Spends work time planning her wedding and conspiring with Jim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>, even inventing the "office administrator" job to avoid being fired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
*   **Kevin Malone**: An accountant who can barely do math but remained employed for years because firing him would be uncomfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.
*   **Dwight Schrute**: Revels in bureaucracy, obsessing over rules and inventing pointless bureaucratic structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.
*   **Gabe Lewis**: Holds a "director" title but wields no power and cannot even fire anyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.
*   **Andy Bernard**: As manager, spends months away from the office on a boat without anyone noticing, and the team excels in his absence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

The superfluous nature of Dunder Mifflin is highlighted when Michael Scott explains his job to children: the paper is sent to them "cut and died" from a manufacturer, and they sell it for more than they paid for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. The children accurately point out the business's superfluity, likening it to Office Depot, which is "running this out of business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

## The Paradox of BS Jobs

[[david_graebers_theory_on_the_proliferation_of_pointless_jobs | Graeber]] notes that a free market theoretically promises to eliminate waste; if a job were truly pointless, market pressures would correct it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. Dunder Mifflin faces these pressures, with layoffs, branch mergers, and company sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. Yet, the Scranton branch succeeds despite its inefficiencies, with managers, accountants, and HR reps unable to perform their jobs effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.

Culturally, employees are expected to show up for 40 hours a week, leading to a culture of "looking busy" and managers creating pointless tasks to fill time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. Graeber argues there's a general sense that if one isn't "suffering at your job then it's not worth compensating fairly," leading to an optimization of suffering over efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. Michael Scott, for instance, believes his job is to break up monotony for staff well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a> and feigns busyness when convenient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.

### Proliferation and Categories
In 2013, the year [[the_popularity_and_cultural_impact_of_the_office | The Office]] ended, a Harvard Business Review survey found that half of 12,000 professionals felt their job had no meaning, and another poll indicated 37% of British workers thought their jobs were useless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>. Graeber theorizes that BS jobs spread due to the rise of the service economy, where administrative, consulting, clerical, and IT positions have boomed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>.

Graeber breaks down BS jobs into several categories:
*   **Flunkies**: Employees existing solely to justify a manager's position or inflate their prestige <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>.
*   **Goons**: Those who exist because other companies have them (e.g., legal or marketing departments) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>.
*   **Duct Tapers**: Clean up messes created by inefficient systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>.
*   **Box Takers**: Verify that actual work is being done, even if it's not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>.
*   **Task Masters**: Create BS work for other BS employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>.

As a company that doesn't actually make paper, Dunder Mifflin fits squarely into this service economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>, justifying higher prices through customer service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:59">[00:17:59]</a>.

## Psychological Impact and Coping Mechanisms

Graeber documents that pointless jobs are "incredibly harmful to our psyche," leading to depression, anxiety, and guilt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. People derive pleasure from "being the cause," having an effect on the world, even in a small way, and pointless jobs rob them of this pleasure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>. He invokes Dostoevsky's theory that the worst torture is to force someone to endlessly perform an obviously pointless task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.

Many Dunder Mifflin employees are thwarted from "being the cause" by managers, bureaucracy, or the inanity of their tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. [[the_role_of_nonsense_in_professional_life_as_depicted_in_the_office | The Office]] focuses on the characters' responses to their pointless professional lives:
*   **Jim**: Experiences agency through pranks on Dwight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>, admitting he'd "kill himself if paper became his career" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>.
*   **Pam**: Copes with distraction and eventually finds love and family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>, noting that being a receptionist was not her childhood dream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.
*   **Stanley**: Gets by with the hope of retirement and "Pretzel Day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.
*   **Oscar**: Ends the show running for state senate, a role where he could "theoretically produce change" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>.
*   **Kevin**: Finds happiness running a bar where he can competently bring guests joy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>.
*   **Michael**: Denies the superfluous nature of his job, convincing himself of its paramount importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. His hatred of Toby stems from Toby infringing on his ability to "be the cause" in his own office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>. His non-stop narcissism is explained by a lonesome childhood, seeking a "hundred friends" by being married and having a hundred kids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>.
*   **Dwight**: Embraces the inanity, clinging to pomp, circumstance, bureaucratic titles, and the appearance of authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>. He seeks to become a "petty dictator" to have ultimate say in his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>.

[[the_popularity_and_cultural_impact_of_the_office | The Office]] may resonate because it presents an escapist fantasy where characters don't get fired for minimal work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>. By the finale, they've all endured the BS, finding love or simply leaving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a>. This suggests that in our own lives, we can hope for a better job or a domestic life that provides enough happiness to cope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:42">[00:18:42]</a>.

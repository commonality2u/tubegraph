From: [[wisecrackedu]] <br/> 

Often associated with the word "irreverent," South Park is known for treating nothing as sacred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Its unique approach to religion, a subject typically demanding reverence, compels viewers to re-examine what faith truly means to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. The show dares to ask questions that other series wouldn't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>, making [[religious_themes_and_criticism_in_south_park_episodes | religion a central theme]] in many episodes.

## Blurring the Lines: The Profane and the Profound

Even before the series officially began, creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker released holiday specials featuring Jesus in combat against an evil snowman and Santa Claus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. These early works established a core tenet of the show: what seems ordinary can be a big deal, and what sounds profoundly important can be trivial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

This blurring of lines is a consistent theme:
*   The boys are not starstruck when meeting Jesus, but fight over who plays him in an Easter play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
*   When given the chance to ask God anything, Stan asks about periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
*   The meaning of life is revealed to be Earth as an intergalactic "Truman Show"-style reality series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.
*   Jesus struggles to get viewers for his public-access talk show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
*   Satan is portrayed as a serial monogamist continually returning to Saddam Hussein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

## Religion as a Tool for Manipulation

Religion in South Park often appears significant only when manipulated for personal gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. Eric Cartman is the undisputed master of this exploitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. As he states, "I know enough to exploit it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

Examples of Cartman's religious manipulation:
*   Becoming a tent revival preacher to get rich from donations (Season 4) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
*   Achieving success in Christian music by adapting secular pop songs (Season 7) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
*   Forming a fan club for Mel Gibson's *The Passion of the Christ* to lead the Fourth Reich (Season 8's "The Passion of the Jew") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. This episode highlights [[role_of_antisemitism_in_south_park | Cartman's antisemitism]].
*   Painting a cow to resemble the biblically prophesied red heifer to mess with Kyle's mind, accidentally bringing about world peace (Season 17) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

## Creators' Stance: Not Anti-Religious, but Fascinated

Despite its [[irreverence_and_sacredness_in_south_park | irreverent approach]], the creators, Matt Stone and Trey Parker, largely disagree with the impression that the show is simply anti-religious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. Matt Stone notes that while atheists have latched onto the show because it "make[s] fun of a lot of religion," neither he nor Parker are "anti-religious at all," with Stone adding, "I'm fascinated by religion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

## Challenging the Sacred and Profane Divide

South Park's perceived anti-religious stance stems from its refusal to treat religion as a sacred subject, which contrasts with Western spiritual traditions that emphasize honoring the sacred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. French philosopher Émile Durkheim theorized that Western religions divide the world into two categories: the sacred and the profane, with the sacred always taken seriously due to its connection to fundamental cosmic forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. South Park fundamentally denies the legitimacy of this distinction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

### Desecration as Salvation

A recurring theme is that sometimes the only way to save something deemed sacred is by "desecrating" it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

*   In "Red Hot Catholic Love" (Season 6), Father Maxie tears a "sacred Vatican Document" in two, defying the authority of a sentient giant spider ruling the Catholic Church, which had sanctioned pedophilia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. This act metaphorically suggests that the church could only evolve if it ceased to be too sacred to investigate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
*   In *The South Park Movie*, Cartman and Kenny save the world by cursing out Saddam Hussein and making a deal with the Devil, respectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.
*   In "Cancelled" (Season 7), Earth is saved from cosmic destruction for reasons Gene Roddenberry might not have found inspiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

## Critiques of the Sacred and "Redemptive Violence"

South Park also suggests that humanity's concept of the sacred is flawed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. While Jesus literally walks the Earth, he often goes unnoticed and his talk show, "Jesus and Pals," loses in ratings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. However, when Jesus fights, he suddenly gains his followers' respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.

Jesus's frequent battles throughout the series—against Frosty, Santa, Satan, Iraqi soldiers, Bill Donohue, a xenomorph, and a Seussian villain—are presented as the only way he can maintain his followers' esteem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. This aligns with American theologian Walter Wink's "myth of redemptive violence," which posits that the human sense of the sacred, originating from ancient Babylonian mythology, stems from the desire to see good triumph over evil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. Wink argues that this myth is "the real myth of the modern world," surpassing traditional religions in dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. South Park's Jesus fights because he realizes his followers' projection of this myth onto him is more important than what he can genuinely offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

## Critiquing Human Nature, Not Just Religion

South Park's [[social_satire_in_south_park | social satire]] and [[cultural_and_social_critiques_in_south_park | cultural critique]] often extend beyond religion itself, focusing on the flaws of human nature. The show suggests that you don't need to be religious to be a "narrow-minded asshole" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.

### The Self-Promotional Activist
Stan's character arc in Season 16 serves as an example, showcasing his self-promotional activism where he enjoys being treated with reverence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. He abandons causes once they no longer make him popular, in contrast to Wendy Testaburger, who has deeper motivations and self-respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. South Park suggests that movements driven by individuals seeking to be taken seriously are likely to "go off the rails" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

### The New Atheism Movement
This critique extends to the New Atheism movement. In the two-part episode "Go God Go," Cartman's journey to the 26th century reveals three rival militant atheist factions killing each other over branding disputes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. The message is clear: human beings are violent and irrational, and getting rid of religion won't change that <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

The core difference between Stone and Parker and the New Atheist movement lies in a "chicken-or-egg" question: Is religion ridiculous because people are ridiculous, or vice versa? Stone and Parker subscribe to the latter view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. This highlights [[south_parks_commentary_on_human_nature_and_belief_systems | South Park's broader commentary on human nature]].

## Embracing Ambiguity and the Inevitable Ridiculousness

Australian science historian Margaret Wertheim argues in *Pythagoras’ Trousers* that Western scientific models often resemble religious ones due to a "hypermasculine drive for certainty and finality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. This insistence on absolute certainty, even without much evidence, leads to ridiculous answers to fundamental questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>. South Park, like Wertheim, suggests that refusing to accept ambiguity makes our worldviews sound ridiculous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

The show's creators are not interested in dictating whether one should be religious or not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. Matt Stone posed the rhetorical question: "[I]f the mass delusion of a religion makes you happy, makes your family work better, is that bad or good?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>. The series has explicitly made this argument twice, notably in "Red Hot Catholic Love" (Season 6) and "All About Mormons" (Season 7) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. After mocking new kid Gary's Mormon beliefs and upbeat family life, the episode concludes with the idea that being religious or not religious can both be sensible, echoing philosopher William James's pragmatism: "whether it or not it was created by a divine figure, it's still life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.

Unlike most series dealing with religion, South Park doesn't offer an "escape route"—a particular religion or ideology to avoid being ridiculous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. Its underlying philosophy is that being human is "inevitably ridiculous," and there's no way to avoid this fate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. No matter one's chosen worldview, South Park asserts that we'll "look silly if we take ourselves too seriously" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. The ultimate question, then, isn't whether our belief system is a joke, but "whether or not we know it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>. This approach highlights [[south_parks_satire_on_religion_and_consumerism | South Park's unique blend of satire]].

The Disney/Pixar film "Inside Out," released in 2015, garnered critical acclaim for its light-hearted yet insightful approach to how the human brain works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The creators consulted extensively with psychologists to ensure the whimsical world presented was rooted in actual science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Psychological Insights from Inside Out

The film offers several insights into psychology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>:

*   **Emotions Color Memories**: Psychologists now understand better how current emotions can influence past memories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.
*   **Interaction of Emotions and Rationality**: A significant insight is how emotions interact with the rational part of the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

Society often holds a notion that emotions disrupt otherwise functional and rational brains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. However, according to consulting psychologists Dacher Keltner and Paul Ekman, modern science suggests the opposite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. They state that brains use emotion to "organize, rather than disrupt, rational thinking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

For instance, anger can make individuals more aware of unfairness around them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. Fear helps prevent dangerous actions like wandering into the middle of the road <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>, and disgust limits the urge to consume spoiled food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. In [[psychological_insights_in_inside_out | Inside Out]], Anger facilitates action, and Fear ensures Riley's safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

Another observation relates to how the brain remembers things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. Most daily information is discarded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>, but new, useful, or emotionally important information is filed away in long-term memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. The film depicts this through Riley's sleep, where useless information is dumped, and important data is stored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

## A Reinterpretation of Joy's Role

While typically seen as the protagonist, Joy can be argued to be the villain of [[psychological_insights_in_inside_out | Inside Out]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. Joy's initial tampering with core memories leads to worsening problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>, and she acts like a "petty dictator" by bossing around other emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. Joy's determination that Sadness touching a memory is a "bad thing" highlights this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

This interpretation suggests [[psychological_insights_in_inside_out | Inside Out]] is a commentary on the [[cultural_perceptions_of_happiness_and_emotions | compulsory happiness]] prevalent in 20th-century society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. Modern society often mandates a positive outlook, with various professionals prescribing ways to achieve happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. However, this approach overlooks that other emotions are productive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Many celebrated artistic works originate from artists grappling with unpleasant emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. The idea of completely eradicating these emotions is equally dangerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

Historically, the modern distorted view of happiness was not always present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. Friedrich Nietzsche famously stated that "Mankind does not strive for happiness; only the Englishman does that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. The blanket advice to simply be happy with one's situation is problematic, yet society frames happiness as a personal responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

## Happiness as a Societal Construct

[[psychological_insights_in_inside_out | Inside Out]] embodies this logic, with most of the drama unfolding within Riley's mind rather than her external environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. This focus on internal drama avoids external factors, such as the impersonal machinations of capitalism that lead Riley's father to relocate for wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

Economic sociologist William Davies, in "The Happiness Industry," argues that [[cultural_perceptions_of_happiness_and_emotions | compulsory happiness]] is a central component of neoliberal capitalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. According to Davies, managers, corporations, and advertisers manipulate happiness to encourage harder work and greater consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. Society desires Joy to be in control of our minds, pushing out emotions like anger, which can make us keenly aware of injustice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. This perspective suggests that merely being happy bypasses crucial questions about systemic injustice as a source of sadness or anger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

For example, Riley's mother asks her to smile for her father despite hardship, implying the need for a happy facade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. The film's limitation of the psyche to internal drama, rather than the outside world, is problematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. Davies contends that a "relentless fascination with quantities of subjective feeling" diverts critical attention from broader political and economic problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. He calls "happiness science" "critique turned inwards" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. Instead of viewing depression solely as a neural event, it should also be seen as a problem of disempowerment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. This is observed in corporate mindfulness and Silicon Valley workspaces that offer perks to mask demanding work conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

## Embracing All Emotions for Robust Happiness

Joy's character in the film embodies this logic, as she attempts to sideline Sadness from the beginning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. However, by implicitly casting Joy as the villain, [[psychological_insights_in_inside_out | Inside Out]] ultimately criticizes this compulsory happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Joy's compulsive desire to maintain happiness despite hardship leads Riley into a downward spiral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. It is only when Anger, Disgust, Fear, and Sadness work together in the climax that Riley begins to achieve a better mental state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

This suggests that emotions like sadness and anger are crucial for developing a more robust kind of happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. The concept of Eudaimonia, from Ancient Greek philosophy, refers to "happiness" and was espoused by philosophers like Plato and Aristotle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. Plato argued that happiness was not merely the pursuit of pleasure, but rather the pursuit of virtue and justice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. A person seeking only hedonistic pleasure would not be truly happy due to internal strife and disharmony that arises from a lack of virtue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. A careful viewing of [[psychological_insights_in_inside_out | Inside Out]] aligns with this idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

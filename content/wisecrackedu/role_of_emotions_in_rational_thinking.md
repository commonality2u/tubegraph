The 2015 Disney/Pixar film *Inside Out* received critical acclaim for its light-hearted approach to understanding how the brain works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. The film's creators consulted extensively with psychologists to ensure that the fantastical world they presented was grounded in actual science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Psychological Insights from *Inside Out*

*Inside Out* offers several key [[psychological_insights_in_inside_out | psychological insights]]:
*   **Emotions Color Memories** Modern psychologists now have a better understanding of how our current emotions can influence and color our past memories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.
*   **Emotion-Rational Interaction** A significant insight is the way emotions interact with the rational part of the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. There is a common societal notion that emotions disrupt and mess up an otherwise functional and rational brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. However, according to consulting psychologists Dacher Keltner and Paul Ekman, modern science indicates the opposite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. They assert that brains utilize emotion to "organize, rather than disrupt, rational thinking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
    *   **Anger:** For instance, one study cited by Keltner and Ekman found that anger increases awareness of unfairness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. In the film, Anger is depicted as an emotion that "gets shit done" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
    *   **Fear:** Fear is crucial for self-preservation, helping individuals avoid dangers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. In *Inside Out*, Fear ensures Riley's safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
    *   **Disgust:** Disgust helps limit urges to consume harmful things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
*   **Memory Formation** The brain remembers things by filing away information that is new, useful, or emotionally important into long-term memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. Useless information is typically discarded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

## Reinterpreting "Inside Out": Joy as the Antagonist

While the scientific aspects are interesting, a different interpretation suggests that the conventional viewing of *Inside Out* as a journey with Joy as the hero is "terribly wrong" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. Instead, it can be argued that Joy is the film's villain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

Joy is presented as an "egomaniac" who irreparably harms an innocent girl's brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. She is the source of many problems, attempting to tamper with core memories and making things worse in her quest to recover them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. Joy acts like a "petty dictator," bossing other emotions around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>, and labeling Sadness's influence on memories as negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

This interpretation positions *Inside Out* as a critique of the "compulsory happiness" prevalent in 20th-century society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. Modern society often mandates a positive outlook, with various professionals encouraging self-care and positivity, sometimes even prescribing medication to achieve it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. However, this view overlooks the crucial role of other emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Many beloved creative works originate from artists grappling with "unpleasant emotions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. Attempting to eradicate emotions like sadness or anger is seen as dangerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

The idea that happiness is solely a personal responsibility, a struggle within one's own mind, is embodied by *Inside Out*'s structure, where the drama primarily unfolds within Riley's mind rather than her external environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

### Happiness and Neoliberal Capitalism

Economic sociologist William Davies, in his book *The Happiness Industry*, argues that this "compulsory happiness" is a core tenet of neoliberal capitalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. According to Davies, happiness is manipulated by managers, corporations, and advertisers to encourage people to work harder and consume more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. Society seeks to empower Joy within our minds, pushing aside emotions like anger, which can make us keenly aware of injustice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

Forcing happiness overlooks critical questions about the underlying causes of dissatisfaction, such as hating one's job or whether sadness and anger stem from unjust systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. The film's limitation of the psyche to internal drama, rather than external factors, is problematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. Davies suggests that the "relentless fascination with quantities of subjective feeling" diverts critical attention from broader political and economic issues, making "happiness science" "critique turned inwards" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

Instead of viewing a character's depression purely as a neural event, it should also be considered a problem of disempowerment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. This is analogous to corporate mindfulness trends and Silicon Valley workplaces that emphasize "fun" perks while demanding long hours and repetitive work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

## A Robust Happiness through Emotional Integration

By casting Joy as an accidental villain, *Inside Out* implicitly criticizes this dominant societal logic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. Joy's compulsive desire to maintain happiness leads Riley into a depressive spiral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. Only when Anger, Disgust, Fear, and Sadness collaborate does Riley begin to achieve a better mental state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.

This suggests that emotions like sadness and anger contribute to making individuals better people and fostering a more "robust" kind of happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. This aligns with the Ancient Greek philosophical concept of **Eudaimonia**, which means "happiness" but was espoused by philosophers like Plato and Aristotle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. Plato argued that happiness was not merely the pursuit of pleasure, but rather the pursuit of virtue and justice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. A person seeking only hedonistic pleasure would not be truly happy due to internal strife and disharmony that arises from a lack of virtue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. After careful viewing, this nuanced understanding of happiness seems to be the true message of *Inside Out* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

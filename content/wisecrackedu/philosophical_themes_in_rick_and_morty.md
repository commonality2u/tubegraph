In `Rick and Morty`, particularly within Season 3, the show frequently explores the concept of the meaninglessness of existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. It asserts that "Nothing you think matters matters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a> and that specific realities are not special, as events occur infinitely across infinite realities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. The series often undermines moments of genuine emotion or love, ripping them away from characters and viewers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. This presents a unique challenge for character development in a TV show where meaning is absent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

While the show flirts with spiraling deeper into [[Existentialism and Nihilism in Rick and Morty | nihilism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>, it offers a novel solution through character growth, specifically within the matriarch of the Smith family, Beth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## Beth's Existential Crisis and Radical Freedom

In the Season 3 finale, "The Rickchurian Mortydate," Beth questions whether she was replaced by a clone, a proposition Rick had offered her in a previous episode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. This leads her to confront and question her past, including whether her memories are truly her own and what that signifies for her future happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

Rick previously informed Beth that her intelligence makes her "Worse. You're smart," adding that "When you know nothing matters the universe is yours and I’ve never met a universe that was into it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Rick's personal answer to this realization is simply, "Don't think about it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

Faced with this revelation, Beth is presented with radical freedom to choose her own destiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. This freedom brings her peace regarding her decision to stay with or leave her family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. Rick advises her:
> "Then stay and luxuriate in a life you can finally know you've chosen. My secret bonus is that no matter what you choose you're finally gonna chill the f*** out." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>

The episode implies that Beth chose to stay, leading to a newfound sense of happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. She appears to be a better mother (in a way) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>, loves Jerry, and has reunited her family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

## Amor Fati: The Cure for Common Nihilism

To explain Beth's surprising reconciliation with Jerry and her overall paradigm shift, the concept of **Amor Fati** is introduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

### Nietzschean Philosophy
Amor Fati, a Latin phrase used by [[Nietzschean philosophy in Rick and Morty | Nietzsche]], means "Love of Fate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. It embodies the affirmation of life and becoming a "Yes-Sayer," rather than a "Yes-Man" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. This concept is closely linked to Nietzsche's thought experiment known as "Eternal Recurrence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

#### Eternal Recurrence
The "Eternal Recurrence" thought experiment asks one to imagine a demon who declares that your entire life will be relived infinitely, exactly as it happened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. The question then becomes whether this news throws you into existential despair or if you would "high-five the demon and say you’ve never heard anything more divine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. To desire to relive every moment of your life for eternity—the good, the bad, and everything in between—is the ultimate affirmation of life, embodying Amor Fati <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. It is part of Nietzsche's strategy to overcome the crushing [[Existentialism and Nihilism in Rick and Morty | nihilism]] of existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

### Beth's Embrace of Amor Fati
Beth, given her [[Existentialism and Nihilism in Rick and Morty | existential crisis]] and Rick-like intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>, has to confront her past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. By recreating a past date with Jerry, she re-lives a small part of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. Although she may have hated her life, including her date with Jerry, the first time around, this time she chooses to be a Nietzschean "Yes-Sayer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

Amor Fati isn't about ignoring the past or seeing everything as a blessing in disguise; it's about not shunning the difficult aspects of one's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. Beth acknowledges she's no longer the woman Jerry married <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. While Jerry may be an "idiot," his "simplicity" might be what someone from a family that uses intelligence to justify sickness needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

Another instance of Amor Fati is when Beth believes Rick has come to "retire" her, a functional acceptance of her fate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. She embraces being with her family rather than dwelling on what could have been, even if a version of Beth chose to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. Despite the infinite universes where Rick and Beth made different choices, she desires to stay in "this one" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

Nietzsche also wrote about the impossible task of "knowing oneself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. Beth desperately wants to know who she is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>, but for Nietzsche, the logic behind why we do anything is impenetrable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. Rick's own motivations are often unclear to the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>:
> "I don't know. Maybe you matter so little that I like you. Or maybe, it makes you matter. Maybe I love you." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>

Nietzsche would argue that it doesn't truly matter if Beth chose to be cloned or if any of her choices matter in infinite versions of herself; all one can do is love their fate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. This appears to be the choice Beth has made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

## Rick vs. Beth as Ubermensch

While Rick is often portrayed as a kind of [[Nietzschean philosophy in Rick and Morty | Nietzschean ubermensch]] battling a meaningless cosmos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>, he doesn't truly create his own new meaning. Instead, he engages in self-destructive behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. In contrast, Beth, when confronted with the meaninglessness of the cosmos, finds happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. This act of finding happiness in the face of meaninglessness is arguably more "ubermenschy" than Rick's approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

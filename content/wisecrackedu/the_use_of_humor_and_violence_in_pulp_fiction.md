[[hidden_meanings_and_analysis_of_pulp_fiction | Pulp Fiction]], directed by acclaimed foot fetishist [[quentin_tarantinos_storytelling_techniques | Quentin Tarantino]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, is a film composed of three interconnected stories set in the seedy underbelly of Los Angeles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. The film upends traditional gangster and action genres by trivializing their macho image and employing a cavalier attitude towards violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

## Cavalier Attitude Towards Violence

Much of [[hidden_meanings_and_analysis_of_pulp_fiction | Pulp Fiction]]'s humor stems from its nonchalant approach to human-on-human violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

*   **Casual Conversations Amidst Danger**
    Hitmen Vincent and Jules, despite being undermanned and undergunned while en route to a "conflict resolution" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>, engage in casual gossip about TV pilots and foot massages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>, creating a relaxed scene that should otherwise generate suspense or concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
*   **Lack of Remorse**
    After Vincent accidentally shoots Marvin in the head, killing him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>, there is no remorse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. Vincent and Jules are more concerned with bloodying Jimmie's towels than with having taken a life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
*   **Understated Ominous Moments**
    In the torture dungeon, Maynard's ominous statement that "Nobody kills anybody in his place of business except him or Zed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a> is immediately followed by a friendly door chime and the reveal, "That's Zed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. This contrasts with most films that would pair such a statement with dramatic music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

## Undercutting High Stakes with Mundanity

The film takes a cavalier attitude with time, frequently undercutting high-stakes situations with characters moving at a slower pace or engaging in trivialities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

*   **Distractions During Emergencies**
    While Vincent frantically tries to save the dying Mia on the phone, his frantic shots are intercut with Lance calmly ingesting wet bread pellets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. Later, Lance and his wife get sidetracked by petty squabbling while trying to find a medical book <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
*   **Slow-Paced Revenge**
    Butch takes his time picking a weapon as Marcellus is being raped in the background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

## Elevating the Mundane

Just as serious things are downplayed, mundane elements are granted special significance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

*   **The Bathroom as a Plot Device**
    The bathroom serves as a focal point for many crucial scenes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. Jules and Vincent are nearly killed by a man who lives in the bathroom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. More notably, every time Vincent uses the bathroom, something bad happens, including the restaurant robbery, Mia's overdose, and Vincent getting shot by Butch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

## Conclusion

By trivializing important events and "important-izing" trivial ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>, [[hidden_meanings_and_analysis_of_pulp_fiction | Pulp Fiction]] suggests that life is random and filled with outrageous coincidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. Examples of this include Honey Bunny and Pumpkin choosing to rob the very restaurant where two heroes are eating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>, Butch's improbable encounter with Marcellus at a traffic light and subsequent discovery of the dishonest pawn shop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>, and Vincent and Jules miraculously surviving being shot at point-blank range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. This deliberate chaos highlights [[themes_of_fate_and_coincidence_in_pulp_fiction | themes of fate and coincidence in Pulp Fiction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>, ultimately implying that even in a chaotic world, individuals still possess the power to choose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

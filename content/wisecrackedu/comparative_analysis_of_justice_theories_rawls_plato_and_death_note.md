The anime phenomenon, *Death Note*, delves into a range of philosophical topics, including property rights and human nature, with a significant focus on justiceâ€”what it is and how it should be applied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. Unlike much of popular culture that presents a straightforward notion of justice, *Death Note* distinguishes itself not in *what* it asserts about justice, but in *how* it conveys its message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. The series abstains from taking a clear stance on what constitutes justice, instead employing a distinctive approach to continuously challenge its various definitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. This exploration is primarily facilitated by individual characters who propose their own versions of justice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

## Light Yagami's Justice: Kira and the Ends Justify the Means

The narrative of *Death Note* begins with Light Yagami discovering the Death Note, a supernatural notebook that allows him to kill anyone by writing their name and picturing their face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. Light, an exemplary student, desires to use this power to create a world free of crime, eventually adopting the public persona of "Kira," the "God of the new world" he aims to establish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

Light's philosophical stance as Kira is that the "ends-justify-the-means" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. He believes that his goal of becoming a crime-eliminating uber-tyrant justifies virtually any action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. This includes shamelessly exploiting his girlfriend to evade police and increase his kill count <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>, and even eliminating non-criminals who obstruct his path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

A notable aspect of Light's character is the significant shift in his personality and sense of justice when he temporarily renounces ownership of the Death Note and loses his memories of being Kira <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. During this period, he refuses to exploit Misa's feelings for personal gain, a stark contrast to his Kira persona <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. However, once he touches the Death Note again and regains his memories and powers, his Kira persona promptly returns, prioritizing "Justice with a capital J" over treating people well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. This internal conflict is often portrayed through Light's conversations with himself, where he grapples with moral and practical dilemmas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

Kira's vision of justice aligns with a quasi-utilitarian theory: by executing criminals and establishing one person as God, peace and happiness for the greatest number of people will be ensured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. He views himself as a martyr, willing to sacrifice his mind and soul to clean a "rotten world," even if it means contending with a "rotten self" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. This translates into an Old Testament-style bloodbath where sinners are punished, and blasphemy is considered the ultimate sin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.

## Anonymity and the [[the_influence_of_the_ring_of_gyges_and_philosophical_texts_on_death_note | Ring of Gyges]]

The tension between Light's pre- and post-Death Note personalities, and their eventual merging, highlights the influence of power and anonymity on an individual's moral compass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. This concept echoes the ancient Greek story, [[the_influence_of_the_ring_of_gyges_and_philosophical_texts_on_death_note | The Ring of Gyges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. In this tale, a man finds a ring that grants him invisibility, which he immediately uses to seduce the queen, kill the king, and seize power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

Plato's *Republic* uses this story to raise fundamental questions about justice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. The character Glaucon argues that justice is merely a social contract designed to prevent people from harming each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. The thought experiment suggests that people only value justice because it makes them appear virtuous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. Glaucon posits that an individual with an invisibility ring would naturally act selfishly, as their actions cannot be scrutinized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. This resonates with the idea that as soon as the risk of damaging one's reputation disappears, so does interest in justice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. Light, the seemingly moral valedictorian, secretly revels in actions far worse than breaking social norms, proving Glaucon's point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.

A central question *Death Note* poses is: "What does Justice mean when nobody's looking?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a> This [[role_of_anonymity_and_identity_in_understanding_justice_in_death_note | theme of anonymity]] is reinforced by Light's pseudonymity as Kira, L and N's namelessness, and the anonymity of Kira's online supporters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

## *Death Note* as a Modern Socratic Dialogue

The *Republic*, being a Socratic Dialogue, is less concerned with presenting a definitive theory of justice and more with detailing the process of exploring it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. It uses hypothetical scenarios and varying definitions to challenge the nature of justice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. *Death Note* mirrors this method, showcasing the evolution and shifts in theories of justice among and within its characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

Many characters, including Misa, Light, and Mikami, are convinced they possess the true knowledge of justice, and the tension between these characters and their skeptics forms the core of the show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. Both Light and L declare "I am justice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>, a sentiment reiterated throughout the series, especially in the final episode where Light claims to have become justice by reducing violent crime and ending wars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.

This establishes *Death Note* as a contemporary Socratic Dialogue, using multiple participants to grapple with a universal question like "What is Justice?" similar to *The Republic* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. From Light's initial vision in Episode 1, the question of justice is central <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. Ryuk, motivated by boredom, immediately highlights the contradiction in Light's plan to eliminate all "bad" people, pointing out that this would make Light the only "bad person left" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. This initiates the Socratic Dialogue that spans the entire series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.

## Ideal Theory vs. Injustice Theory: Rawls, Plato, L, and Light

Philosopher John Rawls, much like Light and Plato, contends that to rectify societal injustices, one must first possess an understanding of what "justice" entails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>. Rawls and Plato both support "ideal theory," which suggests that when contemplating justice, one should first consider what it would look like in a perfect world where everyone acts correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. This aligns with Light and Mikami's vision of justice under "ideal" conditions, which involves the death of many <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.

In contrast, other philosophers like Naomi Zack advocate for "injustice theory" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>. This approach does not depend on a preconceived ideal of "justice" or a perfect society. Instead, it centers on identifying injustices as they occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>. It is considered more practical to pinpoint a specific instance of injustice than to begin with a broad, universally applicable definition of what is just <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. By this measure, justice can only be applied to correct an injustice once it has been identified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>.

L, and later N, in their pursuit of Kira, do not appear to be guided by a lofty definition of Justice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>. Instead, their actions stem from the recognition that Kira's "new world" is inherently unjust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. Since L's specific concept of "justice" is never explicitly stated, it is plausible that he views justice as the response to injustice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>. Therefore, while Light and his followers lean towards a Rawlsian approach of a world built around a perfect "Justice," L is more focused on rectifying injustices as they emerge, making any definitive statement of "The Just" secondary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.

L's code of justice is ambiguous, and this ambiguity plays a crucial role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>. He, N, and M seem most interested in winning a "game of wits" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. This lack of strong convictions about a positive definition of Justice allows L to frequently assume the role of an inquisitor, much like Socrates in *The Republic* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.

## Matsuda: The Inquisitor and Audience Surrogate

Another unexpected inquisitor is Matsuda, who raises genuine questions about the moral judgments of Light, Kira, the Japanese Police, and L <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>. Despite being mocked for his inability to conform, Matsuda points out that violent crime had decreased since Kira began killing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>. While he doesn't condone Kira's actions, he is skeptical of the hard line taken by L <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>. He even questions the fundamental belief in Kira's inherent evilness among the Task Force members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>.

Matsuda, with his self-doubt, serves as both an audience surrogate and a philosophical foil to the other characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>. Unlike Light, who is convinced of his project, or L and N, who are singularly focused on catching Kira, Matsuda constantly questions the values presented to him as fact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>. His demeanor differs from the bravado of Plato's debaters, but he primarily acknowledges his own ignorance, which is vital for revealing the ignorance of those around him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>. Even in the end, when he kills Light, his actions are driven by questions rather than definitive answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>. By forcing viewers and characters alike to consider their own views on justice, Matsuda helps organize the competing ideas into a coherent conversation, earning him the title of "Matsuda the modern Socrates!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>.

## Conclusion: An Open-Ended Dialogue on Justice

Ten years of fan forums demonstrate that there is no consensus on who best represented justice, or whether Light's "New World" justified the means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>. This ambiguity is what makes *Death Note* so profound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>. While an engaging detective procedural, the show never abandons its central question of what constitutes a just world, and crucially, it never provides a definitive answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>.

As Light himself summarizes in Episode 30, titled "Justice": "If Kira gets caught then that makes him evil. But if he wins and rules the world then I guess he's justice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>. By the series' conclusion, Kira is defeated, and N's brand of justice appears to triumph <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>. However, this "winner-gets-all morality" suggests that the conflict of competing moral codes was more a logic game than a search for truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. While N might represent justice within the show's world, for the viewers, the answer remains less clear-cut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>. *Death Note* ultimately opens more doors than it closes regarding the meaning and implications of justice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>.

From the perspective of philosophers like Socrates, Rawls, or Zack, neither L nor Kira would likely be considered paragons of justice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>. The true connection between the justice explored in *The Republic* and in *Death Note* lies not in their definitions, but in their shared philosophical methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>. This method is what distinguishes *Death Note* as a show that actively *does* philosophy, rather than merely borrowing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>.

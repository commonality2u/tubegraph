At first glance, *The Purge* appears to be a typical horror film featuring a concept where all crime is legal for 12 continuous hours, questionable acting, and violent carnage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. However, its true terror lies in its ability to highlight the dehumanizing policies of our current social landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. With a closer look, *The Purge* functions as a [[Philosophy and Socioeconomic Commentary in The Purge | commentary]] on contemporary sociopolitical existence, serving as a thinly veiled allegory for America's corrupt politics, rigged economic systems, and culture of violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## The Purge as a Reaffirmation of Social Structures

*The Purge* shares similarities with other ritualistic festivals such as Mardi Gras, Carnival, or Halloween, in that they are designated times where people can violate social norms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. While *The Purge* involves more murder and theft compared to dancing and feasting before Lent, the underlying concept is the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

Rather than undermining the power of law and religion, these events actually reaffirm existing social structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. The "NFFA" (New Founding Fathers of America), who sanction the ritual, are not challenged by *The Purge*; instead, the chaos of the night makes people long for the return of law the next day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. If Carnival reinforces the tenets of Christianity, *The Purge* makes people accept the tenets of the ruling social ideology, which is best described as [[Neoliberalism in South Park Season 19 | Neoliberalism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

## Neoliberalism and the Politics of Disposability

The fundamental principle of [[Neoliberalism in South Park Season 19 | Neoliberalism]] dictates that the government should primarily craft policies that promote the free flow of goods and protect corporate interests, rather than heavily regulating the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Each film in *The Purge* series reflects a different facet of this neoliberal economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. The ways characters deal with *The Purge* highlight the conditions of their respective [[Class Struggles and Economic Disparities Highlighted by The Purge | economic classes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>:

*   **The Original Purge (2013)** focuses on the impact of the event on an upper-middle-class suburban family, the Sandins, who live in a gated community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
*   **The Purge: Anarchy (2014)** shifts to the economic problems of a working-class family, exemplified by Eva Sanchez, who struggles with affordability for her father's medicine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. The inner city setting is depicted as rife with Purge traps, gangs, and government officials abducting people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
*   **The Purge: Election Year (2016)** addresses the consequences of the holiday on small business owners, such as Joe, who faces inexplicably rising Purge insurance premiums <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

The comparison between the suburban setting of the first film and the inner-city setting of the second can be understood as a metaphor for white flight, where the retreat of upper-class white individuals from cities to sheltered suburbs exposes those left behind to disproportionate amounts of crime, homelessness, poverty, and Purging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. For the Sandins, the idea of dealing with violence against the poor is unacceptable in their neighborhood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

Taken as a whole, these examples illustrate the injustices not only of *The Purge* but also of the economic system at large <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. Those who prosper under [[Neoliberalism in South Park Season 19 | neoliberalism]] benefit from *The Purge*, while those harmed by [[Neoliberalism in South Park Season 19 | neoliberalism]] also suffer during *The Purge* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. The upper-middle class profits from "murder night" through the sales of security home systems, while the working class, like Eva Sanchez, can only afford flimsy protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. Joe, unable to afford Purge insurance, must protect his deli with inadequate means and ultimately loses his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

### Dehumanization and Disposability

*The Purge* highlights how neoliberal economics fosters a [[Dehumanization and Disposability as Presented in The Purge | politics of disposability]], a concept explored by thinkers Henry Giroux and Brad Evans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. In the original film, suburbanites view entire groups of people as superfluous and disposable, referring to a homeless stranger as "swine" and "filth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. James Sandin initially justifies torturing his house guest as a means to save his family, only seeing him as fully human when the stranger volunteers to sacrifice himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.

In *The Purge: Anarchy*, the uncontrolled price of medication forces Papa Sanchez to "sell" his life to the rich so his family can be relieved of economic hardship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. His life becomes more valuable as a disposable object than as an actual person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. This idea is echoed in *Rick and Morty*, where a character states, "This girl is one of your poor people and I guess you guys felt like it was okay to subject her to inhuman conditions because there was no chance of it ever hurting you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

Giroux and Evans argue that people become disposable under an economic system characterized by the privatization of healthcare, deregulation of banks, and the erosion of government safety nets like social security and welfare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. The NFFA's policies in *The Purge*—legalizing murder to decrease the poor population, which reduces government spending on welfare, healthcare, and housing—align with this logic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. Shutting down medical and police services during *The Purge* supports this objective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. This is all justified under the banner of economic growth; the elderly, infirm, poor, and "non-contributors" are sacrificed so the economy can grow unhindered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

This "elimination" parallels real-world neoliberal economics where populations are exposed to a "slow death" through inability to afford medicine, poor nutrition, and exposure to pollution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. Instead of active purging, neoliberalism simply allows certain populations to die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

### Malthusian Theory and Its Critique

The justification for *The Purge* is not a new economic idea, tracing back to Reverend Thomas Robert Malthus's 1798 book, "Essay on the Principle of Population" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. Malthus argued that a growing population would create massive food shortages because production couldn't keep up with demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. His proposed solution was to employ laws that keep birth rates low and death rates high, through means like famine, disease, and wars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. This concept is echoed in *The Purge: Election Year* by Caleb Warrens, head of the NFFA, who states, "Everyone to HAVE. SOME cannot have. NOT enough to go around" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

However, Friedrich Engels critiqued Malthus, arguing that the issue isn't increasing population but an economic system that doesn't value workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. Engels believed Malthus's model was merely an excuse to treat poor people poorly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. The NFFA's elaborate Purge ceremonies suggest their motivations go beyond mere economic concerns, taking the mistreatment of poor people to an extreme level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.

## Conclusion

The genius of *The Purge* lies in its visceral exposure of how the neoliberal economy generates profit in a predatory manner through "murder night" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. While the privileged make significant money from weapon sales, insurance, private bodyguards, and home security systems, the poor are left to fight for survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.

The *Purge* movies offer a glimpse into a potential dystopia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. The *Rick and Morty* episode about Purging provides an interesting counterpoint, suggesting that Rick's enjoyment of the brutal violence may reflect the audience's own attraction to violent entertainment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. The success of *The Purge* films might reveal a societal tendency to enjoy watching shocking violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

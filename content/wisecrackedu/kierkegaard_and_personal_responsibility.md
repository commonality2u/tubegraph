Søren Kierkegaard, a Christian theorist and father of [[existentialism_and_radical_freedom_in_bojack_horseman|Existentialism]], viewed suffering as a critical part of personal and spiritual growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:12">[05:08:12]</a>. He believed that suffering purifies the sufferer, teaches them to appreciate life, and compels them to take responsibility for their actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:39">[05:39:39]</a>.

## Stages of Self-Development

Kierkegaard proposed that an individual must pass through three distinct phases to become their "true self" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:30">[05:51:30]</a>:
1.  **The Aesthetic** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:49">[05:56:49]</a>: Driven by sensual pleasures and lacking morality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:34">[05:58:34]</a>.
2.  **The Ethical** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:21">[06:01:21]</a>: Driven by morality and a belief in individual responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:57">[06:03:57]</a>.
3.  **The Religious** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:21">[06:06:21]</a>: Driven by faith in God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:56">[06:07:56]</a>.

Suffering is essential for moving to the next stage of human development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:15">[06:17:15]</a>. While Kierkegaard primarily referred to spiritual and [[suffering_and_ethical_selfunderstanding|existential suffering]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:23:09">[06:23:09]</a>, the *Saw* film series' Jigsaw character uses physical torture to force victims (often "aesthetes") into ethical dilemmas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:55">[06:33:55]</a>.

## Suffering and Self-Reflection

According to Kierkegaard, suffering compels individuals to reflect on their situation, leading to "the first doubt" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:07">[07:07:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:14">[07:14:14]</a>. This doubt is the thought, "Why is this happening to me; can it not be otherwise?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:51">[07:17:51]</a>. This moment generates an immediate desire for change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:17">[07:30:17]</a>, opening a person up to what Kierkegaard called "[[suffering_and_ethical_selfunderstanding|ethical self-understanding]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:18">[07:37:18]</a>.

> "Suffering is growth-inducing because it “turns the single individual over to himself completely.”" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42:12">[07:42:12]</a>

At its most successful, this suffering can force a person to repent for past sins, take responsibility for their guilt, and choose to seek their own survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:06">[07:47:06]</a>. As one progresses, a "false self" dies, making room for recreation into a better, truer self <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:57:07">[07:57:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:13:00">[08:13:00]</a>.

## Personal Responsibility and Choice

Kierkegaard valued personal responsibility, stating that the first indispensable step to becoming "a real man" is by becoming a "responsible individual before God" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:33:54">[09:33:54]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:40:54">[09:40:54]</a>. The key to taking responsibility is making a choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:52:13">[09:52:13]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:07">[09:55:07]</a>.

Kierkegaard believed that "in the moment of making a choice, a man 'becomes himself'" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:11:06">[10:11:06]</a>. This highlights the transformative power of agency in shaping one's identity and moral standing.

Director Ari Aster's 2019 film *Midsommar* captivated horror fans as a follow-up to his 2018 film *Hereditary* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Described by Jordan Peele as "the most idyllic horror film of all time," *Midsommar* prompts an examination of its deeper meaning beyond its gruesome imagery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. The film explores themes of community, alienation, and the reassertion of ritualistic value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

## Film Recap

*Midsommar* introduces Dani, a young woman grappling with a strained relationship with her boyfriend, Christian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Following a family tragedy where her sister kills herself and their parents, Christian, motivated by guilt, invites Dani to join him and his anthropology grad school friends on a trip to Sweden for a rare "once every 96 years" midsummer festival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

Upon arriving at an seemingly idyllic Swedish commune, the events quickly turn bizarre <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Two elders commit ritualistic suicide by jumping off a cliff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>, one of the local women places a pubic hair in Christian's pie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>, and people engage in dancing and moaning while under the influence of hallucinogens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. The foreign visitors begin to disappear or are killed in horrifying ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

Meanwhile, Dani's experience takes a different turn: she wins an all-girls stone dance competition, is crowned May Queen, and is celebrated by the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. Christian is drawn into a sex ritual, which Dani witnesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. The film culminates in a human sacrifice, where Dani, as May Queen, selects Christian to be the ninth person burned alive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Dani smiles as he and others burn, signifying her full integration into the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

## Ari Aster's Portrayal of Rituals

[[ari_asters_portrayal_of_rituals_in_midsommar | Ari Aster's portrayal of rituals in Midsommar]] blends authentic [[influence_of_swedish_culture_and_mythology_in_midsommar | Swedish culture and mythology]] with invented, darker elements, creating a unique horror experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

### Authentic Elements

While *Midsommar* depicts a bloodbath, traditional Midsummer in Sweden is a light and happy holiday celebrating summer, fertility, and involves dancing around maypoles, decorating with plants, and visiting holy springs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

Aster did extensive research, drawing from Swedish traditions and folklore, as well as Norse mythology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>:
*   **Hårga Village**: Hårga is a real rural village <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.
*   **Imagery**: Much of the film's imagery, including the maypole, and paintings on barn walls, is consistent with real Swedish Midsummer celebrations and agrarian societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
*   **Customs**: Characters eat herring and wear flower wreaths, which are real Swedish customs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
*   **Religious Traditions**: Aster incorporated elements like the blessing of the crops from James George Fraser's 19th-century anthropological study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.
*   **Runic Alphabet**: Aster learned the Scandinavian runic alphabet, and every Hårga clothing item is decorated with specifically chosen runic symbols and an invented hieroglyphic language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

### Invented Elements

Many of the more horrifying aspects of the film are Aster's inventions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>:
*   **Sacrifices**: The death rituals, such as elders jumping off cliffs and human sacrifices, are not part of Midsummer history, even in ancient times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. However, Aster was likely inspired by debated Viking mythology and folklore which depict sacrifices, including humans, every nine years, though scholars dispute their occurrence after 1050 A.D. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
*   **Sex Rituals**: The "weird sex stuff" was completely Aster's "twisted brainchild" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. Although baby-making is associated with Midsummer, leading to a spike in births nine months after the solstice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
*   **Psychedelics**: While Swedes celebrate with alcohol, they are "far more likely to get boozy than they are to trip balls" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

## Symbolism in *Midsommar*

*Midsommar* is rich with symbolism drawn from its unique blend of folklore and invention:
*   **Runic Symbols**:
    *   Christian's white robe, worn before the fertility ceremony, is decorated with the upwards-arrow Tiwaz symbol, associated with the Norse god Tyr, representing bravery, masculine energy, and virility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. Tyr sacrifices his hand to save the world, which is fitting for Christian, who is about to be sacrificed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.
    *   Dani's dress features two runes: an R-shaped Rivo, symbolizing journey, and an hourglass-shaped Thaugs, which can mean new beginning or loss of hope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. Both are relevant to her journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
*   **Bear Carcass**: Christian is placed inside a bear carcass before being burned alive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. Bears are significant in Norse mythology; Viking men wore bear skins in battle, believing them to offer protection, possibly even from fire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.
*   **Blood Eagle**: The grotesque fate of Simon, splayed open with his lungs still breathing, is a reenactment of the "blood eagle," a Viking torture ritual first documented in 865 A.D. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.
*   **Love Rituals**:
    *   Hårga women picking different types of flowers, in real life, would pick seven kinds to put under their pillow to dream of their future mate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. Instead, Christian's seducer, Maja, places a carved love rune under his bed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.
    *   Christian's pie containing a pubic hair and his drink being redder (suggesting menstrual blood) are described by Aster as coming from actual Swedish folklore and lore for love spells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

## Themes: Community and Belonging

[[comparative_perspectives_on_community_and_belonging_in_midsommar | Comparative perspectives on community and belonging in Midsommar]] are vividly portrayed through the contrasting experiences of Dani and her American counterparts.

### Dani's Journey from Alienation to Belonging
Dani begins the film entrenched in a "cold, alienating secular society" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. Her world is depicted with muted colors, "icy lonely city streets," and a clear absence of community and emotional support after the loss of her family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. Her conversations are often isolated, either by phone or through mirrors, symbolizing a lack of genuine connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. Her boyfriend constantly tries to distance himself, forgetting her birthday and pressuring her to take hallucinogens despite her panic attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.

In contrast, the Hårga community offers what Dani lacks: "love, empathy, and community" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. They move and behave "like different parts of the same organism," embodying shared catharsis in both pain and pleasure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. When an elder fails to die instantly from a cliff jump, the tribe moans in unison, sharing his pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. Similarly, during Christian's sex ritual, the women moan in unison with Maja, sharing her pleasure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. Aster notes their language is "empathy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

Dani's transformation is gradual but profound:
*   **Emersion**: Initially intimidated by their unity, Dani becomes increasingly immersed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. After witnessing the sacrifice, she listens attentively to an elder explain life as a "circle, a recycle," an idea appealing to someone who recently lost her entire family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.
*   **Costume**: Her clothing changes from dark "real world" attire to Hårga traditional wear, culminating in a full dress and flower wreath before the Maypole dance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.
*   **Shared Experience**: During the Maypole dance, she takes hallucinogens in a ritualized motion, sharing the experience with the Hårga girls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. Despite being "slightly off rhythm," she is led into the dance, and it's the first time the audience sees her "truly smile," moving as part of the "singular Hårga organism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.
*   **Catharsis**: The most critical moment occurs after she sees Christian's infidelity. Her uncontrollable tears, echoing her earlier grief, are met with a group of Hårga women crying in tandem, sharing her emotional load and empathizing completely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.
*   **Surrender to Nature**: Dani's increasing integration into the cult is mirrored by her immersion into nature, hallucinating grass growing on her hands and feet, and becoming covered in flowers as May Queen, symbolizing her surrender to this agrarian society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>.
*   **Final Act**: Her new allegiance is solidified when she chooses Christian for the final sacrifice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. Watching him burn, she experiences both pain and joy, smiling as the "vestiges of her former life crumble" and she is "free to start anew in a community where she can belong and be seen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.

### The Detached Outsiders
In stark contrast, Christian and his friends approach the Hårga people with "condescending distance," like anthropology students observing a thesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. They sneak into temples for photos of sacred texts and watch rituals as if "surveilling animals at a zoo" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. Mark, one of the friends, exemplifies this disrespect by urinating on a sacred tree and not comprehending the Hårga's reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>. Their detached and intrigued approach mirrors the audience's own alienation from the value of ancient rituals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.

## Reassertion of Ritual

Aster uses *Midsommar* to constantly play into and subvert modern secular aversion to mystical traditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. As theologian David Bentley Hart notes, contemporary society often leans towards "comfortable nihilism," seeing ritual acts as "primitive and potentially barbaric" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>. The film's choice of "very religious Swedes" as the boogeyman, rather than a typical serial killer, speaks to society's fear and aversion to ritual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>.

At the same time, Aster presents the Hårga clan as the solution to Dani's problems, offering her "complete acceptance, genuine reciprocity, and total empathy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>. Thus, *Midsommar* serves as a "shocking reassertion of the value of ritual" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>. No matter how irrational these acts may seem, they serve a "very rational purpose: to build community and a sense of belonging" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>. This layered exploration of themes and symbolism makes *Midsommar* a "wisecrack certified deep" film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.

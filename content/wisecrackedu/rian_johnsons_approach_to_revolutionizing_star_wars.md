From: [[wisecrackedu]] <br/> 

*The Last Jedi* generated significant [[star_wars_fan_backlash_and_criticism | fan backlash]] and [[fan_reaction_to_the_last_jedi | criticism]] from many fans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Common complaints included Luke Skywalker's portrayal as a "green milk-chugging coward," Snoke's quick demise, Holdo's illogical plan, the boring Canto Bight section, Rey's parents being a "red herring," and excessive Marvel humor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This article explores how [[impact_of_rian_johnsons_creative_decisions | Rian Johnson tried to revolutionize Star Wars]] with this film, and where the attempt may have fallen short <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## Meta-Commentary on New vs. Old Star Wars

*The Last Jedi* engages in a meta-commentary on the relationship between the [[disneys_acquisition_and_changes_to_star_wars_canon | new Star Wars]] and the original trilogy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. *The Force Awakens* depicted Kylo Ren burdened by the legacy of Darth Vader, mirroring the new series' pressure to live up to the original trilogy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. Just as Kylo Ren mimicked Vader, *The Force Awakens* mimicked *A New Hope*, being "almost beat per beat the same movie" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

However, in *The Last Jedi*, Snoke's command for Kylo to remove his "ridiculous thing off" and Kylo's subsequent destruction of his mask, along with Luke throwing away his lightsaber, signaled a shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. Johnson aimed to telegraph to his audience that the film would no longer rehash the original trilogy but would be a [[metaphors_and_thematic_subversion_in_the_last_jedi | radical subversion of the Star Wars formula]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. The message was clear: "For the new Star Wars to live, the old Star Wars must die" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

## Abrasive Subversion of Tropes

Johnson sought progress by "abrasively undermin[ing] the tropes and traditions that characterized the previous films" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>:
*   **Protagonist's Lineage:** Unlike Luke Skywalker, Rey's parents were "degenerate winos" and "filthy junk traders" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.
*   **Hero Archetypes:** Heroes became "janitors and mechanics" instead of "politicians and princesses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
*   **Luke Skywalker:** Portrayed as a "failed nephew murder/slovenian philosopher" rather than an idealistic hero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.
*   **Yoda and the Jedi Order:** Yoda became a "would-be book burner," and the Jedi Order was depicted as flawed, with a "legacy of failure. Hypocrisy. Hubris" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. Their actions, such as allowing Darth Sidious to rise and the creation of Darth Vader, were highlighted as failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

Johnson seemed to imply that the lack of progress in the galaxy, evident in the rise of a "nearly identical Nazi-inspired fascistic order" (the First Order) after the Empire's collapse, was due to an inadequate conception of [[philosophical_insights_into_the_star_wars_legitimation_crisis | good and evil]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

## Jungian Psychology and the Shadow Archetype

Johnson's approach delves into concepts from Joseph Campbell's "The Hero with a Thousand Faces," which heavily influenced George Lucas and is based on [[jungian_psychology_and_the_last_jedi | Carl Jung]]'s work on archetypes and the collective unconscious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. Johnson sought to complicate the audience's relationship to the dark side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

### The Shadow in Star Wars

Jung's "shadow" archetype represents the "primal or animal part of our unconscious that tends to get repressed — the ‘dark side’" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. In the monomyth, the shadow is embodied by a character reflecting the protagonist's shortcomings and fears, such as Gollum to Frodo or Darth Vader to Luke Skywalker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. The original Star Wars emphasized conquering inner demons, with Luke sparing Vader's life to avoid succumbing to anger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

*The Last Jedi* suggests a different perspective on balance in the Force. While traditional Star Wars desired balance for the galaxy's good, Johnson's film implies the Force inherently promotes balance: "When the darkness rises, the force amplifies the light to balance it out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. Snoke's dialogue even suggests that a powerful Jedi order would be met by an equally powerful dark side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.

Luke's criticism hints that the Jedi Order, in part, is to blame for the "cyclical rise and fall of these fascist empires" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. The film suggests the dark side is not merely to be conquered, as that would cause the Force to "overcorrect" and amplify evil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.

### Jungian Perspectives on Repression and Conflict

[[jungian_psychology_and_the_last_jedi | Jungian analyst, Robert A. Johnson]] (not to be confused with Rian Johnson) argues against conquering and expunging "dark sides." He states that repression causes an "ego split" and forces individuals to scapegoat others, leading to "never-ending fight" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. The original *Star Wars* literally projected Luke's inner demons onto Darth Vader, an "evil space wizard" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.

[[impact_of_rian_johnsons_creative_decisions | Rian Johnson tweaks the basic Jung-ish formula]] by attempting to complicate the classic [[good_versus_evil_in_star_wars_mythology | good and evil]] distinction. If conquering evil with good hasn't prevented the Empire's return as the First Order, the galaxy might need to reconcile with its dark side for true balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

## DJ's Moral Ambiguity

The character of DJ (Benicio del Toro) exemplifies this moral complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. He rejects the traditional "purely good Rebels and purely evil oppressors," revealing that "even the good guys can get caught up with the darker elements of the universe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. DJ's cynicism sees through the "false divisions of 'good' and evil,'" highlighting arms dealers selling weapons to both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.

This marks a significant, morally ambiguous moment in Star Wars, complicating the understanding of the Rebellion as infallibly good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. Robert A. Johnson warns that the inability to reconcile with one's shadow leads to scapegoating, violence, war, and racism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. *The Last Jedi* suggests "a system at play" rather than clear-cut good guys and bad guys, criticizing the galaxy's military economy and its inherent exploitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

## The Backpedal: What Went Wrong?

Despite its efforts to revolutionize Star Wars by suggesting the "past" must die—whether it be the film structure or its moral lens—*The Last Jedi* ultimately backpedals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. Kylo Ren offers Rey a chance to "end all the dogmatism of the previous films" by joining him and letting "Snoke. Skywalker. The Sith. The Jedi. The rebels. Let it all die" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>. However, Rey rejects this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.

The film then proceeds to reaffirm the very things it seemed to tear down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>:
*   **Heroic Archetypes:** The legend of Luke Skywalker is reaffirmed, inspiring the galaxy, even if based on a lie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>.
*   **Established Orders:** Despite Luke's earlier call for the Jedi to die, Rey proclaims, "And I will not be the last Jedi" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.
*   **Narrative Structure:** The film reverts to the original trilogy's established narrative tropes, like the "strike me down" trope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.
*   **Jedi Past:** The Jedi books are saved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.

The film's ideological shift is perplexing, with Luke suddenly reaffirming antiquated ideas seemingly without sufficient motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>. The film makes a "psychologically sophisticated case" for Rey to team with Ren, suggesting the old ways lead to a "galactic game of Nazi Whack-a-Mole" and that radical change is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. Ren, having confronted his good and bad sides, is arguably closer to "Jungian balance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>, offering Rey the reconciliation of ego and shadow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>.

However, Rey chooses to remain the "good Jedi," adhering to the old moral code of "morally-pure, infallible hero" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>. The critique suggests that after spending so much time "abrasively subverting everything we love and know about Star Wars," to "shrug and revert back to where we started" is "less cool" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.

The Walt Disney Company has evolved from an industry giant into an absolute behemoth, significantly impacting global cultural storytelling [00:02:31]. While enjoying immense success, the company's approach to adapting existing narratives raises questions about its broader cultural influence [00:01:13].

## Disney's Dominance and Acquisition Strategy
Disney has achieved unparalleled market dominance, owning or licensing a vast array of intellectual properties from *Star Wars* and *X-Men* to Pixar and Marvel [00:00:26]. In 2019, Disney films like *Endgame*, *Aladdin*, [[themes_and_symbolism_in_disneys_frozen | Frozen 2]], and *Toy Story 4* accounted for seven of the top ten highest-grossing films [00:00:48]. Many of the top 50 highest-grossing films of all time were either produced by or later acquired by Disney [00:00:57].

This [[disneys_acquisition_strategy_and_market_dominance | acquisition strategy and market dominance]] can be traced back to founder Walt Disney's early experiences [00:02:41]. After losing the rights to "Oswald the Lucky Rabbit" and having his animators poached, Walt Disney vowed to "own everything that he made after that" [00:03:09]. His early success, notably with *Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs* in 1937, established a formula: find an existing story, make it "cute and wholesome," and maximize potential audience for profit [00:03:41]. This method of acquiring, adapting, and twisting original artistic intentions has become a consistent Disney practice [00:04:24].

## The "Cutesy Aesthetic" and its Consequences
Disney's distinct aesthetic, characterized by "round faces, saucer eyes, [and] big goofy grins," has been a deliberate strategy [00:04:08]. Walt Disney was "ruthless in his quest to make all things adorable" [00:04:20]. This drive for cuteness, however, has often led to the [[criticism_of_disneys_adaptations_of_iconic_stories | criticism of Disney's adaptations of iconic stories]] by bleaching stories in a "caustic vat of cuteness" and stripping them of their original artistic intentions [00:08:24]. This "Disney meat grinder" polishes off any "rough and unsavory edges" from classic tales [00:09:57].

### Case Studies in Adaptation

#### Pinocchio
Disney's *Pinocchio* (1940) portrays the titular puppet as a naive character who earns his wish to become a "real boy" by being brave, truthful, and unselfish, culminating in a happy ending after sacrificing himself to save his father [00:04:43].

However, the original 1883 novel by Carlo Collodi intended a much darker fate for Pinocchio [00:05:58]. In Collodi's initial ending, Pinocchio is "gruesomely hanged" by assassins, left to "hung stiff and insensible" [00:06:11]. This bleak outcome, which inspired angry fan mail leading to a continuation, was consistent with Collodi's intent for the story to be a "bleak morality tale" with the simple moral: "be good or suffer" [00:07:06]. The original Pinocchio was a "mean-spirited and rude" character who suffered consequences for his actions, including being robbed, starved, and having his legs sawed off [00:07:21]. Disney's version removed these dark, satiric overtones, transforming Pinocchio into a "naive piece of pine" and altering his angular character design to be more "adorable" [00:08:39].

#### The Little Mermaid
The 1989 Disney classic, *The Little Mermaid*, is a "timeless story" of a mermaid making a "faustian bargain" for legs to win a prince, ending happily ever after with true love conquering all [00:10:23].

Hans Christian Andersen's original 1837 tale, however, rejected this "happily ever after" message [00:10:30]. Andersen's story emphasizes suffering; the mermaid not only gives away her voice but also endures agonizing pain with every step she takes on land [00:11:08]. Crucially, the prince never reciprocates her affection, marrying a local princess instead [00:11:20]. Andersen aimed for a moral about sacrifice and divine reward, not romantic love. The mermaid gains a soul not through a kiss, but through a "Christ-like sacrifice" where she gives up her life to save the prince, becoming a "gentle spirit" who must help mankind for 300 years to earn a soul [00:12:09]. Andersen would have "despised Disney's ending" [00:12:02].

### Wider Implications of Whitewashing
Beyond specific examples, Disney's consistent practice of scrubbing "dark and unsavory edges" from stories has significant consequences [00:13:01]. For instance, Disney's *Pocahontas* provides a "shitty history lesson" about colonial kidnapping and murder, presenting it as a love story [00:13:06]. Similarly, the original *Sleeping Beauty* is a "literally about a woman being non-consensually impregnated in her sleep and giving birth to twins also in her sleep" [00:12:47].

By replacing complex, often dark narratives with "bland wholesome" ones, Disney inadvertently creates new, potentially "destructive" narratives [00:14:02]. Psychologist Susan Darker Smith points out that young girls identifying with characters like Cinderella or Belle, who believe "love conquers all," are more likely to end up in abusive relationships [00:14:16]. This [[critique_of_disneys_portrayal_of_relationships | critique of Disney's portrayal of relationships]] highlights how the company fails to equip children with tools for navigating "real life problems," which was a core purpose of original fairy tales â€“ to prepare children for "the darker and crueler aspects of life" [00:14:45].

## The Business of Cuteness: "Evil Cute"
According to free market economist Milton Friedman, a company's "only responsibility is to make more money" [00:15:00]. This capitalist principle explains Disney's operation as a "cuteness factory" [00:15:30]. When Disney experimented with "grimmer, edgier films" like *The Black Cauldron* in the 1970s and 80s, they were "huge box office failures" [00:15:37]. The "Disney Renaissance" of the 1990s was a "major course correction" back to the "sentimental cuteness" that has sustained the company [00:15:50].

This [[the_commercialization_of_fairy_tales_by_Disney | commercialization of fairy tales by Disney]] leverages the power of cuteness to "hijack our brains" [00:16:00]. Studies show that cuteness increases concentration and activates the brain's pleasure center, pumping out dopamine [00:16:06]. Cultural theorist Joshua Paul Dale calls the phenomenon of cuteness used for "potentially nefarious purposes" "evil cute" [00:16:40]. Ultimately, for Disney, cuteness is a "means to pad its bottom line," regardless of whether the stories are "ultimately good for children" [00:16:59].

## Concerns for the Future of Storytelling
Disney's influence extends to more contemporary and iconic cultural works. Fans have expressed despair over creative choices in the *Star Wars* franchise since Disney's acquisition, noting a quick course correction towards a "sweet conclusion based on a magical kiss, romantic sacrifice and... everyone you care about is jedi royalty" [00:17:21]. This pattern suggests that "no property or franchise which Disney won't find a way to wrap its cute little tentacles around" [00:17:55].

As Disney continues to expand, there's a reasonable worry that its "blanket philosophy of cuteness" will also expand, potentially at the "expense of story nuance and morality" [00:18:08]. This raises concerns for the future of franchises like *X-Men*, as it's "hard to imagine Disney signing off on something as subversive as *Logan*" [00:18:21]. The increasing consolidation of media under Disney's ownership may mean less space for "grittier, darker stories" and "grown up fairy tales" in the cultural landscape [00:18:28].

[[alan_moores_influence_on_comics_and_culture | Alan Moore]], author of acclaimed comics like *Watchmen*, *Miracleman*, and *The Killing Joke*, identifies as a ritual magician <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. He describes his magical practice not as pulling rabbits from hats, but in the vein of a "Steven Strange variety that consults grimoires and conjures demons" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>. While this might initially seem like superstition, Moore's perspective reveals a fascinating philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>.

## Hermeticism: The Root of Moore's Magic

Moore is a dedicated student of Hermeticism, which is understood less as a rigid religion and more as a collection of interconnected practices and principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>. The primary goal of Hermeticism is to gain an understanding of the world through three methods: [[alchemy_as_science_and_its_moral_implications | alchemy]], astrology, and theurgy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>. Theurgy, in this context, refers to the process of achieving spiritual perfection to draw closer to God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>.

Hermetic teachings are largely based on the *Corpus Hermeticum*, attributed to the mythical figure Hermes Trismegistus, a fusion of the Greek god Hermes and the Egyptian god Thoth, both associated with language and wisdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>. For Moore, this combination of language and understanding forms the very essence of magic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.

## Magic as Engaging with Consciousness

In his upcoming work, *The Moon and Serpent Bumper Book of Magic*, Moore defines magic as "a purposeful engagement with the phenomena and possibilities of consciousness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>. This concept hinges on the idea that reality can be divided into two categories: the material and the immaterial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>.

*   **The Material** encompasses physical elements such as matter, energy, space, time, and fundamental forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:00">[03:23:00]</a>. However, humans do not directly experience these <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>. Instead, sensory information is processed by the brain to create a mental model of the external world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>.
*   **The Immaterial** is this mental model, the internal perception of reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>.

Moore illustrates the profound interplay between the material and immaterial:
*   An immaterial idea, like Moore's concept for *Watchmen*, becomes material when artist Dave Gibbons gives it form through pencils on a page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>.
*   Conversely, a material sound, such as spoken words, can alter one's immaterial perception, conjuring an image in the mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>. This act, for Moore, is a "genuine spell" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>.

Therefore, magic, to Moore, acts as a bridge between the material and the immaterial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>. Art, language, and symbols are the tools, or "real wizard's wands," that facilitate this connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:00">[04:34:00]</a>. He asserts that magic, art, language, and consciousness are so intertwined they become "different aspects of the same phenomenon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:00">[04:38:00]</a>.

### Storytelling as Spell-Craft

The principle of changing perception through narrative is exemplified by the rabbit-duck illusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>. Initially seeing a duck doesn't fix its meaning; being told it's also a rabbit causes a shift in perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>. This is "storytelling as spell-craft," capable of both casting and dispelling illusions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>.

As an anarchist, Moore views money as a "destructive illusion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:00">[05:14:00]</a>. In *Miracleman*, the protagonist abolishes money, revealing its illusory nature: "Money’s imaginary. Real if we believe in it… Come summer, money won’t exist. But then it never did" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>.

*Promethea* further demonstrates this magical alteration of perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>. When protagonist Sophie faces the demon-king Asmodeus, her initial anger shifts to acceptance that "so-called demons are just a part of human-nature" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>. This change in internal perception causes Asmodeus to transform into a human, explaining, "Approach us with fear, with hatred and revulsion, and we will be fearsome, hateful, and vile. Approach us humanely and with respect, and we will be human and respectable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:13:00">[06:13:00]</a>. For a magician, "expectation creates perspective" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:24:00">[06:24:00]</a>. Even Doctor Manhattan from *Watchmen* is described as a magician in this sense, his blue, ageless appearance being a reflection of his internal self-perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:00">[06:28:00]</a>.

## Hermetic Principles in Moore's Work

Moore integrates specific Hermetic principles throughout his storytelling to influence perception on a grand scale.

### Macrocosm and Microcosm: "As Above, So Below"

One of Hermeticism's most famous principles is "macrocosm and microcosm," expressed in the maxim "As above, so below" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:00">[07:04:00]</a>. This idea suggests that every level of reality reflects every other, like an "infinite fractal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:00">[07:10:00]</a>. Understanding a part of the pattern allows for a better understanding of the whole, enabling movement from lower to higher levels of comprehension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a>.

In *Promethea*, the series' structure is deliberately based on the Kabbalah's Tree of Life, which repeats at both macrocosmic (entirety of existence) and microcosmic (individual soul) levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35:00">[07:35:00]</a>. Moore views the Tree of Life as a "roadmap to all reality, including our inner lives" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>:

*   **Bottom Rung:** Mere perception (e.g., seeing the rabbit or duck) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:55:00">[07:55:00]</a>.
*   **Above that:** Imagination (ability to form mental models) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>.
*   **Above that:** Art and language (tying ideas to sounds, symbols, pictures, stories) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a>.
*   **Above that:** Emotion and reason <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:13:00">[08:13:00]</a>.

At a macroscopic level, the physical universe represents the "basest sphere of the world's soul," followed by the collective unconscious, and at the very top, "The All. The One. God" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:17:00">[08:17:00]</a>. This structure is mirrored in *Promethea*'s thirty-two issues, corresponding to the ten Spheres and twenty-two Paths of the Tree of Life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:00">[08:31:00]</a>. The final thirty-second issue, with its thirty-two pages each expounding on a Path, acts as a deliberate microcosm of the entire series, reinforcing the "As above, so below" principle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:38:00">[08:38:00]</a>.

### Solve et Coagula: "Separate and Combine"

Another Hermetic principle Moore employs is "Solve et Coagula," meaning "Separate and Combine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03:00">[09:03:00]</a>. This involves breaking a thing down into its component parts to better understand how the whole functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03:00">[09:03:00]</a>.

*   **Doctor Manhattan's Arc:** In *Watchmen*, Doctor Manhattan initially excels at "separate," detaching from humanity by mentally breaking down humans into "abstract arrangements of atoms" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:00">[09:09:00]</a>. His breakthrough on Mars is learning to "recombine" and perceive humans as "holistic four-dimensional objects" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:40:00">[09:40:00]</a>.
*   **Promethea's Sixth Issue:** Sophie defeats writer Marto Neptura, who wields power over the land of fiction, by understanding that Neptura is a collective pen name of various novelists. By recognizing his "separate unique styles," she overcomes him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:48:00">[09:48:00]</a>.

## Prophecies of the World's End

Moore suggests that if a sufficiently compelling story can change individual perception, a story that serves as a complete model of the world could change the perception of the entire human species <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:13:00">[10:13:00]</a>. For Moore, when a collective way of viewing the world ends, "the World ends" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:24:00">[10:24:00]</a>.

In *Promethea*, Sophie's task is to bring about such an "Apocalypse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:29:00">[10:29:00]</a>. Margaret, a previous Promethea, explains that humans are "amphibious," living in both "matter and mind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:32:00">[10:32:00]</a>. *Promethea* aims to make people more aware of the "vast immaterial realm," tempting them to explore it, leading to a "great Devonian leap from sea to land" – from matter to mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:41:00">[10:41:00]</a>. Moore believes humanity's first "purposeful engagement with the phenomena and possibilities of consciousness" through representation and language led to the birth of human culture, including writing, painting, and science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:58:00">[10:58:00]</a>. In the same way, this idea of "the world" can also end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:33:00">[11:33:00]</a>. Sophie achieves this in the comics by explaining Hermetic principles, causing everyone to perceive the immaterial and material worlds as equally real <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:39:00">[11:39:00]</a>.

Moore himself has contemplated a similar end for the real world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:52:00">[11:52:00]</a>. In *Promethea*'s twelfth issue, he uses the Tarot to trace the world's history, predicting a "coming leap to expanded consciousness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:00:00">[12:00:00]</a>. In 1999, he predicted the end of the world as we know it would occur in 2017, when the sum total of human knowledge would double every half-second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:20:00">[12:20:00]</a>. This rapid influx of knowledge, he theorized, would make old ways of understanding obsolete, necessitating new ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:31:00">[12:31:00]</a>.

Although 2017 passed without this prophetic end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:41:00">[12:41:00]</a>, Moore himself attempted to "herald the Apocalypse" in September 2016 with the release of his magnum opus, *Jerusalem* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:47:00">[12:47:00]</a>. While *Promethea* was a "spell" to change individual minds, *Jerusalem* was intended as a "ritual" for worldwide revelation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:02:00">[13:02:00]</a>. Moore describes it as his "most sophisticated and complex magical working thus far," aimed at having a "beneficial effect upon the consciousness of its readership" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:11:00">[13:11:00]</a>.

## Experiencing Higher Consciousness Through Language

In *Jerusalem*, Moore constructs the narrative to allow the reader to experience the higher states of consciousness being described <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:36:00">[13:36:00]</a>. This is evident in a chapter told from the perspective of Lucia Joyce, confined in an asylum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:50:00">[13:50:00]</a>. Moore employs a linguistic style similar to her father's *Finnegans Wake*, full of puns, portmanteaus, and neologisms, to replicate Lucia's condition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:56:00">[13:56:00]</a>. He explores the idea that individuals exhibiting certain forms of "insanity" might be closer to perceiving external reality than those deemed "sane" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:05:00">[14:05:00]</a>.

Doctor Manhattan, perceiving every moment of his life simultaneously, is presented as more "sane" than those who fall prey to the "stubbornly persistent illusion" of linear time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:14:00">[14:14:00]</a>. Moore aims to habituate readers to perceive these normally unperceived dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:42:00">[14:42:00]</a>. He applies "Solve et Coagula" to language itself, separating phonetics (how words sound) from graphetics (how words appear) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:47:00">[14:47:00]</a>. By writing dialogue that looks like gibberish but makes sense when read phonetically, Moore forces the reader to engage with multiple layers of meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:00:00">[15:00:00]</a>. This method teaches the reader to perceive more dimensions in text, mirroring the theme of the universe having more dimensions than normally perceived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:39:00">[15:39:00]</a>. This is magic: changing how the mind models the world by altering the language used to construct that model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:47:00">[15:47:00]</a>.

While Moore's grand revelation may not have materialized in 2017, his status as an influential writer in comics ensures his literary efforts will continue to impact readers for centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:11:00">[16:11:00]</a>. If Moore is correct, magic is "at least as real as our imagination" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:23:00">[16:23:00]</a>.

As *Promethea*'s revelation states, speaking directly to the reader:
> "I’m an idea, but I’m a real idea. I’m the idea of human imagination, which, when you think about it, is the only thing we can really be certain isn’t imaginary… See, I’m imagination. I’m real and I’m the best friend you’ve ever had. Who do you think got you all this cool stuff? The clothes you wear, the room, the house, the city that you’re in. Everything in it started out in human imagination. Your lives, your personalities, your whole world. All invented… There’s nothing here but a funny little twist of amino acids playing a marvelous game of pretend" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:34:00">[16:34:00]</a>.

To this list, the highly imaginative works of [[alan_moores_influence_on_comics_and_culture | Alan Moore]] can certainly be added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:13:00">[17:13:00]</a>.

The book *[[plot_summary_of_lord_of_the_flies | Lord of the Flies]]* by William Golding begins when a G5 full of "prissy British boys" crash lands on a remote island in the Pacific <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Among the survivors are Ralph, Piggy, Jack, and Simon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. The novel can be seen as an [[allegorical_themes_in_lord_of_the_flies | allegorical effort]] to trace the origin of societal flaws back to human nature, reminding us of humanity's capacity for evil and the superficiality of man-made moral systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

## Key Characters

### Ralph
Initially, Ralph and Piggy find a large shell, which they call "the conch," to gather the boys and conduct "bidness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. The children appoint Ralph as their leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. When concerns about a monster arise, Ralph attempts to calm the fear, stating that the perceived monster is "all in yo head, son" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. His leadership is later challenged by Jack, who claims Ralph "ain’t got the balls to be the leader" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

During a frenzied dance, Ralph participates in the killing of Simon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. After Jack's group steals Piggy's glasses, Ralph confronts Jack, leading to a brawl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. Outnumbered after Piggy's death, Ralph flees to the shore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. He is discovered by a Naval officer just as he is about to collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Ralph's eventual "fallin' at the navy man’s feet" is a recurring pattern emphasizing the "fall of human kind" throughout the book <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

### Piggy
Piggy assists Ralph in finding and using the conch to organize the boys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. He also gets "some licks in" during the chaotic killing of Simon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. Jack's group later storms Ralph's camp and steals Piggy’s glasses, which are crucial for making fire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. During the confrontation between Ralph and Jack, Piggy is thrown off a cliff, and the conch shatters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

Piggy's loss of sight (his glasses) symbolizes the "fall of reason" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. When Jack's "punk" gang takes Piggy's glasses to make a fire, it signifies a transition from the "reign of reason" to the "reign of savagery" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

### Jack
Jack is appointed as the head hunter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. Initially hesitant to kill for food, he soon overcomes this, "busts his cherry," and hunts a pig <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. After claiming to have seen the beast, Jack blows the conch and asserts that Ralph is an unfit leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. He invites others to leave Ralph's "posse" and join his "new crew" for meat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

Jack and his group kill another pig, impaling its head on a stick as an offering to the beast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. His posse later storms Ralph's "crib" and steals Piggy’s glasses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

### Simon
Simon experiences a vision of the pig's head talking to him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. This pig head, referred to as "The Lord of the Flies," reveals to Simon that the beast is not something to be hunted, but rather the "violence in dem kids hearts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. When Simon returns to camp, the other boys mistake him for the beast and kill him in a "cracked out frenzy," with even Ralph and Piggy participating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

## Symbolic Figures and Their Meaning

### The Beast / The Lord of the Flies
The "beast" initially feared by the younger boys is revealed through Simon's vision to be the innate violence within the children themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. The pig-head on a stick, "The Lord of the Flies," is another name for Beelzebub, the "prince of demons," also known as "THE DEVIL" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. This figure represents the "destruction, decay and demoralization of man kind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.

If viewed through a Freudian lens, The Lord of the Flies can be seen as representing "the id," which functions solely to ensure survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. When the id is in charge, "Laws, moral codes, even intelligence itself don’t mean jack shit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

### The Naval Officer
The arrival of the Naval officer at the end of the story might suggest a return to righteousness in adult life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. However, the tragic irony is that the soldier is himself "smack in the middle of a war," trying to get the drop on an enemy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. This highlights that "ain’t nobody to save civilized humanity from they violent nature neither" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

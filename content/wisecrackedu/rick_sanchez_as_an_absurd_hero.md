The season 3 premiere of [[rick_and_mortys_critique_of_conventional_morality | Rick and Morty]], "The Rickshank Redemption," ignited online discussion, moving beyond the initial anti-April Fool's prank to deeper philosophical themes, particularly related to a promotional Szechuan dipping sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The show frequently explores [[absurdism_and_existentialism_in_the_series | existential themes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>, including creations despairing over their existence, resentment towards creators, and Morty's unique philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

The series also delves into [[absurdism_and_existentialism_in_the_series | absurdism]], a concept related to existentialism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

## The Absurd Universe of Rick and Morty

According to French philosopher [[albert_camus_absurdism_and_its_reflections_in_bojack_horseman | Albert Camus]], human existence is cruel and absurd because humans seek meaning in a universe that remains silent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. The image of Sisyphus pushing a boulder uphill eternally serves as a metaphor for this human condition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. In line with [[albert_camus_absurdism_and_its_reflections_in_bojack_horseman | Camus]], [[rick_and_mortys_critique_of_conventional_morality | Rick and Morty]] portrays an absurd, meaningless multiverse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

Rick consistently trivializes everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>, disbelieving in concepts like love or tradition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. His companionship with Morty is even alleged to be a means to hide his genius brain waves from the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. "The Rickshank Redemption" further reinforces these themes, showcasing the arbitrary nature of social systems, mocking sentimentality, and highlighting the pointlessness of it all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

## Undermining Meaning and Hope

While both [[absurdism_and_existentialism_in_the_series | absurdism]] and [[absurdism_and_existentialism_in_the_series | existentialism]] acknowledge a meaningless world, the transition from Season 2 to Season 3 of [[rick_and_mortys_critique_of_conventional_morality | Rick and Morty]] solidifies its identity as an "absurd" work by dangling and then destroying meaning and hope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

At the end of Season 2, Rick momentarily breaks from his sociopathic behavior to experience a heartfelt moment at Birdperson's wedding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. However, this is immediately undercut by the revelation that Tammy is a spy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. This instance is notable because an external force, not Rick's own cynicism, thwarts his flirtation with being a caring individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

Later in the episode, after exposing his family to hardships from the Galactic Federation, Rick seemingly sacrifices himself by turning himself in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. This act suggests Rick might be grappling with meaning, choosing to "do right" by his family despite knowing the meaninglessness of love and life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. This cliffhanger hinted at a potential shift towards creating meaning in a meaningless world—an idea championed by many [[absurdism_and_existentialism_in_the_series | existentialists]], but firmly rejected by [[albert_camus_absurdism_and_its_reflections_in_bojack_horseman | Camus]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

### Camus's Critique of Meaning

[[albert_camus_absurdism_and_its_reflections_in_bojack_horseman | Camus]] criticized authors like Fyodor Dostoevsky for proposing absurd worlds where characters grasp life's frivolity, only to "chicken out" and retreat to the comfort of meaning, such as religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. For [[albert_camus_absurdism_and_its_reflections_in_bojack_horseman | Camus]], an absurd work "does not provide a reply" to the absurd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. [[absurdism_and_existentialism_in_the_series | Existentialists]] like [[jeanpaul_sartres_radical_freedom_as_depicted_in_bojack_horseman | Jean-Paul Sartre]] or Dostoevsky, though realizing existence's absurdity, fail by resorting to hope or attempts to create meaning, effectively "deifying what crushes them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

[[rick_and_mortys_critique_of_conventional_morality | Rick and Morty]], with "The Rickshank Redemption," defies expectations of a similar retreat into meaning, instead doubling down on the absurd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. Rick's imprisonment was merely a ploy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>, and the show promises an even darker journey, countering the prospect of a humanized Rick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. Much of the episode's [[comedy_of_the_absurd_and_existentialist_themes | comedy]] is not from joking about life's meaninglessness, but from mocking the audience's *attempt* to draw meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

For instance, the reveal of Beth and Diane's brutal murder and Rick's subsequent transformation into a deranged loner scientist—a tragic Walter White-style origin story—is presented to bait audience empathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. However, this is revealed to be a ruse, a joke on the audience's desire for a meaningful backstory to his madness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. [[rick_and_mortys_critique_of_conventional_morality | Rick and Morty]] not only evades meaning but seems to take "perverse joy" in manipulating the audience's search for hope, akin to [[albert_camus_absurdism_and_its_reflections_in_bojack_horseman | Camus]] making his point in the style of an internet troll <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

Similarly, Rick saving Earth from the Galactic Federation might tempt viewers to attribute a "greater good" motive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. Yet, Summer's comment suggests the new world order isn't much better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. The idea that Rick cares for Morty and Summer is also repeatedly toyed with: he rushes to save them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>, then shows casual disregard for Summer's life (which turns out to be a strategy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>, only to finally admit he saved them solely so Beth wouldn't kick him out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

## The Szechuan Sauce and the Absurd Hero

This brings the narrative to the Szechuan sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. Rick's stated motivation for his entire series arc is not family, justice, or love, but a forgotten promotional Mulan McNugget sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. This undercuts any potential for Rick to gain a sense of morality, suggesting his quest for this "random promotional condiment from the Clinton era" is the ultimate driving force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.

However, the show implies this love for Szechuan sauce itself means nothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. The quest for it isn't creating meaning; it's a reflection of the absurdity of being driven by *anything* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. In a meaningless world, why *not* dedicate oneself to an absurd quest for plum-flavored McNugget sauce, even for 9 seasons or 97 years? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a> The Szechuan sauce quest is meaningful only as a joke about meaninglessness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

[[albert_camus_absurdism_and_its_reflections_in_bojack_horseman | Camus]] defines an "Absurd hero" as someone who understands and finds happiness in life's pointlessness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. This hero must fully comprehend the "cosmic indifference" surrounding them, a state [[albert_camus_absurdism_and_its_reflections_in_bojack_horseman | Camus]] calls "lucid indifference" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

This description strongly aligns with Rick Sanchez <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>:
*   His existence is defined by his knowledge of a vast multiverse where everything terrible and good has happened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.
*   He reduces basic morals to genetic programming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.
*   Despite being capable of anything, he yearns only for Szechuan sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.

However, a crucial difference exists: true absurd heroes find happiness in the absurd, while Rick is depicted as being in "great pain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. Perhaps Rick's true character arc won't be about becoming more caring but about finding enjoyment in the absurdity of it all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

The "April Fool's joke" of the season premiere was not just the release of the episode, but the prospect of Rick finding meaning, particularly through the Szechuan sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. If viewers believed Rick's self-sacrifice indicated a belief in family, justice, or anything else, they were, in essence, "had" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.

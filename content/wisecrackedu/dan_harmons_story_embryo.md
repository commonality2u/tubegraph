Writer and showrunner Dan Harmon proposes that every story, from epic tales like *The Odyssey* to simple jokes, follows an 8-step structure he calls "the story embryo" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

## The Eight Steps of the Story Embryo
Harmon's universal story structure is as follows:
1.  A character is in a zone of comfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
2.  But they want something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
3.  They enter an unfamiliar situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
4.  Adapt to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
5.  Get what they wanted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
6.  Pay a heavy price for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
7.  Then return to their familiar situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
8.  Having changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

## Story Structure for Television
While the "story embryo" applies generally, its application changes based on genre and medium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. Television, unlike movies that aim to provide a 90-minute high, seeks to keep viewers watching indefinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. This often means TV shows prioritize preserving the status quo over significant change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. For example, Batman in *The Dark Knight Rises* leaves Gotham to start a new life, whereas in *Batman: The Animated Series*, each episode begins and ends with Batman fighting a new villain in the same old Gotham <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. Harmon suggests that television "swaps out any meaningful and therefore potentially television-subverting truth with the basic, eternal 'truth' that change is unnecessary" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

With this in mind, the structure of a typical TV episode looks more like this:
1.  "I (the protagonist) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>
2.  Notice a small problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
3.  And make a major decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
4.  This changes things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>
5.  To some satisfaction, but <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>
6.  There are consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>
7.  That must be undone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>
8.  And I must admit the futility of change" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

## Application in [[rick_and_morty_story_structure | Rick & Morty]]
Showrunners Dan Harmon and Justin Roiland masterfully apply this story structure in *[[rick_and_morty_story_structure | Rick & Morty]]* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. Every episode follows this format, as demonstrated in Season 2, Episode 6: "The Ricks Must Be Crazy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

### Step 1: Establish a protagonist in a zone of comfort
The episode opens with Summer, Rick, and Morty emerging from a movie called *Ball Fondlers*, immediately establishing the protagonists and their world in a relatable way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. This quick opening allows the audience to understand the characters and their reality, which includes details like "giant telepathic spiders, eleven 9/11s, aaaannnnnnddd the BEST ICE CREAM IN THE MULTIVERSE!!!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

### Step 2: Introduce a small problem and establish a need
Life isn't perfect, and for the Sanchez family, this realization comes when Rick's ship refuses to start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. Rick quickly identifies the problem: "looks like something’s wrong with the Microverse Battery. We’re going to have to go inside" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. Morty's reluctance to embark on this journey ("Um, go inside what?") is a narrative trick that helps the audience identify with him and become more invested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

### Step 3: The protagonist makes a major decision and enters an unfamiliar situation
The descent into the unknown begins as Rick and Morty literally shrink down to visit a world inside Rick’s car battery, posing as aliens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. Rick insists there's "nothing dishonest" about their actions, telling Morty to "slap on these antennas. These people need to believe we’re aliens" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. The contrast between their familiar world and this new one, populated by Martian-like people living in power plant-inspired buildings who venerate Rick for electricity, is stark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. Unbeknownst to them, the "Gooble Boxes" Rick provided actually redirect most of their power to his ship, and Rick has guided their civilization in "messed up ways," such as teaching them that flipping someone off means "peace among worlds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

### Step 4: Characters adapt to the new situation and things must change
This stage focuses on external rather than internal change, as TV aims to preserve the status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. Upon arriving in the Microverse, Rick and Morty encounter Zeep Xanflorp, a scientist who is a "carbon copy of a carbon-copy of Rick himself," even dropping out of school because "It’s not a place for smart people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. Zeep has created his own Microverse, making Rick's Gooble Boxes obsolete and rendering his car battery unusable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. Despite facing a mirror image of himself, Rick doesn't change; instead, he shamelessly parrots Morty's earlier objections, stating, "That just sounds like slavery with extra steps!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. When Morty points out Rick's hypocrisy, Rick seizes it as an opportunity to stop Zeep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. The new conflict is introduced: Rick must find a scientist in Zeep’s Microverse working on his own Microverse to force Zeep to realize his hypocrisy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

### Step 5: The character gets what they wanted
This is the turning point where the hero has hit rock-bottom and found what they were looking for, even if unexpected, and their motivations begin to shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. Rick reaches this step when he finds Kyle, a scientist in Zeep’s Microverse who is creating his own Microverse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. In an [[inceptions_ambiguous_ending | Inception]]-like moment, they travel into a Microverse within a Microverse within another Microverse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. Rick smugly watches as Zeep repeats the "slavery with extra steps" rant to Kyle for the third time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. However, Zeep then realizes that his own universe is a Microverse, and his existence was brought into being by Rick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. This realization leads to an existential rage, causing Zeep and Rick to fight while Kyle crumbles with the realization of his nested reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.

### Step 6: Paying a hefty price and suffering the consequences
This step prepares the hero for their return, often by having them test their will against the world and getting "their ass handed to them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. Rick gets his desired outcome – a Microverse within Zeep's Microverse – but by demonstrating Zeep's hypocrisy, Rick causes Kyle to have an existential meltdown and commit suicide, trapping them all in the "Tinyverse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. Unable to put their egos aside, Rick and Zeep blame each other and focus on mutual destruction instead of working together to escape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. Morty eventually leaves them to live with Tree People <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.

### Step 7: Undoing the damage and returning to the familiar world
This is the final step before the hero resurfaces to their old world, which can be as difficult as leaving it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. Morty, using his control over the Tree People, forces Rick and Zeep to put their egos aside and engineer a solution out of Kyle’s Tinyverse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. Once they escape, all bets are off, and they rush to exit the surrounding Microverse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. Zeep, who is essentially Rick's "shadow" and a dark reflection of his undesirable traits, serves as the gatekeeper of this lower world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. He is the final obstacle Rick must face, aiming to trap Rick to prevent his own Microverse from being destroyed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. The beauty of *[[rick_and_morty_story_structure | Rick & Morty]]* is that Rick is aware of his shortcomings but has no desire to fix them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. The episode presents parallels between Rick and Zeep, making them equally problematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. When they finally face off, it's not Rick battling demons to change, but simply "Rick fighting Rick" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>. Even Morty sees the fight as unnecessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.

### Step 8: Change or the futility of it
Normally, this step is where the hero achieves fulfillment, integrating new skills into their old life, as seen with Daniel in *The Karate Kid* or Amanda becoming the next [[jigsaws_motivation_and_philosophy | Jigsaw]] Killer in *Saw II* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>. However, for TV, the hero can never be fully fulfilled, otherwise there would be no desire for further adventures and thus no more story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.

After Zeep is dealt with, Rick and Morty return to their *Ball Fondlers* reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>. Rick's car starts, and he explains that Zeep had two choices: revert to Gooble Box technology or have Rick discard a broken Microverse battery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>. The episode ends with Rick, Morty, and Summer sitting down for ice cream, with a dazed Morty and Summer shell-shocked by the normalcy after their ordeal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.

## Conclusion
[[rick_and_morty_story_structure | Rick & Morty]] is both familiar and radically different from other television shows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>. While it mocks popular culture and subverts expectations, its core structure adheres to the cyclical nature of TV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>. However, *[[rick_and_morty_story_structure | Rick & Morty]]* uses this circular structure to highlight "the depressing, crippling futility of change" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>. Rick successfully re-enslaves an entire planet to power his car for something as mundane as ice cream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>. This demonstrates that while Rick Sanchez may not believe in much, the creative team behind the show certainly believes in the power of story structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>.

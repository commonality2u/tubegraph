The *Rick and Morty* episode "Get Schwifty" is a key installment for understanding the show's approach to [[philosophical_themes_in_rick_and_morty | philosophical themes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>. While *Rick and Morty* consistently trivializes things people hold dear, especially religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>, "Get Schwifty" explores the complexity of how humans rationalize their beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:00">[00:42:00]</a>.

## The Cromulons and the Rise of Headism

The episode's premise begins with a giant floating head, known as a Cromulon, appearing and demanding that humanity "SHOW ME WHAT YOU GOT!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>. This cosmic event triggers natural disasters such as earthquakes, sinkholes, fires, and massive flooding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a>.

This scenario allows the show to initially mock the opportunistic nature of organized religion, as churches request more faith, money, and even new organs amidst the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>.

The narrative then follows two distinct groups of people:
*   Those aware that the Cromulons are filming a reality show and require a hit song <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>.
*   Those completely ignorant of the Cromulons' true intentions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>.

Due to this cosmic "point of view" problem and the lack of understanding about the Cromulons' purpose, a cult known as Headism emerges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>. This cult forms because people naturally create explanations when there's "no peak behind the curtain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>.

## Exposing Logical Fallacies

Rather than merely being a "scathing indictment of religion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>, the episode targets the reasoning behind belief structures themselves, exposing fallacies in various human convictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>. It specifically satirizes two common logical fallacies that confuse correlation with causation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>.

### Cum Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc

This fallacy, meaning "with this, therefore because of this," is the mistaken belief that two simultaneous, unrelated events are causally linked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>.
*   The Headist religion begins when Principal Vagina prays to the Head at the same time the cataclysms subside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>. In reality, the Heads stopped because they were pleased with Rick's impromptu performance of "Get Schwifty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>.
*   Later, when Principal Vagina tries to "ascend" Beth and Jerry, the Heads begin booing, leading the Headists to believe this action angered the Heads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>. However, the Heads were displeased with Rick's terrible performance without Morty and a nuclear strike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>.

### Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc

This fallacy, meaning "after this, therefore because of this," refers to the idea that because something precedes another, it must be the cause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>.
*   The President thinks that celebrities like The-Dream, Billy Corgan, Randy Newman, and Pharrell are all dead because he named them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>.

Aristotle was credited with creating the first list of logical fallacies, aiming to identify arguments that "sounded great but are actually pure ass-clownery" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>. Characters with a limited point of view, unaware of the reality TV show, consistently believe their mundane ceremonies influence the Cromulons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>. Even Beth and Jerry recognize this pattern, stating, "It's possible that we may have been correlating some things that weren't actually related at all" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>.

## Human Cognition and Belief Systems

The episode makes a broader point beyond satirizing magical thinking: people don't simply fall into "silly beliefs" out of irrationality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>. Instead, they "over rationalize their thinking to the point of absurdity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>.

### The Persistence of Beliefs

Some cognitive psychologists argue that [[structure_of_human_belief_and_cognition_in_rick_and_morty | pseudo-scientific belief systems]] are resilient because they are "sustained by the structure of the human brain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>. These systems persist and spread through appeals to rationality, not through trickery or mass stupidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>. The human brain is "hard-wired to search for logical conclusions and easy explanations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>.

> "Ma'am, a giant head in the sky is controlling the weather. Did you wanna play checkers?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>
> "Let's be rational! I'll see you at God's house!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>

### Confirmation Bias

People tend to believe what aligns with their existing worldview, consuming and sharing information that confirms their political beliefs or creating elaborate justifications for supporting their favorite sports teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>. This phenomenon is called **confirmation bias**: the tendency to seek out and interpret information that proves one's own beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:00">[05:29:00]</a>.

Confirmation bias explains why individuals might overlook "glaring flaws in their belief system for the sake of personal benefit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a>. For example, Beth and Jerry overlook the Headists' extreme practices because Summer is "thriving" within the cult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>.

## Broader Critique of Belief

These fallacies and biases are not exclusive to religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>. [[critique_of_religion_and_belief_systems_in_rick_and_morty | While Rick and Morty enjoys criticizing religion]], post hoc rationalization is an "inevitability of our cause and effect thought process" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>. Even the audience can be fooled by the brain's tendency to accept logical fallacies, as demonstrated by Rick's "snake and wristwatch" trick, which plays on the desire to attribute event A as the cause of event B <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>.

Ultimately, *Rick and Morty* uses "Get Schwifty" to deliver the "tasty irony" that cosmic events leading to a religion can be "woefully inaccurate," built on something as inane as a "f**king reality TV show" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>. The show takes its [[philosophical_themes_in_rick_and_morty | critique]] a step further, challenging the human ability to make predictions and comprehend the full complexity of existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:00">[06:55:00]</a>. This relentless approach, where "nothing is safe," not even belief, distinguishes *Rick and Morty* from contemporary satire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:00">[07:01:00]</a>.

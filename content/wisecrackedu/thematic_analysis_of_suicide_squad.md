*Suicide Squad* (2016) is identified as an ambitious, yet uniquely disastrous film that failed to deliver insightful thematic development despite significant analytical effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. The video analyzing the film adopts an "autopsy" format, examining media that "doesn't quite work" to learn from its shortcomings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## Production Issues and Impact
Warner Bros. reportedly hired the trailer company to "functionally rewrite" *Suicide Squad* after perceiving the trailer as superior to the initial cut of the movie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This decision is attributed to the film's opening 30 minutes resembling a music video filled with "too much neon exposition" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. The film was significantly altered, or "hacked to shit," which impacted its coherence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## The Primary Theme: Control
A hallmark of a thought-provoking movie is its ability to introduce and develop a theme through conflict, characters, and visuals, inspiring thought or feeling in the viewer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. In *Suicide Squad*, the primary theme established is **control** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

Instances of control within the film include:
*   "Dickbag guards" controlling and abusing the main characters, who are powerless prisoners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
*   Amanda Waller and Rick Flag controlling the Squad using a device that kills them if they deviate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
*   The Enchantress battling for control over the body of archaeologist June Moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
*   Amanda Waller controlling The Enchantress by stabbing her heart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
*   Amanda Waller controlling Rick Flag by exploiting his love affair with June <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
*   The Enchantress controlling people by transforming them into "slave monsters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
*   The Enchantress's brother taking control of another character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
*   Diablo losing control and accidentally killing his family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   The Joker controlling Harley Quinn through their abusive relationship, symbolized by her jacket reading "Property of The Joker" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

## Connection to the Snyder DC Universe
The theme of control is consistent throughout the "Snyder DC Universe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>:
*   **Man of Steel:** Raises the question of how mankind can maintain control when metahumans with godlike powers exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. The implied answer is reliance on a benevolent savior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
*   **[[batman_v_superman_ideological_conflicts | Batman v Superman]]:** Shifts the question to what if a benevolent savior, like Superman, turns hostile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. The resolution is Superman's self-sacrifice, ensuring humanity's control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
*   **Suicide Squad:** Enters the narrative after Superman's death, asking how far humanity must go to maintain control now that Earth's metahuman "bodyguard" is gone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. While *Batman v Superman* explored the ramifications of a god-like being wielding power over humanity, *Suicide Squad* was set up to explore the ramifications of humans wielding overwhelming power to fight godlike beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

This dynamic is further reflected in the painting from *Batman v Superman*, which Lex Luthor uses to suggest that even Satan started as an angel, implying Superman could turn evil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. Similarly, Amanda Waller is compared to both God and the Devil in *Suicide Squad*, posing the question of whether her quest for control, despite being a "righteous government official," will go too far, much like the potential fall of Satan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.

## Unfulfilled Thematic Potential
The thematic setup in *Suicide Squad* presents an opportunity for "juicy moral conundrums," such as whether tyrannical control is necessary against existential threats, as explored in *The Dark Knight* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>, or if such oppression is inherently evil, as seen in *One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. However, *Suicide Squad* fails to explore either of these possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

The film suffers from an "identity crisis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. As an anti-superhero movie, it encourages identification with the prisoners, showcasing their humanity, regrets, and desire for freedom, while portraying those in power as lacking humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:06:02]</a>. The film uses tyrannical control to complicate the divide between "good establishments" and "evil supervillains," even presenting The Enchantress as a victim of control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:29]</a>. This setup hints at a potential moral gray area where viewers might question whether to identify with The Enchantress as they do the Squad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

However, the film ultimately abandons this moral complexity by reducing Enchantress to a "bland, evil villain" who seeks to destroy the world with an arbitrary doomsday machine and vague motivations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. This simplification of evil prevents the film from asking interesting questions about the characterization of evil when protagonists, antagonists, and those pulling strings are all "bad guys" in some sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. The nuance is lost, and evil is lazily defined as anything that wants to destroy the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

This failure to develop the theme of control and oppression renders it meaningless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. The film neither argues that oppressive power is necessary (as the Squad defeats Enchantress of their own accord) nor that it is evil (as Waller's corrupt status quo is reinstated) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. Characters who were under the control of others generally suffer: Enchantress dies, Diablo dies, the Squad returns to prison, and Harley Quinn remains under the Joker's control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. The film ultimately portrays "subjugated people defending their own imprisonment against someone who's also been a victim of control," leading to a thematic "mess" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

## The Joker's Role and "Desire, Surrender, Power"
One of the major [[criticism_of_character_development_in_suicide_squad | criticisms]] leveled at *Suicide Squad* is the Joker's perceived lack of purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. However, his line, "Desire becomes surrender, surrender becomes power," offers a potential thematic contribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. This idea is briefly manifested when Enchantress attempts to control the Squad by showing them their desires (Harley's normal life with the Joker, Deadshot's desire to kill Batman, Diablo's family), which would lead them to surrender and grant her power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

While the concept "sort of works" in this instance, it doesn't meaningfully develop the relationship between control, desire, and surrender in the final cut of the film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. There are hints of an attempt to create an arc for Harley Quinn regarding these concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. Initially, she submits to desire by letting the Joker dominate her, but later rejects Enchantress's domination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. The problem is that this doesn't represent a "paradigm shifting moment" for Harley; she immediately returns to being controlled by the Joker, negating any lesson or thematic development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.

## Conclusion
*Suicide Squad* possessed a "spark of intelligence" and likely had earlier script versions that were superior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. However, the finished film fails to develop its core themes of control and oppression in any meaningful way, leaving viewers to ruminate on its lost potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>.

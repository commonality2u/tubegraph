*South Park*, the animated series set in a small Colorado town, has, in recent seasons (19-20), shifted from standalone episodes to season-long serialization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This shift initially allowed for brilliant blending of themes, such as [[Political Correctness and its Critique in South Park | PC culture]], advertising, and gentrification in Season 19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Season 20 attempted an even more ambitious storyline, juggling the presidential election, member berries, and internet trolling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## South Park's Storytelling "Golden Rule"

Underlying *South Park*'s often "unpredictable, imaginative, and completely unhinged" nature is a strict order to its madness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. The show is constructed with a rigid plot line rule: if the words "and then" are needed between story beats, the narrative is considered flawed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. A strong narrative, particularly for [[Social satire in South Park | South Park]]'s brand of [[Cultural and Social Critiques in South Park | cultural and social critiques]], requires cause and effect, where events are linked by "buts" or "therefores" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

An example of this rule in action is the famous Mormon episode:
> An annoyingly perfect Mormon kid moves to town <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>, therefore he pisses everyone off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>, therefore Stan decides to kick his ass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. But the kid is so nice, that he tells Stan to go ahead and beat him up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. Therefore Stan doesn't beat him up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. Instead, he agrees to go to the kids house for dinner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

Each action linked by "therefore" or "but" indicates a consequence or reaction, ensuring every plot point matters and the show maintains momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. This structured approach allows *South Park* to deliver its pointed [[South Parks satire on religion and consumerism | satire]], as seen in its [[South Parks treatment of religion | treatment of religion]] in this episode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

## Impact of Political Events on Season 20

The unexpected outcome of the 2016 US presidential election significantly disrupted Season 20's narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. Creators Stone and Parker had planned the season around the expectation of Hillary Clinton winning, forcing last-minute rewrites after Donald Trump's victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. This event had a direct [[impact_of_political_events_on_south_parks_plot_development | impact on the show's plot development]] and led to the breaking of the creators' core storytelling rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

### Narrative Breakdown: Member Berries

The member berries storyline initially exemplified *South Park*'s Golden Rule:
*   Randy tries member berries, falls into a nostalgic trance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.
*   Therefore, Randy realizes member berries are dangerous brainwashing germs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
*   Therefore, Randy tells Mr. Garrison the truth about his popularity, linking it to the world changing and yearning for the old ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
*   Therefore, they set out to destroy member berries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.
*   Therefore, Randy convinces Mr. Garrison to give a heartfelt speech denouncing nostalgia, telling people to vote against him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

This setup anticipated a Hillary Clinton victory, creating a "perfect half season set up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. However, after Trump (represented by Mr. Garrison) won, the narrative became "messy," shifting from a "but or therefore based plot, to a big cluster f**k of and thens" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. This resulted in:
*   Mr. Garrison winning "out of nowhere" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
*   Member berries magically turning into a "weird vomit inducing virus" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.
*   Their identity changing from intoxicating berries to Nazis, and eventually a "tiny fruit militia," without clear justification or logical progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

The member berries plotline lost its clear purpose – to embody "toxic nostalgia" – and devolved into a "random progression of events that build without any apparent logic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

### Satire of Internet Culture: Trolling Plotline

The subplot involving Kyle's dad, Gerald, as the internet troll skankhunt42, initially aligned with the show's structure:
*   Gerald's trolling angers the Danes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.
*   Therefore the Danes threatened to release everyone's internet history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.
*   Therefore, Hillary Clinton, fearing leaked online activities, needs skankhunt42 to save her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

Once Hillary lost the election, this narrative structure crumbled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. Clinton confusingly recruits Gerald anyway, with a vague mission, breaking the cause-and-effect chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. The show then resorted to abrupt reveals, such as Clinton's claim being a ruse to kidnap American trolls, who are then rick-rolled, and the top Danish guy being a troll himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. This created a "seemingly random increasingly complicated laundry list of plot points" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.

The initial promise of analyzing how the internet fragments public and private selves and how privacy allows for bad behavior was building to a "really promising conclusion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. The show also effectively skewed "outrage cycles that dominate internet culture" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>, even hinting at "Trevor's axiom" as an explanation for Mr. Garrison's victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. However, these ideas were not fully developed due to the forced narrative changes. The ultimate resolution of "blowing up the internet" to delete everyone's secrets destroyed the season's building cause-and-effect relationships, offering a "Psych! We're blowing everything up" instead of a satisfying conclusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

### Hypothetical Alternate Season 20

Had Hillary Clinton won, Season 20 would have explored different satirical themes. An episode aired post-election contained remnants of this original plan, including Bill Clinton and Bill Cosby forming a "gentlemen's club" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. Parker indicated that this alternate reality would have focused on Bill Clinton as the "terrified First Gentleman," escalating the "battle of the sexes" already underway at South Park Elementary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>. This would have provided more "poignancy to Cartman's newly inspired fear of his girlfriend Heidi" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>. This alternate path highlights the show's capacity for [[South Parks commentary on human nature and belief systems | commentary on human nature and belief systems]] through its satirical lens.

## Future of South Park's Serialization

The narrative challenges of Season 20 led creators to suggest an end to serialization as they knew it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. While messy, Season 20 had promise, and earlier serialized seasons (18 and 19) were considered some of their best work in a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. The difficulties faced in Season 20 underscore the challenges of maintaining a consistent satirical narrative when external, unpredictable events disrupt planned storylines.

Quentin Tarantino's *Django Unchained* is not just a typical action-packed film with his signature hallmarks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Beyond its revenge narrative, the movie offers a clever and nuanced [[django_unchaineds_commentary_on_slavery_and_racism | criticism of slavery]] through its pervasive use of symbolic subversion and cultural appropriation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. The film deliberately twists common cultural expectations, language, fashion, music, and genre conventions to highlight the hypocrisy and savagery of the institution of slavery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

## Subverting Language and Civilization

[[the_role_of_language_and_culture_in_django_unchained | The role of language and culture in Django Unchained]] is central to its critique of slavery. From the perspective of white enslavers like Big Daddy and Calvin Candie, white bodies are seen as representing culture and civilization, while black bodies are deemed uncivilized and incapable of proper language use or cultural appreciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

Dr. King Schultz, an eloquent German bounty hunter, disrupts this racist binary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. His mastery of English, despite it being his second language, confounds native-speaking enslavers, making self-satisfied Southerners appear "wildly uncivilized" by comparison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. Schultz, an emblem of mythical European civilization, serves as a "walking reminder" that these self-styled men of culture are "full of shit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

This critique extends to the historical justification of slavery. Aristotle's concept of "logos" (speech and reason) differentiating humans from animals was used to justify Greek slavery, claiming slaves were incapable of possessing "logos" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. *Django Unchained* flips this dichotomy, showing cruel enslavers mumbling incoherently, while enslaved characters speak clearly and intelligibly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

Furthermore, the film contrasts how Schultz treats enslaved people with how other white characters do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. Schultz uses the honorific "Fraulein" for Broomhilde, unlike the prevalent use of racial slurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. In contrast, Calvin Candie demands the French honorific "Monsieur" as a sign of respect, even though he doesn't speak French, using titles for mandatory submission rather than voluntary respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

The use of beer also serves as a potent symbol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. When Schultz buys Django a beer, it symbolizes a transition from a master-slave dynamic to a relationship of coworkers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. However, when Candie orders beer for one of his fighters, it's a "sick sort of reward" for an enslaved man forced to murder another, representing "cold blooded savagery" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

The film also tackles the appropriation of European culture by enslavers. Candie's forced attempt to show off his German <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>, and Schultz's disgust at a woman playing Beethoven after witnessing atrocities, highlights the inherent contradiction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. Schultz sees "a beautiful product of his culture appropriated by people who are truly savages" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.

Even the Christian Bible, meant to signify proper European religion, was twisted to justify slavery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. This is explicitly shown when a Brittle brother quotes Genesis 9:2, justifying violence against enslaved people by comparing them to beasts, with a page of the Bible pinned over his heart – a target Django shoots through, exposing the "bloody hypocrisy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

## Fashion and Iconography as Subversion

*Django Unchained* uses everything from fashion to music to iconography to "flip the logic of slavery on its head" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. Joseph Cinque, leader of the Amistad Rebellion, was famously portrayed in media in the style of a noble from the culture that enslaved him, a depiction described as "egalitarian" and "subversive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

Similarly, when Schultz gives Django a makeover, Django emerges dressed like one of the Three Musketeers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. This attire, coupled with Django riding a horse (historically associated with the well-to-do), is "deliberately abrasive" for those who would reserve such symbols for white, civilized men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. In one of the final scenes, Django wears Candie's clothes while destroying the plantation, further cementing this visual subversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.

This aesthetic choice aligns with theorist José Esteban Muñoz's concept of "disidentification," a strategy of acting against a dominant ideology by "mangl[ing] its symbols from within" rather than escaping or assimilating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. Django dons the attire of a Southern aristocrat not to become one, but to "abuse the very notion of the Southern Gentleman" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. Artist Kehinde Wiley's work, painting Harlem residents in the style of classic European art, offers a parallel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

## Music as Symbolic Cultural Appropriation

Tarantino also manipulates the soundtrack to underscore Django's subversion of cultural expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. The use of rap music, seemingly "out of sync" with a mid-nineteenth-century Western <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>, makes perfect sense when considering rap's historical use by those facing racial and economic inequality to call for resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. Lyrics from "100 Black Coffins" explicitly tie into themes of revenge and fighting oppression, highlighting Django's journey for power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.

Furthermore, Schultz uses Richard Wagner's "Twilight of the Gods" to contextualize Django's quest to save Broomhilde, casting Django as a Siegfried-like figure in his own story of revenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>. This interpretation frames Django as a Nietzschean "ubermensch" who responds to the "nihilistic values of slavery and white supremacy" by "both metaphorically and literally burning the whole damn thing to the ground" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>. The fiery destruction of Candyland thus becomes a "metaphorical call for the destruction of the institution of slavery in general" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>.

Tarantino's choice of Wagner also serves as a subtle nod to cultural appropriation and subversion, given that Wagner's Ring Cycle was deeply associated with German nationalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>. By using a narrative once appropriated by Nazis to support white supremacy, Tarantino tells a slavery revenge story that actively destroys white supremacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.

## Genre Subversion: The Western

Finally, *Django Unchained* symbolically subverts the Western genre itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. Traditional Westerns often feature "strong jawed white dudes" killing "villainized Native Americans" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>. In contrast, *Django Unchained* depicts white cowboy types being taken out by a freed slave, a subject largely ignored in the Western canon, thus flipping the genre's inherent power dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>.

Ultimately, *Django Unchained* uses various forms of symbolic subversion and cultural re-appropriation to deliver a sharp critique of slavery and white supremacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>.

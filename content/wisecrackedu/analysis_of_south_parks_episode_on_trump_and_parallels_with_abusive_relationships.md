*South Park* has been consistently challenged by the problem of how to make [[satirical_social_commentary_in_south_park | social satire]] when reality itself is absurd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Co-creators Matt and Trey have observed that both liberals and conservatives often praise the same episodes, each believing the show secretly aligns with their views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

After Season 20 was significantly impacted by the [[impact_of_2016_presidential_election_on_south_park | 2016 election]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>, the creators vowed to avoid Trump-related narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>, stating they did not want to "be CNN" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Despite divisive politics dominating national discourse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>, the episode "Doubling Down" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a> demonstrates that *South Park* can remain relevant while not taking sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. This episode takes a stance without resorting to partisan talking points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a> and offers a nuanced indictment of Trump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. A consistent message of the season, however, is that "we're all f***ed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

## Plot Overview and Parallels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>

The episode features two parallel plots:
*   Heidi's abusive relationship with Eric Cartman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. After trying to end things with Cartman, she is emotionally blackmailed into staying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. Kyle attempts to rescue her and eventually falls for her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Heidi briefly dumps Cartman for Kyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>, but her friends' judgmental reactions cause her to "double down" on Cartman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   Paul Ryan, Mitch McConnell, and Mike Pence's attempts to stand up to President Garrison (a stand-in for Trump) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. Garrison's abusive behavior, including "f***ing people to death," keeps them in line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. They commemorate Garrison's first anniversary as president, and he assures them the next three years will be worse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

The episode's brilliance lies in how these A and B plots parallel each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. The main gist is that Heidi's abusive relationship with Cartman mirrors Trump supporters' abusive relationship with Trump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

## Unpacking the Parallel

The parallel is subtly hinted at early through coded language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. Kyle's questioning of Heidi's relationship with Cartman uses language identical to that used by critics questioning Trump voters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

Kyle's direct questions to Heidi about her relationship with Cartman perfectly align with questions posed to Trump supporters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>:
*   Heidi and Cartman are about to celebrate their one-year anniversary, paralleling President Garrison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
*   Kyle's pressing uses language perfectly suited to Trump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
*   Kyle acts as a liberal reporter interviewing a Trump supporter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

This tactless approach causes Heidi to "double down" on Cartman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. An ironic layer is added when Kyle uses political polling language for Cartman, while Paul Ryan uses domestic abuse language to protect Trump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

When Heidi finally admits to Kyle that she might have made a mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>, her description of falling for Cartman sounds like how reporters explain how the white working-class voter "fell for" Trump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. Kyle points out that Cartman, like Trump, constantly plays the victim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>:
> "We all wrongly see ourselves as the victim sometimes, but Cartman sees himself as the victim ALL the time." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>

Heidi stands in for the regretful Trump voter who doesn't want to admit she was wrong, stating, "I don’t know how I’m going to face people if I finally give up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. A montage sums up the episode, showing a dejected Heidi evaluating her relationship while "took-er-jerbs dudes" cry watching Trump on TV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. The message is clear: Heidi represents the white working-class voter struggling to accept that banking on Trump was a mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.

## Critique of Liberal Condescension

*South Park* uniquely critiques liberals in a nuanced way, unlike most satirical shows that tend to mock conservatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. This has been particularly true in the past year, with shows like SNL doubling down on Trump-themed lampoonery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. Such shows are unlikely to resonate with even a vaguely regretful Trump voter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>, which is why Matt and Trey have been reluctant to constantly take easy shots at Trump or his supporters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>, contributing to [[the_challenges_of_creating_satire_in_the_trump_era | the challenges of creating satire in the Trump era]].

The episode critiques Hollywood's "Open Season" approach to Trump and his supporters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>, most clearly expressed through Kyle, who often acts as the [[meta_commentary_on_political_satire_in_south_park | meta-voice of reason]] for the show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. Kyle advises against criticizing Heidi for being with Cartman:
> "You can't keep saying 'we told you so' because if you make her feel dumb, she just doubles down and tries to prove to herself that it wasn't dumb." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>

The show expresses disdain for Trump but urges the liberal media to be less condescending and less eager to say "I told you so" to Trump voters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. The girls' comments made Heidi run back to Cartman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>, where an isolated, insecure Heidi was primed to believe whatever radical, bigoted garbage Cartman served up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. Cartman convinces Heidi to make Kyle her "Jewish scapegoat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>, much like Trump convinces his base to blame the left for everything that goes wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

## [[south_parks_treatment_of_antisemitism_and_cultural_bigotry | South Park's Treatment of Anti-Semitism]]

While Cartman's anti-Semitic jokes have been a staple of *South Park* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>, Heidi's final speech to Kyle in this episode felt different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. It lacked overt punchlines, focusing instead on Kyle's devastated reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.
> "Did she just call me a dirty Jew?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>

The show's mockery of anti-Semites has never appeared so dark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>, which may be *South Park's* acknowledgment of how fundamentally different Cartman's character sounds since the rise of the alt-right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. It seems *South Park* has consciously graduated from goofy, childish bigotry to genuinely ugly bigotry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

Ultimately, things look bleak as Heidi is controlled by Cartman, and the Republicans and the nation are set to be further abused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

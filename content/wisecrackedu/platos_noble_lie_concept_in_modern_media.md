The film *Sausage Party* reflects rampant disillusionment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a> and serves as a cynical parable of religion and its effects on societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. Within the supermarket setting, a religious system is concocted by non-perishable items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

## The Great Beyond as a Noble Lie

This system, involving the "Great Beyond," is a means to pacify society and protect the food items from their own "stupid brains" or circulatory mechanisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. The promise of this Great Beyond eases the food items' suffering, allowing them to face their impending demise with "plucky optimism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

This tactic directly illustrates the concept of [[platos_allegory_of_the_cave | Plato's noble lie]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. A [[platos_allegory_of_the_cave | noble lie]] is defined as a fictitious story used to persuade individuals to accept their roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

## Faith and Disillusionment

For a lie like the "Great Beyond" to work effectively, people must avoid asking too many questions, making faith an important element in the foodie community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. When Honey Mustard returns from the "Great Beyond" and attempts to warn everyone, he is ridiculed and silenced because no one wants to challenge their established faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. Ultimately, such a stubborn belief can only be challenged by "incontrovertible proof," such as a severed head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

The film's ultimate message encourages hedonism, suggesting there is no point in living life in anticipation of a "pot of gold at the end of the rainbow," as the outcome for food is always consumption or decomposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. This leads to the conclusion that one might as well set aside differences and pursue as much pleasure as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

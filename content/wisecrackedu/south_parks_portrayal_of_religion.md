If one word is often associated with South Park, it's "[[role_of_irreverence_in_south_parks_narrative | irreverent]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. In the world of South Park, nothing is sacred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. While most people use "[[role_of_irreverence_in_south_parks_narrative | irreverent]]" in a general sense, the show has a unique way of dealing with religion, a subject typically associated with reverence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. The series challenges viewers to re-examine what religion means to them by presenting scenarios like baby Jesus fighting Frosty the Snowman or Satan pondering a Britney Spears costume for his sweet-sixteen party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Part 1: Are You There God (It's Me: Jesus)

Even before the show officially began, Matt Stone and Trey Parker released holiday specials featuring Jesus battling an evil snowman and Santa Claus for the soul of the holidays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. A consistent theme emerged from these early works: in South Park, seemingly ordinary things can be a "big deal," while "mindblowingly important" concepts can be insignificant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

The show consistently blurs the lines between the profound and the ordinary:
*   The boys are not starstruck when speaking to Jesus, but they fight over playing him in the Easter play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
*   When given the chance to ask God any question in season three, Stan inquires about periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
*   In season seven, the meaning of life is revealed to be Earth as an intergalactic "Truman Show"-style reality series on the verge of cancellation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.
*   Jesus struggles to attract viewers for his public-access talk show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
*   Satan is depicted as a serial monogamist repeatedly returning to Saddam Hussein despite knowing he's not good for him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

### [[critique_of_religious_manipulation_in_south_park | Manipulation of Religion]]

Religion is only shown as important in South Park when individuals [[critique_of_religious_manipulation_in_south_park | manipulate it for their own purposes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. Eric Cartman is presented as the master of this manipulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. As Cartman states, "I know enough to exploit it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

Examples of Cartman's religious manipulation:
*   Becoming a wealthy tent revival preacher in season four <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
*   Achieving success in Christian music by adapting secular pop songs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
*   Building a fan club around Mel Gibson's *The Passion of the Christ* in "[[south_parks_treatment_of_antisemitism_and_cultural_bigotry | The Passion of the Jew]]" to lead the Fourth Reich <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
*   Painting a cow to resemble the biblically prophesied red heifer to mess with Kyle's mind, accidentally bringing about world peace in season 17 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

### Creators' Stance on Religion

While some might conclude that South Park implies religion is ridiculous and makes people gullible, series creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker largely disagree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. Matt Stone notes that while the show makes fun of religion, they are not anti-religious and are fascinated by it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

### Denying the [[comparison_of_sacred_and_profane_in_south_park | Sacred and the Profane]]

South Park's seemingly anti-religious stance to some stems from its refusal to treat religion as a sacred subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. Western spiritual traditions often emphasize honoring the sacred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. Émile Durkheim, in *The Elementary Forms of Religious Life*, observed that Western religions categorize the world into two radically opposed domains: the [[comparison_of_sacred_and_profane_in_south_park | sacred and the profane]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. South Park fundamentally denies the legitimacy of this distinction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

For example, in "Red Hot Catholic Love" (season six), Father Maxie discovers the Catholic Church is an intergalactic coalition led by a sentient giant spider that has endorsed pedophilia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. Maxie bravely tears the sacred Vatican Document, symbolizing that the church could only evolve if it ceased to be too sacred to investigate, mirroring the Boston Globe's role in exposing the molestation scandal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. A recurring theme in the series is that sometimes, saving something made sacred requires desecrating it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

Other instances of desecration leading to salvation include:
*   Cartman and Kenny saving the world by cursing out Saddam Hussein and making a deal with the Devil in *The South Park Movie* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.
*   The cosmic TV industry agreeing not to destroy Earth in "Cancelled" (season seven) for unconventional reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

### A Screwy Concept of the Sacred

South Park suggests that humanity's concept of the sacred is inherently flawed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. Jesus literally walks the Earth in South Park, yet most people ignore or don't recognize him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. His talk show, *Jesus and Pals*, is routinely out-rated by Jimbo and Ned's *Huntin' and Killin'* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. However, when Jesus engages in combat, he suddenly becomes their "Lord" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.

Jesus's frequent fights – against Frosty, Santa, Satan, Iraqi soldiers, Bill Donohue, a xenomorph, and a Seussian villain – are presented as the only way to maintain his followers' respect, despite his nature as the "Prince of Peace" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. South Park's Jesus seems aware of theologian Walter Wink's "myth of redemptive violence," which posits that humanity's sense of the sacred, dating back to ancient Babylonian mythology, stems from the desire to see good triumph over evil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

> "This myth of redemptive violence is the real myth of the modern world. It, and not Judaism or Christianity or Islam, is the dominant religion in our society today.." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>

Jesus fights because he realizes his followers' projected myth is more important than his own teachings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. The transformation of Jesus and other religious figures into superheroes illustrates the pervasive power of the "myth of redemptive violence" over all religions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

## Part 2: A Scause For Applause

Beyond its casual attitude towards the sacred, South Park suggests that one doesn't need to be religious to be a "narrow-minded assh*le" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

### Critique of Self-Righteous Activism

Many characters in the series exhibit self-righteousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. Stan's character arc in season sixteen, where he becomes a self-promotional activist, is a strong example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. In "Butterballs" and "A Scause for Applause," Stan enjoys being treated with reverence as a hero, but he moves on as soon as his cause ceases to make him popular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. This contrasts with Wendy Testaburger, who has deeper motivations and self-respect, regardless of whether her opinions are popular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

South Park's [[satirical_social_commentary_in_south_park | social commentary]] posits that movements led by individuals seeking validation are prone to derailment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

### [[rick_and_mortys_view_on_religion_and_atheism | Critique of New Atheism]]

This critique extends to the New Atheism movement. In the two-part episode "Go God Go," Cartman is stranded in the 26th century, where three rival militant atheist factions are killing each other over branding disputes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. The show's message is that human beings are inherently violent and irrational, and abolishing religion will not change this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

Stone and Parker's perspective differs from New Atheism on a "chicken-or-egg" question: Is religion ridiculous because people are ridiculous, or vice-versa? They hold the latter view: people are ridiculous, and that makes religion ridiculous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.

### Ambiguity and Certainty

Australian science historian Margaret Wertheim argues in *Pythagoras’ Trousers* that Western scientific models of the universe often resemble religious ones due to a "hypermasculine drive for certainty and finality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. South Park, like Wertheim, suggests that refusing to accept ambiguity can make answers to fundamental questions seem ridiculous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

### The Question of Belief

South Park does not seek to answer whether one *should* be religious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. As Matt Stone rhetorically asked Slate, "if the mass delusion of a religion makes you happy, makes your family work better, is that bad or good?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.

The series has explicitly made this argument twice: in "Red Hot Catholic Love" (season six) and "All About Mormons" (season seven) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. In "All About Mormons," despite the episode's ridicule of new kid Gary's upbeat family and unfamiliar beliefs, Gary ultimately defends himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.

Stone and Parker's view, that both being religious and not being religious can be sensible, echoes American philosopher William James. In *Pragmatism* (1907), James states:

> "When a play is once over, and the curtain drawn, you really make it no better by claiming an illustrious genius for its author, just as you make it no worse by calling him a common hack.” <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>

Essentially, whether created by a divine figure or not, it's still life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>.

## Conclusion

Unlike many series that address religion, South Park doesn't offer an "escape route"—a specific religion or ideology to avoid being ridiculous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. Its unique underlying philosophy is that being human is inevitably ridiculous, and there's no way to avoid this fate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. South Park suggests that regardless of one's chosen religion or life philosophy, taking oneself too seriously will make one appear silly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. The core question, then, is not whether one's belief system is a joke, but whether one is aware of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.

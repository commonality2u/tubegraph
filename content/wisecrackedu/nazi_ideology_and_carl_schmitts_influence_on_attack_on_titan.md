*Attack on Titan* is described as a colossal series with amazing fight scenes and "gargantuan steamy ken dolls" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. While many anime explore [[exploration_of_death_in_attack_on_titan | death]], few ruminate on its visceral reality quite like *Attack on Titan* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Titans are presented as the physical personification of death, serving as "walking reminders of human mortality" and an "existential confrontation with the inevitability of demise" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. However, the series' darkest element is not the introspective confrontations with death or the Titans' lack of genitals, but rather the construction of the society behind the walls itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Germanic Parallels and Carl Schmitt

The society in *Attack on Titan* is depicted as an anachronistic, quasi-Germanic setting, featuring German architecture, war cries, and character names <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. The similarities to German history extend beyond superficial elements, as the political ideology of this society aligns with the beliefs of Carl Schmitt, a notorious Nazi philosopher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

Carl Schmitt is explicitly identified as a "real piece of shit" and a "card-carrying Nazi, unrepentant to the end" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. The series does not endorse Schmitt's ideas but instead functions as an exploration of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. *Attack on Titan*'s dark nature stems from presenting a society that, when faced with a horrific enemy, maintains stability while reflecting Nazi ideology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. The show provocatively asks whether, in this dystopian society, a controversial philosophy might be the only thing preventing societal collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

## Schmitt's "The Political" in Attack on Titan

Central to Schmitt's philosophy and the civilization in *Attack on Titan* is the concept of "the political" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. For Schmitt, a stable society is created by three key concepts:
1.  Conflict and inequality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>
2.  Clear distinctions between friends and enemies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>
3.  Sovereignty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>

### Conflict and Inequality

Schmitt emphasizes that conflict, division, and inequality among human beings are inevitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. This perspective is rooted in the understanding that humanity's basic nature is savage and hellish, where "people are essentially shitty and life isn’t fair" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. Characters like Mikasa, Armin, and Eren echo this thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. The show consistently returns to the theme of a "dog eat dog world" where one must fight to survive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

This [[social_inequality_and_class_structure_in_attack_on_titan | constant war against all]] aligns with Thomas Hobbes' view of humanity's fundamental nature as monstrous, with social structures being the only restraint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. Schmitt extends this, asserting that hostility is unavoidable and inequality is inevitable, with some people always being smarter, fitter, or more attractive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. According to Schmitt, politics should not attempt to eliminate antagonism or inequality, but rather a strong sovereign should focus on maintaining order and population control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

*Attack on Titan* visually demonstrates this by separating classes with literal walls, forming a caste system within each section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. People in Wall Maria are less safe than those in Walls Rose and Sina <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. While those in Trost face danger, inner-city residents "are chillin in castles, playing chess and shit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. The Scouts risk their lives beyond the walls, while the MPs in the inner walls are largely incompetent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. Unlike most media narratives that would seek to repair such inequality, *Attack on Titan* has not shown evidence of this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. For Schmitt, alleviating inequality is a distraction from the "political" imperatives of nationalism and survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

This focus on nationalistic duty is evident in the Season 1 theme song, which resembles "Triumph of the Will"-level nationalistic propaganda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. Its lyrics speak of fighting past defeat, trampling corpses, and having the will of starving wolves, set against scenes of the soaring military <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. This can be seen as a rallying cry for a defeated people, much like post-World War I Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

### Friend-Enemy Distinction

Schmitt's second element of "the political" is a clear [[friend_enemy_distinction_in_politics_and_attack_on_titan | friend and enemy distinction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. Good governments, he argues, need an enemy to struggle against without completely dominating them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. The Titans serve as a check against total conquest beyond the wall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. Without a clear enemy, human nature leads to a "war against all," an unending civil war characterized by war crimes and dehumanization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. A clear enemy prevents infighting and internal conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

Both Erwin and Pyxis express concern over this distinction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. Pyxis explicitly comments on the necessity of Titans as the enemy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. They worry that the Titans aren't the real threat, but humanity itself, with Titans merely keeping people in line by providing a common goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

The ultimate purpose of the Titans is initially unrevealed in the show, with hints of a face in the wall and abnormal Titans controlled by people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. If rogue Titans are part of an inside conspiracy or tools of the elite to lower the population, this would represent a "government-fabricated enemy"—a Schmitt-ean "wet dream" of an intelligent, strong, naked enemy that keeps humanity from fighting itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. Such a scenario would also serve as a strong criticism of Schmitt's politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. The Titans can be seen as an allegory for the perfect scapegoat, mobilizing the population and empowering those in control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.

The show's theme of freedom also reflects the friend-enemy distinction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. The Scouts' "wings of freedom" badge and Eren and Armin's desire for a life beyond the walls, likening humanity to "penned in cattle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. For Schmitt, freedom and community are defined by denying cowardice in the face of impending death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. Joining the Scouts becomes a liberation from the fear of waiting to die inside the wall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. This desire to join the Scouts cements Eren's class as a political community, giving life purpose through the battlefield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

Schmitt defines a political community by its members' ability to kill enemies for friends' sake or die at enemies' hands for friends' sake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>. The Scouts who risk their lives embody this, akin to the troops in Alfred Tennyson's "The Charge of the Light Brigade," which is quoted in the show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. This camaraderie binds humanity's remnants together, preventing internal strife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. However, the friend-enemy distinction blurs as Eren and Annie are revealed as Titans, eroding the clear lines between foreign enemy and domestic friend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. The partial transformation scene with Eren saving Mikasa and Armin highlights the chaos when the division between human and Titan blurs, making population security near impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.

### Sovereignty and State of Emergency

The final element of Schmitt's "the political" is the power of the sovereign itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. [[role_of_sovereignty_and_state_of_emergency_in_attack_on_titan | Sovereign entities]] possess the ability to declare states of emergency, justifying the sacrifice of populations for the greater good, such as sending a battalion to reclaim Wall Maria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. This power is crucial for long-term societal stability, preventing "political bickering" from impeding the fight against existential threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. The sovereign can also make exceptions to the law, like granting special citizen status to those living inside Wall Sina <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.

In *Attack on Titan*, the leadership structure appears to be based on martial law and military rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>. Premiere Dhalis Zachary leads the military tribunal with the power to execute Eren, and wall cultists have gained influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. Leaders send millions to their death to ensure the safety of the remaining population within the walls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. Pyxis reveals that the retaking of Wall Maria was a "thinly disguised purge" to ease the stress from a massive refugee influx, a decision to "kill off part of the population for the greater good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. As twisted as it sounds, Schmitt argues that the sovereign must maintain this ability to commit even horrendous acts to maintain order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>.

## Conclusion and Commentary

The series prompts viewers to consider what would happen if all Titans suddenly disappeared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. Would society devolve into anarchy or civil war, or would it lead to liberation and peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>? For Schmitt, eradicating an enemy is not an option, as the drive for warfare means another enemy will always emerge, potentially leading to internal conflict until "no people left to kill but your own population" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.

The critique reminds viewers to be wary of a theorist who warned about unending war while being a "principal theorist for the Nazi Party" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. Despite this, Schmitt's work remains a subject of robust academic debate for understanding international conflict, executive power, and current systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. *Attack on Titan* has the potential to become a scathing criticism of Schmitt-style politics or to merely complicate them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.

*Lord of the Flies* by William Golding begins with a G5 full of British boys crash-landing on a remote island in the Pacific <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Among the survivors are [[character_analysis_ralph_piggy_jack_simon | Ralph]], [[character_analysis_ralph_piggy_jack_simon | Piggy]], [[character_analysis_ralph_piggy_jack_simon | Jack]], and [[character_analysis_ralph_piggy_jack_simon | Simon]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

### Initial Order and Leadership
To establish order, [[character_analysis_ralph_piggy_jack_simon | Piggy]] and [[character_analysis_ralph_piggy_jack_simon | Ralph]] find a large shell, which they call "the conch," to use for gathering and discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. The children appoint [[character_analysis_ralph_piggy_jack_simon | Ralph]] as the leader and [[character_analysis_ralph_piggy_jack_simon | Jack]] as the head hunter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. Initially, [[character_analysis_ralph_piggy_jack_simon | Jack]] struggles to kill for food but eventually succeeds in hunting a pig <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

### Fear of the Beast and Division
The younger boys become scared, claiming they saw a monster, but [[character_analysis_ralph_piggy_jack_simon | Ralph]] tries to reassure them it's imaginary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. One day, [[character_analysis_ralph_piggy_jack_simon | Jack]] claims to have seen the beast and challenges [[character_analysis_ralph_piggy_jack_simon | Ralph]]'s leadership, inviting others to join his new group for food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

### The Lord of the Flies
[[character_analysis_ralph_piggy_jack_simon | Jack]] and his followers kill another pig and impale its head on a stick as an offering to the beast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. [[character_analysis_ralph_piggy_jack_simon | Simon]] then has a vision where this pig head, referred to as "The Lord of the Flies," speaks to him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. The pig head reveals that the beast is not something to be hunted, but rather the inherent violence within the boys' own hearts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

### Tragic Events
When [[character_analysis_ralph_piggy_jack_simon | Simon]] returns to camp to share his realization, the other boys mistake him for the beast in their frenzied state and kill him, with even [[character_analysis_ralph_piggy_jack_simon | Ralph]] and [[character_analysis_ralph_piggy_jack_simon | Piggy]] participating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. Afterward, [[character_analysis_ralph_piggy_jack_simon | Jack]]'s group raids [[character_analysis_ralph_piggy_jack_simon | Ralph]]'s camp and steals [[character_analysis_ralph_piggy_jack_simon | Piggy]]'s glasses, which are essential for making fire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

[[character_analysis_ralph_piggy_jack_simon | Ralph]] confronts [[character_analysis_ralph_piggy_jack_simon | Jack]], leading to a brawl. During the fight, [[character_analysis_ralph_piggy_jack_simon | Piggy]] is thrown off a cliff, and [[symbolism_the_conch_and_the_lord_of_the_flies | the conch]] shatters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Outnumbered, [[character_analysis_ralph_piggy_jack_simon | Ralph]] flees towards the shore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

### Rescue and Irony
Just as [[character_analysis_ralph_piggy_jack_simon | Ralph]] is about to collapse, he spots a Naval officer in the water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. The officer, observing the boys attempting to kill [[character_analysis_ralph_piggy_jack_simon | Ralph]], questions their behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. He takes the children onto his boat to return them to civilization, but their innocence has been irrevocably lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

### Thematic Interpretation
The book is an allegorical effort to trace the origins of societal flaws to human nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. By observing the boys' descent into savagery, the novel reminds readers of humanity's capacity for evil and the superficiality of man-made moral systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

A profound irony lies in the adult world's perceived righteousness compared to the boys' savagery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. The naval officer who rescues them is himself in the middle of a war, trying to attack an enemy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. This highlights the tragedy that there's no one to save civilized humanity from its own violent nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

### Symbolism and Motifs
The central [[symbolism_the_conch_and_the_lord_of_the_flies | symbol]] is the pig-head on a stick, "The Lord of the Flies," which is another name for Beelzebub, the prince of demons, or the Devil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. It represents the destruction, decay, and demoralization of humankind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. From a Freudian perspective, "The Lord of the Flies" represents "the id," which functions solely for survival, rendering laws, moral codes, and intelligence irrelevant when it's in charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

The novel features recurring patterns, or motifs, of "falling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. This includes [[character_analysis_ralph_piggy_jack_simon | Piggy]] falling off the cliff with [[symbolism_the_conch_and_the_lord_of_the_flies | the conch]], the falling parachutist, and [[character_analysis_ralph_piggy_jack_simon | Ralph]] falling at the naval man's feet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. These instances emphasize the "fall of humankind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. Additionally, the loss of [[character_analysis_ralph_piggy_jack_simon | Piggy]]'s sight (his glasses) symbolizes the fall of reason <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. When [[character_analysis_ralph_piggy_jack_simon | Jack]] steals [[character_analysis_ralph_piggy_jack_simon | Piggy]]'s glasses to make fire for his gang, it signifies the transition from the reign of reason to the reign of savagery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

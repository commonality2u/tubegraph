The anime phenomenon *Death Note* explores a range of philosophical topics, including property rights and human nature, with a significant focus on [[philosophy_of_justice_in_death_note | Justice]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. The show is unique not in *what* it says about justice, but in *how* it presents the topic, constantly challenging various definitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

### Light Yagami's Transformation and Moral Dilemmas
The series follows Light Yagami, a model student who discovers the Death Note, a supernatural notebook capable of killing anyone by writing their name while picturing their face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. Light's initial goal is to use this power to create a world devoid of crime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. He soon adopts the public persona of "Kira," the "God of the new world" he aims to establish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

Light, as Kira, embodies an "ends-justify-the-means" philosophy, believing that being a "crime-zapping uber-tyrant" justifies almost any action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. This includes shamelessly using his girlfriend, Misa, to distract the police and maximize his kill count <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>, and even killing non-criminals who obstruct his path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. He declares, "This world is rotting and those who are making it rot deserve to die. Someone has to do it so why not me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. Light expresses happiness and never feels cursed by the Death Note, believing he is creating a perfect world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

A significant aspect of Light's character evolution is shown when he temporarily renounces ownership of the Death Note <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. Upon losing his memories of being Kira, his personality noticeably changes, as does his [[different_theories_of_justice_presented_in_death_note | sense of justice]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. He transitions from a "by any means necessary" attitude to one of ethical consideration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. For example, the non-Kira Light refuses to exploit Misa's feelings for personal gain, stating, "To me, exploiting another person's feelings for personal gain is unforgivable and I won't allow myself to stoop that low" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. This stands in stark contrast to his Kira persona, who pretended to love her for years merely for convenience in killing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. Even when Misa expresses indifference about being used, the non-Kira Light actively avoids leading her on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. However, once he regains his memories and powers by touching the Death Note again, his Kira persona immediately returns, and he moves in with Misa to gain more killing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. This highlights the tension between Light's innate morality and the corrupted "Justice with a capital J" driven by the Death Note <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

### The Influence of Anonymity on Character
The concept of anonymity plays a crucial role in [[role_of_anonymity_in_shaping_justice_in_death_note | shaping justice]] in *Death Note* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. The show's portrayal of Light's dual personality echoes themes from [[comparative_analysis_of_death_note_and_greek_philosophy | ancient Greek philosophy]], specifically Plato's *The Republic* and the story of The Ring of Gyges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. This fable suggests that people only value justice or morality when their actions can be scrutinized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. Light's transformation into Kira, and the growing support for Kira on the internet where anonymity is possible, reflect Glaucon's argument that once the risk of damaging one's reputation is removed, interest in justice disappears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. Light, initially a "golden boy valedictorian," takes joy in actions far worse than merely breaking social codes once he gains the anonymity afforded by the Death Note <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.

### Competing Visions of Justice
The series explores multiple characters' interpretations of justice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Light's vision is a world without criminals, achieved by "whatever means necessary" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. He sees himself as a martyr, willing to sacrifice his mind and soul to become the "god of the new world," believing this quasi-utilitarian approach will ensure peace for the greatest number of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.

In contrast, the detective L, and later his successors M and N, challenge Kira's reasoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. L highlights the contradiction in Kira's ideal: if a just world is one without criminality, then Kira's criminal act of killing is itself an injustice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. L's approach aligns with "injustice theory," focusing on identifying and correcting injustices rather than starting from an abstract ideal of justice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>. The hunt for Kira is driven by the recognition that Kira's "new world" is unjust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.

Matsuda, a member of the task force, serves as an "audience surrogate and philosophical foil" to the other characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>. Unlike Light's conviction or L's single-minded pursuit, Matsuda constantly questions the presented values and beliefs about justice, even pointing out the decrease in violent crime due to Kira <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>. He asks, "Do you guys ever think that maybe Kira isn't completely evil?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>, demonstrating his self-doubt and critical perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>. Matsuda's role is to force viewers and characters to consider their own opinions of justice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>.

### Conclusion
*Death Note* functions as a modern Socratic Dialogue, using multiple participants to explore the universal question of "What is Justice?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. The show deliberately avoids giving a clear answer, instead presenting a "war of competing moral codes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26">[00:17:26]</a>. The ambiguity regarding who best represented justice, or whether Light's "New World" justified his means, is what makes the show poignant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>. By opening more doors than it closes regarding the meaning and implications of justice, *Death Note* distinguishes itself as a show that *does* philosophy, rather than merely borrowing from it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>.

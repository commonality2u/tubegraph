"The Vindicators 3: Return of the World Ender" is an episode that critically examines the superhero genre and delves into the complex nature of good and evil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This analysis explores the episode's subversion of superhero tropes, its philosophical inspirations, and its commentary on morality.

## Episode Overview

In this episode, Morty gets to choose their next adventure, opting to join his heroes, The Vindicators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. However, Rick gets blackout drunk, effortlessly destroys the ominous Worldender, and then traps The Vindicators in a series of "Saw"-inspired trials that lead to their ruin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

## Subverting the Superhero Narrative

"The Vindicators 3" functions as a direct jab at Marvel movies, with "The Vindicators" serving as an obvious stand-in for "The Avengers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Rick acts as a mouthpiece for those disillusioned with the formulaic nature of popular cinema <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

Rick's cynical view of heroes is highlighted:
> "They’re the writers of their own press releases, Morty. They’re a bunch of drama queens who spend an hour talking and 20 minutes jumping around while shit blows up. They’re a phase. We did one. It was the big event of that summer. Let it die.” <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>

The central [[rick_and_morty_story_structure | story arc]] of "The Vindicators 3" mirrors another "Morty adventure," "Meeseeks and Destroy," in that it depicts Morty's optimistic worldview crumbling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. In "Meeseeks and Destroy," Morty's wholesome view of fairy tales erodes as the genre is subverted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. Similarly, in "The Vindicators 3," Morty's faith in superheroes erodes as the superhero genre is subverted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## The Complexities of Good and Evil

Beneath the superhero parody, the episode explores the complexities of good and evil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. Unlike some adventures where Morty's worldview shatters naturally, Rick plays a unique and active role in its disintegration here <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

### Rick's Moral Trials

After drunkenly killing Worldender, Rick creates a "Saw"-inspired puzzle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. This scheme is less about confronting demons and more about pushing people over a "moral cliff" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. The trials succeed in exposing the Vindicators' true natures: Vance shows his true colors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>, Million Ants kills Alan Rails over a woman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>, and Crocubot reveals the Vindicators' secrets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. By the end, Rick gloats to Morty about the sham of heroism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

### Philosophical Inspirations

The episode draws inspiration from unique villains in popular cinema to explore its themes:

*   **Jigsaw**: Like Jigsaw, who aims to change people's paradigms through suffering to make them appreciate life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>, Drunk Rick's trials are not primarily about eradicating The Vindicators but creating a moral crisis to prove they are not heroes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.
*   **The Joker**: A less obvious but profound inspiration is The Joker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. Morty’s carnival ride trip is inspired by Alan Moore’s *The Killing Joke*, where Commissioner Gordon is tortured by The Joker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. The Joker, like Jigsaw, isn't solely motivated by murder; he seeks to prove that "all it takes is a little push" for someone to descend into madness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. Rick's "shenanigans" similarly push the Vindicators to lose control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. Just as The Joker infects the idealistic Harvey Dent with nihilism, Rick turns the benevolent Vindicators into violent backstabbers, upending Morty's simplistic understanding of good and evil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
    > "Oh, I don't know, you managed to destroy just about everything today, the villains, the heroes, the lines between them... my childhood." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>
    > "Thank youuuuu" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>

### The Problem with "Infinite Evil"

The episode suggests that narratives spoon-feeding simplistic good vs. evil concepts are problematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. Philosopher Jacques Rancière's idea of "Evil" with a capital E, often found in superhero movies, is that any conflict becomes an ultimate struggle of Good and Evil, making the value of victory infinite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. This "all or nothing" mentality can justify horrific actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>:
> "What happened on Dorian 5?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>
> "Nothing!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>
> "Nothing?! We exterminated a PLANET!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>
> "W-wait, huh?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>
> "Doomnomatron was hiding there, he's a shapeshifter! Destroying Dorian 5 was the only way to kill him!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>
> "I could have made you a device to detect Doomnomatron from orbit like that." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>

Rancière argues that "infinite evil" warrants "infinite justice," which disregards morals and often loses sight of true justice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

### The Noble Lie

By the episode's end, Supernova is also infected with Rick's nihilistic philosophy, no longer believing in a real division between good and evil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. However, she recognizes that the *simplistic division must be upheld* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>:
> "It's like you said Morty." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>
> "There’s no right or wrong." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>
> "Never said that." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>
> "It’s the galaxy’s faith in the vindicators that keeps the galaxy secure." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>

Supernova is willing to kill Rick, Morty, and even her lover to protect the *perception* that the Vindicators are good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. This highlights that their actions are less important than the galaxy's faith in them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. This concept is a shoutout to *The Dark Knight*, which explores moral greyness in comic book movies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. Batman lies about Harvey Dent's goodness to maintain peace, just as Supernova wants the galaxy to believe a similar lie about herself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

Both instances advocate for a "noble lie," an idea made famous by the Greek philosopher Plato, where societies are built on a myth that maintains order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. This is not the first time *Rick and Morty* has referenced this concept:
> "We found it inside a lockbox. Inside King Jellybean's closet." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>
> "We have to tell the people!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>
> "Wait, destroy it." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>
> "Our people will get more from the idea he represented, than from the Jellybean he actually was." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>

While *The Dark Knight* may celebrate this lie, *Rick and Morty* uses it to deconstruct the myth of superheroes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

## Two Dismal Perspectives on Morality

While the episode deconstructs good and evil as arbitrary concepts, it also suggests that a complete absence of these concepts is equally problematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. This echoes Dr. Wong's confrontation with Rick in a previous episode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>:
> "The only connection between your unquestionable intelligence and the sickness destroying your family is that everyone in your family, you included, use intelligence to justify sickness." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>

The Vindicators fail to critically engage with their methods or mission, while Rick refuses to engage with his decisions because he believes "nothing matters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. If good and evil are just social constructs, he can justify any action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

The episode presents two extreme and "completely dismal" perspectives on good and evil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>:
1.  **Zero conviction**: Leads to apathy and Rick doing whatever he wants without consequence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
2.  **Complete conviction**: Leads to people doing horrific things for the sake of "good," such as exterminating a planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

As is typical for *Rick and Morty*, there are no "right answers," only "wrong ones" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.

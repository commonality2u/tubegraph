From: [[wisecrackedu]] <br/> 

*Goblin Slayer* explores profound philosophical questions, primarily revolving around the titular character's unwavering focus on eliminating goblins, rather than confronting the grander threats typically seen in fantasy narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. The show uses its genre conventions to subvert expectations and delve into concepts of peace and societal neglect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Series Recap
The story begins with a bright-eyed Priestess and her friends embarking on their first adventure to kill goblins, which goes terribly wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. *Goblin Slayer* rescues the Priestess, who then joins his party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Their group expands to include an Elf, Dwarf, and Lizard Man, who investigate troublesome goblins on the elven border and later in sewers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. Despite a Demon Lord threatening the realm, *Goblin Slayer* maintains his singular focus on goblins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

## Subverting Fantasy Tropes
*Goblin Slayer* heavily references Dungeons & Dragons, utilizing elements like dice rolling, spell slots, guilds, quests, and various fantasy tropes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. The show embraces generic fantasy with intentionally common names for characters and places, such as "Elven Ranger," "Watertown," or "Sword Maiden," and even bosses like "Goblin Champion" or "Demon Lord" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

In typical fantasy narratives, heroes begin with minor threats (rats, bugs, goblins) and progress to stronger enemies, culminating in a major villain whose defeat brings peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. *Goblin Slayer* deviates from this linear path, choosing to exclusively hunt goblins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. He argues that even if the Demon Lord is slain, goblins will continue to terrorize rural and vulnerable areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. This perspective subverts the basic assumption of a "happily ever after" in the fantasy genre <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. The show highlights that less spectacular monsters still plague villagers even after a major threat is neutralized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. The Demon Lord's death is shown to be swift and handled by unknown heroes, underscoring that its demise does not eliminate the ongoing threat of goblins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

## Peace Theory and Its Application

The show's logic can be understood through [[positive_and_negative_peace_theory_in_context_of_goblin_slayer | peace theory]], which distinguishes between two types of peace defined by theorist John Galtung <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>:

*   **[[positive_and_negative_peace_theory_in_context_of_goblin_slayer | Negative Peace]]**: This is the absence of direct violence or war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. In fantasy, it equates to a world without major destructive forces like a Demon Lord, Night King, Sauron, or Ganondorf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.
*   **[[positive_and_negative_peace_theory_in_context_of_goblin_slayer | Positive Peace]]**: This goes beyond the absence of war to include the presence of justice and protections that serve the needs of everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. This is what *Goblin Slayer* pursues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. While the show focuses on goblins, in the real world, this could represent pervasive issues like poverty, famine, disease, corruption, discrimination, and crime â€“ the "goblins of the real world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

For many, violence is an interruption, but for some, it is a constant backdrop to their lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. *Goblin Slayer*'s relentless focus on eliminating goblins, even if it doesn't appear "peaceful," is framed as conflict prevention and development, addressing the short-term problems to establish long-term protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

## The Stigma of "Grunt Work"

The show highlights how smaller, seemingly insignificant issues can compound into a terrible reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. The "small work" of goblin slaying is often viewed as "grunt work" or "child's play," lacking the glory associated with defeating a Demon Lord <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. Despite being a silver-class adventurer, *Goblin Slayer* is mocked for his choice of missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

This phenomenon mirrors real-world scenarios where high-prestige jobs (like cancer research) receive more attention than vital but less glamorous work (like water testing for public health) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. *Goblin Slayer* learns the dangers of goblins firsthand, leading him to commit to this vital, albeit undervalued, mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

## Consequences of Minimizing the Goblin Threat
The stigma against goblin slaying has two significant consequences:

1.  **Minimizing the Threat**: Many adventurers underestimate the danger goblins pose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. Though seemingly simple to kill, goblins have tricks that make them dangerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. Because the problem is perceived as simple, unqualified adventurers are sent to deal with them, often resulting in their deaths, as silver-ranked heroes prioritize "better things to do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.
2.  **Worsening Problem**: Goblins breed and become more dangerous over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. Major heroes avoid involvement, either seeing goblins as mere pests or being too embarrassed to admit fear after confronting greater evils <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. The Sword Maiden, who once slayed the original Demon Lord, hires *Goblin Slayer* to deal with goblins under the city, revealing her own fear and reluctance to admit it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.

## Psychological Impact and Positive Peace

Goblin attacks leave people in a constant state of fear and anxiety, adding to their already difficult lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. This elevates the stakes of [[positive_and_negative_peace_theory_in_context_of_goblin_slayer | positive peace]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. While dealing with goblins may not change the material conditions of life, it significantly impacts the psychological well-being of the affected population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. *Goblin Slayer*'s intervention, both in killing goblins and addressing the Sword Maiden's fears, helps alleviate her nightmares and improves her mental state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.

## Narrative Implications
The show's unique approach to fantasy, where the ultimate threat (the Demon Lord) is swiftly dispatched and the hero remains fixated on a "lesser" enemy, suggests an unconventional narrative trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. This focus implies that the show might explore the escalating complexity of the goblin threat itself, or the societal consequences of a false sense of security, rather than progressing to ever-larger adversaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.

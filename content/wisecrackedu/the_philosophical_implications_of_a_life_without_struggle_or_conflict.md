The anime series *One-Punch Man* presents an unusual premise that serves as a subtle commentary on the trajectory of civilization and the human experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. Unlike most narratives driven by conflict, *One-Punch Man* explores a world where drama is virtually non-existent for its protagonist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. This unique structure allows the show to highlight the importance of conflict to both fictional stories and human existence itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

## Saitama's Predicament: The Burden of Invincibility

The protagonist, Saitama, is a hero who can defeat any enemy with a single punch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. While he initially found joy in hero work, this thrill has vanished after three years due to his overwhelming power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. He claims to be a "hero for fun," but he doesn't seem to enjoy it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. Saitama's vacant expression and resigned demeanor suggest boredom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>, but the show's deeper focus is on imagining a world without conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

Unlike conventional heroes who grow and change through challenges, Saitama remains largely the same throughout the series because he decimates any conflict with one swing of his fist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. He doesn't even benefit from the fear of defeat since he knows he cannot lose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. This absence of adversity leaves him with nothing to strive for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. His training, which could typically depict development, is merely the same routine every day with no progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. Saitama's motivations are mundane, stemming from no deep-seated pain, only exercise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. The ease with which he achieved superhero status robs the struggles of other characters of any [[meaning_and_suffering_in_human_and_artificial_lives | meaning]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

## Conflict's Role in Narrative and Life

Conventional narratives rely on conflict to drive the story forward and motivate characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. Screenwriting expert Robert McKee notes that "the music of story is conflict," and it is through progressing and building conflict that a story moves in time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. Challenges force characters to change and grow, leading to the climax of the story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

*One-Punch Man* subverts this by making Saitama immune to conflict, relegating him to a passive observer in many major battles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. Instead, the focus shifts to supporting characters who experience classic character arcs, like Genos, the wandering warrior seeking power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>, or Dr. Genus, driven by scientific dismissal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. However, Saitama consistently undercuts their narrative traction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

### The Anti-Catharsis

Saitama often acts as a "human deus ex machina," swooping in to solve seemingly unsolvable problems with his unbeatable punch, rendering others' struggles irrelevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. This narrative bailout deprives the audience of catharsis, the emotional release that comes from connecting with a story's emotional payoff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. We are accustomed to relating emotionally to heroes' victories and defeats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

> "Through the actions and personas of characters we can revisit our own lives and past experiences." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>

The show actively plays the role of emotional spoiler, priming viewers for a release only to deprive them of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. For instance, the Mumen Rider's earnest, underdog struggle against the Sea King, despite inevitable failure, builds dramatic tension that is then dissolved by Saitama's anticlimactic intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

## Masahiro Morioka's Philosophy on Pain and Value

Beyond comedy, *One-Punch Man* highlights what is missing in a life devoid of conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. Japanese theorist Masahiro Morioka argues that civilization's drive to minimize pain and discomfort has inadvertently drained value from life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. While reducing pain seems beneficial, Morioka suggests that it leads to a loss of "the opportunity of experiencing the joy of life that comes from encountering an unwanted situation and being forced to transform ourselves to find a new way of thinking and beingâ€¦" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.

Saitama's frustration stems from his inability to change and progress through failure and [[meaning_and_suffering_in_human_and_artificial_lives | pain]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. His life becomes devoid of purpose without meaningful hardship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>. Just as a story needs conflict, so too does a human being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. Saitama's reaction to the Paradisers' manifesto, which advocates for "success with no effort," further illustrates this point: he finds the idea "pretty boring" because he already experiences such ease, and it "sucks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.

Morioka warns that while a civilization without [[meaning_and_suffering_in_human_and_artificial_lives | pain]] and [[meaning_and_suffering_in_human_and_artificial_lives | suffering]] appears ideal, people might "end up with losing sight of joy, and forgetting the meaning of life, in a society pervaded by pain reduction mechanisms and filled with pleasure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.

## Conclusion

*One-Punch Man* serves as a philosophical warning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>. Through Saitama's perpetually bored state, the show suggests that too much comfort and the absence of struggle can render life meaningless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>. It encourages embracing failures, [[meaning_and_suffering_in_human_and_artificial_lives | pain]], and [[meaning_and_suffering_in_human_and_artificial_lives | suffering]] as essential components that give [[meaning_and_suffering_in_human_and_artificial_lives | meaning]] to life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.

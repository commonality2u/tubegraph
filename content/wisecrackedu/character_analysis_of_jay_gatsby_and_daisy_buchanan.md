This article explores the characters of Jay Gatsby and Daisy Buchanan as depicted in F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel, *[[summary_of_the_great_gatsby | The Great Gatsby]]*, based on an analysis from Thug Notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Jay Gatsby

Jay Gatsby is presented as a rich playboy with "mad Mitt Romney money" who owns a "pimpin crib" in Long Island, next door to Nick Carraway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. His primary motivation for moving to Long Island was to rekindle a past relationship with Daisy Buchanan, who was formerly his "main bitch" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. He hoped to "get a crack at that ass again" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

Gatsby's relationship with Daisy causes conflict, particularly with her husband, Tom, who becomes "crunk about Daisy and Gatsby’s relationship" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. Gatsby and Tom engage in a confrontation, demanding Daisy choose between them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

Tragically, Gatsby becomes entangled in the death of Myrtle, Tom's mistress. Daisy is driving Gatsby's car when Myrtle is hit and killed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. Although Daisy was driving, Tom later tells George that Gatsby was behind the wheel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. George, mistakenly believing Gatsby was also Myrtle's lover, retaliates by shooting Gatsby in his pool before taking his own life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

### Ideals and Dreams

Gatsby's character is central to the [[critique_of_the_american_dream_in_the_great_gatsby | criticism of the anti-Calvinistic image of the American dream]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. Fitzgerald's America, unlike an imagined past where "homies always got each others backs," is portrayed as "full of back stabbin crackers that make Gatsby’s romantic dream ridiculous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. Despite this, Gatsby "keeps it real by stickin to his American ideals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. According to Minter, "Because of the beauty of his dream and the heroism of his efforts to move beyond it, Gatsby can be made great" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

The [[motifs_of_dreams_versus_reality_in_the_great_gatsby | motif of dreams versus reality]] is profoundly embodied in Gatsby <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. He holds "big ass delusions about the future with this bitch, Daisy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. Gatsby believes "you can repeat the past," a notion that the narrative dismisses, stating "ain’t nobody can recover past time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. This disconnect is subtly shown through details like Gatsby possessing "a big ass stack of books, most of which he’s never read," suggesting he's "frontin’ trying to look all intelligent and shit," which "ain’t reality, B" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

### Symbolism

The [[symbolism_in_the_great_gatsby | green light]] is a significant symbol connected to Gatsby <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. Initially, it represents "the fading optimism of Gatsby’s dream" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. At the story's outset, the green light possesses a "burning quality that gets Gatsby all riled up about shackin up with his bitch" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. However, by the book's conclusion, it has become "just another lame ass green light," losing its special significance, much like his "fake ass dreams" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

## Daisy Buchanan

Daisy Buchanan is introduced as Nick Carraway's cousin and Tom Buchanan's wife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. She is unaware that Tom has a mistress named Myrtle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Daisy has a romantic history with Jay Gatsby, having been his "main bitch" in the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

During a confrontation at the Plaza Hotel, Gatsby and Tom demand Daisy choose between them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. However, she "can’t make up her mind!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. In a pivotal event, Daisy is driving Gatsby's car when she accidentally hits and kills Myrtle, who "slings her ass in front of the car" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. Following the accident, Daisy "just keeps drivin Gatsby’s whip, gets the hell out of dodge, and decides she’s done with Gtasby" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

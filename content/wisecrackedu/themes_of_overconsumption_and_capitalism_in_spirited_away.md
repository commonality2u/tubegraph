*Spirited Away*, the acclaimed film from legendary animator [[miyazakis_artistic_techniques_and_legacy_through_spirited_away | Hayao Miyazaki]], serves as a cautionary tale about [[themes_of_excess_and_greed | greed and overconsumption]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>, especially in the context of postwar Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

## Context of Postwar Japan
After the end of World War II, Japan experienced an economic boom that coincided with a cultural shift towards capitalism and away from traditional values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. The Spirit Realm in the film takes the form of an old amusement park styled after the Meiji period (late 19th to early 20th century) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. Discarded shrines on the hillside [[symbolism_in_spirited_away | symbolize]] the relegation of cultural history in favor of modern pursuits like leisure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

In this economically-driven environment, overconsumption leads to severe consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

## Consequences of Greed
*   **Chihiro's Parents:** Chihiro's parents indulge in food from the spirit realm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>, stuffing it down their gullets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a> despite its suspicious lack of vegetables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. They rely on their credit cards and cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. As a result, they are transformed into pigs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>, a symbol commonly used on Earth to represent capitalist cultures that could lead to the eradication of humankind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.
*   **The Bathhouse Furnace:** The bathhouse furnace is also shaped like a pig, constantly consuming resources simply to provide guests with a slightly more temperate bubble bath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
*   **No-Face:** When No-Face arrives, overflowing with gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>, Yubaba and her workers exploit him for every last ounce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. This transaction is considered the "foundation of a transactional ecosystem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. However, as the staff showers No-Face in excess, he responds by showering them in stomach acid, demonstrating the destructive nature of unchecked greed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

## Hope for Balance
The film expresses a hope that modern Japan can achieve a balance between economic prosperity and spiritual heritage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. A significant emphasis is placed on remembering one's name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a> and the identity of one's parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>, which are crucial for forging a connection to one's ancestry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. This message extends to the art form itself, as the film, predominantly drawn by hand, conveys a hope that future generations will progress while respecting the history of animation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.

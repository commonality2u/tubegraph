The *Saw* franchise, known for its gruesome traps and morally ambiguous characters, centers around the puppet-master Jigsaw, also known as John Kramer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>. While Jigsaw's initial philosophy suggests his torturous games are opportunities for victims to repent and transform into better human beings, the series ultimately reveals significant flaws in his moral code and the failure of his intended legacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>.

### Jigsaw's Stated Philosophy
John Kramer's motivation for his deadly games is rooted in a belief that suffering can lead to personal and spiritual growth, enabling victims to appreciate life more fully if they survive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. He views suffering as a purificatory force, similar to early Christian philosophy's justification of suffering as a means for sinners to atone and reunite with God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>. Kramer also shares common threads with Soren Kierkegaard, believing that suffering purifies the sufferer, teaches them to appreciate life, and forces them to take responsibility for their actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>. He demands personal responsibility and choice from his victims, often ending his games with the refrain, "Make your choice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:33:00">[09:33:00]</a>.

### Flaws in the Moral Code
Despite Jigsaw's grand philosophical claims, the *Saw* series critiques this extreme version of traditional Christian morality, revealing the inherent flaws in his approach:

*   **Failed God-like Figure**: Kramer is frequently positioned as a God-like figure, monk, or martyr, dressing in a hooded cape, acquiring disciples, and maintaining an omniscient quality by always watching his victims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:54:00">[10:54:00]</a>. However, he is presented as a "seriously failed" God-like figure because his attempts to establish a moral order do not bring about the meaningful change he professes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:10:00">[11:10:00]</a>.
*   **Victim Outcomes**: Most of Jigsaw's victims fail their tests, either crumbling under pressure or being unable to withstand the pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:21:00">[11:21:00]</a>. Those who do manage to pass are often severely traumatized, as evidenced by a survivor who sarcastically states the best thing that happened to him after cutting off his arm was "handicapped parking at the damn mall!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:27:00">[11:27:00]</a>.
*   **Inconsistent Justice**: Although Jigsaw is presented as a God-like figure, his justice is not dispensed fairly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:38:00">[12:38:00]</a>. He is ultimately the villain of the series, and his "morality lessons" frequently sacrifice innocent human lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:45:00">[12:45:00]</a>.
*   **Meaningless Rhetoric**: Characters within the films themselves highlight the deeply flawed nature of his moral code. One character states, "You’re talking, but it means nothing!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:21:00">[12:21:00]</a>. Even his most fervent follower, Amanda, denounces him just before her death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:31:00">[12:31:00]</a>.

### Failure of Jigsaw's Legacy
Jigsaw's ambition to establish a lasting legacy of moral transformation through his games ultimately crumbles, largely due to the failure of his apprentices:

*   **Ill-Fated Quest for Apprentices**: Kramer's quest for the "right apprentice" is ill-fated, as each of his contenders twists his philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:43:00">[11:43:00]</a>.
*   **Rigged vs. Winnable Games**: While Jigsaw intends his games to be winnable if the rules are followed, his mentees create rigged games that are unwinnable death traps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:51:00">[11:51:00]</a>. A clear example is questioned when a character asks, "If the aim of Jigsaw’s game was to get out before the bomb went off, then why was the door welded shut?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:04:00">[12:04:00]</a>.
*   **Revenge vs. Renewal**: His disciples use the games for personal revenge rather than for the philosophical renewal Jigsaw espoused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:08:00">[12:08:00]</a>. This corruption of his intent leads to them trapping and killing one another out of jealousy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:12:00">[12:12:00]</a>, signifying a complete breakdown of his intended "legacy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:16:00">[12:16:00]</a>.

### Jigsaw's Own Demise
The ultimate failure of Jigsaw's philosophy is perhaps best underscored by his own death. While one might expect salvation or redemption for a figure who posits himself as a moral arbiter, Jigsaw dies after offering one of his victims, Jeff, the opportunity to forgive him. Instead, Jeff violently kills Kramer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:50:00">[12:50:00]</a>. Even Kramer's own death is presented as the result of one of his test's ultimate failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:02:00">[13:02:00]</a>. This highlights the inherent contradiction and ultimate futility of seeking "spiritual rebirth in a reverse bear trap" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:09:00">[13:09:00]</a>.

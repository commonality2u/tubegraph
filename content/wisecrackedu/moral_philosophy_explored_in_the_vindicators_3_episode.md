From: [[wisecrackedu]] <br/> 

The *Rick and Morty* episode "The Vindicators 3: Return of the World Ender" critiques superhero films, presenting "The Vindicators" as a clear parody of "The Avengers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Rick acts as a voice for those feeling disenchanted with the formulaic nature of popular cinema <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. The episode delves into the complexities of good and evil, a concept superhero films often struggle with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

The plot sees Morty choosing an adventure with his heroes, The Vindicators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. Rick, in typical fashion, gets blackout drunk, effortlessly defeats the ominous Worldender, and then traps The Vindicators in a series of demoralizing trials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Similar to another "Morty adventure" (presumably "Meeseeks and Destroy"), the central theme of [[analysis_of_the_vindicators_3_episode_in_rick_and_morty | "The Vindicators 3"]] is the erosion of Morty’s optimistic worldview as the superhero genre is subverted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Beyond the satirical elements, the episode explores the intricate nature of good and evil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

## Rick's Orchestrated Moral Crisis

Rick plays a pivotal role in dismantling Morty's simplistic understanding of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. After dispatching Worldender while intoxicated, Rick devises a *Saw*-inspired puzzle, not to make people confront their demons like Jigsaw, but rather as "a drunken scheme to push people over a moral cliff" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. This scheme succeeds in exposing The Vindicators' true natures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>, causing Million Ants to kill Allen Rails over a woman, and Crocubot to reveal the Vindicators' secret <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. By the end, Rick proudly asserts his correctness about the fraudulent nature of heroism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

The episode cleverly draws inspiration from unique villains in popular cinema <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. Jigsaw, for instance, seeks to change people's perspectives by making them endure suffering to appreciate life more, rather than pursuing senseless murder or financial gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. Similarly, Drunk Rick's trials are primarily designed to instigate a moral crisis for The Vindicators, proving to Morty that they are not true heroes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

### Influence of [[the_jokers_role_in_exploring_moral_dilemmas_and_challenging_conventional_morality | The Joker]]

A less obvious, yet profound, inspiration for the episode is [[the_jokers_role_in_exploring_moral_dilemmas_and_challenging_conventional_morality | The Joker]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. Morty’s experience in the carnival ride echoes Alan Moore’s *The Killing Joke*, where Commissioner Gordon is tortured by [[the_jokers_role_in_exploring_moral_dilemmas_and_challenging_conventional_morality | The Joker]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. Like Jigsaw, [[the_jokers_role_in_exploring_moral_dilemmas_and_challenging_conventional_morality | The Joker]] is motivated by more than just murder; he aims to prove that a single "sufficiently bad day" can drive anyone to madness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

> "See madness, as you know, is like gravity." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>
> "All it takes is a little push." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>

Rick's actions in the episode similarly aim to "push" The Vindicators to their breaking point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. Just as [[the_jokers_role_in_exploring_moral_dilemmas_and_challenging_conventional_morality | The Joker]] corrupts the idealistic Harvey Dent in *The Dark Knight*, Rick transforms the supposedly benevolent Vindicators into violent, backstabbing figures, thus dismantling Morty's simplistic view of good and evil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.

## Critique of Simplistic Good vs. Evil Narratives

The episode argues that being "spoon-fed narratives of good and evil" is detrimental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. Philosopher Jacques Rancière suggests that when conflict is framed as an "ultimate struggle of Good and Evil" (the kind common in superhero movies), the value of victory becomes infinite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. This "all or nothing" mentality can justify even the most atrocious actions in pursuit of victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. The Vindicators exemplify this by exterminating an entire planet, Dorian 5, to eliminate a shapeshifting villain, Doomnomatron, claiming it was the "only way" despite Rick's ability to easily create a device for detection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

Rancière's perspective implies that "infinite evil"—whether world-destroyers or mortal humans—justifies "infinite justice," which disregards morals and the well-being of people (like those on Dorian 5), often losing sight of justice itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.

## The Noble Lie and Moral Greyness

By the episode's conclusion, Supernova, too, becomes infected with Rick’s nihilistic philosophy, abandoning belief in a genuine division between good and evil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. However, she recognizes that this simplistic division *must be upheld* for the galaxy's security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. She is willing to kill Rick, Morty, and even her lover to maintain the public perception of The Vindicators as good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. Their actions are less important than the galaxy's faith in them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

This concept echoes [[moral_dilemmas_and_justice_in_the_dark_knight | *The Dark Knight*]], considered a prime example of moral greyness in comic book cinema <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. Batman lies about Harvey Dent’s "goodness" to preserve peace in Gotham, much like Supernova wants the galaxy to believe a similar lie about herself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. Both advocate for a "noble lie," an idea from Plato that societies can maintain order through a foundational myth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.

*Rick and Morty* has previously referenced this "noble lie" concept, such as when King Jellybean's true nature is discovered, and it is decided to destroy the evidence to preserve the idea he represented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. However, while [[moral_dilemmas_and_justice_in_the_dark_knight | *The Dark Knight*]] celebrates this lie, [[philosophical_themes_in_rick_and_morty | *Rick and Morty*]] uses it to deconstruct the superhero myth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

## The Dual Dilemma of Morality

While Rick deconstructs good and evil as "artificial constructs," the show also suggests that the complete absence of these concepts is problematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. This is a callback to a previous episode where Dr. Wong points out that Rick uses his intelligence to justify the sickness destroying his family, implying that his nihilistic worldview allows him to avoid accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. If nothing matters and good/evil are mere social constructs, Rick can justify his actions without considering them evil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.

The episode presents two equally dismal perspectives on good and evil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>:

1.  **Zero conviction**: This leads to a nihilistic approach where actions don't matter, as seen in Rick's behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.
2.  **Complete conviction**: This results in morally questionable actions committed for the perceived "greater good," like The Vindicators destroying a planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.

As with much of [[philosophical_themes_in_rick_and_morty | *Rick and Morty*]], the episode concludes that "There are no right answers. Only wrong ones" when it comes to moral philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

William Shakespeare's [[summary_of_hamlet_by_shakespeare | *Hamlet*]] is a play deeply concerned with themes of existentialism and pervasive uncertainty, reflecting the ambiguity of modernity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>. The central character, [[character_analysis_of_hamlet | Hamlet]], navigates a world filled with ethical and metaphysical dilemmas, which directly impacts his actions and perceptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>.

## Hamlet's Internal Conflict and Procrastination

A significant aspect of [[character_analysis_of_hamlet | Hamlet]]'s character is his prolonged delay in avenging his father, King Hamlet, who was murdered by his brother Claudius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>. This [[hamlets_procrastination_and_motivations | procrastination]] is one of the most debated subjects in Shakespearean scholarship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>. Rather than having a clear devotion to a moral or societal code, [[character_analysis_of_hamlet | Hamlet]] is depicted with a "divided mind and will," struggling with the task of revenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>.

Some interpretations suggest his delay stems from a sensitive nature unfit for a brutal world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>. Others propose an Oedipal complex, where [[character_analysis_of_hamlet | Hamlet]] unconsciously identifies with Claudius's actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. Another perspective posits that [[character_analysis_of_hamlet | Hamlet]]'s hesitation is an attempt to challenge a corrupt system built on "lies and treachery" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>. These varied explanations highlight the play's inherent ambiguity regarding his motivations.

## The "To Be or Not To Be" Soliloquy

[[character_analysis_of_hamlet | Hamlet]]'s famous "to be or not to be" speech epitomizes his existential quandary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>. This soliloquy can be interpreted as [[character_analysis_of_hamlet | Hamlet]]'s struggle between choosing to live or die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>. Alternatively, it represents a choice between adhering to a Christian ideal of self-denial or taking violent action to reclaim his throne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>. This moment encapsulates the profound [[themes_of_existential_freedom_and_choice | existential freedom and choice]] that plague the protagonist.

## Pervasive Uncertainty in the Play

Beyond [[character_analysis_of_hamlet | Hamlet]]'s personal struggles, the play itself is structured around numerous uncertainties, casting both characters and audience into a state of doubt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>. Questions that arise include:
*   Can the audience truly trust [[character_analysis_of_hamlet | Hamlet]]'s ghost father? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>
*   Was Gertrude, [[character_analysis_of_hamlet | Hamlet]]'s mother, complicit in the King's murder? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>
*   Why can guards see the ghost in Act 1, but only [[character_analysis_of_hamlet | Hamlet]] in Act 3? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>
*   Is [[character_analysis_of_hamlet | Hamlet]] merely feigning madness, or has his pretense become a genuine mental state? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>

The play intentionally blurs the lines between reality and pretense, sanity and madness, leaving these fundamental questions unresolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>. By presenting these ambiguities, Shakespeare implicates the audience, making "Hamlets of us all" in the face of profound uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>.

*South Park* Season 19, a serialized narrative, marked a significant evolution for the show, becoming "arguably the smartest season yet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. It chronicles the town's social changes, introduces a new central character, and provides commentary on America’s political climate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. The season offers layered commentary on modern social conditions and serves as a meta-commentary on the show itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## Meta-Commentary on the Show's Identity

The season opens with Principal Victoria's firing, leading to the appointment of a new principal whose goal is to make South Park Elementary "a more progressive place that fits in with today's times" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. This narrative mirrors *South Park* the show, questioning if its "signature vulgar sensibility" can survive in the current [[political_correctness_and_its_critique_in_south_park | politically correct]] world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. The changing town serves as a metaphor for the show facing change, with characters like Officer Barbrady and Mr. Garrison expressing a feeling of being "a relic" in rapidly changing times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

## Unpacking [[neoliberalism_in_south_park_season_19 | Neoliberalism]]

While *South Park* has often been seen as taking shots at liberal politics, Season 19 evades a simple left/right divide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. The season connects seemingly disparate themes—gentrification, [[political_correctness_and_its_critique_in_south_park | PC culture]], and advertising—through the lens of [[neoliberalism_in_south_park_season_19 | neoliberalism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

[[neoliberalism_in_south_park_season_19 | Neoliberalism]] is an economic ideology that emphasizes personal freedoms and market solutions for societal problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. According to philosopher Henry Giroux, its tenets include:
*   Consumerism as a citizen's most important duty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
*   Individual freedoms trumping public freedoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
*   Addressing all public social issues on a private level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

### Commodification of Culture and Diversity

A core critique of the season is that [[neoliberalism_in_south_park_season_19 | neoliberalism]]'s goal is to make everything marketable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. Gentrification, for example, is presented as the free market's "solution" for "shitty neighborhoods," selling overpriced goods without addressing underlying poverty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. The show famously posits, "What is PC but a verbal form of gentrification? Spruce everything up, get rid of all the ugliness, in order to create a false sense of paradise? Only one thing can actually live in that world: ads" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

Even diversity and multiculturalism are depicted as serving profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. *South Park* suggests that advertisers manipulate [[political_correctness_and_its_critique_in_south_park | PC culture]] to gentrify areas, turning "otherness and diversity" into "marketable brands" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. Ads are personified as the "inhuman forces of [[neoliberalism_in_south_park_season_19 | neoliberal capitalism]]" that assimilate or destroy everything in their path, subtly and often unnoticed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. This leads to anxiety about whether friends, family, or even TV shows are "just ads or sponsored content" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

[[neoliberalism_in_south_park_season_19 | Neoliberalism]] excels at cooptation, taking what was once outside the system and assimilating it to serve capitalism's needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. Multiculturalism becomes a "trendy brand to be purchased" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. The town adopts "marks of tolerance" like having "gay kids" and a "police-free environment" to attract businesses and residents, symbolized by the arrival of Whole Foods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. Whole Foods ceases to be just a store and becomes a set of "lofty ideals" that consumers buy into <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

## The Spectacle of Inclusion

The show argues that the "spectacle of inclusion is good for business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. Characters like Craig and Tweek receive money for being gay, raising the question of whether affirmation is for them or for the viewer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. In the [[neoliberalism_in_south_park_season_19 | neoliberal economy]], inclusion becomes a commodity, sold for "a healthy dose of self righteousness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

## Critique of [[political_correctness_and_its_critique_in_south_park | Political Correctness]]

Slovenian theorist Slavoj Zizek's ideas are used to explain the danger of modern political systems that are "just so dang pleasant" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. It's easier to identify a clear "bad guy" (like the KKK) than to criticize the pleasant façade of [[political_correctness_and_its_critique_in_south_park | PC culture]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. Zizek describes [[political_correctness_and_its_critique_in_south_park | political correctness]] as "just a form of self-discipline which doesn’t really allow you to overcome [racism, misogyny, and so on]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. It is a "nice paint job over the same old discriminatory reality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

The show satirizes self-satisfying acts of "social justice," where people spend excessively at Whole Foods but feel good about donating a dollar to charity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. This "Whole Food style charity" allows individuals to "be a good [[neoliberalism_in_south_park_season_19 | neoliberal]] consumer, and still feel like you’re fighting against it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. Criticism is disarmed as rebellion itself becomes a commodity, a form of "inter-passivity"—doing things not to achieve change, but to maintain the status quo while feeling active <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.

### The Hypocrisy of "Tolerance"

*South Park* exposes the hypocrisy of this new "progressive" world. The town's true feelings about the poor emerge when Whole Foods is surrounded by the homeless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. Multiculturalism becomes a "badge to wear" rather than a real political project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. The town's residents remain ignorant, feigning knowledge of other cultures to appear progressive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.

The show's meta-criticism questions if "token inclusion" leads to real inclusivity or merely boosts ratings by creating a "shell of actual diversity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. The show suggests this "show of tolerance" is more about making "white liberals feel good than the marginalized people they seek to help" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. The "PC frathouse," despite its talk of marginalized people, is entirely white <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.

## Narcissism and Victimhood Culture

The show argues that behind both political extremes lies a "deep rooted narcissism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. Buying into the [[political_correctness_and_its_critique_in_south_park | PC brand]] is often about "making yourself feel good than affecting real change" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>. Randy's charity morphs into giving iPads to children in developing countries to protect the "fragile egos of people like Randy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>. This "Whole Foods activism" is about "being a sell-out to the system while making meaningless gestures to protect your own sense of self-worth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>.

Cartman's sudden adoption of [[political_correctness_and_its_critique_in_south_park | PC culture]] is explained by his pathological narcissism, using "safe space language to protect his ego" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>. Conversely, Mr. Garrison's "fuck-em-all-to-death attitude" and nationalist American exceptionalism reveal a "special snowflake" complex, fueled by a narcissistic obsession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>.

[[neoliberalism_in_south_park_season_19 | Neoliberalism]], by promoting a culture of consumerism centered on the individual, fuels this "self obsession en masse," leading to a "cult of victimhood" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>. For the [[political_correctness_and_its_critique_in_south_park | PC crowd]], it's the mistaken idea that not being a victim means having someone entertain "your’s illusions of grandeur" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>. Jean Baudrillard's concept of "charity cannibalism" suggests that when real tragedies are scarce, society invents its own, exploiting others' destitution for personal "adventure playground" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. This is exemplified when PC Principal validates Nathan as a helpless victim to fit his narrative, disempowering actual victims like Jimmy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.

The critique is not that everyone advocating for safe spaces is an extreme caricature, but that "otherwise reasonable logic has been caught up in a whirlwind of societal bullshit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>. *South Park* creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker criticize the "shallow versions" of [[political_correctness_and_its_critique_in_south_park | PC culture]] propagated in mainstream media, acknowledging their own privileged position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>. The show concludes that navigating society without seeming bigoted while avoiding "phony inclusion is really hard" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>.

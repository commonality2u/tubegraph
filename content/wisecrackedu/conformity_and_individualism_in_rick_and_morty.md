*Rick and Morty* frequently explores themes of conformity and individualism, often inverting common tropes to provide thought-provoking insights into human nature and society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. The show critiques basic values and delves into character psyche through its examination of these concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

## "Auto Erotic Assimilation"

The episode "Auto Erotic Assimilation" serves as a primary example of *Rick and Morty*'s exploration of conformity and individualism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. In this episode, Rick encounters his ex-girlfriend, Unity, who is a hivemind collective capable of assimilating alien races <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

### Inverting the "Body Snatchers" Trope

Unity's assimilation process, where she pukes into mouths to integrate individuals into her collective, directly references the 1956 film *Invasion of the Body Snatchers* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. This film, and the broader science fiction trope of aliens creating a zombie-like collective, depicts an alien assault that replaces people with emotionless replicas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. *Invasion of the Body Snatchers* has been interpreted as a commentary on the threat of the Soviet Union and the perceived loss of individualism under Communist rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

However, *Rick and Morty* inverts this narrative by suggesting that the freedom associated with individualism can actually be problematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. While *The Invasion of the Body Snatchers* expresses anxiety about Communism destroying individualism, *Rick and Morty* highlights the "very-not-fictional horrors of our own freedoms" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

### The Pitfalls of Individual Freedom

When the inhabitants of Unityâ€™s planet are liberated from the collective, they recall past lives as sex offenders and drug addicts, and their newfound freedom leads to a "nipple-driven race war" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. This demonstrates the show's argument that unbridled individual freedom can be chaotic and destructive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

### Rick's Egotism and Relationships

The tension between individual freedom and collective existence also serves to develop Rick's character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. Being part of a family or relationship often involves compromising individual freedoms for the benefit of the group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. Throughout the series, Rick's extreme egotism consistently hinders his relationships with his family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. In "Auto Erotic Assimilation," Rick's egotism not only destroys his relationship with Unity but also leads to the downfall of her entire society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. Unity's letter to Rick reveals that he caused her to lose her own sense of self within their relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

This characterization of Rick is further linked to Jeff Winger, the main character of *Community*, another show created by Dan Harmon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. Like Rick, Jeff Winger is depicted as an egotistical individual struggling to understand what it means to be around people who care about him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.

The show's consistent themes of [[alienation_and_societal_critique_in_rick_and_morty | alienation and societal critique]] are evident in its portrayal of the challenges of individualism and the complexities of belonging to a collective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. The series often presents a [[philosophy_and_absurdism_in_rick_and_morty | philosophy]] that questions established norms and highlights the inherent difficulties in human connection.

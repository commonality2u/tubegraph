The film *Idiocracy* explores a theory about societal decline, suggesting that "dumb, irresponsible people" reproduce at rates vastly exceeding those of "upstanding" citizens, leading to a continuous decrease in the general populace's intelligence due to a lack of natural selection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

## Historical Roots of the "Too Many Babies" Theory

This concept is deeply rooted in the historical movement of [[eugenics_and_the_concept_of_social_deterioration | Eugenics]]. The theory, explored in *Idiocracy*, posits that without natural selection, the general populace will continuously get dumber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. This very idea was popularized by Henry Herbert Goddard in his influential 1912 book, *The Kallikak Family* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

Goddard's book detailed the family of a pseudonymously named Deborah Kallikak, tracing generations of individuals he deemed "idiots" back to a revolutionary soldier who had a fling with a "tavern girl" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. In contrast, the same soldier, Martin Kallikak, later married a "nice Quaker girl" and fathered a long line of "upstanding citizens" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. Goddard's family chart, illustrating the "bad" people outnumbering the "good," bears a resemblance to *Idiocracy*'s opening family tree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.

Goddard's work was based on the concept of "feeble-mindedness," a term he coined, and he also originated the term "moron" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. He believed that feeble-mindedness was a spreading disease that needed to be stopped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

## The Eugenics Movement and its Impact

While Goddard didn't invent the movement, he significantly popularized Eugenics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. Despite the fact that Goddard later renounced his own work due to its methods being "riddled with errors and inaccuracies," the Eugenics movement gained widespread traction based on these now-debunked ideas about genetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. This led to the implementation of forced sterilization programs across America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. A notable instance was a Supreme Court case that upheld a sterilization law, with the court commenting to the plaintiff that "three generations of imbeciles are enough" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.

## *Idiocracy*'s Stance and Real-World IQ Trends

Mike Judge, the creator of *Idiocracy*, has addressed the criticism that the film is pro-eugenics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. He clarified that the movie's opening aimed to cover both nature and nurture, highlighting irresponsible parenting as a factor, and explicitly stated, "I obviously donâ€™t believe in eugenics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.

Contrary to the film's premise, the real world does not show "dumb people having kids" making the world dumber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>. In fact, IQ scores have been steadily increasing by approximately 3 points every year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. This phenomenon suggests that if Joe Bauers, the protagonist of *Idiocracy*, were to take an IQ test 500 years in the future, he would be considered "dumb as shit" by those future standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.

## The "Cultural Deterioration" Argument

Judge's critique in *Idiocracy* can also be labeled as a common refrain of "cultural deterioration" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. This includes complaints about language, cinema, and television worsening, signaling an impending "end of the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.

However, this complaint is an old one that historically proves untrue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>. Theodor Adorno, for example, believed that Jazz signaled "the death of good music" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>. Similarly, people have perpetually complained about "the youths" ruining language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>. Thomas Sheridan, in the preface to his 1780 English dictionary, lamented the declining standards of pronunciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. Such complaints are found throughout recorded history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>. Ironically, this very "deterioration" of language is what leads to the creation of new languages, such as French, English, Spanish, and Italian, from older forms like Latin or Proto-German <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.

In conclusion, while *Idiocracy* offers a humorous and at times prescient snapshot of early 2000s anxieties, its central premise about the world getting dumber due to reproduction patterns is not supported by real-world trends or a correct understanding of historical "cultural deterioration" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>. The film's strength lies more in its function as a [[social_commentary_on_violence_and_societal_structure | cautionary tale]] about society ceding critical thinking in favor of mindless consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>.

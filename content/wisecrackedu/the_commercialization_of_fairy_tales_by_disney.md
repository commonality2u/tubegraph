Disney has transitioned from an industry giant to a "behemoth," significantly impacting culture and storytelling, particularly through its adaptations of traditional fairy tales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:52">[00:31:52]</a>. While their films are widely beloved, questions arise about whether Disney's expanding artistic reach is detrimental to cultural narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

## Disney's Acquisition and Dominance
Disney's dominance in the entertainment industry is evident in its market share; in 2019, Disney made seven of the top ten highest-grossing films, including *Endgame*, *Aladdin*, *Frozen 2* [[themes_and_symbolism_in_disneys_frozen | Frozen 2]], and *Toy Story 4* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Many of the top 50 highest-grossing films of all time were either made or later acquired by Disney <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

This strategy of acquiring intellectual property (IP) is deeply rooted in the company's history. Founder Walt Disney, after losing the rights to his first successful character, Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, vowed to own "everything that he made" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. This early experience shaped Disney's approach, leading to the acquisition of properties like The Muppets, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars, and most recently, 21st Century Fox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. This [[disneys_acquisition_strategy_and_market_dominance | acquisition strategy]] has allowed Disney to become a "veritable creative and financial powerhouse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

## The "Cuteness Factory" Formula
Early on, Disney's success was based on a "simple formula": finding an existing story, making it "as cute and wholesome as possible" to maximize audience potential, and then profiting immensely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. This [[disneys_impact_on_cultural_storytelling | Disney aesthetic]], characterized by "round faces, saucer eyes, big goofy grins," was a deliberate choice to appeal to a mass audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

However, critics argue that this "reign of cuteness" was not accidental but a ruthless quest to make all things adorable, leading Disney to spend a century acquiring, adapting, and ultimately "twisting their original artistic intentions beyond recognition" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. This process involves "bleaching" stories in a "caustic vat of cuteness" and pumping them out for profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

### Case Study: Pinocchio
The original 1883 story of *Pinocchio* by Carlo Collodi was not intended to provide a "warm fuzzy feeling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. In Collodi's original ending, Pinocchio was "gruesomely hanged" by assassins, dying "stiff and insensible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. This bleak morality tale depicted a "mean-spirited and rude Pinocchio" who suffered consequences like being robbed, starved, and having his legs sawed off, with his actions causing his suffering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. The story also included "psychological abuse," with Pinocchio believing he had killed Geppetto and the Blue Fairy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

Disney's adaptation, however, "whitewashed" Pinocchio to fit its "cutesy aesthetic," removing the dark, satiric overtones in favor of "syrupy" dialogue and transforming Pinocchio into a naive, lovable character with a rounded design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. This radical change led Collodi's grandson to sue Disney's Italian distributor for infringing on the story's moral copyright <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

### Case Study: The Little Mermaid
Disney's 1989 classic, *The Little Mermaid*, is another example of this transformation. Based on Hans Christian Andersen's tale, Disney's retelling removed many of the darker and more religious overtones, presenting a love story with a "happily ever after" where "true love saves all" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.

In contrast, Andersen's source material is not "happy or uplifting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>. His story portrays love primarily as suffering; the mermaid endures extreme pain with every step, and the prince never reciprocates her affection, instead marrying another princess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. Andersen intended the mermaid to be saved not by love, but by "sacrifice," specifically a "Christ-like sacrifice" where she gives up her life and love to save the prince, eventually being rewarded with a soul after helping mankind for 300 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. Andersen explicitly "despised Disney's ending" where a kiss and a strategic boat crash resolve everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.

## Consequences for Culture and Children
The [[criticism_of_disneys_adaptations_of_iconic_stories | commercialization of fairy tales by Disney]] has several significant consequences:

*   **Rewriting Narrative**: Disney's method of "purging" beloved fairy tales of their original intentions effectively "rewrites the narrative in our collective memories" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.
*   **Shitty History Lessons**: In the case of *Pocahontas*, Disney's adaptation is criticized for providing a "shitty history lesson" by depicting a story of "freedom to love who you choose" rather than the historical reality of "colonists kidnapping a native American woman and murdering her husband" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>. Similarly, the original *Sleeping Beauty* is about a woman being "non-consensually impregnated in her sleep" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>.
*   **Undermining Symbolic Value**: Fairy tales, despite their dark or complex nature, offer children a "symbolic template for understanding the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>. They allow children to express and cope with anxieties, as seen in a children's cancer clinic where patients used fairy tales to process their struggles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. By stripping these tales of their "bite" and inserting "bland, wholesome narrative," Disney creates new narratives that can be "potentially quite destructive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>.
*   **Harmful Portrayals of Relationships**: Psychologist Susan Darker Smith points out that young girls who identify with Disney heroines like Cinderella or Belle from *Beauty and the Beast* are "more likely to end up in abusive relationships as adults" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>. These individuals may believe that if their love is strong enough, they can change a partner's behavior, mirroring the "love conquers all" message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>.
*   **Failure to Prepare for Reality**: By "peddling a convenient narrative" where all problems are solved by true love, Disney "fails to give children any tools for navigating real-life problems" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. The original purpose of fairy tales was to "convey the darker and crueler aspects of life so as to better prepare children for the realities of adulthood" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[0:14:50]</a>.

## The Capitalist Raison d'être
According to free market economist Milton Friedman, companies' "only responsibility is to make more money," regardless of social consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. This "capitalist raison d'être" explains why Disney operates as a "cuteness factory" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>. When Disney experimented with "grimmer, edgier films" like *The Black Cauldron* in the 1970s and 80s, they were "huge box office failures," nearly causing the company's collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>. The "Disney Renaissance" of the 90s was a direct "course correction back into the sentimental cuteness" that has sustained the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>.

Cuteness is a powerful tool for commercial success because it "hijacks our brains" and "sells" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>. Studies show that cuteness increases concentration and activates the brain's pleasure center, the nucleus accumbens, leading to dopamine release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>. This phenomenon, where cuteness is used for "potentially nefarious purposes," is termed "evil cute" by cultural theorist Joshua Paul Dale, suggesting Disney's "precious animated friends" might qualify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>. Ultimately, cuteness is a means for Disney to "pad its bottom line," irrespective of whether the stories are beneficial for children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>.

## Broader Impact on Storytelling
The "Disney-fication of storytelling" extends beyond fairy tales, affecting other iconic cultural works. With its acquisition of franchises like Star Wars, fans have expressed despair at creative choices that often revert to "sentimental fan service" and "sweet conclusion[s]" based on "magical kiss[es]" and "romantic sacrifice[s]," despite brief flirtations with darkness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>.

There is concern that as Disney continues to grow, its "blanket philosophy of cuteness" will expand, coming "at the expense of story nuance and morality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>. This raises worries that there won't be space for "grittier, darker stories" or "grown-up fairy tales" in the media landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>.

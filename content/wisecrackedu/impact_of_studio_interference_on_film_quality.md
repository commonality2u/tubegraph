The 2016 film *Suicide Squad* is identified as a "unique disaster" among the year's underwhelming cinematic releases, largely due to significant studio interference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. Warner Bros. reportedly found the film's trailer to be superior to the movie itself, prompting them to hire the trailer company to "functionally rewrite the movie" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Consequences of Marketing Influence

The direct influence of the marketing team is cited as the reason for the film's opening 30 minutes feeling like a "music video with too much neon exposition" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. Despite the movie being "hacked to shit," it still retained an ambitious core idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. The editing choices, influenced by marketing, significantly impacted the [[influence_of_music_and_media_on_the_films_narrative | film's narrative]] and initial presentation. This situation serves as an example of [[marketing_versus_film_execution_in_2016_films | marketing versus film execution in 2016 films]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Undermining Thematic Development

The interference profoundly affected the film's thematic depth, particularly regarding its primary theme of control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>. While the film initially sets up a complex exploration of control, showing multiple facets of oppression and power dynamics, the final cut simplifies these nuanced ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:00">[05:02:00]</a>.

The film's initial setup presents a potential moral gray area by portraying the protagonists as oppressed individuals seeking freedom, while those in power are depicted as lacking humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>. Even the villain, Enchantress, is presented as a victim of control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:29:00">[06:29:00]</a>. However, instead of developing this complexity, the film reverts to "the lamest of superhero movie tropes," making Enchantress a "bland, evil villain" with a vague motivation to destroy the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:49:00">[06:49:00]</a>. This choice, stemming from the production issues, robs the themes of control and oppression of any meaningful development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:00">[08:04:00]</a>.

## Lost Potential

The final version of *Suicide Squad* fails to fully develop its intriguing questions about the characterization of evil when protagonists, antagonists, and those in power are all depicted as "bad guys" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:19:00">[07:19:00]</a>. The film "dances around something insightful," but ultimately, all nuance is discarded, and evil is "lazily labeled as the thing that wants to destroy the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:39:00">[07:39:00]</a>.

The thematic arc intended for Harley Quinn, involving desire, surrender, and power, is also undermined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:00">[10:07:00]</a>. Although there are hints of an attempt to show her rejecting desire and domination, she ultimately remains under the Joker's influence, preventing any meaningful lesson or paradigm shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:32:00">[10:32:00]</a>.

There is a "spark of intelligence" in *Suicide Squad*, suggesting that "earlier versions of the film abandoned by studio would have been so much better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:51:00">[10:51:00]</a>. The final product, however, is considered a "mess" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:57:00">[08:57:00]</a>.

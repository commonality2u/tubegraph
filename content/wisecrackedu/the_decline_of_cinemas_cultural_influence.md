[[Quentin Tarantinos love for cinema | Quentin Tarantino]], known for his profound love for cinema, often integrates this obsession throughout his work, with films serving as homages to various genres and historical settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. His 2009 film, *Inglourious Basterds*, explicitly explores the power of film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## Cinema as a Weapon in *Inglourious Basterds*

*Inglourious Basterds* is a fictional account set during World War II, where a group of American Jews, led by Lieutenant Aldo Raine, wages guerrilla warfare in Nazi territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. The climax of the film revolves around a film screening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. The film is deeply "meta-cinematic," functioning as a film about film, with its plot framed by the broader German culture of cinema <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

Joseph Goebbels, the Nazi propaganda minister, is a prominent figure in the film, viewing his productions as the dawn of a new era in German cinema, distinct from the "Jewish German intellectual cinema of the twenties" and "Jewish-controlled dogma of Hollywood" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. Historically, the [[Nazi propaganda and cinema | Nazi party heavily exploited the power of cinema]] for propaganda, producing films like Riefenstahl's *Triumph of the Will*, which were technically advanced but condemned for their deification of Hitler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

Tarantino's film suggests that just as cinema helped build the Nazis up, it could also tear them down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. By depicting the stylized murder of the Nazi regime, Tarantino wields the same power Goebbels once held, but with an opposing message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. The film emphasizes that the camera is more powerful than the sword in its universe, as evidenced by the choice of a British agent with cinema expertise as a contact in Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. The Nazis' love for cinema makes them vulnerable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

The climactic destruction of the Nazi high command occurs in a cinema, set ablaze by 35mm film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. This implies that "cinema killed the Nazis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. Tarantino himself stated that "all that happens in *Inglourious Basterds* is because of the cinema... the 35 millimeter cinema killed the Third Reich" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.

Even though *Inglourious Basterds* is an alternate history, it posits that cinema won the war "in people's minds," cementing anti-Nazism as a norm in American culture, which was then globally exported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. Tarantino suggests that 35mm film and the medium of cinema acted as a "cultural safeguard" that suppressed the echoes of Nazism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

## The Challenge to Cinema's Power Today

However, the rise of xenophobic, neo-fascist political groups and an increase in anti-semitic and racist violence, alongside Nazi-esque content online, suggests that Tarantino's theory about cinema permanently killing Nazism might no longer hold true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.

### The Ritual of Cinema

Tarantino's film emphasizes the power of movies and the act of going to the theater as a communal activity and a ritual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. Rituals, defined as activities that distinguish a moment from mundane time, lend importance to the experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. For Tarantino, the traditional elements of film (projector sound, changing reels, projectionist) supercharge this ritual, enabling stories to have a lasting impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. This power, the film suggests, was strong enough to keep the Third Reich "dead" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

### The Internet's Influence and the Death of Monoculture

The current landscape, however, allows people to engage with movies without leaving their homes, lacking the built-in ritual of the theater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. This shift allows individuals to curate a "hyper tailored" cultural experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>, leading to a loss of cinema's power and poignancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

Media theorist Marshall McLuhan, in his work *The Global Village*, predicted the rise of "global media networking" (the internet) and its consequence: the "death of monoculture" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. This means everyone consumes culture "a la carte" to fit their interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.

McLuhan called this phenomenon "robotism" or right-hemisphere thinking, a capacity for conscious presence in multiple places at once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. While left-hemisphere thinking is associated with hierarchical reasoning and shared culture, right-hemisphere thinking involves more primitive intuitions and a rejection of shared ideas, leading to individuals creating their own belief systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. While the neuroscience of this theory is debated, McLuhan's observation of technology's hidden effects remains "prescient" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.

Today, shared culture is diminishing, with few vestiges of monoculture remaining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. This splintering allows for diverse cultural expressions, but also for behaviors once socially agreed upon as "bad," like Nazism, to flourish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.

### The Loss of a Ruling Center

McLuhan explains this phenomenon as the loss of a "ruling center" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>. In a decentralized, "electric circuit" culture, each point is as central as the next, and "social restraints based on interconnection hierarchies constantly dissolve and reform" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. A ruling center refers to the shared beliefs that underpin societal functioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.

As this shared agreement weakens, previously suppressed "nastiness" can emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>. There is no longer a fixed ethical center, with individuals deriving ethics from various digital sources like Facebook, Twitter, or YouTube, preventing a collective agreement on rules and behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>.

In this context, cinema's historical power to influence culture and relay critical social messages by appealing to a "ruling center" has diminished due to widespread "robotism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.

## [[Quentin Tarantinos love for cinema | Tarantino's]] Adaptation

Despite his staunch defense of the theatrical experience and his preference for shooting all his films on film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>, Tarantino has begun to adapt. He released his film *The Hateful Eight* as a four-part mini-series on Netflix, a move that would have been "unthinkable" for him just a few years prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. This indicates that even Tarantino recognizes the need to keep his voice relevant in the evolving cultural landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.

His upcoming, and allegedly second-to-last, film is set in 1969, a period when cinema was undeniably a central cultural ritual in America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>. This raises questions about how Tarantino will address his "love of the past and disdain for the future" and whether he will acknowledge cinema's diminished power or offer a new perspective on its role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>.

The contemporary [[Star Wars fan backlash and criticism|Star Wars backlash]] against recent films, particularly *The Last Jedi*, may appear to be mere "fanboys throwing tantrums" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. However, a deeper philosophical understanding, utilizing the concept of a "legitimation crisis" from political philosopher Jurgen Habermas, reveals a more profound issue at play within the Star Wars universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## The Star Wars "Crisis" Defined

Fan discontent is often rooted in director [[Rian Johnsons approach to revolutionizing Star Wars|Rian Johnson's approach]] of "subverting the canon" or "killing the past" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Specific grievances include:
*   **Subversion of Narrative Expectations** Rey's lineage was revealed to be "nobodies" rather than a significant family like Skywalkers or Kenobis, contrary to established "mystery box teasing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.
*   **Unceremonious Character Arcs** Snoke's character received "no storied rise" and an "unceremonious death" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. Luke Skywalker, a "wholesome hero," was depicted as contemplating killing his nephew and throwing away his lightsaber, which "just didn’t seem right" to many fans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
*   **[[Disneys acquisition and changes to Star Wars canon|Decanonization of Extended Universe]]** Following Disney's acquisition of Lucasfilm in 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>, many radio dramas, video games, comics, and novels previously considered "part of the gospel" by Lucasfilm were "decanonizing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. This act was seen as a "regime change" where "Lord Lucas was replaced by a money-hungry animated mouse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

The widespread fan disapproval for new Star Wars spin-offs and the "crisis" within the franchise reflects a deeper problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

## Jurgen Habermas and the Legitimation Crisis

The situation in Star Wars parallels what Jurgen Habermas describes as a "legitimation crisis"—an existential crisis threatening the foundation of a social system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. Social systems comprise governmental, socio-cultural, and economic sub-parts, which can be mapped onto Star Wars fandom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

*   **Governmental Analogy**
    *   Governments derive legitimacy from stories or ideas (e.g., divine right, popular election) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
    *   George Lucas acted as the "divinely ordained monarch of the Star Wars universe," with his creations and Lucasfilm-approved spin-offs forming the established canon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. His legitimacy stemmed from having "created it all" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.
    *   When a system's values are no longer upheld or are deemed "antiquated and useless," people may feel "betrayed" and begin to rebel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. This was evident when Disney, a "huge corporation," took over the franchise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

*   **Socio-cultural Analogy: The "Lifeworld" (Lebenswelt)**
    *   Habermas defines a "lifeworld" (lebenswelt) as a socially cohesive system with shared practices, beliefs, values, and rules of operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.
    *   The "general meaning of Star Wars, the values it represents, the characters it has developed, the stories it tells, and the themes that define it" were originally established by Lucas and agreed upon within the fan community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.
    *   This Star Wars "lifeworld" also contributed to individual identity by allowing fans to derive meaning from its values and beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.
    *   When Disney, lacking Lucas's legitimacy, changed these "agreed upon values, meanings, and truths" of the Star Wars system, it sparked questions and rebellion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. Hacking away at the canon affects fans' identities, which are "wrapped up in this sh*t" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.

## Historical Parallel: The Catholic Church and the Printing Press

The current Star Wars crisis is likened to the Catholic Church's legitimation crisis in the 1500s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

*   **Church Authority**
    *   Until the 16th century, the Catholic Church controlled the interpretation of the Bible because hard copies were expensive and literacy was low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. This allowed practices like selling indulgences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.
    *   In this analogy, the original Star Wars universe is the "bible," with George Lucas, as its author, holding the authority to interpret it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.

*   **Impact of the Printing Press**
    *   Johannes Gutenberg's invention of the printing press in 1440 enabled rapid text reproduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.
    *   Suddenly, ordinary people could read the Bible and develop their own interpretations, leading to figures like Martin Luther challenging the Church's authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
    *   This led to a crisis because the masses were no longer merely "consuming religious meaning, but also helping produce canonical interpretations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

## The Age of Prosumerism and its [[Impact of prosumerism on Star Wars fandom|Impact]]

Like the Catholic Church facing an educated populace, Disney now faces the "wrath of the educated masses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. However, the problem has evolved: people don't just read; they "blog, tweet, make video essays, produce their own cartoons, and stream content to millions of viewers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.

*   **Definition of Prosumer**
    *   The term "prosumer," coined by futurists Alvin and Heidi Toffler in the 1980s, describes the merging roles of producer and consumer in the modern technological age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.
    *   Star Wars fans are "prosumers extraordinaire" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>, actively shaping the meaning of the Star Wars universe through sharing YouTube videos, fan theories, and engaging in online communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.
    *   Every fan theory and discussion contributes to "practicing" Star Wars, making the community integral to its meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

*   **Consequences for Creators**
    *   The "age of the prosumer empowers people to criticize the few anointed successors of Lucas" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.
    *   This dynamic affects creators, as seen when director James Mangold (of *Logan*) tweeted about the difficulty of working on big franchises, comparing it to "writing a new chapter of The Bible (w/ the probable danger of being stoned & called a blasphemer)" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.

## Future Outlook

The Star Wars system is not necessarily doomed to collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. Like the Catholic Church, which "learned, adjusted, and stayed in tact" after its own legitimation crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>, the Star Wars system can also evolve.

The critical questions for the future of Star Wars are:
*   Will Disney adapt to the era of prosumerism, respecting fans and the universe they've helped create <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>?
*   Will fans choose to evolve with the system and find new ways of interacting with the material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>?
*   Or will Disney and the fans diverge, leading to separate versions of the Star Wars "religion" that compete for viewership, much like the Catholic and Protestant split <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>?

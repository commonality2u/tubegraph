The *Bioshock* series is known for its philosophical depth, particularly its exploration of [[integration_of_philosophical_concepts_in_bioshock_games | philosophical concepts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. A significant theme explored in the games is the concept of choice and [[free_will_and_consciousness_in_westworld | free will]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

## Andrew Ryan's Perspective on Choice

In the first *Bioshock* game, Andrew Ryan states, "we all make choices, but, in the end, our choices make us" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. This statement raises a paradox: if choices define us, how can we truly be free to make them? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a> Ryan's famous phrase, "A man chooses. A slave obeys" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>, serves as a direct commentary on the nature of gaming itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. Ryan suggests that players are destined to follow the game's fixed narrative path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. The idea that a gamer has any influence on the game's outcome, or "interactivity," is presented as merely an illusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.

## Hard Determinism

The central question posed by *Bioshock* regarding choice is: "Is Free will even possible?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>

One philosophical school of thought, known as Hard Determinism, posits that [[determinism_in_the_matrix_reloaded | free will]] does not exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. This perspective argues that if every action can be reduced to cause and effect, then all actions are inevitably bound by external forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. The concept suggests that what players perceive as a "choice" is simply an illusion, as their actions are a result of a series of events they had no control over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.

## Bioshock Infinite and the Multiverse

*Bioshock Infinite* introduces the concept of the multiverse as a potential solution to the problem of [[discussion_of_free_will_versus_determinism_in_the_matrix | free will]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. The idea of an infinite number of worlds to choose from <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a> suggests that protagonist Booker DeWitt's ability to go back and choose not to be baptized, or to smother baby Comstock, might offer a way out of a deterministic universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.

However, the game ultimately reveals that this very choice is not a real possibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. Even when the player is presented with apparent choices, the game subtly reinforces the problem of [[themes_of_control_and_determinism_in_the_truman_show | free will]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.

### In-Game Examples of Illusory Choice

*   **The Coin Flip:** Early in *Bioshock Infinite*, the player is prompted to "press X" to flip a coin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. While presented as a choice, the player cannot *not* flip the coin, as the game will not progress otherwise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>. Furthermore, every coin flip invariably results in "heads" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>, reinforcing the idea of a predetermined outcome.
*   **Handing Over Elizabeth:** Another instance occurs when Booker is told to "Bring [them] the girl and wipe away the debt" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. The game offers the "option" to press X to hand Elizabeth over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>. However, the only way to advance the game is to press square and pick up baby Elizabeth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. Despite the appearance of choice, the game forces the player's action, proving that the presented "choice" is merely an illusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. Unlike typical cutscenes, *Bioshock* makes the player actively perform these actions, forcing them to confront their lack of [[fate_and_free_will_in_macbeth | freedom]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.

Ultimately, *Bioshock* suggests that the only true way for a player to assert their freedom within its world is to turn off the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.

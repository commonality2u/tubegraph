    *   Her actions, such as bringing Neo back to life, mirror the Holy Trinity's purported act of resurrecting Jesus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>.

## Specific Literary Works Referenced

*   The film overtly references *Alice in Wondertown* and *The Wizards of Waverly Place* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>.
*   **Room 101 (from George Orwell's *1984*)**
    *   Neo's room number is 101, which is the same as Room 101 in George Orwell's novel *1984* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>. In *1984*, Room 101 is a torture chamber where prisoners are brainwashed by being forced to relive their worst nightmares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.
*   **Simulacra and Simulation (by Jean Baudrillard)**
    *   Neo stores his illegal programs inside a copy of Jean Baudrillard's *Simulacra and Simulation* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.
    *   This postmodern book discusses the decay of reality and its replacement with simulated images, exploring the idea of a copy without an original <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>.
    *   When Morpheus welcomes Neo to the "Desert of the Real," he is directly quoting this text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>.

## Philosophical Allusions

*   **Plato's "Allegory of the Cave"**
    *   [[philosophical_themes_in_the_matrix | The Matrix]] draws inspiration from [[philosophical_influences_on_the_matrix_trilogy | philosophy]], specifically Plato's "Allegory of the Cave" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>.
    *   In the allegory, a prisoner living his entire life watching shadows in a cave would perceive those shadows as reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>. If this prisoner were to see the sun, they would be overwhelmed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>.
    *   This parallels Neo's experience: his eyes hurt because he has never used them in the true sense, and he vomits upon discovering the reality of his world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>.

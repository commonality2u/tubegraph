*The Lego Movie* features bizarre [[philosophical_themes_in_the_matrix | existential undertones]] despite its appearance as a children's film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

## Emmet's Journey of Realization and Rebellion
After a "death trip into oblivion," the film's protagonist, Emmet Brickowski, enters a "heightened reality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. In this new state, he comes to the profound realization that free will is an illusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. Emmet perceives himself as nothing more than a puppet, controlled by a "snot-nosed fleshmonster" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

Emmet's subsequent act of wiggling off the table symbolizes an [[themes_of_existential_freedom_and_choice | existential rebellion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. This act represents his refusal to be defined by external forces, whether they are his societal overlords, his God, or even a beloved child star <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

### Religious Symbolism
Emmet's journey also takes on religious significance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. His name, "Emmet," means "truth" in Hebrew, which is fitting for his role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. His entry into the "real world" is symbolic of death, and his eventual return is depicted as a Christ-like resurrection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

## [[creativity_and_individualism_in_the_lego_movie | Creativity and Individualism]] Over Uniformity
Ultimately, *The Lego Movie* functions as a celebration of [[creativity_and_individualism_in_the_lego_movie | creativity and individualism]] triumphing over uniformity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. Emmet lives in a society as rigid as the Lego blocks themselves, where his individual will is stifled by strict instructions and a "terrifyingly catchy song" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

The film's core message, as Emmet learns, is that to become "the Special," one "must embrace what is special about YOU" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. This encourages viewers not to settle for being "just another cog in some larger machine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

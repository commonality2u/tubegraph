*The Lego Movie*, while appearing to be a children's film, incorporates "bizarre existential undertones" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05">[04:05]</a> that delve into deeper philosophical questions.

## The Illusion of Free Will

Following a "death trip into oblivion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09">[04:09]</a>, Emmet Brickowski enters a "heightened reality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11">[04:11]</a> where he confronts the idea that free will is an illusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12">[04:12]</a>. In this revelation, he perceives himself as "nothing more than a puppet being controlled by some snot-nosed fleshmonster" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14">[04:14]</a>.

## Emmet's Existential Rebellion

Emmet's act of "wiggl[ing] off the table" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19">[04:19]</a> symbolizes an "existential rebellion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21">[04:21]</a>. Through this action, he refuses to allow external forces, such as his "societal overlords," his "God," or even "beloved child star Fred Savage," to define him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22">[04:22]</a>.

## Symbolic Resurrection

Emmet is presented as a religious figure, particularly as his name, meaning "truth" in Hebrew, is noted as appropriate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30">[04:30]</a>. His initial journey into the "real world" is interpreted as symbolizing death, and his subsequent return is depicted as a "Christ-like resurrection" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35">[04:35]</a>.

## Embracing Individualism

Ultimately, *The Lego Movie* celebrates [[creativity_and_individualism_versus_conformity_in_the_lego_movie | creativity and individualism over uniformity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43">[04:43]</a>. Emmet's initial existence within a rigid society, where his individual will was "smothered by instructions and a terrifyingly catchy song," highlights the film's critique of conformity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49">[04:49]</a>. The core message Emmet learns is that to become "the Special," one "must embrace what is special about YOU" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02">[05:02]</a>, encouraging viewers not to "settle for being just another cog in some larger machine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08">[05:08]</a>.

Walter White, the central figure of *Breaking Bad* Season Number One, undergoes a significant transformation throughout the series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Initially, Walter is portrayed as a 50-year-old man who "enjoys playing with his food" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. He is described as moping around like a "Debbie Downey Jr." and dislikes doctors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. His life prior to his change includes being a "human test subject for cleaning products" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## The Shift to a New Venture

Walter decides he needs a new hobby and takes up the manufacture of methamphetamine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. This new enterprise offers "exciting growth opportunity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. As a small business owner, Walter seeks out ways to distinguish his product and edge out the competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. He also learns that a healthy working environment sometimes requires "a little stress relief" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

## Metamorphosis and Shifting Morality

Walter's expertise in chemistry frequently offers insight into his "changing and troubled excuse for a psyche" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
*   In the pilot episode, his chemistry class outlines the theme of his own "metamorphosis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
*   By episode two, Walter's lecture on thalidomide chirality points to his "shifting morality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.
*   In episode six, a presentation hints that Walter himself "may in fact be a volatile substance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

Walter is often depicted failing to thrive within existing [[american_dream_and_moral_decline_in_breaking_bad | American healthcare]] and economic systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. Despite appearing to live what was once called the "[[american_dream_and_moral_decline_in_breaking_bad | American Dream]]" with a family and accolades, he struggles financially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. The [[american_dream_and_moral_decline_in_breaking_bad | American Dream]] ultimately fails him, leading him to "rage against the machine" and create a new alter ego <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

## Attaining Respect Outside the Law

It is only by operating "outside the law" that Walter can achieve the "respect and mobility he so desperately craves" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. Ironically, by taking drastic measures to earn money for his cancer treatment, Walter "effectively becomes a societal cancer" himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. He gains energy for himself with each transaction, even as he contributes to "the deterioration of other human beings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

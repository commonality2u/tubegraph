Despite having been off the air for over six years, *The Office* remains the most streamed show on Netflix (or was, prior to NBC launching its own streaming platform) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This sustained viewership, with people watching it daily for over a decade, has led to a "baffling" phenomenon surrounding the show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. While the series is praised for its lovable characters and great jokes, its "secret sauce" may lie in its reflection of "bullsh*t," or BS, jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## The Premise of The Office

*The Office* is a mockumentary-style series centered on the Scranton, Pennsylvania, branch of Dunder Mifflin, a struggling paper company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. The branch is led by Michael Scott, a manager whose antics constantly divert his staff from their actual work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. After Steve Carell's departure, equally incompetent managers continue this tradition of distraction and poor metaphors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

On the surface, *The Office* depicts individuals navigating unsatisfying jobs while enduring deeply uncomfortable situations with their boss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. It also satirizes familiar [[workplace_dynamics_and_character_archetypes_in_the_office | office archetypes]], including:
*   The uptight accountant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>
*   The chatterbox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>
*   The attractive receptionist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>
*   The person anticipating retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>
*   The unlovable HR representative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>
*   The lovable dunce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>
*   "That guy who went to Cornell" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>

The show further addresses anxieties regarding the evolving American economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>, particularly the effects of digitization, e-commerce, and retail consolidation that emerged in the 2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

## The Prevalence of "BS Jobs"

A core argument for *The Office*'s popularity is its reflection of the widespread "complete and utter BS" that has infiltrated professional lives and the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. This concept aligns with anthropologist David Graeber's argument that [[the_concept_of_nonsense_and_bs_jobs_within_the_office_and_real_life | BS jobs]] are proliferating across the developed world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

Graeber defines a BS job as "a form of paid employment that is so completely pointless, unnecessary, or pernicious that even the employee cannot justify its existence even though as part of the conditions of employment the employee feels obliged to pretend that this is not the case" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

### Dunder Mifflin as a Case Study
Life at Dunder Mifflin frequently embodies the characteristics of a [[the_concept_of_nonsense_and_bs_jobs_within_the_office and real life | BS job]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>:
*   **Useless Meetings**: Characters spend time in meetings that yield no tangible results, such as creating acronyms or debating streamer colors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.
*   **Nearing Obsolescence**: The paper industry itself is struggling against modern chains and e-commerce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>, making Dunder Mifflin's existence precarious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.
*   **Meaningless Directives**: Employees follow random directives from superiors, including throwing out entire playbooks to implement new systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

While some real work is done (e.g., accountants Oscar and Angela, sales people selling), many employees are acutely aware of the pointlessness of their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. Even under threat of downsizing, a significant portion of the day is dedicated to "nonsense meetings, 'Flonkerton,' and office romance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

Many characters cope with the meaninglessness through distraction:
*   **Jim Halpert**: Jim, despite being praised for his intelligence, fills his time with elaborate pranks on Dwight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>, such as moving his desk inch by inch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. He's repeatedly offered promotions despite his lack of engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.
*   **Pam Beesly**: Pam spends her work hours planning her wedding and conspiring with Jim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. She even invents the role of "office administrator" to avoid being fired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.
*   **Kevin Malone**: Kevin, an accountant who can barely do math, remains employed for years largely because firing him would be uncomfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.
*   **Dwight Schrute**: Dwight embraces bureaucracy, obsessing over rules and inventing pointless structures like the "assistant to my assistant" role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.
*   **Andy Bernard**: Andy, as manager, spends months away from the office on a boat without anyone noticing, and the branch continues to function, even excel, without him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

The superfluous nature of Dunder Mifflin is explicitly highlighted when Michael explains his job to children: they don't manufacture paper; they simply buy it from a manufacturer and sell it for more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. The children quickly point out the business's superfluity and even immorality, akin to Office Depot, which is "running this out of business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

### The Paradox of BS Jobs and Societal Expectations
Graeber notes the paradox that a free market, theoretically, should eliminate such waste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. Despite Dunder Mifflin facing layoffs, mergers, and sales, the Scranton branch improbably succeeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>, riddled with inefficiencies like incompetent managers, accountants who can't do math, and an HR rep prevented from doing his job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.

Culturally, there's an expectation to work 40 hours a week, even if the actual "real work" is minimal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. This leads to a culture of "looking busy" and managers inventing pointless tasks to fill time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. Graeber argues that society believes if one isn't "suffering" at their job, it's not worth fair compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. Thus, "instead of optimizing efficiency, we've begun to optimize suffering" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>, leading to the hiring of more useless people to ensure others look busy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. Michael Scott embodies this, as the office could run fine without him; his behavior often impedes productivity, and he feigns busyness to avoid duties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

### Psychological Impact and the Need to "Be the Cause"
Graeber asserts that pointless jobs are not merely wasteful but "incredibly harmful to our psyche," causing depression, anxiety, and guilt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. People derive pleasure from "being the cause," or having an effect on the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>. Pointless jobs deprive individuals of this pleasure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. He references Dostoevsky, who theorized in a Siberian prison camp that the worst torture would be to endlessly perform an obviously pointless task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.

The characters of Dunder Mifflin are frequently thwarted from "being the cause" by management, bureaucracy, or the inanity of their tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. Much of the show explores their responses to their pointless professional lives:
*   **Jim**: Finds agency through his pranks on Dwight, "being the cause" of Dwight's suffering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>.
*   **Pam**: Copes through distraction, eventually finding solace in love and family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.
*   **Stanley**: Endures with the hope of retirement and "Pretzel Day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.
*   **Oscar**: Ends the show pursuing state senate, a role where he could theoretically produce change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.
*   **Kevin**: Finds happiness running a bar where he can competently bring joy to guests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>.
*   **Michael**: Denies his job's superfluous nature by convincing himself of its "paramount importance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. His hatred of Toby stems from Toby infringing on Michael's ability to "be the cause" in his own office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>. He yearns for love and respect, seeking to satisfy his lonely childhood by making his staff a "pseudo family" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. The show's [[referentiality_and_humor_in_television | documentary]] style highlights Michael's posturing for the cameras to present himself as an admired leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>.
*   **Dwight**: Embraces inanity and clings to pomp and circumstance, fulfilling his warped view of "being the cause" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>. Despite a successful beet farm, he fixates on bureaucratic titles and the appearance of authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>, ultimately aiming to become a petty dictator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>.

## Broader Societal Context
The success of *The Office* can be attributed to its cast, jokes, and its ability to serve as ambient background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. However, a significant reason for its resonance is the widespread commonality of [[the_concept_of_nonsense_and_bs_jobs_within_the_office_and_real_life | BS jobs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>. In 2013, when *The Office* ended, a Harvard Business Review survey found that half of 12,000 professionals felt their job lacked meaning, and another poll indicated 37% of British workers believed their jobs were "utterly useless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>.

Graeber theorizes that such jobs persist because their existence seems antithetical to capitalism, and society is reluctant to admit their possibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>. He compares this phenomenon to the Soviet Union's practice of inventing jobs to ensure full employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>.

Another factor is the rise of the service economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>. While traditional service roles remained stable, administrative, consulting, clerical, accounting, and IT professions boomed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>. While not all these jobs are BS, the sector is where BS proliferates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>.

Graeber categorizes [[the_concept_of_nonsense_and_bs_jobs_within_the_office_and_real_life | BS jobs]] into several types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>:
*   **Flunkies**: Employees existing solely to justify a manager's position or inflate their prestige <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>.
*   **Goons**: Roles existing because other companies have them (e.g., legal or marketing departments) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26">[00:17:26]</a>.
*   **Duct Tapers**: Those who clean up the messes of inefficient systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>.
*   **Box Takers**: Employees who verify that actual work is being done, when it often isn't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>.
*   **Task Masters**: Those who create BS work for other BS employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>.

As a company that doesn't actually produce paper, Dunder Mifflin squarely fits within this service economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>. Their higher prices are justified by customer service, and Michael's stated goal is to "hire people and inspire people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>, driven by his need to be loved and to create a "pseudo family" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>.

## Conclusion
*The Office* resonates with viewers because it portrays characters who successfully cope with the [[the_concept_of_nonsense_and_bs_jobs_within_the_office_and_real_life | BS job]] reality. The show offers an "escapist fantasy" where individuals aren't fired for minimal work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>. By the series finale, most characters have endured the BS, finding either love or simply moving on to different paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:33">[00:18:33]</a>. This suggests that in professional lives filled with pointlessness, the ultimate hope may be to find a better job or a fulfilling domestic life that mitigates the need to care about the job's inherent meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:42">[00:18:42]</a>.

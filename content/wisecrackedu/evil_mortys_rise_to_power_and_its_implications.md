Season 3 episode 7 of *Rick and Morty*, titled "The Ricklantis Mixup" (also known as "Tales from the Citadel"), is described as one of the season's darkest and densest episodes, building a complex and dismal political world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This episode offers a significant [[satire_and_social_commentary_in_rick_and_morty | social commentary]] on modern politics, hope, resistance, and revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Evil Morty's Ascent

Following the catastrophic events of "The Rickshank Redemption," the Citadel of Ricks began to rebuild, with democratic elections held for the first time since the Council of Ricks' dissolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. In this political vacuum, Evil Morty rose to power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

His campaign was built on a platform of "unity and change" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. He positioned himself as a leader who understood the true [[depiction_of_class_struggle_in_rick_and_morty | class struggle]] within the Citadel, arguing that the divisions between Ricks and Mortys were a distraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. Instead, he claimed the real problem was "the Ricks and Mortys feeding on the citadel's death" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>, highlighting a divide between the rich and the working class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. He asserted that the real division was between those who liked the Citadel divided and "the rest of us" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. He articulated a form of class consciousness, urging Ricks and Mortys to unite against the ruling elite to create a better world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

## Implications of His Rule

Despite his populist rhetoric, Evil Morty quickly revealed his "grander, and more totalitarian intentions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. His rise culminated in a brutal purge of his political opponents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>, suggesting his promises of unity and change were merely "lip service as a means to power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.

The episode suggests a pervasive sense of [[alienation_and_societal_critique_in_rick_and_morty | alienation]] within the Citadel, where all, including the apparent ruling class of Ricks, are victims of the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. This extends to the various subplots in the episode, including:
*   A police Rick confronting the corrupt underbelly of the Citadel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
*   Orphaned Mortys' hopes for adventure turning into "literal trash" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.
*   An assembly line Rick's rebellion being commodified into a "freedom wafer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

These narratives collectively underscore a bleak message: any political or personal optimism for change is "crushed by a cruel and indifferent reality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. The change promised by Evil Morty is depicted as a "ploy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>, particularly evident in the orphan Mortys' story where their wish for a better world, seemingly granted, is ultimately understood as part of Evil Morty's deception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

### The Illusion of Change
The episode's darkest message is that in a terrifying political reality, the best one can hope for is "the illusion of making a difference" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. The subplot of the orphan Mortys reinforces this, suggesting their actions "mattered" only in their belief, akin to the revolting Rick whose rebellion is commodified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. Ultimately, the show implies that no real progress can be expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.

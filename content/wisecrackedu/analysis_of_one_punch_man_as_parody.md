From: [[wisecrackedu]] <br/> 

*One Punch Man* is identified as a prime example of [[parody_and_satirical_elements_in_one_punch_man | parody]] in modern media, often discussed alongside works like *Watchmen* to illustrate the distinct differences between [[difference_between_satire_and_parody | satire]] and [[parody_and_satirical_elements_in_one_punch_man | parody]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a>. Unlike [[analysis_of_watchmen_as_satire | satire]], which aims to attack vice or folly and subvert literary structures, [[parody_and_satirical_elements_in_one_punch_man | parody]] exaggerates certain elements of its target while ultimately affirming the literary form it inhabits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:01:01">[12:01:01]</a>.

## Defining Parody in *One Punch Man*

[[parody_and_satirical_elements_in_one_punch_man | One Punch Man]] operates from within the texts and ideas it criticizes, accepting the logic and rules of its genre and taking them seriously as tools of its criticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:14:14">[12:14:14]</a>. The show's creators demonstrate a clear love for the genre, even as they subject it to ridicule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:55:08">[12:55:08]</a>. The fundamental difference lies in its intent: [[parody_and_satirical_elements_in_one_punch_man | parody]] seeks to awaken audiences to flaws in beloved works without aiming to demolish the genre itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:52:01">[14:52:01]</a>. Instead, [[parody_and_satirical_elements_in_one_punch_man | One Punch Man]] mocks anime and manga to help expand the possibilities of what the genre can achieve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:01:05">[15:01:05]</a>.

## Parodic Elements and Tropes

### Overpowered Protagonist
The central parodic element in [[parody_and_satirical_elements_in_one_punch_man | One Punch Man]] is Saitama, a hero capable of defeating any enemy with a single punch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>. This extreme power leads to [[themes_of_existential_boredom_and_ennui_in_one_punch_man | boredom]] for Saitama, who mourns his lack of a true challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>. This contrasts sharply with traditional protagonists like Goku or Batman, who face significant struggles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>. While Goku trains intensely, Saitama merely does push-ups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>. By exaggerating the overpowered hero archetype, [[parody_and_satirical_elements_in_one_punch_man | One Punch Man]] questions the necessity of other characters and traditional struggle in such narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:01:01">[13:01:01]</a>.

### Distorted Archetypes and Tropes
[[parody_and_satirical_elements_in_one_punch_man | One Punch Man]] takes familiar archetypes from its genre and twists them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>. Examples include:
*   A magical girl trope distorted with a "swole ex-convict" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.
*   A hardworking everyman hero who is a "debuffed version of Toku Hero Kamen Rider" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.
*   A Goku-esque world savior resembling a "low-rent Halloween costume attached to an egg" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.

The show also features intentionally over-the-top villain monologues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:56:00">[10:56:00]</a>, dramatic backstories for every character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:19:00">[11:19:00]</a>, and utilizes classic anime and manga tropes like ocean creatures, Kaiju-style monsters, and swarms of people in suits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:31:00">[11:31:00]</a>.

### Subversion of Heroic Endeavor
Characters like Genos and Mumen Rider embody classic anime protagonist traits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:25:00">[12:25:00]</a>. Genos, seeking revenge after trauma, is constantly made a joke by Saitama's immense power, yet his desires are not treated as stupid, merely irrelevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:29:00">[12:29:00]</a>. Mumen Rider, with a classic backstory and a hero's motivation to help people, frequently gets defeated, showcasing a "message about real life" where not everyone has what it takes to be a superhero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:51:00">[13:51:00]</a>.

This [[parody_and_satirical_elements_in_one_punch_man | parody]] critiques superhero stories by showing "precisely where they double and collapse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:38:00">[13:38:00]</a>. For instance, the traditional happy ending where a hero anticipates the next challenge is replaced by Saitama's relatable [[themes_of_existential_boredom_and_ennui_in_one_punch_man | boredom]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:28:00">[14:28:00]</a>.

### Critique of Narrative Models
[[parody_and_satirical_elements_in_one_punch_man | One Punch Man]] offers a [[comparison_between_mob_psycho_100_and_one_punch_man | criticism]] of the *Dragon Ball Z* model of storytelling, where villains and heroes constantly escalate in power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:44:00">[15:44:00]</a>. Boros, like Goku, seeks the strongest opponents but is willing to destroy innocents to find them, while Saitama, the strongest, is utterly bored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:48:00">[15:48:00]</a>. This highlights the failure points of an "infinite power model" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:03:00">[16:03:00]</a>.

## Parody's Affirmation of the Genre

Despite its critiques, [[parody_and_satirical_elements_in_one_punch_man | One Punch Man]] does not disavow the value of heroes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:07:00">[16:07:00]</a>. The show encourages recognition and emulation of the bravery seen in characters like Genos and Mumen Rider, while simultaneously acknowledging the silliness of the stories containing these lessons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:15:00">[16:15:00]</a>. This "critical difference" between [[parody_and_satirical_elements_in_one_punch_man | One Punch Man]] and [[analysis_of_watchmen_as_satire | Watchmen]] underscores that while both use overpowered characters to make points about their genres, [[analysis_of_watchmen_as_satire | Watchmen]] condemns the genre, whereas [[parody_and_satirical_elements_in_one_punch_man | One Punch Man]] seeks to refresh it without abandoning it completely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:24:00">[16:24:00]</a>.

The show advocates for moving beyond the "bigger monster, bigger gun" trope to explore other narratives, such as stories about chefs, ice skaters, and mahjong players, thereby opening up the possibilities for anime storytelling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:29:00">[15:29:00]</a>.

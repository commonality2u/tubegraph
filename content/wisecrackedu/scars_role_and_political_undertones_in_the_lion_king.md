Scar, the brother of Mufasa, plays a pivotal role as the antagonist in [[analysis_of_the_lion_king_plot_and_characters | The Lion King]]. He is characterized by his ambition for power and his rejection of the established social order of the Pride Lands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Seizing Power

Scar harbors a long-standing desire for Mufasa's death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. He orchestrates Mufasa's demise by tricking him into a wildebeest stampede <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. Following this, Scar manipulates Simba into believing he was responsible for his father's death, causing the young cub to flee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. With Simba gone, Scar successfully claims the throne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. His reign concludes when Simba returns to confront him, leading to a "kerfuffle" where Scar is defeated and left for the hyenas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

## Rejection of Feudal Society

Scar stands out as the only animal in the film who rejects the ingrained feudal society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. His opposition is perhaps symbolized by a visible head wound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. He laments that "life isn't fair" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a> and actively rebels against the "natural" societal order that deems him weak because he lacks the physical attributes of his brother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

## Scar's Reign and Political Undertones

Upon ascending to power, Scar ushers in an era of ostensible equality, allowing hyenas to be on par with the lions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. However, despite these "progressive politics," Scar is not entirely altruistic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

### Totalitarian Parallels

Scar's ambition and methods are imbued with significant political undertones:
*   His song about establishing a "new world order" features explicit Nazi marching imagery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.
*   Camera movements during this sequence are lifted directly from Leni Reifenstahl's *Triumph of the Will* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>, a film known for its propaganda promoting German tourism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

### Disruption of the Natural Order

Similar to historical totalitarian regimes, Scar's reign quickly deteriorates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. By interfering with the [[themes_of_social_order_and_hierarchy_in_the_lion_king | natural order]] of the food chain, the once prosperous Pride Lands descend into "anarchy and starvation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. This outcome suggests the film's conservative message that disrupting the [[themes_of_social_order_and_hierarchy_in_the_lion_king | "circle of life"]]—a fixed social order—leads to chaos and violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

*South Park* Season 19 marked a significant shift in the show's narrative approach, adopting a comprehensive [[south_park_serialized_storylines | serialized storyline]] unlike much earlier seasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. While the show experimented with this idea in Season 18, it was not as thorough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Season 19 is considered by some to be the smartest season to date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Narrative Structure and Social Commentary

Season 19 chronicles the fictional Colorado town of South Park as it undergoes considerable social changes, introduces a new central character, and provides [[satirical_social_commentary_in_south_park | commentary]] on America's contemporary political climate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. One of the season's cleverest aspects is its layered commentary, focusing not only on modern social conditions but also on the show itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

The season opens with the firing of Principal Victoria, leading to the appointment of a new person tasked with making South Park Elementary "a more progressive place that fits in with today's times" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This new character's declaration, "I'm here because this place is lost in a time-warp," serves as meta-commentary, questioning whether *South Park*'s signature vulgar sensibility can survive in a politically correct world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. The changes within the town can be interpreted as the show itself confronting changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. Characters like Officer Barbrady are depicted as "relics" from another time, while Newsmen continuously highlight "changes" to the town <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Mr. Garrison, known for his profanity, returns to South Park to "save it from these changes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

The season's plotline concerning political correctness (PC) culture is deeply intertwined with broader themes of [[neoliberalism_in_south_park_season_19 | neoliberalism]], gentrification, and advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. A key line from the season posits, "What is PC but a verbal form of gentrification? Spruce everything up, get rid of all the ugliness, in order to create a false sense of paradise? Only one thing can actually live in that world: ads" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. This connection highlights the show's ongoing [[south_park_and_capitalism | critique of capitalism]] and [[consumerism_and_social_commentary_in_south_park | consumerism]], suggesting that in a [[neoliberalism_in_south_park_season_19 | neoliberal]] economy, diversity and "otherness" are commodified as marketable brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

The ads in the show are portrayed as "grossly inhuman forces of [[neoliberalism_in_south_park_season_19 | neoliberal capitalism]]" that can assimilate or destroy everything while remaining largely unnoticed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. This raises questions about what ideas are truly original versus those planted by clever commercials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. The season's narrative suggests that only "reduced versions of ourselves, of cultures, that can be neatly packaged and sold" can survive in a world permeated by advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

## Meta-Commentary and Future Challenges

The show explicitly employs meta-commentary when depicting inclusion as good for business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. For instance, the town of South Park's economic advancement is tied to adopting "marks of tolerance" to attract businesses and new residents, exemplified by the arrival of Whole Foods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. The narrative critiques this "spectacle of inclusion" as another commodity sold for self-righteousness rather than genuine societal change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

The show's criticism extends to the individual as much as to other shows, questioning whether token inclusion truly fosters inclusivity or merely serves as a "shell of actual diversity" to boost ratings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. The narrative concludes that such displays of tolerance are often more about making privileged individuals "feel good" than genuinely helping marginalized communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

The [[trolling_and_internet_culture_in_south_park | "trolling"]] and "safe space" narratives of the season reveal a deep-rooted narcissism behind both political extremes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. While the show's creators, Matt Stone and Trey Parker, are aware of their own privileged position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>, they challenge the superficiality of PC culture, which they believe is "propagated in the mainstream media" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>.

The finale of Season 19 confirms that PC Principal, a symbol of these contemporary challenges, is "here to stay" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>. Stan's comment, "This is gonna be really hard," acknowledges the difficulty of navigating between avoiding bigotry and falling into the "trappings of phony inclusion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>.

Looking ahead to [[season_20_narrative_challenges | Season 20 narrative challenges]], the question remained whether *South Park* would yield to societal pressures and reorient itself completely, or "stick their middle finger firmly in the air and double down on their off-color roots" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>. Regardless, as a TV show, *South Park* needs to navigate the current political climate and maintain its appeal, including through advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>.

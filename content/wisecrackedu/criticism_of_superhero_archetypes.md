Self-aware humor in media, exemplified by works like *Deadpool*, *Cabin in the Woods*, and *Galaxy Quest*, often involves making fun of the very genres they inhabit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This trend of self-criticism is complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a> and involves distinguishing between [[satire_of_superhero_films | satire]] and [[satire_of_superhero_films | parody]], both of which exist to criticize the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. This article explores how *Watchmen* and *One-Punch Man* utilize these forms to critique superhero archetypes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

## Twisting Archetypes

Both *Watchmen* and *One-Punch Man* share a willingness to take the archetypes of their respective genres and twist them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

### One-Punch Man's Distortions
*   *One-Punch Man* distorts common anime tropes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>:
    *   Magical girls are twisted into a "swole ex-convict" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.
    *   The hard-working everyman hero becomes a "debuffed version of Toku Hero Kamen Rider" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
    *   A Goku-esque world savior is portrayed as a "low rent halloween costume attached to an egg" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

### Watchmen's Superhero Knock-offs
*   *Watchmen* features an army of superhero knock-offs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>, particularly distilling elements of Batman into different characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>:
    *   **Ozymandias** embodies the "charismatic, rich, and hyper-intelligent Bruce Wayne" who is seen as a force of good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.
    *   **Rorschach** represents the detective aspect of Batman, intensely searching for "Truth with a capital T," with this quest dangerously veering into horrifying obsession, akin to Frank Miller's take on the Caped Crusader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
    *   **Nite Owl** is a recreation of the "nerdy, inventor version of Batman," reminiscent of Adam West's portrayal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

Both stories use these twisted versions of recognizable characters to comment on what is often taken for granted in superhero narratives: the types of heroes, expected actions, and motivations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. This contrast explores a more "realistic" version of superhero power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

## Realistic Portrayal of Power

Both Saitama and Dr. Manhattan, while not realistic in their god-like abilities, offer a "realistic" reaction to omnipotence: boredom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
*   **Saitama** constantly mourns his lack of a true challenge, easily defeating any enemy with a single punch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.
*   **Dr. Manhattan** spends his time on Mars, contemplating time, and engaging in "weird sex" due to his indifference towards humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

Neither character struggles in a traditional way, unlike [[supermans_characterization_in_batman_v_superman | Batman]] or Goku <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. Physical confrontations are over before they begin for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

## Satire: Watchmen's Condemnation of Superheroes

*Watchmen* is a [[satire_of_superhero_films | satire]] that attacks the vices and follies of society and the superhero genre <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. It specifically assaults the idea of anyone possessing powers comparable to a nuclear weapon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.
*   The character of Dr. Manhattan, whose name references the Manhattan Project, symbolizes nuclear fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. He is used as a weapon, winning the Vietnam War by himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>, and his increasing boredom reflects the indifference of immense power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. It's a grim joke about [[supermans_characterization_in_batman_v_superman | Superman]], questioning why an all-powerful being would care about humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.
*   The Comedian, an extra-strong, hyper-capable super soldier akin to Captain America or Wolverine, exemplifies the corrupting influence of power, being both a sadist and a psychopath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.
*   *Watchmen* persuades its audience that the very idea of superheroes is a dangerous fantasy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. It posits that superheroes create an asymmetry of power that defies regulation, allowing them to violate rules and commit violence at their discretion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. By using the structure of superhero narratives, *Watchmen* subverts them to show how superpowers, or any immense power, inevitably lead to "f**ked up sh*t" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. It condemns superhero fiction for promoting a dangerous fantasy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.

## Parody: One-Punch Man's Affirmed Critique

*One-Punch Man* is a [[satire_of_superhero_films | parody]] that exaggerates certain elements of its target genre but ultimately affirms the literary form it inhabits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. It operates from within the texts and ideas it criticizes, accepting the logic and rules of its genre <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>.
*   **Genos** mirrors a classic anime protagonist who suffered trauma and seeks revenge, but his efforts are constantly rendered a joke by Saitama's immense power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>. This doesn't diminish Genos's appeal or make his desires seem stupid; it simply shows they are irrelevant due to Saitama's power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>.
*   The show critiques superhero stories by "showing... precisely where they double and collapse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>. For example, **Mumen Rider** has a classic hero's motivation, wanting to help people like his idols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>, similar to Midoriya from *My Hero Academia* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>. However, Mumen Rider constantly gets defeated, conveying a message about real life: not everyone has what it takes to be a superhero, and telling them they can might lead to harm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>. This offers a [[critique_of_heroism_and_societal_roles_in_goblin_slayer | critique of heroism and societal roles]].
*   Saitama's boredom intrudes on the typical superhero ending where the hero is happy and ready for the next challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>. This relatable reaction to having nothing left to overcome shows a flaw in the idea of infinite power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>.
*   *One-Punch Man* critiques the Dragon Ball Z model of storytelling, where villains like Boros constantly seek stronger opponents, while the actual strongest being, Saitama, is bored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>. The show displays how this "infinite power model" can fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>.

While *One-Punch Man* criticizes certain superhero narratives, it does not disavow the value of heroes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>. It wants the audience to recognize and emulate the bravery of characters like Genos and Mumen Rider, while also acknowledging the silliness of the stories containing those lessons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>. It mocks anime to expand the possibilities of what it can do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>.

## Conclusion

Both *Watchmen* and *One-Punch Man* use overpowered characters to critique the genres they inhabit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>. However, *Watchmen* condemns the superhero genre itself, making broader condemnations of social systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>, while *One-Punch Man* seeks to refresh existing narratives rather than abandon them completely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>. Examples of [[satire_of_superhero_films | satire]] alongside *Watchmen* include *Team America*, *Dr. Strangelove*, and *Heathers*, while [[satire_of_superhero_films | parody]] alongside *One-Punch Man* includes *Deadpool*, *Galaxy Quest*, and *Blazing Saddles* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>.

From: [[wisecrackedu]] <br/> 

Emmet Brickowski, a "yellow humanoid creature" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a> and construction worker, initially presents as an unpopular figure despite possessing the voice of a "charismatic and bankable leading man" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. His journey transforms him from an ordinary, compliant citizen into a significant symbolic figure within *The Lego Movie*.

## The Accidental Hero

Emmet's heroic journey begins unintentionally when he follows a "cute girl" named Wyldstyle and falls into a large hole, where the fabled "Piece of Resistance" becomes stuck to his back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. This event instantly makes him popular, leading others to "hang out with him" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. He is soon believed to be "The Special," a prophesied individual destined to save the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. This belief leads him to meet the Master Builders, who operate without instruction manuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>, and later to lead an attack on President Business' headquarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

However, the prophecy is revealed to be a fabrication by Vitruvius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Despite this, Emmet takes a leap of faith, falling into a wormhole and awakening in another dimension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. It is here that he discovers he and his friends are mere toys in a "toy story" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>, controlled by a "snot-nosed fleshmonster" (a child) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

## Symbolic Interpretations

Emmet's narrative arc is imbued with several layers of symbolism:

### [[existential_themes_in_the_lego_movie | Existential Rebellion]]

After his "death trip into oblivion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a> and entry into a "heightened reality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>, Emmet realizes that "free will is an illusion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. His act of wiggling off the table in the "real world" signifies an [[existential_themes_in_the_lego_movie | existential rebellion]], as he "refus[es] to let anyone define him" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>, whether societal overlords, God, or the child controlling him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

### Religious Figuration

Emmet becomes a "religious figure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>, a role fitting given his name, which means "truth" in Hebrew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. His initial fall and subsequent return from the "real world" to the Lego dimension symbolizes a "Christ-like resurrection" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

### [[creativity_and_individualism_versus_conformity_in_the_lego_movie | Champion of Creativity and Individualism]]

Ultimately, *The Lego Movie* uses Emmet's journey as a "celebration of creativity and individualism over uniformity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. Emmet lives in a society "as rigid as the blocks themselves" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>, where his "individual will [is] smothered by instructions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. His transformation into "the Special" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a> is achieved by embracing "what is special about YOU" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>, encouraging viewers not to "settle for being just another cog in some larger machine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

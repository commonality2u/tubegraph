The anime *One-Punch Man* presents a unique departure from conventional narratives by largely eliminating drama, primarily because its protagonist, Saitama, is so overwhelmingly powerful he can defeat any enemy with a single punch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. While boredom is a prevalent theme, the show's core focus is on conflict, specifically imagining a world without it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. This unique approach highlights the crucial importance of conflict not only for fictional stories but also for the human experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

## Conflict as the Engine of Narrative

Conventional narratives, from horror movies to action flicks, are inherently driven by conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. As screenwriting expert Robert McKee explains, conflict is "the music of story" and its progression builds the narrative forward in time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. Without it, characters lack motivation and purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data_t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

In a typical story, heroes encounter obstacles that force them to change and grow, with each mini-conflict driving the narrative towards a climax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. The original *Star Wars* trilogy provides a classic example, where Luke Skywalker faces constant challenges like the death of Obi-Wan and the loss of his hand, leading to his development as a character in preparation for his showdown with Darth Vader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. This aligns with the concept of [[the_heros_journey_and_narrative_structure | the hero's journey]], where struggle is central to the protagonist's transformation.

### Saitama's "Anti-Hero's Journey"

Unlike traditional heroes, Saitama's immense strength means he decimates any conflict with one swing, preventing him from experiencing development or even the fear of defeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. With no adversity to strive against, he remains essentially the same throughout the series, with even his rigorous training depicted as a stagnant routine rather than a path to progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

> "One hundred push-ups, one hundred sit-ups, and one hundred squats." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>
> "Then a ten kilometer run. Do it every single day!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>

### Shifting Focus to Supporting Characters

Because Saitama is immune to conflict, *One-Punch Man* often shifts its focus to supporting characters who *do* face challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. Characters like Genos, the wandering warrior seeking a teacher, and Dr. Genus, a scientist driven by dismissal, exhibit classic character arcs with motivations and struggles that contribute to [[narrative structure and the golden rule in storytelling | their narrative structure]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. Even the villains' motivations are explored, only to be abruptly undercut by Saitama's effortless victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

## Saitama as a Deus Ex Machina

Saitama frequently acts as a human "deus ex machina" – a plot device where an external force resolves an seemingly unsolvable problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. When the situation is most dire for other characters, he appears to effortlessly save the day with his unbeatable punch, rendering their struggles irrelevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

For example, when Genos prepares to self-destruct to save the city from Mosquito Girl, Saitama arrives to destroy the villain with ease, nullifying Genos's heroic sacrifice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. This deliberate use of [[impact_of_small_threats_in_fantasy_narratives | overwhelming power]] to prevent narrative tension creates an "anti-catharsis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

## The Absence of Catharsis

The constant fizzling out of conflict in *One-Punch Man* deprives the audience of catharsis, the emotional release experienced when connecting with a story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. We are trained to feel empathy for characters and their predicaments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. Philosopher Richard Kearney notes that story allows us to "repeat the past forward," revisiting our own lives and experiences through characters' actions and personas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

This emotional connection is evident in how Japanese audiences found catharsis watching Rikidozan defeat American wrestlers after WWII, or how Kaiju movies like *Godzilla* processed the devastation of the atomic bomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>. Similarly, American cinema after 9/11 allowed audiences to process emotions related to terrorist attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.

*One-Punch Man*, however, deliberately frustrates this expectation, preventing the build-up of dramatic tension and emotional payoff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. This is exemplified when Mumen Rider's heroic but futile stand against the Sea King is met with an anticlimactic "Nice fight man, you should be proud of yourself" from Saitama <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. This subversion of expectation is a core element of [[the_impact_of_storytelling_and_imagination_on_human_culture_and_consciousness | the impact of storytelling and imagination on human culture and consciousness]].

## Conflict and the Meaning of Life

Beyond parody and humor, *One-Punch Man* subtly explores the philosophical implications of a life without struggle or conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. Japanese theorist Masahiro Morioka suggests that humanity's drive to minimize pain and discomfort can inadvertently drain value from life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. While reducing pain might seem beneficial, Morioka argues that it can lead to losing "the opportunity of experiencing the joy of life that comes from encountering an unwanted situation and being forced to transform ourselves to find a new way of thinking and being" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.

Saitama's experience perfectly illustrates this. His early battle against Crablante had meaning because he struggled to achieve victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>. However, in his current state, where "all it took was one punch," his life has become devoid of purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. He finds the Paradisers' manifesto for "success with no effort" boring, highlighting his own dissatisfaction with effortless power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.

> "A civilization without pain and suffering seems to be the ideal of the human race. However, I wonder if people might end up with losing sight of joy, and forgetting the meaning of life, in a society pervaded by pain reduction mechanisms and filled with pleasure.” <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>

Even when Saitama finally meets a seemingly genuine challenger in the Season 1 finale, it's revealed he was holding back, and the fight still ends with one devastating "Serious punch" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>.

Through Saitama's "dead fish stare," *One-Punch Man* delivers a warning: embrace failures, pain, and suffering, because without conflict, both a story and a human life lack meaning and purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>.

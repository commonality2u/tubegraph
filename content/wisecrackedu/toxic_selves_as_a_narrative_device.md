The *Rick and Morty* Season 3 episode "Rest and Ricklaxation" employs a unique narrative approach by exploring the "toxic" sides of its main characters, Rick and Morty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This episode delves into character development and mental health, presenting a perspective that challenges traditional storytelling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Anti-Character Development

"Rest and Ricklaxation" is characterized by what is termed "anti-character development" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. This concept stands in contrast to common narrative structures, particularly Joseph Campbell's "The Hero's Journey," where protagonists typically confront and overcome a "shadow" â€“ a dark reflection of themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. Examples of this traditional overcoming include Logan sacrificing himself to battle X-24, thereby overcoming his selfishness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>, or Luke Skywalker sparing Darth Vader, which represents overcoming temptation towards the Dark Side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

In *Rick and Morty*, toxic Morty and toxic Rick are literal "shadow" versions of their healthier counterparts, created by an alien spa's mental detoxifier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. However, instead of the characters overcoming these toxic traits, the narrative arc involves a journey to reunite with their "worst selves" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. Healthy-Morty, initially popular and confident, ultimately needs to rediscover his self-loathing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. Similarly, Healthy-Rick, who appears thoughtful and normal, must rediscover his narcissism and "irrational" care for Morty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. The show suggests that "regular" character development can be "pretty creepy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

## Critique of Mental Health Ideals

This "anti-character development" serves as a [[critique_of_selfhelp_culture_in_rick_and_morty | smart commentary on mental health]] in modern society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. The episode parodies the idea, often promoted by self-help gurus and popular media, that one must strive to eliminate all unpleasant or painful thoughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

The show suggests that ideals such as "uncritically loving yourself," "saying yes to everything," and "believing in yourself no matter how stupid your passive income scheme is" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>, when fully embodied, can make one seem like a "coked-out weirdo" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

The episode aligns with sociologist William Davies' concept of "compulsory happiness," as explored in his book *The Happiness Industry* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. Davies argues that corporations, managers, and advertisers promote a definition of mental health that serves capitalist society, fostering a "cheerful acceptance of the status quo" and constant self-improvement for the sake of being a better consumer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

Healthy-Morty, for instance, spouts self-help platitudes and demands others partake in his new lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. When faced with real problems, like a sentient part of himself trapped in "hell," he dismisses it as "not healthy" to acknowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

### The Importance of "Negative" Traits

The episode argues that many emotions and traits that the self-help industry encourages people to erase, such as self-doubt and sadness, are "pretty important" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. In Morty's case, self-doubt can prevent him from becoming a "full-on sociopath" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. Healthy-Morty becomes an unscrupulous stockbroker, likened to a "sociopathic Wall Street fat cat with too much self-esteem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

Rick ultimately realizes that some of these "less desirable parts of ourselves," despite the pain they may cause, are "essential to actually being healthy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. Jessica's comment to Morty, "Good to have you back" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>, implies that Morty's authentic, "self-hating self," is his "truly better self" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

### Narrative Inconsistency

A critique of this narrative device arises from the episode's subjective definition of "toxicity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. While "Healthy Rick" expresses pride in being Morty's grandpa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>, he later claims his attachment to Morty is irrational and therefore toxic, allowing him to act nonchalantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. This raises questions about whether his love for Morty is considered toxic or healthy within the narrative's own framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

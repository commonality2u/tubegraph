Wisecrack's analysis of DC Universe films focuses on the overarching themes and ideological questions presented within the franchise, particularly through *Suicide Squad* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>, *Man of Steel*, and *Batman v Superman*.

## Core Thematic Concerns in the DC Universe

A hallmark of a thought-provoking movie is its ability to introduce and develop a theme through conflict, characters, and visuals, inspiring thought or feeling in the viewer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>.

### Theme of Control

The [[theme_of_control_in_suicide_squad | primary theme]] identified across the Snyder DC Universe is [[theme_of_control_in_suicide_squad | control]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>.

#### Man of Steel
*   *Man of Steel* explores how mankind can maintain [[theme_of_control_in_suicide_squad | control]] of their own society when metahumans with godlike powers exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. The suggested answer is hoping one of these beings acts as humanity's savior and preserves law and order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>.

#### Batman v Superman
*   Following *Man of Steel*, *Batman v Superman* raises the question of what happens if a benevolent savior, like Superman, turns antagonistic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>. It asks how mankind can maintain order if a powerful being with the ability to wipe out humanity becomes an enemy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>. The film's implicit answer is that Superman, being a "Jesus" figure, would sacrifice himself for humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>.
*   [[batman_v_superman_ideological_failings | Lex Luthor's painting]] in *Batman v Superman* serves to remind viewers that even Satan began as an angel, implying Superman could turn evil at any moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>.

#### Suicide Squad
*   *Suicide Squad* enters the narrative after Superman's death, posing the question: "Now that Earth's metahuman bodyguard is dead, how far must humanity go to maintain [[theme_of_control_in_suicide_squad | control]]?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>.
*   While *Batman v Superman* explored the ramifications of a god-like being wielding overwhelming power over humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>, *Suicide Squad* is positioned to explore the opposite: the ramifications of humans wielding overwhelming power to fight god-like beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>.
*   The film explicitly demonstrates various forms of [[theme_of_control_in_suicide_squad | control]]:
    *   Guards [[theme_of_control_in_suicide_squad | control]] and abuse the main characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>.
    *   Amanda Waller and Rick Flag [[theme_of_control_in_suicide_squad | control]] the Squad using devices that kill them if they disobey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>.
    *   The Enchantress battles for [[theme_of_control_in_suicide_squad | control]] over June Moone's body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.
    *   Amanda Waller [[theme_of_control_in_suicide_squad | controls]] The Enchantress by manipulating her heart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>.
    *   Amanda Waller also [[theme_of_control_in_suicide_squad | controls]] Rick Flag through his love for June Moone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>.
    *   The Enchantress [[theme_of_control_in_suicide_squad | controls]] people by turning them into slave monsters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>.
    *   Diablo loses [[theme_of_control_in_suicide_squad | control]] and accidentally kills his family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.
    *   The Joker [[theme_of_control_in_suicide_squad | controls]] Harley Quinn through their abusive relationship, symbolized by her jacket stating "Property of The Joker" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>.
*   Amanda Waller is compared to both God and the Devil within the film, leading to the question of whether her quest for [[theme_of_control_in_suicide_squad | control]] will go too far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:00">[04:38:00]</a>. This sets up potential moral dilemmas such as whether tyrannical [[theme_of_control_in_suicide_squad | control]] is necessary against existential threats, similar to *The Dark Knight*'s themes of order vs. chaos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>, or if such oppression is inherently evil, as in *One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19:00">[05:19:00]</a>.
*   As an anti-superhero movie, *Suicide Squad* asks the audience to identify with the prisoners, revealing their humanity despite being villains, while simultaneously portraying those in power as lacking humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>. This dynamic complicates the traditional divide between "good" establishments and "evil" supervillains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:12:00">[06:12:00]</a>.
*   Despite a promising setup for a moral gray area, the film ultimately resorts to the trope of making Enchantress a bland, world-destroying villain with vague motivations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:49:00">[06:49:00]</a>. This simplification robs the themes of [[theme_of_control_in_suicide_squad | control]] and oppression of their meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:00">[08:04:00]</a>. The film neither argues that oppressive power is necessary (as the Squad acts of their own accord) nor that it is evil (as Waller's corrupt status quo is reinstated) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:07:00">[08:07:00]</a>. Ultimately, those under [[theme_of_control_in_suicide_squad | control]] generally suffer, leaving the film's stance on [[theme_of_control_in_suicide_squad | control]] versus freedom ambiguous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:00">[08:23:00]</a>.

### Desire, Surrender, and Power

The Joker's statement, "Desire becomes surrender, surrender becomes power," offers a potential thematic contribution to *Suicide Squad* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:20:00">[09:20:00]</a>. This idea is somewhat reflected when Enchantress tries to seduce the Squad by showing them their deepest desires (Harley's normal life with Joker, Deadshot killing Batman, Diablo's family) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:00">[09:34:00]</a>. By wanting to surrender to these desires, they would grant Enchantress power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:48:00">[09:48:00]</a>.

Hints suggest an attempt to establish an arc for Harley Quinn related to desire, surrender, and power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:00">[10:07:00]</a>. Initially, she submits to desire and the Joker's domination, but later rejects Enchantress's domination. However, this isn't presented as a true lesson for Harley, as she remains under the Joker's [[theme_of_control_in_suicide_squad | control]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:32:00">[10:32:00]</a>.

### Conclusion

While *Suicide Squad* shows a "spark of intelligence" and potential for deeper thematic engagement, suggesting earlier, more insightful versions of the script may have existed, the final cut ultimately fails to fully develop its complex themes of [[theme_of_control_in_suicide_squad | control]], oppression, desire, and freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:51:00">[10:51:00]</a>.

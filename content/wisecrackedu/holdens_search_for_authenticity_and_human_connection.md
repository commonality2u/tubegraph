*The Catcher in the Rye* by J.D. Salinger tells the story of [[Holden Caulfields struggles with society | Holden Caulfield]], a 16-year-old boy whose narrative is told from a mental hospital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. The novel illustrates [[Holden Caulfields struggles with society | Holden's]] attempt to find stability and acceptance in a society he perceives as "faking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. When he comes up empty-handed in this search, he feels he must "buck the system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

## Rejection of "Phoniness"

Holden's values often stand in reverse to the rest of society's, symbolized by him turning his hunting hat around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. This stance foreshadows his desire to be the "Catcher in the Rye" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. Figuratively, he aims to save children from the "bent-ass shit of adulthood" and the "fake-ass world of adults" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. His admiration for the unchanging exhibits in the Museum signifies his wish to freeze time and avoid becoming one of the "fake-ass adults," like the "plastic playas behind the glass" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

## Struggle for Genuine Connection

Despite his desire for connection, Holden struggles significantly. He admits he has never "busted his cherry," even while claiming to have been "swimmin in trim" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. When he hires a prostitute named Sunny, he "chokes" and merely states he wants to talk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

Holden's loneliness stems from his "legit desire to search for beauty in human contact" that he struggles to find in a world he views as ugly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. This makes him one of literature's loneliest characters because he "keeps it so real, while errybody else frontin’" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

### Relationships with Others

*   **Phoebe:** The only person [[Holdens relationships with other characters | Holden]] feels he can "keep it real with" is his younger sister, Phoebe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   **Other Characters:** [[Holdens relationships with other characters | Holden]] attempts to connect with his old teacher, Spencer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>, and later with Mr. Antolini, though he flees when he suspects Antolini is "feelin him up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. He also has a physical altercation with his roommate, Stradlater, over a girl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## Holden's Inner Conflict

While Holden "spittin that righteous talk," he himself is not a "prince," admitting, "I’m the most terrific liar you ever saw in your life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. Despite projecting a tough exterior, he possesses a gentle soul, evident in his concern for the ducks in Central Park when the lake freezes over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. Ultimately, [[Holden Caulfields struggles with society | Holden]] pays the price for being "too soft in a world twisted by deceit," ending up in a psych ward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

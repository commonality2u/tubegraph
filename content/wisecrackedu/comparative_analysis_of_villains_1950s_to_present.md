Villains are often considered the best part of a movie, evoking emotions ranging from fear to empathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Lately, audiences have found themselves nodding along to diabolical logic or feeling more empathetic than usual towards antagonists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Contemporary villains, such as Killmonger from *Black Panther* or Screenslaver from *The Incredibles 2*, have become strangely relatable, each presenting articulate criticisms of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

Villainy consistently mirrors the prevailing value systems and fears of a given era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. While villain archetypes can break molds or draw inspiration from the past, this analysis focuses on noticeable trends within enduring films of each period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

## The 1950s and Early 1960s: The "Other" and One-Dimensional Evil

This era, described as the height of the Cold War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>, presented a largely black-and-white view of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. American villains were straightforwardly evil, embodying the "other" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

### Characteristics of Villains
*   **External Threats**: Movie screens were populated by "bad Russian people, bad Asian people, and very bad aliens" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. These "naughty dudes" were an "inherent, inexplicable evil that’s stoked on destroying America and our apple pie values" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
    *   Examples include the amorphous red "Blob", the "Creature from the Black Lagoon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>, and aliens from *The Invasion of the Body Snatchers*, which symbolized fears of Communist brainwashing and infiltration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
*   **Biblical Epics**: The 1950s also saw a resurgence of biblical sagas, which subtly supported Cold War propaganda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. These films depicted "God-fearing Americans" against "godless communists" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
    *   *Ben Hur* featured an evil Roman commander persecuting an aristocratic Jew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
    *   *Quo Vadis* pitted Christian converts against Emperor Nero and his Roman Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.
    *   *The Ten Commandments* showed Moses confronting the Egyptian emperor Ramses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
    *   These villains were "representatives of larger groups of bad people who wanted to cancel baseball and tupperware parties" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
*   **Cold War Agents**: Even when not explicitly foreign or pagan, villains were often "anti-American, Communist double agents" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>, or agents of Russian intelligence agencies like SMERSH in James Bond films <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

This period was characterized by an "us vs. them" mentality, portraying villains as "pure and simply evil," often one-dimensional "foreign/communist/alien/blob" figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

## The Late 1960s and 1970s: Institutional Corruption and Blurred Lines

A definitive shift in villain portrayal occurred in the late 1960s and 1970s, reflecting a time of significant social turbulence and soul-searching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. Events like the Civil Rights Movement and the Vietnam War exposed America's less perfect aspects, leading to a startling drop in public trust in government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

### Characteristics of Villains
*   **Corrupt Systems**: Movies highlighted the "corrupt social systems that Americans were increasingly disillusioned with" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. Evil politicians and public officials were prominent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
    *   *All the President’s Men* (1976) brought the Watergate scandal to the big screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
    *   Steven Spielberg’s *Jaws* depicted a "crooked mayor who cares more about tourism revenue than keeping people from becoming shark bait" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.
    *   In *Chinatown*, a sinister billionaire claimed his evil acts were due to his environment, suggesting that "circumstances of power make the villain, rather than any innate nature" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.
*   **Corrupt Cops**: Films like *Serpico* (based on a true story) depicted a world where police corruption was assumed, and Frank Serpico was distrusted for refusing bribes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. Corrupt cops were mainstays in *The Godfather*, *White Lightning*, *The French Connection*, and *The Conversation* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>, signifying a loss of goodwill towards institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.
*   **Institutional Villains**: Villains began to embody the very broken systems that angered people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.
    *   Nurse Ratched from *One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest* transformed a benevolent profession into one that turned individuals into "drugged-up, dependent ghosts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.
    *   *East from Alcatraz* and *Cool Hand Luke* similarly portrayed prisoners as sympathetic heroes struggling against evil wardens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. In these cases, the person imposing law or societal norms became the villain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.
*   **Blurred Hero/Villain Lines**: The 1970s "muddied the waters by blurring the line between hero and villain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. Characters were "conflicted, heavily-flawed protagonists with questionable, even hideous morals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.
    *   *Walter White* from *Breaking Bad* is cited as an anti-hero who eventually morphs into a villain protagonist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.
    *   Travis Bickle in Martin Scorsese’s *Taxi Driver* (1976) exemplifies this, swinging from plotting assassination to rescuing a child prostitute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.
    *   In *Dog Day Afternoon* (1975), Sonny Wortzik, a novice crook, holds bank workers hostage to fund his wife's gender-affirming surgery, revealing a more complex, sympathetic motivation than typical villains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.

## The 1980s: Cartoonish Threats and Lingering Skepticism

The 1980s saw a "backpedal" towards more cartoonish villains who directly embodied the era's biggest threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>, ushering back an "us vs. them" paradigm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

### Characteristics of Villains
*   **War on Drugs**: Villains frequently sought "sweet sweet drug money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a> in films like *Scarface*, *To Live & Die in L.A.*, *Beverly Hills Cop*, and *Raw Deal* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. This served as a "ying-yang response" to the unsavory cops of the 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.
    *   *Tango & Cash* depicted roguish cops as protagonists despite using violence, justified by their effectiveness against drug lords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>, ultimately endorsing a "by any means necessary" policing model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.
*   **Cold War Resurgence**: Renewed Cold War anxieties brought back "evil Russians" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.
    *   *Rocky IV* featured the uncharming Soviet boxer Ivan Drago, accused of being "pure anti-Soviet propaganda" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.
    *   *Red Heat* depicted Soviet drug lord Viktor Rostavili as a "trifecta of evil" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.
    *   *Red Dawn* (1984) imagined a Soviet invasion of America, explicitly intended by its director, John Milius, as a warning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.
*   **Exploiting Corrupt Institutions**: Despite the return to "the other as the enemy," hints of 1970s skepticism lingered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>. Villains continued to exploit corrupt institutions for personal gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.
    *   Gordon "Greed is Good" Gekko used the corrupt financial industry for "gold-plated desires" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.
    *   Hans Gruber from *Die Hard* (1988) initially posed as a terrorist exacting revenge on a greedy corporation, but was revealed to be solely after money, like Gekko <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>.

## The 1990s: Homegrown Terror and Anti-Villains

The 1990s reflected a shift towards "homegrown terrorist" and "going postal" headlines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. This was a prime time for "complex anti-villains" fighting localized battles through radical means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>.

### Characteristics of Villains
*   **Philosophical Motivations**: Villains showed motivations beyond mere monetary gain, often hinting at deeper philosophies.
    *   Howard Payne from *Speed* (1994), a former bomb squad officer turned extortionist, was partly motivated by money but also expressed a sense of superiority and a desire for "meaning" and "purpose" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>.
    *   John Doe in *Se7en* (1995) saw himself as a "chosen warrior" crusading against everyday sin, "setting the example" through sadistic acts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.
*   **Domestic Terrorists**: *Arlington Road* (1999) epitomized the domestic terror genre, with a villain who was a suburban neighbor secretly orchestrating bombings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>. He claimed a "lofty noble goal" but also critiqued "Clinton-era prosperity," questioning, "Are you happy in your godless, suburban life?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>.
*   **Victimized by System/Circumstance**: These villains often felt victimized by the system or circumstance and sought justice on their "icky terms" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>.
    *   In *American Beauty*, the villain was Lester’s homophobic, Nazi-memorabilia-hoarding neighbor Frank Fitts, who killed Lester after being rebuffed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>.
    *   Some villains even had "genuinely noble causes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. In *The Rock* (1996), General Hummel held San Francisco hostage to demand compensation for slain Marines' families <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>, raising the question of whether noble ends justify violent means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>.

## The 2000s: Nihilism and the "Spirit of Terrorism"

The 2000s, shaped by 9/11 and the War on Terror <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>, saw villains confront an "existential threat to its sense of safety and power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>.

### Characteristics of Villains
*   **Anarchy and Chaos**: Christopher Nolan’s *Dark Knight Trilogy* captured the popular imagination. In *Batman Begins* (2005), the international terrorist group "The League of Shadows" aimed to destroy Gotham <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>.
    *   Heath Ledger’s Joker in *The Dark Knight* (2008) embodied the "spirit of terrorism," representing "anarchy and chaos of a particularly destructive and nihilistic nature" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>, with the film bursting with 9/11 iconography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>.
*   **Randomness and Meaninglessness**: This era also featured villains who made fates arbitrary.
    *   Two-Face in *The Dark Knight* represented how evil can corrupt even the noble, deciding fates through "pure contingency and nihilism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.
    *   Anton Chigurh from *No Country For Old Men* (2007) used a coin flip to decide victims' fates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>. He was an "active nihilist" who believed that if morality is contrived, a coin flip is as valid as any method to decide life or death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>.
    *   Frank Costello from Martin Scorsese's *The Departed* (2006) also acted on the belief that life is meaningless ("We all are, act accordingly") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>, excusing any actions that sustained him for "just one more day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>.

The 2000s depicted a villainous creed of "no creed at all," reflecting a sense of meaninglessness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>.

## Present Day: Relatable Villains and Radical Solutions

Contemporary villains reflect an increasingly divided America with low trust in government, media, and religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>. They embody radical, violent solutions to seemingly objectively evil systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>.

### Characteristics of Villains
*   **Challenging Corrupt Systems**: Unlike 1950s villains who infiltrated good systems, today's villains "face objectively evil systems which they want to change for the better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>. Their villainy lies only in their extreme means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>.
    *   Killmonger in *Black Panther* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a> held a "legitimate critique of how the world treats its black citizens and Wakanda’s passivity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>. His radical plan to instigate a militant uprising ultimately led to positive policy changes in Wakanda, such as ending isolationism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>.
    *   August Walker/John Lark from *Mission Impossible 6* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:43">[00:19:43]</a>, a utilitarian villain, sought to destroy a third of the world to bring the remaining two-thirds together, believing "the greater the suffering, the greater the peace" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:49">[00:19:49]</a>.
    *   Thanos from *Infinity War* wanted to eliminate half the world's population to solve resource scarcities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:03">[00:20:03]</a>.
    *   Screenslaver from *The Incredibles 2* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a> critiqued how "endless repackaging of life into consumable media has made us all lazy passive observers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>, and that superheroes keep people "docile and meek" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>. Her plan involved mind-controlling superheroes to discredit them so people would learn to protect themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>.

These contemporary villains share a "majorly out-there plan that appeals to our country’s growing fears that the world is screwed beyond repair, and the only way to fix it is to tear it down" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:33">[00:20:33]</a>. Audiences can empathize with their critique of the system and desire for change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:44">[00:20:44]</a>. In this "through the looking glass" reinterpretation of villainy, heroes often appear as flawed protectors of an undesirable status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:52">[00:20:52]</a>.

## Conclusion: An [[Evolution of Villains in Cinema | Evolving Archetype]]

Today's villains are a "weird mirror image" of 1950s villains; instead of corrupting good institutions, they aim to effect good change within corrupt institutions, albeit through terrible means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>. They merge the complexity of 90s villains with the broadened [[Relatable Villains and Social Critiques | social critiques]] of the 70s, standing in opposition to the nihilism of the 2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:14">[00:21:14]</a>. These villains believe in a cause worth fighting for, and if they chose different methods for social change, they might well be seen as complex heroes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a>.

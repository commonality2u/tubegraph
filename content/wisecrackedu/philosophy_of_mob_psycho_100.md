*Mob Psycho 100*, created by ONE, the same Japanese manga artist behind *[[comparison_between_mob_psycho_100_and_one_punch_man | One Punch Man]]*, explores the concept of [[the_meaning_of_a_fulfilling_life_in_mob_psycho_100 | living a fulfilling life]] through the lens of an overpowered protagonist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Unlike Saitama from *[[comparison_between_mob_psycho_100_and_one_punch_man | One Punch Man]]*, Shigeo Kageyama (Mob) manages to find satisfaction and peace with his abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Mob's Approach to Power

Mob is a middle schooler with psychic powers that grant him near-godlike control over the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. He works for Reigen Arataka, a con man who masquerades as a powerful psychic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. From the start, Reigen advises Mob never to use his powers against another human, warning that misusing such great power would only lead to self-destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. Reigen's intention is to teach Mob control, preventing his powers from going berserk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

Mob's daily life is an attempt to live normally, often repressing the rage that fuels his powers, which occasionally gets out of his control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. When other superpowered individuals, known as 'espers,' attack Mob or his friends, he faces a dilemma: protect his loved ones or adhere to his promise not to harm others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

Mob's reluctance to use his powers might seem unusual, as having such abilities could appear to be highly advantageous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## The Egocentricity of Other Espers

Characters like Teru, the "shadow leader" of a rival middle school gang, use their psychic powers to bully others, seemingly gaining attention, respect, and power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. Dimple, a power-hungry ghost, even states that Teru has "put his psychic powers to good life and live a fulfilling life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

However, most espers and powerful beings in this world are profoundly egocentric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. They see themselves as the "main characters" of an unfolding story, rather than ordinary people with limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. This sense of entitlement often leaves them feeling miserable when reality doesn't conform to their inflated self-perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. They believe the world should worship them because they are "a gift" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

Mob, however, doesn't desire Teru's superficially perfect life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. He believes an easy life built on innate gifts would be "pointless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a> because the things he truly wants, like muscles, understanding girls, or reading social cues, are things he must work for, regardless of his powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. Mob recognizes that if these espers had their psychic powers removed, "there'll be nothing left. You'll be empty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. Their dependence on powers for identity and worth makes them fragile, unable to tolerate any challenges to their self-image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

## The Philosophy of the Sublime

Mob's perspective on accepting limitations is supported by Irish philosopher Edmund Burke, known for his description of "the sublime" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

> [!INFO] The Sublime
> The sublime is defined as the feeling of experiencing oneself as infinitesimally small when confronted by vast forces beyond one's control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. It is a display of power or grandeur that completely overwhelms one's own capabilities, suspending or even destroying egocentricity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. Examples include gazing at a mountain range, staring into deep space, or sailing through a thunderstorm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

Burke believed that such experiences are vital for a healthy life, as they compel individuals to engage mental and spiritual capacities that might otherwise be ignored, specifically those that remind us we are not at the center of the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. Avoiding challenging scenarios that enable the experience of the sublime can lead to an unhealthy state, resulting in "Melancholy, dejection, despair, and often self-murder" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

Burke held that the sublime literally "exercises parts of our minds and bodies" that are crucial for well-being, particularly those that "tense up" in response to fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. He argued that "Labour [is] a thing absolutely requisite to make us pass our lives with tolerable satisfaction," and that "the best remedy for all these evils is to exercise or labour; and labour is a surmounting of difficulties" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. For the mind and body to function properly, they must be "shaken and worked to a proper degree" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

## Espers' Failures vs. Mob's Success

Many espers in *Mob Psycho 100* fall into the trap of being "too relaxed" about their place in the universe, leading to profound dissatisfaction despite their power or status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. They avoid "difficulties" by relying solely on their psychic powers for social status and a false sense of self-worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. Consequently, they need to be "shaken and worked" by external forces before they can find genuine fulfillment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

Mob, unlike the deluded espers, actively seeks the difficult "labour" of integrating into the world and society, rather than trying to transcend it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. He finds allies in the Body Improvement Club, whose members, like Burke, view "surmounting of difficulties" as crucial for a fulfilling life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. They choose to challenge their weaknesses instead of solely relying on innate strengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.

### The Sublime as a Reality Check

Teru's defeat by Mob serves as a clear example of the sublime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. Overwhelmed by Mob's power, Teru experiences terror and utter helplessness, feeling the fear of death as he is stripped of his hair, clothes, and hoisted into the sky by Mob's out-of-control powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. This experience of insignificance brings Teru true peace, as he realizes, "I guess...I'm just an average person after all" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

Reigen also exposes the remaining "Scars" to the sublime by shattering their delusions of grandeur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. Using Mob's transferred powers and his own rhetoric, Reigen reminds them that despite their abilities, they are "nothing more than a commoner" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. This forceful confrontation with their insignificance puts them on a path toward a healthier, more mature mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. For espers, the key to freedom lies in accepting their human vulnerability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. The show's theme song encapsulates this idea: "If everyone is not special...Maybe you can be what you want to be" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.

### Mob's Own Delusion and Sublime Experience

Even Mob, despite his desire for normalcy, suffers from a delusional self-image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. As a 14-year-old, he believes he must be in total control of his world and is profoundly responsible for everything that happens, especially during his unconscious psychic episodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>. This leads him to repress his emotions, fearing his rage will overwhelm him, paradoxically giving him less control over his explosions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. The burden of this perceived responsibility causes him immense pain and a feeling of powerlessness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. This is Mob's unique delusion: a benevolent desire for godhood, where he sees himself as the primary "mover and shaker" of his world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>.

It is Reigen, an adult Mob respects, who helps him overcome this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. Reigen reminds Mob that he is just a kid and doesn't always have to shoulder the world's burdens, telling him, "When things go south, it's okay to run away" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. This realization shocks Mob into an experience of the sublime, where he feels his own insignificance and temporarily transfers his powers to Reigen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>. This moment allows Mob to finally come to terms with his abilities and move towards [[the_meaning_of_a_fulfilling_life_in_mob_psycho_100 | living a good life]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>.

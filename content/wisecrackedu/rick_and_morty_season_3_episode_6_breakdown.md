[[Rick and Morty episode analysis | Rick and Morty]] Season 3 Episode 6, "Rest and Ricklaxation," is highlighted for its unique approach to [[character_development_in_rick_and_morty | character development]] and its exploration of [[themes_of_mental_health_in_rick_and_morty | mental health]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Episode Recap

Rick and Morty, feeling burned out from constant near-death experiences, visit an alien spa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. They use a mental detoxifier, which purges the parts of themselves they dislike most <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

The result is:
*   **Healthy Morty**: Becomes popular, confident, and lands a date with Jessica, free from self-doubt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.
*   **Healthy Rick**: Appears as a "normal human being" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

This new reality is disrupted when their toxic counterparts escape the detoxifier and cause chaos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## Anti-Character Development

The episode employs a concept referred to as "anti-character development" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
[[Rick and Morty story structure | Dan Harmon]] often adheres to his version of Joseph Campbell's "The Hero's Journey," which typically involves protagonists confronting and overcoming their "shadow" â€” a dark reflection of themselves, similar to Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. This overcoming usually leads to new insights, like Logan sacrificing himself or Luke Skywalker sparing Darth Vader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

However, in "Rest and Ricklaxation":
*   Toxic Morty and Toxic Rick are literal "shadow" versions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   Instead of overcoming their toxic traits, the episode is a journey for Rick and Morty to *reunite* with their worst selves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
*   Healthy Morty, initially a "smooth operator," ultimately needs to rediscover his self-loathing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
*   Healthy Rick, a "thoughtful super-genius," needs to rediscover his narcissism and irrational care for Morty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

This "regular" kind of [[character_development_in_rick_and_morty | character development]] is presented as "creepy" in this context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

## Commentary on Mental Health

The "anti-[[character_development_in_rick_and_morty | character development]]" serves as a critique of societal views on [[themes_of_mental_health_in_rick_and_morty | mental health]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. The episode questions what it truly means to be mentally healthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

It parodies "healthy" attitudes promoted by self-help gurus and popular media, specifically the idea of eliminating all unpleasant or painful thoughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. The show suggests that fully embodying ideals like "uncritically loving yourself" and "saying yes to everything" can make one seem like a "coked-out weirdo" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

The episode aligns with sociologist William Davies' concept of "compulsory happiness" from his book *The Happiness Industry* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. Davies argues that corporations, managers, and advertisers promote a definition of [[themes_of_mental_health_in_rick_and_morty | mental health]] that supports capitalist society, leading to a happiness that involves cheerful acceptance of the status quo and constant self-improvement for the sake of being a better consumer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

### Morty's Transformation

Healthy Morty exemplifies these ideals, spouting platitudes and demanding others partake in his new lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. When faced with genuine problems, like a sentient part of himself trapped in hell, his response is simply to insist "things are good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

The episode argues that eliminating emotions like self-doubt and sadness, as the self-help industry often advocates, is problematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. For Morty, self-doubt is crucial to prevent him from becoming a full-blown sociopath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. Indeed, Healthy Morty becomes an unscrupulous stockbroker, likened to a sociopathic Wall Street figure, indicating that his "healthy" state leads to morally questionable behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

### Rick's Realization

Rick eventually realizes that some "less desirable" parts of oneself, despite causing pain, are essential for true health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. Jessica's statement, "Good to have you back," implies that Morty's authentic, self-hating self is, in fact, his better self <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

## Unresolved Questions

A minor critique of the episode concerns the inconsistent definition of "toxicity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. While the undesirable parts are purged based on subjective definitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>, Healthy Rick expresses pride in being Morty's grandpa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>, only to later claim his attachment to Morty is irrational and thus toxic, leading him to abandon him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. This raises the question of whether his love for Morty is considered toxic or healthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

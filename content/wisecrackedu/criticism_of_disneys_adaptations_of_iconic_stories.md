Disney has become an "absolute behemoth," acquiring vast amounts of intellectual property, leading to concerns that its ever-broadening artistic reach is detrimental to culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>. The company has a pervasive presence in entertainment, making seven of the top ten highest-grossing films of 2019, including *Avengers: Endgame*, *Aladdin*, *Frozen 2*, and *Toy Story 4* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>. Many of the top 50 highest-grossing films of all time were either produced or later acquired by Disney <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a>. This extensive ownership includes properties like *Star Wars*, X-Men, The Muppets, Pixar, Marvel, and most recently, 21st Century Fox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>.

The company's approach to intellectual property traces back to founder Walt Disney's early experience losing rights to his character Oswald the Lucky Rabbit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>. This led Walt to vow to "own everything that he made after that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>. Disney's early success was built on a formula: "find an existing story, make it as cute and wholesome as possible to maximize your potential audience" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>. This "reign of cuteness" was a deliberate and ruthless quest by Walt Disney to make everything adorable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>. Critics argue that Disney has spent a century acquiring, adapting, and "ultimately twisting their original artistic intentions beyond recognition" to fit this "cutesy aesthetic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:00">[06:06:00]</a>.

## The Disney Method: Pinocchio

Disney's 1940 film *Pinocchio* exemplifies this adaptation process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>. In Disney's version, Pinocchio is a puppet who wishes to be a real boy and is told by a blue fairy he will be if he proves "brave, truthful, and unselfish" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>. After misadventures, including visiting "Pleasure Island" where boys turn into donkeys, Pinocchio saves his father Geppetto from a whale and is transformed into a real boy, leading to a "happily ever after" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>.

### Original Intentions

The original author, Carlo Collodi, "never intended for his story to give children that warm fuzzy feeling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>. The original ending of Collodi's *Pinocchio* was gruesome, with Pinocchio being "gruesomely hanged" by assassins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00">[06:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:00">[06:56:00]</a>. This morbid ending sparked so much angry fan mail that Collodi's editor demanded he bring the character back to life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:57:00">[06:57:00]</a>.

Collodi's *Pinocchio* was meant to be a "tongue-in-cheek albeit bleak morality tale" with a simple moral: "be good or suffer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:13:00">[07:13:00]</a>. The original Pinocchio was "mean-spirited and rude," a "stand-in for all misbehaving children," who experienced severe suffering like being "robbed, starved," and having his legs sawed off, with the intent that his actions caused his suffering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21:00">[07:21:00]</a>. Collodi also included psychological abuse, such as Pinocchio believing he had killed Geppetto and the Blue Fairy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:00">[07:37:00]</a>. This darker tone was "pretty run of the mill if you're familiar with old german folklore" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:52:00">[07:52:00]</a>, and can be seen in more recent children's books like Lemony Snicket's *A Series of Unfortunate Events* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:57:00">[07:57:00]</a>.

### Disney's Whitewashing

Disney "whitewashed Pinocchio to fit the big mouse's cutesy aesthetic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:00">[06:06:00]</a>. They "purged it of its original intentions and thus rewrote the narrative in our collective memories" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a>. The "dark satiric overtones" were replaced with "syrupy lines," and Pinocchio's character went from a "total frat pro" to the "naive piece of pine" known today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29:00">[08:29:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40:00">[08:40:00]</a>. His angular design was scrapped for a more "adorable" character model reminiscent of Mickey Mouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:00">[08:47:00]</a>. Collodi's grandson even sued Disney's Italian distributor for infringing on the story's moral copyright <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:57:00">[08:57:00]</a>.

While artists are allowed to adapt stories, the criticism of Disney lies in its "formula and scale" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:38:00">[09:38:00]</a>. Disney "regularly takes stories like Pinocchio or Sleeping Beauty or hell the Hunchback of Notre Dame and throws them into the commercial meat grinder" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>. This process involves "blanching" them artistically, grinding them down, and pumping them out as "cute little disney sausages" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:11:00">[10:11:00]</a>.

## The Disney Method: The Little Mermaid

The 1989 classic *The Little Mermaid*, based on Hans Christian Andersen's tale, is another example of this phenomenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:22:00">[10:22:00]</a>. Disney's retelling is a love story with a "happily ever after" where the prince "realizes that he really digs this mermaid," and "true love saves all" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:39:00">[10:39:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:53:00">[10:53:00]</a>.

### Original Intentions

Andersen's source material is "not nearly as happy or uplifting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:57:00">[10:57:00]</a>. His story portrays love "primarily as suffering" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:04:00">[11:04:00]</a>. For example, the mermaid not only gives away her voice but "endures the pain of being stabbed every time she takes a step" when she has legs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:08:00">[11:08:00]</a>. Critically, in Andersen's version, the prince "never returns the mermaid's affection" and instead marries a local princess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:20:00">[11:20:00]</a>.

Andersen wanted the mermaid to be saved not by love, but by "sacrifice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:32:00">[11:32:00]</a>. The mermaid despairs over not having a soul and the bargain with the witch revolves around gaining a soul if she kisses her true love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:37:00">[11:37:00]</a>. However, Andersen "never wanted the mermaid to gain a soul simply because she fell in love with a straight up hunk," believing such an ending would be "explicitly wrong" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:51:00">[11:51:00]</a>. He would have "despised Disney's ending" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:02:00">[12:02:00]</a>. In Andersen's tale, the mermaid performs a "Christ-like sacrifice" by giving up her life and love to save the prince, for which she is rewarded by being turned into a "gentle spirit" who will receive a soul if she helps mankind for 300 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:09:00">[12:09:00]</a>.

## Broader Consequences for Storytelling

Disney's "meat grinder" process "polishes off any rough and unsavory edges" from original stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:01:00">[13:01:00]</a>. Other examples include:
*   The real Pocahontas story, which is "about colonists kidnapping a native american woman and murdering her husband," not "the freedom to love who you choose" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:38:00">[12:38:00]</a>. Disney's version provides a "very shitty history lesson that some people might never question" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:06:00">[13:06:00]</a>.
*   The original *Sleeping Beauty*, which is "literally about a woman being non-consensually impregnated in her sleep and giving birth to twins also in her sleep" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:46:00">[12:46:00]</a>.

### Impact on Children and Cultural Storytelling

Most stories Disney adapts are fairy tales, which, despite often being "dark and complex and vaguely disturbing," offer children a "symbolic template for understanding the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:19:00">[13:19:00]</a>. For example, in a children's cancer clinic, patients used fairy tales to express and cope with anxieties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:30:00">[13:30:00]</a>. The "darkness of fairy tales can actually offer a light to children confronting adversity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:54:00">[13:54:00]</a>. However, Disney "strips these fairy tales of their bite," inserting a "bland wholesome narrative" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:59:00">[13:59:00]</a>.

Ironically, in this process, Disney has developed new narratives that can be "potentially quite destructive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:07:00">[14:07:00]</a>. Psychologist Susan Darker Smith points out that young girls who identify with characters like Cinderella or Belle from *Beauty and the Beast* are "more likely to end up in [[critique_of_disneys_portrayal_of_relationships | abusive relationships]] as adults" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:13:00">[14:13:00]</a>. Many victims of domestic abuse identified with these heroines, believing that "if their love is strong enough they can change their partner's behavior" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:27:00">[14:27:00]</a>. By "peddling a convenient narrative in which all the world's problems can be solved by true love," Disney "fails to give children any tools for navigating real life problems" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:40:00">[14:40:00]</a>. The original point of fairy tales was to convey "the darker and crueler aspects of life so as to better prepare children for the realities of adulthood" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:50:00">[14:50:00]</a>.

## The Business of Cuteness

According to free-market economist Milton Friedman, companies' only responsibility is to "make more money," regardless of social consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:01:00">[15:01:00]</a>. This capitalist "raison d'être" explains why Disney operates a "cuteness factory" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:31:00">[15:31:00]</a>. When Disney experimented with "grimmer, edgier films" like *The Black Cauldron* in the 1970s and 80s, they were "huge box office failures" that nearly caused the company's collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:37:00">[15:37:00]</a>. The "Disney Renaissance" of the 90s was a course correction back to the "sentimental cuteness" that has sustained the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:50:00">[15:50:00]</a>.

Cuteness is a means for Disney to "pad its bottom line" because it "hijacks our brains" and "sells" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:59:00">[15:59:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:04:00">[16:04:00]</a>. Studies show that cuteness increases concentration, a trick to make humans pay attention to their young <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:06:00">[16:06:00]</a>. When volunteers were shown cute images, their nucleus accumbens (the brain's pleasure center) "lit up and started pumping out dopamine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:17:00">[16:17:00]</a>. Cultural theorist Joshua Paul Dale calls the phenomenon of cuteness being used for nefarious purposes "evil cute," and Disney's animated friends might qualify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:40:00">[16:40:00]</a>.

## Impact on Modern Franchises

The "Disney vacation of storytelling" becomes more unsettling when it affects "more iconic cultural works" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:12:00">[17:12:00]</a>. Since Disney acquired *Star Wars*, fans have "increasingly despaired at the [[critique_of_the_last_jedis_approach_to_star_wars_tropes | creative choices]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:21:00">[17:21:00]</a>. The last trilogy began with "sentimental fan service" and briefly flirted with "darkness and complexity in The Last Jedi," before Disney quickly "course corrected and opted for a sweet conclusion based on a magical kiss, romantic sacrifice and of course everyone you care about is Jedi royalty now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:28:00">[17:28:00]</a>.

As Disney continues to acquire more media, there are concerns that their "blanket philosophy of cuteness" will expand at the "expense of story nuance and morality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:08:00">[18:08:00]</a>. This makes the future of franchises like X-Men nervous, as it is "hard to imagine disney signing off on something as subversive as Logan" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:18:00">[18:18:00]</a>. Critics worry there won't be space for "grittier, darker stories for grown up fairy tales" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:32:00">[18:32:00]</a>.

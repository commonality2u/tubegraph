The rise of Flat Eartherism highlights a significant societal challenge: a "crisis of knowing shit" where trust in experts has rapidly eroded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This erosion affects trust in scientists, physicians, and government agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. While often met with ridicule, the phenomenon of Flat Earthers points to a deeper, widespread societal problem caused by, and affecting, everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## Flat Earth as a Symptom
Flat Earthers are an increasing presence on YouTube and social media, committed to proving the Earth is flat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. Their beliefs are somewhat scattered, debating whether it's a dome or an infinite plane, or the distance and nature of the sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. However, they are unified in the idea that the Earth-as-sphere is deliberate misinformation propagated by "shadow-y agents" like NASA and world governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. A prominent model suggests the Earth is a flat plane enclosed in a dome called a "firmament," a concept dating back to the Biblical story of Genesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

Despite common perception, many Flat Earthers are critical thinkers who state they became Flat Earthers by trying to debunk the theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Some even assert that the scientific method is the best way to get to the truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. This suggests that the issue isn't a lack of intelligence, but rather a fundamental misunderstanding of how science truly operates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

## The Core Problem: Lack of Scientific Understanding
The larger problem highlighted by Flat Earth debates is a terrible public understanding of science, specifically the [[philosophical_critiques_of_scientism | philosophy of science]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. The [[scientific_inquiry_and_the_nature_of_evidence | philosophy of science]] asks critical questions like "how do we distinguish science from non-science?" and "how should we weigh evidence when testing a hypothesis?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. A general ignorance of how science works allows for the abuse of scientific language, as seen in Flat Earth arguments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

### Verificationism
In the early 1900s, logical positivists proposed **verificationism**, which posits that science is something that can be verified; if it can't, it isn't science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. For example, the statement "this swan is white" can be verified by sensory observation replicated by others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. Flat Earthers allude to this basic idea when they suggest one needs to "go up in space and look at it" to verify the Earth's shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

However, verificationism struggles with "universal statements" like "all swans are white." Even after encountering thousands of white swans, one can never truly verify that *all* swans are white <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. This was exposed when black swans were discovered in Australia in the 1690s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. If applied strictly, requiring individual verification with one's own eyes would be severely limiting for scientific progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.

### Falsificationism (Karl Popper)
Philosopher Karl Popper proposed **falsificationism** as a solution to verificationism's limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. For Popper, good science involves creating a hypothesis and then trying very hard to prove it wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. If a statement cannot theoretically be falsified, it is not science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.

Flat Earthers often claim to "test everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. However, their approach has two main problems:
1.  **Bad Evidence**: Their experiments often suffer from poor design and failure to control confounding variables. The "Bedford Level Experiment" by Samuel Rowbotham, which appeared to disprove the Earth's curvature, failed to account for atmospheric refraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. A more controlled experiment by Alfred Russel Wallace later provided evidence for a round Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.
2.  **Misuse of Falsification**: Flat Earthers focus on trying to prove the round Earth wrong, rather than trying to prove their *own* flat Earth theory wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. When their own experiments, such as a laser gyroscope or flashlight test, yield results that contradict a flat Earth, they invent new, unprovable explanations like "heavenly energies" to explain away the contrary evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. This contrasts with true scientific practice, where such "tweaks" must also be subjected to experiments and evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>.

The problem with "woo-woo" beliefs like those of anti-vaxxers or Flat Earthers is that when asked what evidence would make them renounce their theory, the answer is often "it probably doesn't exist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.

### Paradigms (Thomas Kuhn)
Physicist Thomas Kuhn understood science as working in **paradigms**, which are larger, systematized theories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. In this view, anomalies (like Mercury's unusual orbit which contradicted Newton's physics) don't immediately falsify an entire model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. Scientists will "tweak the model" for as long as possible because the paradigm (e.g., Newton's laws) accurately predicts so much else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. A system is only overturned when a "bigger badder paradigm" emerges that can explain everything the old one could, but better (e.g., Einstein's relativity replacing Newton's physics) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.

While Flat Earthers might "tweak their model" by introducing concepts like "heavenly energies" to explain away contradictory evidence, this doesn't make them scientists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>. Their model cannot perform any of the practical functions that the spherical Earth model enables, such as building long bridges, operating global positioning systems (GPS), navigating airplanes, or launching missiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>.

## Beyond Science: JAQing Off (Just Asking Questions)
A pressing modern problem is "JAQing off," or "Just Asking Questions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>. This is an epidemic in modern political and internet debates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>. It functions by dumping the burden of proof onto the opponent with numerous questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>.

For example, a Flat Earther might ask why oil companies aren't drilling in Antarctica <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>. Answering this seemingly simple question requires explaining the 1959 treaty that declared Antarctica open for discovery and the 1991 treaty prohibiting commercial activity for 50 years to preserve its environment, in addition to the extreme cost and danger of extraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>. By the time one question is answered, the Flat Earther is ready with five more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>.

Unlike genuine scientific inquiry, where questions build consensus and seek to understand anomalies, JAQing off aims to "prove" a theory by casting doubt on the established one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:59">[00:17:59]</a>. This is appealing because unanswered questions can make it appear as though one is wrong or hiding something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>.

## Root Causes and Consequences
The existence of Flat Earthers and other [[conspiracy_theories_and_societal_trust_in_experts | conspiracy theories]] can be accounted for by psychological factors, such as appealing to people who feel powerless or insignificant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:45">[00:18:45]</a>. Cracking a "real" answer to a mystery can make the world feel rational and predictable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a>. For Flat Earthers, it offers the comforting idea that the Earth is a "special little terrarium" at the center of the universe, rather than a tiny blue marble drifting in the cosmos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>.

Ultimately, Flat Earthers reflect a broader crisis of trust in society, characterized by the erosion of faith in all kinds of expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>. This is not harmless; it fuels phenomena like [[pseudoscience_and_the_theme_of_too_many_babies_in_idiocracy | anti-vaxxer]] sentiment, leading to the resurgence of almost extinct diseases and even death threats against perceived "crisis actors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>.

It is not about having blind faith in scientific figures, but rather understanding the conventions and practices that lead to scientific conclusions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>. This includes critically evaluating experiment design, confidence levels in predictions, and understanding how contrary evidence is handled within established models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>. A better education on "how science works" is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a>.

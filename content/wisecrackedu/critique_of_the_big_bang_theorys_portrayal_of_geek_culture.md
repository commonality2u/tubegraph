`The Big Bang Theory` is considered by some to be a profoundly bad show, particularly in its handling of [[use_of_references_in_the_big_bang_theory | references]] and its overall depiction of [[impact_of_representation_on_nerd_culture | nerd culture]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. The show has become a recurring subject of criticism for some <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Problematic Use of References

A significant criticism leveled against `The Big Bang Theory` is its extensive and often superficial reliance on [[use_of_references_in_the_big_bang_theory | references]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. The show frequently incorporates cornerstones of [[impact_of_representation_on_nerd_culture | nerd culture]], such as `Star Trek` and `Battlestar Galactica`, alongside scientific facts and mathematical formulas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. These references are intended to reinforce that characters like Leonard and Sheldon are "diehard nerds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

However, the primary issue is that the joke isn't embedded in the content of the reference itself, but merely in the fact that a reference is made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. For instance, Sheldon's detailed, scientific explanation of friction when Penny slips in a bathtub is presented as a joke simply because it's a "reference" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. The actual science, like the definition of friction or the names of bones, could be replaced with gibberish without altering the joke's perceived effect, implying that the factual content is irrelevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. The humor stems from the *act* of referencing science, not from the scientific concept itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

### Comparison with Futurama

In contrast, the [[comparison_between_big_bang_theory_and_futurama | animated series Futurama]] is cited as an example where references add meaningful depth to a joke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. For example, a `Futurama` joke involving the mathematical symbol for "aleph null" (an infinite set of countable numbers) implies an impossible "infinite number of screens" in a movie theater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. The joke is not merely the reference itself, but the "impossibility" of the subject, thus imbuing the humor with "additional meaning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. `The Big Bang Theory`, conversely, often achieves the opposite effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

## Baudrillard's Theory of Simulacra

The show's use of references without underlying subject matter is analyzed through the lens of French philosopher Jean Baudrillard's theories on reality and representation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. Baudrillard posited four levels of representation:
1.  **Accurate representation:** A perfect picture of reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
2.  **Unfaithful copy:** A representation that obscures reality, like a filtered photo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
3.  **Hides absence of reality:** A representation that pretends to depict reality but has no original, like an artist's rendering of someone they've never seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
4.  **Fourth order simulacra:** Signs and representations referencing other signs and representations, leading to a complete loss of any connection to original reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. This is likened to photoshopping a photoshopped image or creating memes of other memes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

From a pessimistic perspective, `The Big Bang Theory` aligns with the third order of representation: "a copy of something that never existed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. The show presents "science without actual science" and "nerd culture without real nerds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. The characters are portrayed as what someone who has "never met a nerd thinks they're like" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

This superficial referentiality means the jokes don't rely on understanding the science, but merely "the simple recognition that it is a scientific reference" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. This detachment from reality leads to a "death of meaning" and makes "all ideas interchangeable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. An example is the in-show game `Mystic Warlords of Ka'a`, which quickly devolves into "utter nonsense" because the specific details don't matter for the joke to land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

## The Superiority Theory of Humor

If the jokes aren't derived from meaningful references, then what are audiences laughing at in `The Big Bang Theory`? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a> The show's humor often stems from "sh*tting on its characters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.

This aligns with the [[philosophical_analysis_of_humor_in_the_big_bang_theory | Superiority Theory of Humor]], an early Western theory originating with Plato <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.
*   **Plato** believed laughter was a form of "scorn" directed at those unaware of their own faults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.
*   **Thomas Hobbes** modified this, suggesting laughter results from a "competitive nature," triumphing over others or witnessing their downfall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.
*   **Descartes** called laughter the result of "scorn," perceiving "some small evil in a person whom we consider to be deserving of it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.

These philosophers generally agree that laughter often comes "at the expense of others to make ourselves feel good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. However, unlike shows where characters might be depicted as deserving of scorn, `The Big Bang Theory`'s showrunner Chuck Lorre described the characters as "extraordinary people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. This raises the question of why these "extraordinary" characters are consistently belittled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.

## Impact on Nerd Culture

The overarching criticism is that `The Big Bang Theory`, rather than uplifting [[impact_of_representation_on_nerd_culture | nerd culture]], "kind of tears it down" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. By offering only "lip service to nerdom" and mechanically inserting references, the show demonstrates "contempt for real nerds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. The nuances of [[impact_of_representation_on_nerd_culture | nerd culture]] are rendered "irrelevant," as long as the characters appear to be "wanky assholes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. This ultimately does a "disservice" to fans of various [[impact_of_representation_on_nerd_culture | nerd culture]] franchises, as they see "caricatures that kinda just get dumped on" instead of genuine reflections of themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

*Shrek*, the inaugural winner of the Best Animated Feature Oscar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>, is set in a fairy-tale kingdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. The film's protagonist is **Max Shrek**, a large green ogre who lives alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. When squatters are forced onto his land by royal decree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>, Shrek seeks **Lord Facebook** to reclaim it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. Lord Facebook agrees on the condition that Shrek rescue a princess, **Fiona**, for him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>, to be subjected to his "outdated conception of patriarchy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

Shrek and **Donkey** rescue **Princess Fiona** from a volcano castle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. Fiona initially believes Shrek is a prince <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a> but is disappointed when he removes his helmet and she sees he is an "uggo" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Fiona is revealed to be cursed, transforming into an ogre every night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. A misunderstanding leads to a fight between Shrek and Fiona <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>, and Shrek delivers Fiona to Lord Facebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Donkey later clarifies the misunderstanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>, and Shrek stops the wedding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. Fiona transforms, and her kiss with Shrek breaks the curse, leaving her permanently an ogre <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

## [[critique_of_disney_in_shrek | Critique of Disney and Traditional Fairy Tales]]

*Shrek* aims to undermine the idealistic perfection prevalent in [[comparison_of_shrek_and_traditional_fairy_tales | traditional fairy tale stories]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>, specifically targeting Disney's "superficial and overly sentimental offerings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. The film frequently pokes fun at beloved characters associated with classic Disney IP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>:
*   **Robert Hood and his merry men** are depicted as "creepy Frenchmen" who kidnap young girls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
*   **Cinderella** is presented as a "mentally abused shut-in" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
*   **Snow White** is dismissed by Shrek as "just another piece of clutter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

The film's anti-Disney stance is most evident in its central characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>:
*   **Shrek** begins by wiping his backside with a fairy tale page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>, brushes his teeth with slime, and farts openly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>, contrasting with the "glamorous entrance" of typical Disney heroes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
*   **Fiona** initially acts like a stereotypical Disney princess, expecting a "Prince Charming" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a> and grand acts of chivalry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. However, the character who embodies these traditional traits, **Lord Farquaad**, is portrayed as "the most odious character in the film" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

### Corporate Rivalry Influence

The numerous attacks on the Disney aesthetic are believed to stem from a feud between Disney CEO **Michael Eisner** and **Jeffrey Katzenberg** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. Katzenberg, who ran Disney's movie and television division for a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a> and revitalized their animated film catalog with hits like *The Little Mermaid*, *Aladdin*, and *The Lion King* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>, left Disney to start Dreamworks "out of pure spite" after being refused a promotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

Some theories suggest that Katzenberg based the character of **Lord Facebook** on Eisner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. Lord Facebook's kingdom is described as a "dead ringer for Disneyland," complete with costumed employees and puppets singing incessantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

## [[themes_of_beauty_and_societal_expectations_in_shrek | Themes of Beauty and Societal Expectations]]

Katzenberg and Dreamworks criticize the notion that conventionally beautiful people are destined for greater rewards than "normal," less valuable people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. Traditional fairy tales typically conclude with the "lovely princess and handsome hero" living "happily ever after" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. *Shrek* subverts this by making both of its heroes ugly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>, implying their marriage will be rocky and potentially end in divorce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

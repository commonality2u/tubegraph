*Shrek*, the first winner of the Best Animated Feature Oscar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>, takes place in a fairy-tale kingdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. The film centers on Shrek, a large green ogre who lives alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. His solitude is disrupted when Lord Facebook forces a group of fairy-tale squatters onto his land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>, prompting Shrek to seek an appeal from Lord Facebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. To reclaim his land, Shrek agrees to rescue Princess Fiona from a dragon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. Fiona, initially believing Shrek is a prince <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>, is disappointed by his appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

A major plot point involves Fiona's curse, which transforms her into an ogre every night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. A misunderstanding arises between Shrek and Fiona, which is eventually cleared up by Donkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Shrek stops Fiona's wedding to Lord Facebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>, and after Fiona transforms and they kiss, the curse is broken, leaving Fiona permanently an ogre <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. The film concludes with the Macarena dance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a> and a somber tribute to Eric Garner and victims of police violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

## [[antidisney_themes_in_shrek | Anti-Disney Themes]]

*Shrek* actively works to undermine the idealistic perfection prevalent in traditional fairy tales, specifically targeting Disney's often superficial and overly sentimental narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

### Critique of Disney Characters and Tropes

The film makes numerous satirical jabs at characters associated with classic Disney intellectual property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>:
*   **Robin Hood** is depicted as creepy Frenchmen who kidnap young girls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
*   **Cinderella** is portrayed as a "mentally abused shut-in" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
*   **Snow White** is dismissed by Shrek as mere "clutter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

### Central Characters as Anti-Heroes

The film's [[antidisney_themes_in_shrek | anti-Disney agenda]] is most evident in its central characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>:
*   **Shrek** subverts the typical glamorous entrance of Disney heroes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. His initial actions include wiping himself with a fairy tale book page, brushing his teeth with slime, and openly farting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.
*   **Fiona**, though initially behaving like a stereotypical Disney princess expecting a "prince charming" and grand gestures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>, eventually comes to her senses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. The character embodying these chivalric expectations, Lord Facebook, is presented as "odious" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

### The DreamWorks vs. Disney Feud

The numerous attacks on the Disney aesthetic are believed to stem from a feud between Disney CEO Michael Eisner and his former employee, Jeffrey "J Money" Katzenberg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. Katzenberg, who revitalized Disney's animated film catalog with hits like *The Little Fish Lady* (likely a reference to *The Little Mermaid*), *Interracial Couple* (possibly *Pocahontas*), and *The Genie Saves Hanukkah* (likely *Aladdin*) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>, left to start DreamWorks out of spite after Disney refused to promote him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

Some speculate that the character of Lord Facebook is based on Eisner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>, and Lord Facebook's kingdom strongly resembles Disneyland, complete with costumed employees and incessant singing about a "small and pitiful world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

### Rejection of "Happily Ever After"

DreamWorks' creators, including Katzenberg, challenge the notion that beauty automatically leads to greater rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. While traditional fairy tales end with a "lovely princess and handsome hero" living "happily ever after" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>, *Shrek* rejects this by making both its heroes "ugly." This suggests that their marriage will be rocky and likely end in divorce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

Throughout the play, [[summary_of_hamlet_by_shakespeare | Hamlet]] is depicted as being "torn up" about the task of executing Claudius and continuously delays this action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. This procrastination is one of the most debated subjects in all of Shakespearean literature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

## Debates on Hamlet's Delay

Various interpretations exist regarding [[summary_of_hamlet_by_shakespeare | Hamlet]]'s reluctance to act:

*   Some argue that [[summary_of_hamlet_by_shakespeare | Hamlet]] is too sensitive or delicate to effectively operate in a corrupt and "dirty" world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
*   Other theories suggest [[summary_of_hamlet_by_shakespeare | Hamlet]] possesses an Oedipal Complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. In this view, he cannot bring himself to kill Claudius because Claudius has committed the very acts [[summary_of_hamlet_by_shakespeare | Hamlet]] unconsciously desires: killing his father and being with his mother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.
*   A different perspective proposes that [[summary_of_hamlet_by_shakespeare | Hamlet]] is attempting to "buck the system" and dismantle a kingdom riddled with "lies and treachery" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

## Connection to Modernity and [[existentialism_and_uncertainty_in_hamlet | Uncertainty]]

The play is seen as capturing the "ambiguity of modernity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. Like the modern individual, [[summary_of_hamlet_by_shakespeare | Hamlet]] lacks clear devotion to a specific moral code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. His struggle stems from a "divided mind and will," facing "ethical and metaphysical uncertainties" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

This [[existentialism_and_uncertainty_in_hamlet | uncertainty]] is prominently featured in [[summary_of_hamlet_by_shakespeare | Hamlet]]'s famous "to be or not to be" speech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. Interpretations of this speech vary:

*   Some believe it reflects [[summary_of_hamlet_by_shakespeare | Hamlet]]'s indecision between living and dying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
*   Others suggest it's a choice between adhering to the Christian ideal of self-denial or taking violent action to claim his throne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

The play extends this theme of [[existentialism_and_uncertainty_in_hamlet | uncertainty]] to the audience, casting them as "characters of [[existentialism_and_uncertainty_in_hamlet | uncertainty]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. Numerous questions remain unanswered, contributing to the play's enduring ambiguity:

*   Can the audience truly trust [[summary_of_hamlet_by_shakespeare | Hamlet]]'s ghost father? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>
*   Was Queen Gertrude complicit in the King's murder? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>
*   Why can everyone see the ghost in Act 1, but only [[summary_of_hamlet_by_shakespeare | Hamlet]] in Act 3? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>
*   Is [[summary_of_hamlet_by_shakespeare | Hamlet]] merely feigning madness, or has his "mad fiction become fact"? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>

These unresolved questions suggest that William Shakespeare intentionally created a sense of [[existentialism_and_uncertainty_in_hamlet | uncertainty]] for both his characters and his audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

From: [[wisecrackedu]] <br/> 

*Goblin Slayer* explores themes within the [[analysis_of_fantasy_genre_tropes_in_goblin_slayer | fantasy genre]] by asking why its protagonist, Goblin Slayer, exclusively targets goblins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. This focus forms the show's deeper message, subverting typical [[analysis_of_fantasy_genre_tropes_in_goblin_slayer | fantasy]] narratives and offering a unique perspective on peace and conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Premise and Generic Fantasy Tropes
The series begins with a bright-eyed priestess and her friends embarking on their first adventure to kill goblins, which goes horribly wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. Her friends are killed, but she is rescued by Goblin Slayer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. She then joins him, becoming his goblin-slaying padawan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Their party expands to include an elf, dwarf, and lizardman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

While *Goblin Slayer* is an [[cultural_impact_of_goblin_slayer_on_anime_and_fantasy_genres | anime]], it heavily references tabletop role-playing games like *Dungeons & Dragons*, featuring dice rolling, spell slots, guilds, and quests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:30">[01:51:30]</a>. The show embraces generic elements of the [[analysis_of_fantasy_genre_tropes_in_goblin_slayer | fantasy genre]], with characters and locations having intentionally generic names like "Elven Ranger," "Watertown," or "Sword Maiden," and even major antagonists such as "Goblin Champion" or "Demon Lord" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:42">[01:57:42]</a>.

## Subverting Fantasy Tropes: The "Happily Ever After" Deconstructed
Traditional [[analysis_of_fantasy_genre_tropes_in_goblin_slayer | fantasy]] narratives depict [[goblin_slayers_unconventional_heros_journey | heroes]] starting with minor threats (rats, bugs, goblins) to "grind" until they are strong enough to face a major villain threatening the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:20">[02:18:20]</a>. Once the "big bad" is slain, the story concludes with a "happily ever after" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:92">[02:37:92]</a>.

Goblin Slayer, however, explicitly deviates from this linear path, choosing to *only* kill goblins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:50">[02:42:50]</a>. He rationalizes that even if a Demon Lord is defeated, goblins will continue to terrorize vulnerable rural areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:81">[03:02:81]</a>. By focusing on these "little guys," the show subverts the basic assumption of a "happily ever after" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:80">[03:17:80]</a>, questioning whether peace is truly achieved once a major threat is removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:92">[03:19:92]</a>.

This subversion is highlighted when the Demon Lord, often foreshadowed as a climactic antagonist, is dispatched by random [[goblin_slayers_unconventional_heros_journey | heroes]] in under a minute without Goblin Slayer's involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:25">[03:42:25]</a>. This event reinforces Goblin Slayer's philosophy:

> "Even if the Demon Lord's dead... As long as there are still goblins in the world, then the problems will continue for the weak and vulnerable. That's why I hunt them. That's why I will kill them until they're all gone." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:95">[03:52:95]</a>

## Understanding Peace: Negative vs. Positive Peace
The distinction between negative and positive peace, conceptualized by theorist John Galtung, helps to understand Goblin Slayer's logic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:35">[04:12:35]</a>.

### Negative Peace
Negative peace is defined as the *absence of war* or direct violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:30">[04:26:30]</a>. In the [[analysis_of_fantasy_genre_tropes_in_goblin_slayer | fantasy genre]], this translates to a world without major destructive forces like Night Kings, Sauron, or Ganondorf—or in *Goblin Slayer*'s context, the Demon Lord <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:10">[04:38:10]</a>. While this type of peace is commonly discussed, it often fails to examine the smaller, more pervasive violence affecting a society's most vulnerable members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:30">[04:47:30]</a>.

### Positive Peace
Positive peace, conversely, is the *presence of justice and protections* that serve the needs of everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>. This is precisely what Goblin Slayer pursues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:40">[05:09:40]</a>. While in the show it is literally goblins, in the real world, "positive peace" addresses issues like poverty, famine, disease, corruption, discrimination, and crime—the "goblins of the real world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>.

Positive peace highlights that for some individuals, violence is not an interruption but the *backdrop* against which life takes place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>. Goblin Slayer cannot simply relax on an idyllic farm because the persistent threat of goblins requires constant vigilance and defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>. His actions, though violent, contribute to conflict prevention and long-term protection by addressing the immediate, constant threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>.

## The "Grunt Work" Problem: Stigma and Consequences
The concept of "positive peace" is often neglected because addressing smaller, pervasive issues is seen as "grunt work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>. Everyone seeks the glory of defeating a Demon Lord, but slaying goblins is considered "child's play" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:24:00">[06:24:00]</a>. Even after a major threat is gone, the cleanup of residual problems is often deemed below certain individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:00">[06:31:00]</a>.

Despite being a silver-class adventurer, Goblin Slayer is mocked for his choice of missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>. This societal stigma against goblin slaying has two significant consequences:

1.  **Minimization of Threat**: The perception that goblin slaying is uncomplicated and easy (requiring mostly sword swings and decapitations, or even just a strong kick) causes many to minimize the actual danger goblins pose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:00">[08:01:00]</a>. As a result, unqualified [[goblin_slayers_unconventional_heros_journey | heroes]] are sent to deal with them, often leading to their demise and the continued presence of goblins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:00">[08:26:00]</a>. Silver-ranked [[goblin_slayers_unconventional_heros_journey | heroes]] believe they have "better things to do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:30:00">[08:30:00]</a>.
2.  **Worsening Problem**: Goblins reproduce and become more dangerous over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:55:00">[08:55:00]</a>. Major [[goblin_slayers_unconventional_heros_journey | heroes]] refuse to get involved, either deeming goblins as mere pests or being too embarrassed to admit their threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:00">[09:01:00]</a>.

### The Sword Maiden Example
The Sword Maiden, a powerful [[goblin_slayers_unconventional_heros_journey | hero]] who even slayed the original Demon Lord, exemplifies this issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:10:00">[09:10:00]</a>. She hires Goblin Slayer to deal with goblins under the city, having committed "light murder" to ensure their removal by someone else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:22:00">[09:22:00]</a>. Her actions stem from her own traumatic past encounter with goblins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:00">[09:42:00]</a>, and admitting fear of goblins after defeating a Demon Lord goes against the "unspoken [[goblin_slayers_unconventional_heros_journey | hero]] code" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:48:00">[09:48:00]</a>.

Goblin attacks leave people in a constant state of fear and anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:53:00">[09:53:00]</a>. Goblin Slayer's intervention, by eliminating the goblins and discussing her fears, significantly improves the Sword Maiden's well-being, helping her overcome goblin-induced nightmares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:09:00">[10:09:00]</a>. This highlights how addressing seemingly "small" problems contributes to positive peace by improving psychological conditions, even if material conditions remain unchanged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:03:00">[10:03:00]</a>.

## Narrative Implications for *Goblin Slayer*
The show's focus on positive peace raises interesting questions about its narrative trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:27:00">[10:27:00]</a>. Typically, series threats escalate, even within standalone episodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:32:00">[10:32:00]</a>. However, with the Demon Lord already defeated and Goblin Slayer committed to only slaying goblins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:45:00">[10:45:00]</a>, the series faces a challenge in escalating the stakes. This may lead to more ambiguity regarding the goblin threat or force a collision with a larger antagonist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:52:00">[10:52:00]</a>.

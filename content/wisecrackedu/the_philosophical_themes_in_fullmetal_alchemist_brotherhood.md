[[character_development_and_ideological_growth_in_fullmetal_alchemist_brotherhood | Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood]] is described as an instant classic, featuring high-concept science fiction, engaging fight scenes, and a strong philosophical core <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. The series often confronts the protagonists, Edward and Alphonse Elric, with discussions about the effectiveness and application of science, specifically "Alchemy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

The narrative explores how science is applied in the world of Amestris and the role faith plays in this discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. Amestris is a country similar to pre-World War 2 Europe, where alchemy—the manipulation and alteration of matter using natural energy—is treated as a science combining chemistry and biology with its own unique laws, most notably "The Law of Equivalent Exchange" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

## Science vs. Faith: An Ongoing Conflict

The show immediately establishes a dynamic between science and faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

### The Dangers of Blind Faith
In Episode 3, Edward and Alphonse travel to Liore, a desert town where Father Cornello, a holy figure, has gained control by performing "miracles" and indoctrinating people into "Leto-ism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. The Elric brothers are openly skeptical of the divine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. Their skepticism is justified when Cornello's miracles are revealed to be cleverly veiled applications of alchemy, used to gather loyal followers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. The brothers expose him as a fraud, liberating the people from his "ideological tyranny" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

### The Perils of Amoral Science
However, the narrative quickly complicates the "Science Rules Faith drools" perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. In the following episode, the brothers study under Shou Tucker, the "Sewing-Life Alchemist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. Tucker successfully created a talking chimera but to retain his state alchemist certification, he used his own family dog and daughter as components for a new chimera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. Tucker claimed his actions were simply what science demanded, demonstrating the potential for atrocity when science is pursued without morality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

This incident largely sets the tone for the rest of the show, forcing viewers to question the value of single-minded adherence to science and the consequences of reducing all knowledge to scientific terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. This mode of thought is known as "scientism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

### Critique of Scientism
Philosophers who critique scientism are not dismissing science itself, but rather challenging the idea of placing scientific knowledge above all other forms of knowledge, and attempting to reduce other knowledge into scientific terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. Philosopher Paul Feyerabend argued that science is just one of many competing explanatory frameworks, not necessarily more rational or consistent than others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. He used the example of Copernicus's heliocentric model, which was initially rejected by scientists because Aristotle's celestial spheres offered a more complete explanation for planetary movement, even though Copernicus's model could correctly calculate it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. This suggested that science, like any ideology, can prioritize self-preservation over truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

Feyerabend warned that an unquestioning acceptance of any ideology, including science, can lead to disastrous results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. He asked, "How can we protect ourselves against the tyrannies of science, against the tyrannies of popular opinion...?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>

### Dehumanization Through Alchemy
The world of [[character_development_and_ideological_growth_in_fullmetal_alchemist_brotherhood | Brotherhood]] shows science creating "monsters," such as man-made chimeras referred to as "ungodly experiments" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. Alchemy's impersonal and dehumanizing nature is enshrined in "The Law of Equivalent Exchange," which reduces objects, animals, and even people to their physical components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. The Elric brothers' journey itself begins with their belief that they can revive their mother by transmuting the basic ingredients of a human being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

This dehumanizing aspect is further exemplified by the "Philosopher's Stone," which requires human lives as its key ingredient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. The stone allows users to bypass the Law of Equivalent Exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. While the Elrics are reluctant to use it due to its cost in human lives, the Homunculi, artificial humans powered by Philosopher's Stones, embody scientism by reducing the souls within the stones to mere alchemic principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

The Elric brothers, however, demonstrate morality by respecting the autonomy of those souls when they do use the stones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. This aligns with philosopher Immanuel Kant's view that people should never be used or reduced to calculations, but rather are always "a goal in themselves" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

## Militarization of Science
The Elric brothers' problem with alchemy extends beyond its impersonal nature to its subservience to the military <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. Alchemy is so controlled by the Amestrian government that state alchemists are bound by tenets, the first of which is "LITERALLY obey the military" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. State Alchemists are often called "dogs of the military" or "human weapons" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

Sociologist Stanley Aronowitz argued that scientists often see themselves as detached from political power, but their funding frequently comes from corporations or the state, meaning they don't truly own their discoveries or have a say in their application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. Edward constantly clashes with this militarization of science and his own complicity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.

The military's influence even distorts the basic principles of science. The core alchemic principle of deconstructing and reconstructing matter, understanding the natural flow of energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>, is twisted by the military to justify destroying and slaughtering a country through "Alchemic Rebirth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

### The Ishbalan War of Extermination
As tools of the government, alchemists become instruments of the series' chief antagonist, Father, who controls the Amestrian state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. Father seeks to become God, using alchemy, military conflicts, and millions of lives to achieve his goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. The "Ishbalan War of Extermination" was fought solely to advance Father's plan, with state alchemists making a devastating impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

What is shocking about Ishbal is the "scientific language" used to explain what is essentially genocide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. This sanitizing nature of scientific language escalated the war. Führer King Bradley rejected a ceasefire offer, stating that "The Law of Equivalent Exchange" would not allow it, even considering his wife an expendable pawn for his scheme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

The country of Amestris, with its "Führer," resemblance to pre-WW2 Germany, militant expansionism, and blond-haired, blue-eyed army akin to the SS, draws parallels to Nazi Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. General Raven's invocation of Social Darwinism to justify mass extermination further reinforces this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. The human experiments in Amestris mirror those of Dr. Josef Mengele at Auschwitz, demonstrating a similar "wanton cruelty and morbid scientific curiosity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.

Paul Feyerabend, who fought as a Lieutenant in World War 2 and witnessed scientific arguments made by a dictatorship for war and genocide, proposed a separation between science and state, with ultimate power resting in democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. He argued that just as the church was separated from the state, science should also be separated to ensure true freedom and growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>.

## The Role of Faith

While the show presents a cautionary tale about blind adherence to science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>, faith is portrayed as another explanatory model, a source of truth and power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>.
Even in a world populated by scientists, characters appeal to faith:
*   Edward and Alphonse are awestruck by the delivery of a baby, pointing out alchemy's limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>.
*   Dr. Marcoh, responsible for the Philosopher's Stone, calls it fate that he met Scar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.
*   Knox invokes God upon his family's return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>.
*   Even Bradley, a homunculus, questions if his death was "providence," linking it to a prophecy that God would strike him down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>.

However, the show does not conclude that "Science is bad Faith is good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. Feyerabend's contention was that unreflective veneration of *any* ideology inhibits free thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>. Blindly following science as the sole arbiter of truth is as harmful as blindly following faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>. Father Cornello and the Homunculi use Leto-ism to incite violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>, while Scar uses his God, "Ishvala," to justify vengeance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>. Faith alone can be as dangerous as science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>.

## Synthesis of Ideologies and Growth

[[character_development_and_ideological_growth_in_fullmetal_alchemist_brotherhood | Characters grow]] in [[character_development_and_ideological_growth_in_fullmetal_alchemist_brotherhood | Brotherhood]] when they realize the limitations of adhering to a single ideology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. The Elric brothers question Western Alchemy and seek out its Eastern equivalent, Alkahestry, which uses life energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>. Bridging these two ideologies ultimately allows the heroes to triumph <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>.

### Scar's Transformation
Scar, a survivor of the Ishbalan war, initially targets State Alchemists for revenge, believing they transgress against God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>. However, as he learns more, he realizes the error of seeking vengeance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>. Scar, who once justified his actions with God's words, understands that no ideology can justify murder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>. He even breaks his faith's strict laws by using the very alchemy his God abhors to save the country he once hated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>.

### Father's Failure
In contrast, the main antagonist, Father, clings to his single-minded belief in science, becoming obsessed with alchemy's power and viewing humanity as mere materials for his quest to become God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>. Blinded by scientism, he discards human emotions, literally ripping the Seven Deadly Sins from himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>. His conviction in science's absolute supremacy and its ability to achieve perfection ultimately undoes him; the souls he dismissed as mere energy assert their will and repel him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>. Upon his death, he meets "Truth," the real God, still unable to understand his error, having refused to recognize any human wisdom beyond alchemy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>.

### The Elrics' Humble Rejection of Single Ideology
The Elric brothers stand out due to their "humble rejection of a single ideology" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>. They constantly grapple with what alchemy is and their role as State Alchemists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>. At their core is a strong desire to discover their *own* truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:28">[00:19:28]</a>. Alphonse rejects the alchemic worldview of equivalent exchange when faced with a choice between regaining his body and the world's safety, reaffirming his desire to find his own truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>.

This search for possibilities distinguishes the brothers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:08">[00:20:08]</a>. Edward makes his final transmutation by offering his ability to perform alchemy to save Alphonse, recognizing the arrogance in believing alchemy could explain or solve all his problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>. Unlike Father, Edward accepts his place in the universe, understanding that alchemy is not power, but a tool for understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:40">[00:20:40]</a>.

After regaining their bodies and saving the day, the Elrics continue their search for truth and new methods to discover it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>. Alphonse travels east and Edward travels west to gather all knowledge, embodying a principle of "a full circle," not a simple "give and take" like the Law of Equivalent Exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:10">[00:21:10]</a>. This highlights that science alone cannot explain everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:55">[00:21:55]</a>. The show suggests that a pure devotion to science can lead to a dark path, and that philosophical thought is needed in how we view the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:11">[00:22:11]</a>.

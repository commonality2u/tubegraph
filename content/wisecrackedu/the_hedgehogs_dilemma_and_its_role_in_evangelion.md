From: [[wisecrackedu]] <br/> 

*Neon Genesis Evangelion* (Eva) is a profoundly complex narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Beyond its surface plot of biomechanical monsters fighting alien-angel-robot entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, it delves into deep themes of psychosexual development, intimacy, unconscious human motivation, and the inherent struggles of human existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Central to its philosophical core is the concept of the hedgehog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, which forms a key aspect of the [[philosophy_of_neon_genesis_evangelion | Philosophy of Neon Genesis Evangelion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## What is The Hedgehog's Dilemma?

The **Hedgehog's Dilemma** is a parable introduced by the philosophical pessimist Arthur Schopenhauer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a> in his work, *Parega and Paralipomena: Short Philosophical Essays. Volume 2* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. Schopenhauer uses the analogy of hedgehogs huddled together for warmth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. While they desire warmth, their quills prevent them from getting too close without injuring each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. Consequently, they maintain distance, remaining cold, or learn to live without the warmth of others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. This dilemma serves as Eva's guiding theme, directly explored within the series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

In Episode three, Ritsuko explains it to Mitsado: "Even though a hedgehog may wanna become close with another hedgehog, the closer they get the more they injure each other with their spines. It's the same with some humans" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. Episode four is even explicitly titled "The Hedgehog’s Dilemma" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. The desire to avoid being hurt creates a wedge between people, fostering a world of despair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.

## [[the_concept_of_individuality_and_isolation_in_evangelion | Individuality and Isolation]] in Eva

The series vividly portrays the human condition through the lens of this dilemma. The world, having lost half its population in the Second Impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>, is a sad place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. The characters' miserable lives and intimacy issues are directly tied to the Hedgehog's Dilemma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

*   **Asuka**: She pilots her Eva to find meaning and avoid loneliness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. Though seemingly gruff, flashbacks reveal her fear of being alone, using her piloting to draw people toward her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.
*   **Gendo**: He struggles to show Shinji love and be a father, confessing that "When Shinji is near me, all I ever do is cause him pain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. He rejected the world to avoid pain, believing he "never deserved to be loved" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.
*   **Shinji**: He constantly expresses hatred for his father <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>, yet repeatedly pilots the Eva to gain his father's praise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>. This [[freudian_psychoanalysis_in_evangelion | ambivalence]] — passionately hating and loving simultaneously — is a core Freudian idea Eva embraces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>. Shinji's internal conflict is captured by his mantra: "I mustn't run away. I mustn't not run away" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>.

The existential loneliness in the show is further highlighted by references to Soren Kierkegaard's "sickness unto death," which is despair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

## Philosophical Underpinnings: Schopenhauer and the AT-Field

Schopenhauer argues that life is suffering because the world is composed of "will and representation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. For him, reality's nature is unity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>; suffering arises from individuality and the struggle to communicate between separate beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. Each individual's will or ego perceives the world from its unique "representation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. Anguish, fragmentation, and alienation stem from this disconnect between individual wills and what the world provides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. Kaworu echoes this sentiment: "This is mankind's fate. The thread of human hope is spun with the flax of sorrow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.

This separation of wills is manifested in Eva as **AT-fields** (Absolute Terror Fields) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. These fields represent the unique human soul that separates each person's ego, acting as a life force and a barrier that prevents true connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>. Characters like Rei reflect on what it means to be an ego with a body, recognizing that while "at the core we are all the same," minds "lack something basic" and fear that lack, leading to a desire to "become one" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.

## The Death Drive and Instrumentality

The struggle with [[the_concept_of_individuality_and_isolation_in_evangelion | isolation]] and the pain of rejection define Eva <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. To escape this pain, many characters, and indeed humanity's secret organizations NERV and Seele, pursue **Human Instrumentality** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>. Instrumentality is the process of combining all human consciousness into a primordial soup called LCL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>. This desire to merge into a unified whole and shed the issues of self aligns with Freud's concept of the **Death Drive** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>.

For Freud, the death drive is a subconscious desire to return to tranquility, to the peace and harmony of the womb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. In Eva, this translates to the end of everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>. Episode 25 directly references this, describing "the case of Shinji Ikari, the boy who wished for death of his own will" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>. Gendo explains Instrumentality as "not a return to nothingness," but a "return to the state of beginning," a "return to the primal womb" where "souls and minds will become one, attaining eternal balance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>. This echoes the [[religious_symbolism_in_evangelion | Kabbalistic concept of Tikkun ha-Olam]], the "restoration of the world" or reunification with a primordial being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>. Seele and NERV work towards this death drive, counting on Shinji to facilitate humanity's return to a world without loneliness and [[the_concept_of_individuality_and_isolation_in_evangelion | isolation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>.

## Rejecting the Dilemma: Embracing Vulnerability

The human reaction to the Hedgehog's Dilemma might be to seek tranquility in a return to the womb, which the series equates to a desire for death and running away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>. However, Kaworu, a non-human character, offers an alternative: accepting vulnerability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>. He sacrifices his individual desires for Shinji's life, showing unguarded, absolute love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>. Kaworu advises that while keeping others at a distance prevents betrayal, it necessitates enduring loneliness, as "all men are fundamentally alone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>.

In the final episodes and film, Shinji initially accepts instrumentality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>. However, upon realizing he would lose himself—his unique self-image reliant on the presence of others—he has a change of heart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>. He articulates: "Because there are others, I can perceive myself as an individual! If I am alone, then I will be the same without others! For if this world is only of me, then there will be no difference between me and nothing!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>.

Shinji ultimately rejects instrumentality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>, stating, "I am me. I want to be myself. I want to continue existing in this world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>. He renounces a world of primordial soup and shared minds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>, choosing instead a world where people can be hurt, where separation and individual selves, wills, desires, and pain exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>. He confronts the drive towards inorganic existence and accepts the inevitability of suffering in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>. This choice, while accepting pain, also opens the door for hope and joy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:36">[00:19:36]</a>, and the possibility of love alongside violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>.

The series concludes by highlighting that the theological, psychological, and philosophical elements of the story all address the concept of "lack" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:52">[00:19:52]</a>, a missing center of existence as explored by Jacques Lacan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:19:59]</a>. Eva consistently weaves a plot that delves deep into "humanity’s disappointing existence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:18">[00:20:18]</a>. The ending with Shinji and Asuka as a "new Adam and Eve" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a> signifies a "new Beginning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:48">[00:20:48]</a>, even if accompanied by their characteristic dysfunction.

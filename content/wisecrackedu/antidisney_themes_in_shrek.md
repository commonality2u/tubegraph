*Shrek* (2001) was the first film to win the Best Animated Feature Oscar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. The film features an ogre named Shrek who lives alone until fairy tale squatters are forced onto his land by royal decree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Shrek appeals to Lord Facebook, who agrees to return Shrek's land if he rescues a princess for him, reflecting an "outdated conception of patriarchy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. After rescuing Princess Fiona, who is cursed to turn into an ogre every night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>, Shrek and Fiona develop feelings for each other. Their journey and the film's overall narrative are designed to subvert traditional fairy tales and, specifically, [[critiques_of_disneys_storytelling_methods | Disney's storytelling methods]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

## Undermining Traditional Narratives
*Shrek* intentionally undermines the "idealistic perfection that pervades traditional fairy tale stories" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>, particularly targeting Disney's "superficial and overly sentimental offerings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

### Attacks on Classic Characters
The film frequently makes "potshots" at beloved characters associated with classic Disney intellectual property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>:
*   **Robert Hood** and his merry men are depicted as "creepy Frenchmen" who kidnap young girls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
*   **Cinderella** is presented as a "mentally abused shut-in" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
*   **Snow White** is dismissed by Shrek as "just another piece of clutter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

### Subverting Hero Archetypes
*Shrek*'s central characters actively defy traditional heroic portrayals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>:
*   **Shrek's Introduction** His first action is literally wiping his backside with a fairy tale page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>, followed by brushing his teeth with slime and farting, in stark contrast to the "glamorous entrance usually awarded to more clenched-up Disney heroes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
*   **Fiona's Expectations** Initially, Fiona behaves like a stereotypical Disney princess, expecting a "prince charming" to sweep her off her feet with chivalry and grand gestures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. However, the character who embodies these "odious" characteristics is Lord Facebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

## The Disney Feud
The film's numerous attacks on the "Disney aesthetic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a> are believed to stem from a feud between Disney CEO Michael Eisner and Jeffrey "J Money" Katzenberg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.
*   **Katzenberg's Role at Disney** Katzenberg ran Disney's movie and television division for a decade under Eisner, revitalizing their animated film catalog with hits such as *The Little Mermaid*, *Aladdin*, and *The Lion King* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.
*   **Departure and Dreamworks** Despite his efforts, Disney refused to promote Katzenberg, leading him to leave and start Dreamworks Animation "out of pure spite" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.
*   **Lord Facebook as Eisner** Some suggest that Katzenberg based the character of Lord Facebook on Eisner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. Lord Facebook's kingdom is described as a "dead ringer for Disneyland," complete with costumed employees and incessant singing puppets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

## Redefining "Happily Ever After"
Dreamworks, under Katzenberg's guidance, criticizes the notion that beauty predetermines greater rewards or value for individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. Traditional fairy tales conclude with "the lovely princess and handsome hero live 'happily ever after'" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. *Shrek* rejects this by making both of its heroes "ugly," suggesting that their marriage will be "rocky, and probably end in divorce" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

Despite its ambitions, *Suicide Squad* is considered a "unique disaster" among films released in 2016 due to significant issues in its execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. The film is often cited as an example of media that "doesn't quite work," offering lessons through an "autopsy" of its failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## Executive Meddling and Narrative Compromise

A major [[analysis_of_suicide_squad_movie | criticism of Suicide Squad]] stems from Warner Bros.' intervention in the filmmaking process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. The studio believed the movie's trailer was superior to the actual film, leading them to hire the trailer company to "functionally rewrite the movie" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This intervention is attributed to why the first 30 minutes of the film "feels like a music video with too much neon exposition" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. The movie was "hacked to shit," compromising its initial vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## Failure to Develop Thematic Potential

The film introduces "control" as its primary [[theme_of_control_in_suicide_squad | theme of control in Suicide Squad]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. Instances of this theme include:
*   Guards controlling and abusing prisoners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
*   Amanda Waller and Rick Flag controlling the Squad with a kill device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
*   The Enchantress battling for control over June Moon's body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
*   Amanda Waller controlling The Enchantress by stabbing her heart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
*   Amanda Waller controlling Rick Flag through his love for June <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
*   The Enchantress controlling people by turning them into slave monsters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
*   The Joker controlling Harley Quinn through their abusive relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

While the film sets up interesting moral questions about control, such as whether tyrannical control is necessary against existential threats (like in *The Dark Knight*) or if it's inherently evil (like in *One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest*), *Suicide Squad* ultimately fails to provide an answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

### Identity Crisis and Bland Villainy

The film suffers from an "identity crisis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. As an anti-superhero movie, it aims for viewers to identify with the humanity of the "villains" (the Suicide Squad members) while showcasing the lack of humanity in those in power, like Amanda Waller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. Even The Enchantress is presented as a victim of control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. This setup could have created a "moral gray area" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.

However, the film "takes refuge in the lamest of superhero movie tropes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a> by making Enchantress a "bland, evil villain" who "wants to destroy the world with an arbitrary doomsday machine and a super vague motivation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. This choice undermines the potential for insightful questions about the characterization of evil when both protagonists and antagonists are oppressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

### Thematic Incoherence

Ultimately, the film's execution "robs the themes of control and oppression of any meaning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. It neither argues that oppressive power is necessary (as the Squad kills Enchantress of their own accord) nor that it is evil (as Waller's corrupt status quo is reinstated) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. The film concludes with subjugated characters defending their own imprisonment against another victim of control, resulting in a "mess" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

## The Joker's Disconnected Role

A significant [[role_of_the_joker_in_suicide_squad | criticism of the Joker in Suicide Squad]] is that Jared Leto's portrayal "serves no purpose" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. While the Joker provides a line about "desire becomes surrender, surrender becomes power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>, which briefly manifests in the Enchantress's seduction of the Squad, it ultimately "doesn't actually say anything about the nature of control and its relation to desire and surrender" in the final cut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.

Furthermore, Harley Quinn's arc, which seemed poised to explore this dynamic by rejecting the Enchantress's dominance after submitting to the Joker, fails to deliver a meaningful lesson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. She ends up "right back under the thumb of the Joker" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>, rendering the thematic discussion moot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.

## Conclusion

*Suicide Squad* demonstrates "a spark of intelligence," suggesting that "earlier versions of the film abandoned by studio would have been so much better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. However, the final product is criticized for its muddled narrative, underdeveloped themes, and inconsistent character arcs, indicating a significant breakdown in its overall execution.

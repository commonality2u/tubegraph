The film *The Purge* is set in the 21st century on Earth, where the government has legalized murder for half a day, once a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. This societal construct forms the basis for the film's commentary on human nature, societal balance, and [[Comparison of social inequality themes in the movie | social inequality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

## Duality and Societal Rebirth
*The Purge* posits that the human psyche contains both a light and a dark side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. This duality is visually represented through elements like the white and blue bouquets displayed by Purge supporters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. The annual Purge event takes place on March 21, frequently the date of Earth's vernal equinox, when day and night are of equal length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

The film suggests that the Purge is intended to create a healthier and more balanced society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>, mirroring how the vernal equinox signifies the beginning of spring, a period of rebirth and renewal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. The citizens in the film celebrate the "resurrection" of their society on "Purge-mas Eve" with an almost religious fervor, praising the "New Founding Fathers" for allowing the Purge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. The blue flowers (baptisias) seen in the film also reference the Christian ritual of baptism, further emphasizing themes of rebirth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

## [[Social commentary in horror films | Social Stratification]] and Violence
A central theme of *The Purge* is America's issues with [[Social commentary in horror films | social stratification]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. While the Purge laws are ostensibly neutral regarding race and class, they disproportionately affect the disenfranchised who cannot afford high-end security systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. The film states that "the poor can't afford to protect themselves. They're the victims tonight" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

The antagonists, dressed in prep school attire, symbolize the wealthy elite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. They treat the hunting of a homeless black "non-contributor" as if it were an extracurricular activity for college applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. This imbalance draws parallels to the War on Drugs in the 1980s, where laws for crack cocaine, often affecting poor Black communities, were significantly harsher than those for powder cocaine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. Despite the economic benefits cited by the government, the film highlights a deeper, more sinister motive behind the Purge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.

### The Cycle of Violence
*The Purge* initially suggests that engaging in or consuming violence could relieve a person's aggressive desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. However, it quickly undermines this premise, concluding that such actions only desensitize people and lead to more violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. Brutal images of murder are juxtaposed with classical music, underscoring the idea that violence has lost its shock value and become mundane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

In the film's world, humans watch violent "Purge events" on TV for entertainment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. Ironically, *The Purge* itself, a violent film, can be seen as a [[Critique of violence and player behavior in sandbox games | criticism of its own nature]] by offering viewers a "bloodbath" to release aggression, thus perpetuating the cycle it critiques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.

From: [[wisecrackedu]] <br/> 

*Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice* (BvS) attempts to pit its two titular heroes against each other through ideological conflict, largely drawing inspiration from Frank Miller's graphic novel *The Dark Knight Returns* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. However, the film's execution of this comparison, particularly concerning Superman's character, proves to be muddled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.

## Superman's Character in the DCEU

One of the significant challenges for the architects of the DC Extended Universe (DCEU) was making Superman a relatable character, given his indestructible, selfless, and god-like nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. Their solution was to emphasize his vulnerabilities, flaws, and doubts, drawing a parallel to the depiction of a messiah figure in *The Last Temptation of Christ* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. This approach aimed to make him more human <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>, showing his struggle between being a benevolent savior and focusing on personal interests, like Lois <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

However, this character development for Superman inadvertently undermines a fundamental aspect of a Batman and Superman rivalry: their differing ideologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

## Inspiration from *The Dark Knight Returns*

The film *Batman v Superman* heavily borrows cues from Frank Miller’s graphic novel, *The Dark Knight Returns* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. This includes elements like an older, broken Bruce Wayne, Superman's encounter with a nuclear warhead, Robin's memorialized costume, and the central fight dynamic where Superman tries to reason with Batman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

### [[ayn_rands_philosophy_in_batman_v_superman | Ayn Rand's Philosophy]] as a Core Influence

Beneath the surface of *The Dark Knight Returns* lies the unlikely philosophical inspiration of [[ayn_rands_philosophy_in_batman_v_superman | Ayn Rand's *The Fountainhead*]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. Frank Miller explicitly cites Rand as a significant influence on his work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

#### Batman's Randian Egoism

Miller and Snyder are drawn to Rand's depiction of male heroes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. In *The Fountainhead*, Howard Roark is the ideal man: one who achieves his goals and never compromises his integrity, even if it leads to conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. This "Randian hero" is defined by "ethical egoism," the belief that acting in one's best interest is always the best course of action for happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. This concept is a central tenet of [[ayn_rands_philosophy_in_batman_v_superman | Ayn Rand's Objectivism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

Miller's Batman, the "Dark Knight," perfectly embodies Rand's "Ideal Man" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. He is a wealthy, handsome playboy with a genius intellect who refuses to bend to anyone's will but his own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. It is [[batman_as_a_force_of_order_versus_morality | Batman's adherence to Randian egoism]] that enables the ideological conflict between him and Superman in Miller's work: individualism versus collectivism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

#### Superman as the "Anti-Rand" Figure in *The Dark Knight Returns*

In Miller's graphic novel, Superman is portrayed as the "anti-Rand" figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. His self-sacrificing moral righteousness and commitment to "good" mark him as a "Government Stooge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. The core drama of *The Dark Knight Returns* stems from this clear ideological divide: [[duality_in_the_dark_knight | the individualism of Batman versus the conformism of Superman]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

## Ideological Conflict in *Batman v Superman*

While Frank Miller successfully instilled the spirit of Rand's theories to create a compelling conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>, *Batman v Superman*'s integration of this philosophy is where it falters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

### Batman in BvS: A Consistent Randian Hero

Ben Affleck's portrayal of Batman in BvS largely aligns with Miller's Randian interpretation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. He is handsome, supernaturally athletic, intelligent, and a complete individualist, refusing to bend his will to anyone, including the judicial process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. His desire to fight Superman can be seen as a nod to Rand's atheism; a God-like figure undermines ethical egoism by questioning an individual's self-derived rationality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

### Superman in BvS: A Muddled Philosophy

The depiction of [[superman_character_development_in_dceu | Superman in BvS]] becomes muddled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. The filmmakers avoided making him a purely benevolent, do-gooder figure (deemed "boring" and "impossible to relate to") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>, but also opted against making him the "collectivist stooge" that Miller created, primarily because the audience needed to like him for future Justice League films <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

Instead of the self-sacrificing goodness seen in portrayals like Christopher Reeve's Superman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>, BvS's Superman appears to be performing a "tiresome 9-5 job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. The film constantly undercuts his perception as a purely benevolent, Christ-like hero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>, with Batman even stating, "You were never a god, you were never even a man" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.

Superman's crisis manifests as an internal conflict between two warring identities:
*   **Superman 'The God'**: A benevolent, Christ-like, Christopher Reeve-esque figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
*   **Superman 'The Man'**: A Randian Objectivist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>, illustrated by his choice to fly to the Middle East to save Lois while leaving other innocents to die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.

His mother, Martha Kent, suggests that choosing between being a benevolent Messiah and a self-involved Objectivist is equally valid, emphasizing that it's Clark's rational choice to make – a hallmark of a Randian hero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.

Later, the ghost of Jonathan Kent further dismantles the notion of selfless heroism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. He recounts a story where his selfless act of saving his farm inadvertently flooded another, leading to the conclusion that there will always be "another flooded farm you couldn’t stop" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. Jonathan's advice promotes ethical egoism: true moral righteousness comes from bettering oneself, pursuing self-interest, and protecting loved ones because they bring happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.

Ultimately, Superman makes an ambiguous choice, attempting to be both a benevolent savior (taking responsibility for the planet) and an objectivist (doing it for Lois) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. His final sacrifice is portrayed in a Messianic fashion, yet it contradicts the film's earlier muddled philosophical underpinnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.

## Failure of Ideological Conflict

BvS is framed as an [[batman_v_superman_ideological_conflicts | ideological conflict between Batman and Superman]], but no genuine ideological distinction exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. While initial meetings hint at differing beliefs – Bruce distrusts Superman as a "savior" due to his experience with "freaks dressed like clowns" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>, and Clark views Batman as a dangerous vigilante <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a> – this dynamic is quickly "upended" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

As the world turns against Superman, he, like Batman, begins to act on his own accord <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. By using [[ayn_rands_philosophy_in_batman_v_superman | Objectivism]] to make Superman more relatable, the film inadvertently eliminates almost any ideological difference between the two heroes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

> [10:41] So in a film that requires a conflict based on differing ideals, that’s based on a source material showcasing this ideological divide, BvS instead becomes a ‘Randian Hero’ vs. ‘A Maybe Sort-of Randian Hero who can’t decide if he wants to be the divine savior the world wants him to be..’

Ultimately, the film presents no clear preference for heroics. The message isn't about promoting one type of hero over another, but rather about the need for "more heroes" like Aquaman, The Flash, and Cyborg, to form the Justice League <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. This results in a muddled and messy philosophical stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.

The "Saw" franchise, popular since 2004, features the character Jigsaw, who is the creepy puppet-master and main antagonist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. He orchestrates elaborate, gruesome traps for characters he deems morally dubious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Jigsaw's Core Motivation

Jigsaw's torturous games are presented as opportunities for his victims to repent for their sins and, ostensibly, to transform into better human beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. He believes that if his victims survive these tests, they will emerge with a newfound ability to appreciate life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. His approach has been likened to an "extremist Christian morality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## The Origin of Jigsaw (John Kramer)

Before becoming Jigsaw, he was John Kramer, a civil engineer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. His wife, Jill, owned a drug rehab clinic and was pregnant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. Tragedy struck when one of Jill's patients, Cecil Adams, robbed her clinic, accidentally injuring Jill and causing her to suffer a miscarriage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. This event sent John into a deep depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

Soon after, John was diagnosed with a brain tumor and terminal cancer, leading him to plummet further into depression and causing his relationship with Jill to deteriorate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. After this series of misfortunes, John attempted suicide by driving off a cliff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. Miraculously, he survived the crash, which he interpreted as a revelation, leading him to his new calling: dispensing morality through torture devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

## Philosophical Influences

As John Kramer developed his new moral code, he drew inspiration from two primary philosophical sources:

### Early Christian Philosophy on Suffering
Jigsaw's philosophy shares a similar view on suffering with early Christian tradition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. Early Christian theologians theorized that suffering resulted from human sin, particularly the Original Sin committed by Adam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. They believed that sinful humans needed to suffer and repent to be reunited with God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

Similarly, Jigsaw believes his victims deserve the suffering they endure in his traps, seeing them as "enslaved by their past immorality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. The series even features characters named Adam (Cecil Adams, who caused Jill's miscarriage, and Adam Stanheight, who spied on people) whose actions mirror Adam's original sin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

### Søren Kierkegaard and the Stages of Development
John Kramer also shares common ground with Søren Kierkegaard, a Christian theorist and "father of Existentialism," who believed suffering was critical for personal and spiritual growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. Kierkegaard, like Kramer, experienced significant personal hardships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. Both believed that suffering purifies the sufferer, teaches them to appreciate life, and forces them to take responsibility for their actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

Kierkegaard proposed three phases individuals must pass through to become their "true self":
1.  **The aesthetic:** Driven by sensual pleasures and lacking morality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.
2.  **The ethical:** Driven by morality and belief in individual responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
3.  **The religious:** Driven by faith in God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

Suffering is key to progressing through these stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. Jigsaw's machines, though physical, can be understood as tests for his victims, who are typically "aesthetes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. His tests present ethical dilemmas, forcing painful decisions that lead to "ethical self-understanding" by prompting reflection and a desire for change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

## Key Tenets

### Personal Responsibility and Choice
Both Kierkegaard and Kramer highly value personal responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. Kierkegaard stated that becoming "a real man" involves becoming "a responsible individual before God" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. Kramer demands the same from his victims, spurring them into life-affirming action through choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. Kramer insists that his victims "choose" their actions and are responsible for the outcome within his games, famously stating, "I've never murdered anyone in my life. The decisions are up to them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.

### Rebirth and Transformation
For Kierkegaard, spiritual suffering aims to kill off the "flawed, false self" to make room for the "recreation into a better, truer self" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. John Kramer shared this belief, stating, "A different person crawled out through the wreckage" after his suicide attempt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

Jigsaw demands this transformation from his followers, such as Amanda, in a scene that fans call "Amanda's baptism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. This concept aligns with Christian baptism, which symbolizes being "spiritually cleansed" and reborn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. Jigsaw frequently references this idea of rebirth and even began his "kidnapping" activities during a Chinese New Year celebration, which marks a literal celebration of rebirth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

## [[flaws_in_jigsaws_moral_code | Flaws in Jigsaw’s Moral Code]]

Despite his grand philosophical aims, the "Saw" series frequently highlights the [[flaws_in_jigsaws_moral_code | seriously flawed moral code]] at the heart of Jigsaw's philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.

*   **Failed God-like Figure:** Kramer is often portrayed as a god-like figure, dressing in a hooded cape, acquiring disciples, performing "baptisms," and demonstrating omniscience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. However, he is depicted as a "seriously failed" one, as his attempts to establish a moral order do not bring about meaningful change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.
*   **Victim Outcomes:** Most of his victims fail their tests, crumbling under pressure or pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. Those who do survive are frequently traumatized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.
*   **Apprentice Failures:** Jigsaw's quest for a suitable apprentice ultimately fails, as each successor twists his philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>. While Jigsaw's games are designed to be winnable (if one is willing to sacrifice, e.g., a limb), his mentees create unwinnable "rigged games" for revenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. These disciples eventually trap and kill each other out of jealousy, reducing the games' purpose to mere punishment rather than renewal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.
*   **Unfair Justice:** As the series' villain, Jigsaw's morality lessons frequently sacrifice innocent human lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>.
*   **His Own Death:** Even Kramer's own death is the result of one of his tests' ultimate failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. Instead of achieving salvation or redemption through forgiveness, he is violently killed by one of his victims, Jeff, after offering him the opportunity to forgive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.

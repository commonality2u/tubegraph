From: [[wisecrackedu]] <br/> 

The "Saw" franchise centers on Jigsaw, the creepy puppet-master who designs elaborate, torturous games for his victims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>. While Jigsaw's stated [[jigsaws_motivation_and_philosophy | motivation]] is to offer his victims opportunities to repent for their sins and transform into better human beings, the series frequently highlights the inherent flaws and ultimate failure of his extreme moral code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:49:00">[10:49:00]</a>.

## Failed Outcomes

Despite Jigsaw's proclaimed goal of spiritual growth and appreciation for life, his games consistently fall short:
*   **Low Survival Rate** Jigsaw believes survivors will emerge with a newfound appreciation for life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>. However, the odds of survival in his tests are "not quite ever in their favor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>. Most victims fail, crumbling under pressure or being unable to withstand the pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:21:00">[11:21:00]</a>.
*   **Trauma, Not Transformation** Even those who pass Jigsaw's tests are frequently traumatized by the experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:27:00">[11:27:00]</a>. One survivor sarcastically notes that the "best thing" to come from cutting off his own arm was handicapped parking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:32:00">[11:32:00]</a>. This outcome directly contradicts Jigsaw's aim of creating "better, truer" selves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18:00">[08:18:00]</a>.

## Corrupted Legacy

Jigsaw's quest for an apprentice further reveals the extent of his moral code's failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:43:00">[11:43:00]</a>:
*   **Distortion of Philosophy** Each of Jigsaw's apprentices twists his philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:48:00">[11:48:00]</a>. While Jigsaw designs games that are theoretically winnable if the rules are followed, his mentees create "rigged games that are unwinnable death traps" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:51:00">[11:51:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:59:00">[11:59:00]</a>.
*   **Revenge Over Renewal** His disciples use the games for personal revenge, rather than for the purpose of renewal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:08:00">[12:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:16:00">[12:16:00]</a>. They eventually turn on and kill one another out of jealousy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:12:00">[12:12:00]</a>.
*   **Rejection by Disciples** Even Jigsaw's most fervent follower, Amanda, eventually denounces him just before her death, stating his words "means nothing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:26:00">[12:26:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:31:00">[12:31:00]</a>.

## Unjust Justice

Despite being positioned as a "god-like figure" with a quality of omniscience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:54:00">[10:54:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:05:00">[11:05:00]</a>, Jigsaw's justice is far from fair:
*   **Sacrifice of Innocents** He is ultimately the villain of the series, and his morality lessons frequently result in the sacrifice of innocent human lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:45:00">[12:45:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:50:00">[12:50:00]</a>.
*   **Death by Failure** Jigsaw's own death is the result of one of his tests' ultimate failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:02:00">[13:02:00]</a>. He dies after offering one of his victims, Jeff, the opportunity to forgive him, only for Jeff to violently kill him instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:54:00">[12:54:00]</a>.

The series consistently reminds the audience of the profoundly flawed nature of Jigsaw's moral code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:21:00">[12:21:00]</a>, highlighting that spiritual rebirth is unlikely to be found in a reverse bear trap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:09:00">[13:09:00]</a>.

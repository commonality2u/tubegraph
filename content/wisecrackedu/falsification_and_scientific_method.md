The rise of Flat Eartherism highlights a broader crisis concerning how society knows what it knows and the erosion of trust in expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. While seemingly a fringe belief, Flat Earthers compel a deeper examination of our understanding of science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. This extends beyond remembering scientific laws to grappling with the [[philosophy_of_science_and_verificationism | philosophy of science]] itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

## What is the Philosophy of Science?

The [[philosophy_of_science_and_verificationism | philosophy of science]] is a field that asks fundamental questions about science, such as:
*   How do we differentiate science from non-science? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>
*   How should evidence be weighed when testing a hypothesis? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>
*   What constitutes acceptable evidence? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>
*   Fundamentally, how do we know if we know anything? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>

Understanding these frameworks, including their strengths and weaknesses, is crucial to recognizing the misuse of scientific language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

## Verificationism

In the early 1900s, logical positivists proposed a scientific doctrine known as [[philosophy_of_science_and_verificationism | verificationism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. This model suggests that something is scientific if and only if it can be verified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. For example, the statement "this swan is white" can be verified by observation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. Flat Earthers sometimes allude to this idea, questioning direct, personal verification of the Earth's sphericity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.

However, a major problem for verificationism arose with universal statements, such as "all swans are white" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. Even after observing thousands of white swans, one can never truly verify that *all* swans are white, as evidenced by the discovery of black swans in Australia in the 1690s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. This limitation made it difficult to verify many scientific laws, which often rely on universal claims (e.g., "all mass exerts gravitational pull") <a class="yt=timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

## Falsification: Karl Popper's Solution

Philosopher Karl Popper proposed a solution to the crisis of verificationism: [[philosophy_of_science_and_verificationism | falsification]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. For Popper, good science involves developing a hypothesis and then making a strong effort to prove it wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. If the hypothesis cannot be proven wrong, confidence in it increases, but it remains open to future refutation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. A statement is considered scientific only if it could, theoretically, be falsified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.

For instance, if one hypothesizes the Earth is flat, a falsificationist approach would involve designing experiments to prove it is *not* flat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. If such experiments show the Earth is not flat, the hypothesis should be abandoned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. It's important to note that proving the Earth is not flat does not automatically prove it is round, and vice-versa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

## Flat Earthers and Falsification

Flat Earthers often claim to "test everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. However, their approach presents two key problems related to [[philosophy_of_science_and_verificationism | falsification]]:
1.  **Bad Evidence**: Their evidence is often flawed due to poor experimental design and a failure to control for confounding variables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. The Bedford Level Experiment, a favorite among Flat Earthers, failed to account for atmospheric refraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. When properly controlled experiments are conducted, they provide evidence for a round Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.
2.  **Focus on Disproving Others**: A core principle of falsification is attempting to prove *one's own* theory wrong, not merely trying to prove someone else's theory wrong to validate one's own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.

The Netflix documentary "Behind the Curve" illustrates this issue. When Flat Earthers conduct experiments, such as using a laser gyroscope or flashlights, that yield results *contradicting* a flat Earth, they refuse to abandon their hypothesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. Instead, they introduce ad hoc explanations, like "heavenly energies" messing with data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. This unwillingness to state what evidence would make them renounce their theory is a hallmark of "woo-woo" thinking, including anti-vaxxers and creationists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.

## Critiques of Falsificationism and Paradigm Shifts

While [[philosophy_of_science_and_verificationism | falsification]] offers a powerful framework, it also faces critiques. Thomas Kuhn argued that scientific tests and hypotheses do not exist in a vacuum but within larger, systematized theories or "paradigms" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.

Kuhn's model of scientific progress suggests that established scientific paradigms (like Newton's physics) are not immediately abandoned when contradictory evidence emerges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. For example, Newton's laws of motion and gravity accurately predicted most celestial orbits, but they failed to perfectly predict Mercury's orbit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. Rather than immediately discarding Newton's model, scientists initially tweaked it, sometimes even by hypothesizing an undiscovered planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. A paradigm is only overturned when a "bigger, badder paradigm" emerges—like Einstein's theory of relativity—that can explain everything the old model could, plus the anomalies, and even more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. Kuhn termed this a "paradigm shift" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>.

Flat Earthers, in a "perverse way," echo this by tweaking their model with explanations like "heavenly energies" when faced with contradictory evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. However, unlike true science, these "tweaks" are not subjected to further experimentation or evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>. Furthermore, the Flat Earth model cannot perform any of the functions predicated on a round Earth, such as building long bridges, creating a global positioning system (GPS), navigating airplanes, or transmitting satellite TV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>.

## "Just Asking Questions" (JAQing Off)

Another issue highlighted by Flat Earthers is the tactic of "Just Asking Questions" (JAQing off) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>. This involves rapidly posing numerous questions, often with easily verifiable answers, to dump the burden of proof onto the opponent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>. For example, questions like "Why aren't oil companies drilling in Antarctica?" can be answered by detailing international treaties and the high cost and danger of extraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>. Similarly, questions about flight patterns can be explained by the distortion of projecting a sphere onto a flat map or simply by demand and travel time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>.

This tactic makes public debates profoundly unproductive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>. While science is built on asking questions, these questions are meant to build consensus and collective understanding, not merely to "win" a debate or cast doubt on accepted facts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>.

## Conclusion

Flat Earthers and similar groups highlight a crisis of [[trust_in_scientific_consensus_and_expertise | trust in expertise]] in society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>. While conspiracy theories may appeal to those feeling powerless or insignificant, offering a seemingly rational and predictable world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>, they can lead to dangerous outcomes, such as the resurgence of almost extinct diseases due to anti-vaccine sentiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>.

It is not about blind faith in scientific authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>. Instead, understanding the conventions and practices of science—how experiments are designed, how confidence levels are ascribed to predictions, and how contrary evidence is handled within models—is essential for the public to engage critically and constructively with scientific consensus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a>.

The television series *The Office* continues to be a highly streamed show, even years after its conclusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Its enduring [[the_popularity_and_cultural_imThe popularity and cultural impact of The Office | popularity]] is partly attributed to its portrayal of the prevalence of "BS" (bullshit) in modern professional life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Unlike shows where characters are unemployed but still manage to live well, *The Office* depicts characters sitting around doing nothing, but at a desk rather than a couch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

## The Role of Nonsense in Professional Life

*The Office* is a mockumentary following the Scranton, Pennsylvania branch of Dunder Mifflin, a struggling paper company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. The branch is led by Michael Scott, whose antics frequently divert his employees from their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. The show depicts characters dealing with unsatisfying jobs and uncomfortable interactions with their boss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. It also satirizes common office archetypes, such as the uptight accountant, the chatterbox, the attractive receptionist, the person awaiting retirement, the unlovable HR representative, the lovable dunce, and the Cornell alumnus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

The series touches on anxieties related to the evolving American economy, reflecting the impact of digitization, e-commerce, and the consolidation of retailers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. This environment has led to the proliferation of pointless jobs, a concept explored by anthropologist [[david_graebers_theory_on_the_proliferation_of_pointless_jobs | David Graeber]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

### David Graeber's Theory of "BS Jobs"

Graeber defines a [[bs_jobs_and_the_modern_workplace | BS job]] as "a form of paid employment that is so completely pointless, unnecessary, or pernicious that even the employee cannot justify its existence even though, as part of the conditions of employment, the employee feels obliged to pretend that this is not the case" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. This description closely mirrors the reality at Dunder Mifflin, where employees engage in useless meetings and follow random directives for a job nearing obsolescence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

While some jobs might simply be unpleasant (like scrubbing toilets for minimum wage), they are distinct from [[bs_jobs_and_the_modern_workplace | BS jobs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. Although some real work is done at Dunder Mifflin, such as accounting or sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>, many employees are aware of the general pointlessness of their roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. The company struggles to compete with modern chains, and management is unable or unwilling to adapt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. Despite the threat of downsizing, a significant portion of the workday is dedicated to unproductive activities like party planning, fictional games like "Flonkerton," or office romance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

#### The Paradox of BS Jobs

Graeber argues that a free market should theoretically eliminate pointless jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. However, Dunder Mifflin, despite being subject to market pressures (layoffs, mergers, sales) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>, often succeeds despite its inefficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. Culturally, there's an expectation for employees to show up for 40 hours a week, leading to a culture of "looking busy" and managers inventing pointless tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. There's a societal belief that if a job isn't associated with suffering, it's not worth fair compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. This leads to an optimization of suffering rather than efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.

## Psychological Impact and Coping Mechanisms

Pointless jobs are not merely wasteful; they are profoundly detrimental to an individual's psyche, leading to depression, anxiety, and guilt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. Graeber notes that people derive pleasure from "being the cause," or having an effect on the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>. Pointless jobs deprive individuals of this fundamental satisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. As Dostoevsky theorized from his time in a Siberian prison, the worst torture is to force someone to perform an endlessly pointless task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. Dunder Mifflin's employees are frequently thwarted from being "the cause" by management, bureaucracy, or the inanity of their tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.

The show explores how characters cope with their professional lives:
*   **Jim Halpert**: Bored with his job, he finds agency through pranks on Dwight and is frequently offered promotions despite scheming during work hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.
*   **Pam Beesly**: She fills her time planning her wedding and conspiring with Jim, even inventing a job title for herself to avoid being fired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
*   **Kevin Malone**: An accountant who struggles with basic math, he remains employed for years due to the discomfort of firing him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. Later, he finds happiness running a bar where he can competently bring joy to guests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>.
*   **Dwight Schrute**: He thrives on bureaucracy, obsessing over rules, titles, and inventing pointless structures to satisfy his warped view of being "the cause," despite also having a successful beet farm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. His ultimate goal is to become a petty dictator with ultimate say over his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>.
*   **Stanley Hudson**: He copes by looking forward to retirement and finding joy in small pleasures like "Pretzel Day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.
*   **Oscar Martinez**: He eventually runs for state senate, a role that could allow him to create meaningful change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.
*   **Michael Scott**: He denies the superfluous nature of his job by convincing himself of its paramount importance, believing his role is to break up monotony for staff well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. His narcissism and need for attention, stemming from a lonely childhood, are finally satisfied by quitting his job to be with Holly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>. He postures for the documentary cameras to portray himself as an admired leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>.

## The Broad Societal Context of BS Jobs

In 2013, the year *The Office* concluded, a Harvard Business Review survey found that half of 12,000 professionals felt their jobs lacked meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. Another poll indicated 37% of British workers believed their jobs were "utterly useless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>. Graeber suggests these jobs persist partly because their existence seems antithetical to capitalism, and society is reluctant to admit such a possibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>.

The proliferation of [[bs_jobs_and_the_modern_workplace | BS jobs]] is also theorized to be linked to the rise of the service economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>. While traditional service roles remained stable, the boom came from administrative, consulting, clerical, accounting, and IT professions, sectors where BS jobs tend to proliferate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>.

Graeber categorizes [[bs_jobs_and_the_modern_workplace | BS jobs]] into several types:
*   **Flunkies**: Employees who exist solely to justify a manager's position or inflate their prestige <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>.
*   **Goons**: Roles that exist only because other companies also have them, such as certain legal or marketing departments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>.
*   **Duct Tapers**: Those who clean up the messes created by inefficient systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>.
*   **Box Takers**: Employees who exist solely to verify work that is not actually being done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>.
*   **Task Masters**: Individuals who create [[the_role_of_nonsense_in_professional_life_as_depicted_in_the_office | BS work]] for other [[the_role_of_nonsense_in_professional_life_as_depicted_in_the_office | BS employees]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>.

Dunder Mifflin, as a company that doesn't manufacture paper but rather sells it and justifies higher prices through customer service, fits squarely within this service economy model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>. Michael's goal of hiring and inspiring people, rather than focusing on business growth, is driven by his personal need to create a pseudo-family for himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>.

### Escapism and Finding Meaning

The show resonates because it offers an escapist fantasy where characters don't get fired for minimal work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>. By the finale, most characters have endured the [[the_role_of_nonsense_in_professional_life_as_depicted_in_the_office | BS]] either by finding love or leaving the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a>. This suggests that coping with the absurdities of work might involve seeking a better job or finding happiness in one's domestic life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:42">[00:18:42]</a>.

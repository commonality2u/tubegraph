*Get Out*, a social thriller by writer/director Jordan Peele, is notable for its unique focus on [[criticism_of_white_liberalism_in_get_out | white liberals]] rather than conventional targets when exploring race in America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. The story follows Chris Washington as he meets his white girlfriend's parents, initially depicting awkward social interactions before taking a horrific turn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. The film reveals that the party is a slave auction of sorts, where an old white man intends to implant his brain into Chris's body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. Peele conceived the story while reflecting on the widespread belief that the Obama presidency ushered in a 'post-racial' era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. The film argues that this "so-called post-racial liberalism" is more terrifying than generally imagined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

## The Alienating Nature of "Not Racist" Liberals

Throughout the film, Chris encounters white individuals who profess to have "moved beyond" racism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. This disavowal paradoxically reinforces a suspicious, and eventually horrific, relationship with black people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. The attempts of characters to demonstrate their lack of racism, such as the Armitage family's eagerness to discuss "black people stuff" or declare their support for Obama, only serve to further alienate Chris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. This over-performance of "acceptance" highlights the racial difference and makes Chris deeply uncomfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. In this environment, actual racism can be excused if one can present themselves as "down" with black culture and anti-racist ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

## Negrophilia: Fascination and Dehumanization

The film introduces the concept of **negrophilia**, a term from 1920s Paris describing a craze for black culture among "hipsters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. For these Parisians, blackness symbolized "young Parisian modernity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. However, this fascination had a problematic side: "Black personalities were either lionised or demonised in a manner that denied normality," preventing them from being seen as actual people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. *Get Out* demonstrates both extremes: Chris is celebrated for his cultural background, yet also reduced to a physical "beast" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. This negrophilia, driven by white perspectives, extends to the desire for the black body itself, sexually ("is it better?") and athletically ("what's your sport?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. The film reveals that this desire is not about understanding but about satisfying one's own desires, transforming humans into collectibles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. This concept culminates in the literal colonization of the black body through the "Coagula procedure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>, where white minds inhabit black bodies to gain their physical advantages, such as Grandpa Armitage's desire for an athletic body after being bested by Jesse Owens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>, or a blind man's desire for Chris's photographer's eyes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.

## The Psychological Burden of Navigating White Spaces

*Get Out* offers insight into the psychological experience of black Americans in white America.
*   **The Suburbs as a Maze**: The film opens with a black man lost in white suburbs, a metaphor for the "creepy, confusing" emotional maze Chris must navigate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.
*   **Modulated Interactions**: Chris's interactions are often modulated for his white audience, such as his immediate attempt to de-escalate a police encounter that Rose is instigating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. He frequently suppresses his true concerns to avoid making a scene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.
*   **Anxiety and Double Consciousness**: Chris worries if his girlfriend's parents "know I'm black" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. Philosopher Frantz Fanon's description of feeling a "burdensome weight" and being "out of place in a world dominated by whiteness" resonates with Chris's anxiety in overwhelmingly white spaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. Chris is burdened by trying to fit into a world that fundamentally excludes him, forcing him to be "two people at the same time: a black man with his own identity, and, Rose’s black boyfriend who is nice to everyone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

### The Sunken Place and Double Consciousness

The film's central metaphor is the **Sunken Place**, a hypnotic state where one's mind is separated from their body, leaving them to passively view their own experiences through a screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. Jordan Peele explained that "The Sunken Place means we’re marginalized. No matter how hard we scream, the system silences us" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. This symbolizes how societies built on inequality mute the voices of those on the outside, forcing their true identity to remain in the background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

This concept connects to sociologist W.E.B. Du Bois's term **double consciousness**, which describes the internal conflict faced by African Americans in a structurally racist society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. They are compelled to view themselves through the lens of the dominant white society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. This constant evaluation leads to a "two-ness" in the black soul and confusion about the authenticity of one's experiences, leaving Chris feeling like a helpless spectator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.

## Symbolic Objects and Empowerment

*   **The Deer**: The deer Chris and Rose hit at the beginning of the film likely symbolizes Chris's mother's death, which he witnessed helplessly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. This reinforces the idea that the Sunken Place is a metaphor for his own life as a "helpless spectator" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.
*   **Cotton**: Chris uses cotton picked from his chair to block his ears and avoid being permanently cast into the Sunken Place by the Coagula procedure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. This subverts Audre Lorde's idea that "the master’s tools will never dismantle the master’s house" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. Instead, Chris re-purposes a tool associated with slavery to assert his identity and resist a new form of enslavement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.
*   **Bocce Ball**: Chris re-purposes a bocce ball, arguably a "symbol of the white elite," to take out Jeremy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.
*   **Mounted Deer Head**: Chris takes a mounted deer and uses it to attack Dean, symbolizing his overcoming of the powerlessness he once feared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. His escape is a "radical assertion of his black identity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>.

## The Real Monster: Systemic Racism

The film's most terrifying scene, even beyond the fantastical elements, is the arrival of the police as Chris kneels over the bleeding body of a white woman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. While the original ending depicted a devastating worst-case scenario, Peele opted for a more triumphant conclusion in the final cut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. However, the tense moment before Rod's arrival serves as a stark reminder that the true monster of *Get Out* is not a fictional boogeyman, but "the horrors of the system itself," which cannot be heroically defeated at the conclusion of a film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.

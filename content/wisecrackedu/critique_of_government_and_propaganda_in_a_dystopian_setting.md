The *Fallout* series takes place in an alternate 23rd century, where the culture of the 1950s never died, but most of humanity did <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. In this world, a Cold War mentality persisted until a global conflict, spurred by nations running out of oil in the 2050s, culminated in 2077 with nuclear powers launching their arsenals, ushering in a new dark age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

The game's "Wasteland" is a philosophical goldmine, constantly confronting players with the role of society, culture, and propaganda in convincing people to do "stupid things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## The Illusion of Progress and Optimism

Fallout's pre-war society is technologically advanced, but its fascination with atomic power, unchecked by the invention of the transistor, resulted in bulky technology like power armor and laser guns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. The Wasteland is filled with reminders of a pre-war world's sheer optimism, an "age of atomic energy" where "our greatest dreams could be accomplished with a little ingenuity and maybe a few giant anti-communist death robots" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

This optimism is vividly seen in the Vaults themselves, where even with nuclear annihilation imminent, remnant posters maintain a cheeriness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. Many of these Vaults were, in reality, covers for the government to conduct "insane experiments" on their residents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. The Vaults serve as a testament to humanity's power of [[critique_of_compulsory_happiness_in_society | cognitive dissonance]], advertising the possibility of being locked underground as an "exciting foray" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

This concept of "pleasant appearances plastered over modern day nightmares" was explored by German-American philosopher Herbert Marcuse during the Cold War. He argued this reflected modern society's ability to destroy criticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. Marcuse contended that capitalism's marketing prowess makes even the "worst shit in the world just seem 'dandy'," citing real-life "deluxe fallout shelters" as the ultimate example of an "obscene merger" between a cozy luxury getaway and a terrible reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

## Disparity Between Appearance and Reality

This disparity drives much of *Fallout*'s humor, constantly confronting players with contrary images: a quaint, cheery "Leave-it-to-Beaver-esque" culture set against a hellscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. This is evident in:
*   **The Vaults** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>
*   **Radio Stations** that serenade the Wasteland with "chipper jazz tunes" while the player fends off "crazed irradiated remnants of the human race" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
*   **Song Choices**, such as "I Don’t Want to Set the World on Fire," used prominently in the game's trailer, contrasting its innocent romanticism with images of a burnt Washington D.C. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. Other songs like Cole Porter’s "Anything Goes," about lax morals, nod to the "absolute anarchy of the Wasteland" where cannibalism is fair game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

These "marriages between positive and negative" are not just comedic; they are a mechanism by which society "constantly celebrat[es] the same culture and technology that consistently puts us at the brink of total annihilation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.

## One-Dimensional Thought and Suppressed Criticism

Marcuse argued that we live in an age of "one-dimensional thought," where the merging of positive and negative enables the belief that "rationality and technology can only go one way - forward" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. This means technology is always presented as good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. While society is free to debate how to bring order to the Wasteland or kill Communists, there is "no room [for] 'negative thought' or ideas that undermine the one-dimensional, inane positivity of society" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

This is exemplified in *Fallout 3*, where the player is "literally trapped at their own birthday party until they have a sufficient amount of fun" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. Making people "too happy to care" is a component of making them "A-OK with our twisted reality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

## The Enclave and Control through Leisure

The Enclave, the remnants of the United States government, seeks to purge the Wasteland. Their computer-president, John Henry Eden, understands the importance of "fun and leisure in an obedient society" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. Eden praises baseball as a savior of the American dream, praising its ability to make citizens "revel in the joys of sport and sunshine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

The Wasteland is littered with reminders of pre-war excess and comforts—leisure suits, magazines, televisions—which provide an "easy way to cope with the horrific reality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. Eden attempts to resurrect this "distracted society" which led to the cataclysm in the first place, a society that "probably wouldn’t mind if he tried to kill them all" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

## Technology as a Double-Edged Sword

From the Great War to government experiments creating Super Mutants, *Fallout* constantly reminds players of "technology run amok" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. The game presents moral dilemmas regarding technology's use: whether to provide clean water or unleash a devastating virus, or who should control robotic armies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

This theme draws inspiration from the Greek myth of Phaethon, who ruined everything by gleefully taking his father Helios's sun chariot for a joyride. In *New Vegas*, the solar plant is called Helios One, and the player can similarly use its destructive power to slaughter thousands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

Different factions in *Fallout* present varying responses to technology:
*   **The Brotherhood of Steel**: A secretive order that hoards technology in heavily armored bases, believing no one else can be trusted with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. They will go to war with any faction possessing advanced tech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.
*   **Caesar's Legion**: Swears off technology (except for killing tools), believing it makes people weak and dependent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. However, even without technology, Caesar's totalitarian state creates a "living hell," suggesting technology isn't solely to blame for wrongdoing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

## International Relations and the Dangers of "Security Logic"

The Wasteland features various forms of government, from "cruel tyranny fueled slavery, to liberal democracies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. The game also explores modern theories of international relations.

### Hegemonic Stability Theory
Caesar's Legion, superficially modeled after the Roman Empire, seeks to unite humanity under a "dystopian nightmare" where everyone is a slave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. Caesar believes peace comes through security and is only attainable when his Legion is the sole dominant faction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. This aligns with "hegemonic stability theory," where a superpower's intimidation maintains order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. In the game, traders prefer Legion territory due to its safety, as raiders are eliminated and lawbreaking is deterred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.

### Balance of Power and Realism
Alternatively, a balance of power can make war too costly. The NCR hasn't annexed New Vegas not out of virtue, but because the cost would be too high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. The Boomers, like a post-apocalyptic Switzerland, maintain neutrality by protecting their borders with artillery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.

From a "realist" model of international relations, each faction prioritizes its own security, and power is a zero-sum game, necessitating more military might than the next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. Peace is uncertain, and alliances are fleeting, only existing to combat more powerful threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. This realist approach "precludes the ability of factions to work together and truly trust each other, and isn’t that what launched us into nuclear holocaust in the first place?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>

## The "Totalizing Logic" of Security

The diplomatic stakes in *Fallout* are high, with every issue caught in a "life and death struggle for the soul of humanity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>. Players face moral dilemmas: should the NCR resort to bullying, corruption, and unsavory alliances to maintain peace and expand power in the name of democracy? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>

Some philosophers, like Daniel Callahan, argue that "security logic" is "totalizing," meaning there is no limit to the "terrible, grotesque things we are willing to do in the name of survival" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. As Ben Franklin famously stated:
> "Those who surrender freedom for security will not have, nor do they deserve, either one." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>

This point is not lost on Enclave President John Henry Eden, who rationalizes his unelected position with "national security" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>. The Enclave is willing to exterminate "mutated riff raff" to save "real" humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>.

A similar despotism, though less genocidal, is seen with Mr. House in New Vegas. His rule, while orderly and efficient, is a "despotic vision of pre-War glory," achieved "at the expense of personal freedoms and democracy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>. Mr. House explicitly expresses distaste for freedom, stating:
> "Nothing to impede progress. If you want to see the fate of democracies, look out the windows. But autocracy? Firm control in the hands of a technological and economic visionary? Yes, that Vegas shall have.” <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>

Historically, security is a constant theme among dictators who manufacture crises and exaggerate threats to justify repressive laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>. In *Fallout*'s world, such crises are abundant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>.

## Conclusion: Humanity Never Changes

*Fallout*'s constant interrogation of human society and government suggests that the game's refrain, "War never changes," might as well be "humanity never changes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. Beyond the mutated creatures, the most terrifying aspect of the Wasteland is a "rehashing of our own regrettable history: slavery obsessed Romans, [[critique_of_totalitarian_regimes_in_1984 | Orwellian dictatorships]], and genocidal governments" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>. History, it seems, truly does repeat itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>.

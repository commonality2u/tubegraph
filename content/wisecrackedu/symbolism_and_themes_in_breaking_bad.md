## Symbolism

Breaking Bad is rich with [[symbolism_and_themes_in_the_film_midsommar | themes and symbols]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

### The Color Yellow
Season One frequently uses the color yellow to foreshadow threats and dangers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. This symbolism is seen in various forms, including yellow mustard stains, bright yellow "hoopties," broken yellow plates, and in a woman's mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

### Chemistry as Metaphor
Walter's expertise in chemistry offers insight into his evolving and troubled psyche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
*   In the pilot episode, Walter's chemistry class outlines the [[exploration_of_moral_themes_in_the_show | theme]] of his own metamorphosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
*   In episode 2, his lecture on thalidomide chirality points to his shifting morality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   By episode 6, another presentation suggests that Walter himself may be a volatile substance, such as ammonium nitrate or a Pop Rock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

### Background Televisual Programming
The incompetence of the [[character_dynamics_of_walter_white_and_jesse_pinkman | duo]] in criminal matters is reflected by the televisual programming seen in the background of scenes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

## Themes

### Critique of American Systems
Beneath its crime drama exterior, Breaking Bad functions as a critique of struggling American healthcare and economic systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. These systems are portrayed as ones in which both the highly educated Walter and the "highly high" Jesse routinely fail to thrive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

### Societal Legitimacy and Marginalization
Throughout Season One, Jesse attempts to achieve societal legitimacy but is routinely marginalized by various societal groups, including his own parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

### The Failure of the American Dream
Walter appears to be living what was once naively dubbed the "American Dream," complete with a son bearing his name and a shiny plaque <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. However, Walter struggles financially and fails to bring home "sub-par bacon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. The show suggests that despite making socially acceptable moves, the American Dream has failed Walt as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

### Rage Against the Machine and Alter Egos
In response to his circumstances, Walter chooses to "rage against the machine" and create a new alter ego <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. Only by operating outside the law can Walter achieve the respect and mobility he desperately craves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. Jesse, meanwhile, continues to rely on Walter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

### Becoming a Societal Cancer
Ironically, by taking drastic measures to earn money for his cancer treatment, Walter effectively becomes a "societal cancer" himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. With each transaction, he gains energy for himself while participating in the deterioration of other human beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. The show poses the question of whether this represents the American Dream or a waking nightmare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.

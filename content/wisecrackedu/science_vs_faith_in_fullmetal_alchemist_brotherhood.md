*Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood* explores complex philosophical themes, particularly the relationship between science and faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. As Edward and Alphonse Elric journey to restore their bodies, they confront various discussions on the effectiveness and application of science, or "Alchemy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. While alchemy is their means of recovery, they also witness its use for terrible purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## Alchemy as Science

Set in Amestris, a country resembling pre-World War II Europe, *Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood* features alchemy as its defining characteristic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. Alchemy is the manipulation and altering of matter using natural energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. It is treated as a science, combining chemistry and biology with its own laws and principles, most notably "The Law of Equivalent Exchange" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. This law dictates that to gain something, something of equal value must be given <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

## Initial Conflict: Faith Exposed

The series immediately establishes a dynamic between science and faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. In Episode 3, Ed and Al visit Liore, a desert town controlled by Father Cornello, a holy figure who has gained power by performing "miracles" and indoctrinating people into Leto-ism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. The brothers are openly skeptical of the divine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. Their skepticism is justified when they discover Cornello's miracles are merely clever applications of alchemy used to attract followers willing to die for him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. Ed and Al expose Cornello as a fraud, freeing the people of Liore from his "ideological tyranny" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. This initial encounter might suggest that "Science Rules, Faith Drools" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

## Science's Dark Side: Shou Tucker and Scientism

However, the show quickly complicates this view. In the following episode, the brothers study under Shou Tucker, "The Sewing-Life Alchemist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. Tucker, known for successfully creating a talking chimera, attempts to repeat his success to maintain his state alchemist certification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. The Elrics' fascination turns to horror when they discover Tucker used his own daughter and family dog as components for his new chimera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. Tucker shows no remorse, claiming he was simply doing "what science demands" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. This atrocity questions the innocence of science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

Tucker, the amoral alchemist seeking knowledge at any cost, sets the tone for the rest of the show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. *Brotherhood* forces viewers to question the value of single-mindedly adhering to science and the consequences of reducing all knowledge to scientific terms, a mode of thought known as "scientism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

### Critique of Scientism

Philosophers who critique scientism are not dismissing science as a lie, but rather criticizing the tendency to place scientific knowledge above all other forms of knowledge or to attempt to reduce other forms of knowledge into it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. Philosopher Paul Feyerabend argued that science is just one of many competing explanatory frameworks, and is "neither as rational nor consistent as it pretends to be" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. He cited Copernicus's heliocentric model, initially rejected by scientists because Aristotle's celestial spheres offered a more complete explanation of planetary movement, despite Copernicus's model correctly calculating it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. Feyerabend worried that unquestioning acceptance of science, "like any ideology," could lead to disastrous results, similar to the blind faith seen in Liore's Leto-ism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.

### Dehumanizing Aspects of Alchemy

In *Brotherhood*, science creates "monsters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. This impersonal, dehumanizing aspect of alchemy is evident in "The Law of Equivalent Exchange," which reduces objects, animals, and even people to their physical components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. The Elric Brothers' journey begins with their belief that they can revive their mother by transmuting the basic ingredients of a human <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

The Philosopher's Stone, alchemy's most sought-after creation, further highlights this dehumanizing nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. Ed and Al discover that its key ingredient is human life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. While the stone allows users to ignore the law of equivalent exchange, the brothers are reluctant to use it due to its grim origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. In contrast, the "Homonculi," artificial humans powered by Philosopher's Stones, embody scientism's philosophy, reducing the souls within the stones to mere alchemic principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.

The Elric brothers' morality is distinguished by their respect for the autonomy of these souls, even when they briefly use the stones' power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. According to philosopher Immanuel Kant, people should "never be used or reduced to calculations, but rather are always a goal in themselves" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

## Militarization of Science

The Elrics' conflict with alchemy extends beyond its impersonal nature to its subservience to the military <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. Alchemy is so controlled by the Amestrian government that there are three state-appointed tenets, the first of which is "LITERALLY obey the military" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. State Alchemists are frequently called "dogs of the military" or "human weapons" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

Sociologist Stanley Aronowitz argued that scientists often view themselves as independent, yet their funding frequently comes from corporations or the state, meaning they don't truly own their discoveries or have much say in their application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. Ed consistently clashes with this militarization of science and his own complicity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.

The military even distorts basic scientific principles. When the Elrics, reflecting on their childhood training, realize alchemy involves "understanding the natural flow of energy, both deconstructing AND reconstructing it," <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a> this principle is twisted by the military. A general rephrases it as "Alchemic Rebirth" to justify destroying a country and slaughtering its population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

### The Ishvalan War and Historical Parallels

As tools of the government, alchemists become instruments of the series' main antagonist, Father, who controls the Amestrian state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. Father desires to assume the mantle of God, a goal he pursues using alchemy, military conflicts, and millions of lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. The "Ishbalan War of Extermination," Amestris' most brutal war, was fought solely to further Father's plan, with state alchemists having a significant impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

The horror of Ishbal is not only the devastating force of alchemy but also the "scientific language" used to explain it, even by the protagonists, sanitizing what is essentially genocide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. Führer King Bradley dismisses the Ishbalan high priest's offer of self-sacrifice for a ceasefire, stating "The Law of Equivalent Exchange won't allow it," <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a> further demonstrating this detached, scientific rationalization. Bradley even views his own wife as an "expendable pawn" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.

The title "Führer" and the country Amestris, reminiscent of pre-World War II Germany, with its militant expansion, blond-haired, blue-eyed army resembling the SS, highlight strong [[narrative_parallels_between_fullmetal_alchemist_brotherhood_and_realworld_history | narrative parallels]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. The "Might is Right" motivation of Nazi Germany is echoed in Amestris, with General Raven invoking Social Darwinism to justify mass extermination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. Amestris' human experiments, like stitching people and animals together or ripping souls from bodies, draw comparisons to Dr. Josef Mengele's operations at Auschwitz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. Feyerabend, who fought as a Lieutenant in World War II and witnessed the scientific arguments for war and genocide, later proposed a separation between science and state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>.

## The Role of Faith

While *Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood* cautions against blind adherence to science, it also explores faith as "another explanatory model," a source of truth and power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>. Despite the prevalence of scientists, characters often appeal to faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. In "The Miracle of Rush Valley," Ed and Al are awestruck by the delivery of a baby, recognizing the limitations of alchemy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. Dr. Marcoh, responsible for the Philosopher's Stone, calls it "fate" that he met Scar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. Knox, a war doctor, invokes God upon his family's return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>. Even Bradley, a homunculus, questions if his death was "providence," fulfilled by the sun looking like a crescent moon, symbolizing God in alchemy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>.

### Limitations of Blind Faith

However, the show doesn't conclude that "Science is bad, Faith is good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. Feyerabend opposed any "unreflective veneration of any ideology" because it "inhibits free thought" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>. Blindly following science as the sole arbiter of truth is as harmful as blindly following faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>. Examples include Father Cornello using Leto-ists to incite violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>, and Scar initially using his God, "Ishvala," to justify vengeance against alchemists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>. Faith alone, when blindly adhered to, "can be every bit just as scary as science" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>.

## Bridging Ideologies and Growth

Characters in *Brotherhood* grow when they recognize the limitations of adhering to a single ideology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. Edward and Alphonse question Western Alchemy's foundations, which supposedly draw energy from the Earth's mantle, when Father cancels it out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>. Their search for explanation leads them to Alkahestry, alchemy's eastern equivalent, which uses life energy from the planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. Bridging these two ideologies ultimately allows the heroes to triumph <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>.

Scar's transformation is a prime example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>. A survivor of the Ishvalan War, he initially targets State Alchemists for revenge, believing they transgress against God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>. As he learns more, Scar realizes his vengeance is misguided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>. He breaks from the strict laws of his faith, using the very alchemy his God abhors to save the country he once hated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>.

## Father: The Embodiment of Scientism

Scar's transformation contrasts sharply with Father, the main antagonist, who clings to a "single-minded belief in science" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>. Father's obsession with alchemy leads him to view humanity as mere materials for his quest to become God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>. Blinded by scientism, he cannot comprehend the value of human emotions, literally ripping the Seven Deadly Sins from himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>.

Ultimately, Father's conviction in the absolute supremacy of science and the ability to achieve perfection through it is his undoing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>. The souls he dismissed as mere energy within the Philosopher's Stone assert their will against him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>. His conception of a soul as a mere ingredient fails to account for individual autonomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>. After his defeat, Father meets "Truth," the real God, still desperately clinging to scientism and demanding to know what he did wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>. Unlike Scar, Father refused to recognize any human wisdom beyond alchemy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>.

## The Elric Brothers' Humble Rejection of Single Ideology

The Elric brothers are unique in their "humble rejection of a single ideology" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>. From the outset, they grapple with what alchemy is and what it means to be a State Alchemist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>. Their core desire is to discover their *own* truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:28">[00:19:28]</a>. When confronted by Solf J. Kimblee, Alphonse rejects the alchemic worldview that equates gaining their bodies back with sacrificing the world's safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>.

This search for possibilities distinguishes the brothers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:08">[00:20:08]</a>. When Al sacrifices himself, Ed follows him into the portal. Asked by Truth what price he will pay, Ed offers his ability to perform alchemy, recognizing the arrogance in believing alchemy could explain everything or solve all his problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:15">[00:20:15]</a>. Unlike Father, who couldn't accept his place in the universe and equated alchemy with power, Ed knows the truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:40">[00:20:40]</a>.

With their bodies restored and the day saved, the Elrics continue their search for truth and new methods to discover it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>. Alphonse expresses a desire to "give back" to those who helped them, not through a cold formula like the Law of Equivalent Exchange, but through a deeper principle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:10">[00:21:10]</a>. To this end, Al travels east and Ed west, hoping to gather all knowledge to make this principle a reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:32">[00:21:32]</a>.

The series suggests that pure devotion to science can lead down a dark path, and that injecting philosophy into how we view the world is necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:11">[00:22:11]</a>.

[[Monty Python]] redefined comedy in the 1970s and remain hugely influential today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. Their innovative approach paved the way for contemporary comedies such as *South Park*, *Rick and Morty*, and *Deadpool* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. The troupe integrated absurdity, satire, and [[postmodernism_in_comedy | postmodern-reflexivity]] into their work, creating some of the most impactful and quoted comedies ever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Postmodernism and Deconstruction

[[Postmodernism in comedy | Postmodernism]] is prevalent in modern media, with films and TV shows like *Jurassic World*, *Star Wars*, and *Family Guy* constantly referencing themselves and commenting on narrative conventions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. *Deadpool* is a prime example of this movement, embodying [[referentiality_and_humor_in_television | self-reflexivity]] through its rebelliously [[role_of_selfaware_humor_in_media | self-aware]] mockery of the superhero genre <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

This concept of [[postmodernism_in_comedy | postmodernism]], coined by French philosopher Jean-Francois Lyotard in 1979 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>, refers to the subversion of "metanarratives"â€”grand mythologies that provide structure and universal insight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. Monty Python took this [[monty_pythons_deconstruction_of_classical_narratives | deconstruction]] to an extreme level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

### *Monty Python and the Holy Grail*

Unlike *Deadpool*, which primarily lampoons the comic book metanarrative, *Monty Python and the Holy Grail* is defined by its extensive breakdown of multiple metanarratives, including:
*   Arthurian chivalry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>
*   Christianity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>
*   Logic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>
*   The very film medium itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>

The film dismantles ideals of Arthurian chivalry by portraying knights as far from their idealized, honorable image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. For instance, Sir Robin is heralded as brave by his minstrels but runs away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>, and Arthur's supposed "great heroes" are revealed to be cowards, hypocrites, and sociopaths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

Even the metanarrative of God and Christianity is satirized; God is depicted as a "cranky dick" with poor animation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. Philosopher Mikhail Bakhtin's concept of the "downward-swing" describes this distortion, where classical stories become grotesque and challenge viewer's learned lessons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

The film also distorts formal logic, as seen in the witch trial scene where Sir Bedevere's "foolproof" test leads to a ludicrous justification for a woman's death, casting doubt on fundamental faith in logic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.

### Self-Aware Film Medium

*The Holy Grail*'s distortion extends to the film medium itself, constantly breaking the fourth wall and making the audience aware they are watching a movie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. Examples include:
*   Swedish subtitles appearing during the title credits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.
*   Arthur using coconuts instead of a horse due to a tight budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.
*   Characters referring to "the old man from scene 24" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.
*   The defeat of the Black Beast of Arghhh occurring because its animator has a heart attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

This [[role_of_selfaware_humor_in_media | self-reflexivity]] reveals the film itself to be an artificial metanarrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. The film's layers of deconstruction make it "the 'Inception' of postmodern film" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

## The Comedy of the Absurd

Monty Python's brand of comedy is foundational to "The Comedy of the Absurd," an existential-based humor that finds broad humor in humanity's tragic insignificance rather than wallowing in despair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. This is exemplified in *Rick and Morty*, which ties absurd humor with thought-provoking insight into the meaninglessness of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

### *Monty Python's Life of Brian*

*The Life of Brian* showcases this tragic absurdity. Brian's existence is a series of absurd misunderstandings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>, born next to Jesus and mistaken for the Messiah by the Three Wise Men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. This projection of significance onto the insignificant is a hallmark of [[philosophical_influences_in_media | existential thought]], particularly aligned with Albert Camus's embracing of "The Absurd" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.

> "Only the true Messiah denies his divinity." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>

People's desire for meaning leads them to attribute significance to silly objects, such as Brian's sandal, which his disciples proclaim a sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>. This discrepancy between reality and belief is where absurd comedies draw their humor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

Even facing crucifixion, Brian finds comfort and breaks into song with his fellow "crucifixion buddies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. This cheerful lament reflects the Myth of Sisyphus, which Camus famously applied to life itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>. The message, akin to *Life of Brian*'s "Always look at the bright-side," suggests that when faced with insignificance and impending doom, laughter is the only option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. This aligns with [[philosophical_analysis_of_humor | philosophical analysis of humor]].

## Social and Political Satire

[[Social satire in South Park | Satire]] is more vital than ever in modern media, seen in late-night talk shows like *Full Frontal with Samantha Bee* and half-hour comedies like *South Park* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. *South Park*'s creators, Trey Parker and Matt Stone, often cite Monty Python as their single biggest influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.

Monty Python paved the way for this by [[monty_pythons_satirical_take_on_political_and_social_issues | subverting established political ideologies]] in England <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.

### *The Meaning of Life*

In *The Meaning of Life*, Monty Python openly comments on:
*   English imperialism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>
*   Economic disparity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>
*   The classist social hierarchies of the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>

The opening mini-movie, "The Crimson Permanent Assurance," depicts elderly workers rebelling against young American yuppies, destroying symbols of the capitalist system that bound them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>. The film consistently questions the economic notion that self-interest leads to the greater good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>.

Economic disparity is highlighted through sketches like "The Miracle of Birth," where doctors prioritize expensive equipment over patient care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>, and "Live Organ Transplants," where bureaucrats forcefully remove an impoverished man's liver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>. The "Autumn Years" sketch climaxes with the grotesquely obese Mr. Creosote exploding from overeating, symbolizing the rich getting richer and fatter at the expense of the starving lower class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.

Monty Python also skewers British imperialism, showing a hand of God striking down an officer who insists Britain needs an army to suppress differing ideologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>. In a drill, soldiers admit they have better things to do than "march up and down the town square" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>. The film suggests that British imperialism is a threat to the meaning of life, juxtaposing the brutal reality of war with simple pleasures like celebrating a birthday <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>.

### *Monty Python's Flying Circus*

Their sketch show, *The Flying Circus*, often portrays bureaucrats as buffoons or "sticks-in-the-mud" who constantly censor the show itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>.

> "I'm not prepared to pursue my line of inquiry any further as I think this is getting too silly!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>

Christopher Hitchens observed that [[Monty Pythons satirical take on political and social issues | Monty Python's satire]] was founded on "the bubbling magma of absurdity that lay beneath the fragile crust of British reserve," where everyday figures could become extreme characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>.

## Legacy

This unpredictable mixture of the [[postmodernism_in_comedy | postmodern]], the political, and the absurd distinguishes Monty Python from other comedy troupes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>. By merging social commentary, existential angst, and silliness, they defied convention and created a unique brand of comedy that led to the coining of the term "Pythonesque" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>.

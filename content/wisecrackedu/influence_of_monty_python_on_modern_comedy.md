From: [[wisecrackedu]] <br/> 

[[monty_pythons_impact_on_shows_like_south_park_and_rick_and_morty | Monty Python]] redefined comedy in the 1970s and remains hugely influential today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Modern comedies such as *[[south_parks_approach_to_social_satire | South Park]]*, *Rick and Morty*, and *Deadpool* might not exist without [[monty_pythons_impact_on_shows_like_south_park_and_rick_and_morty | Monty Python]]'s groundbreaking work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. The troupe paved the way for contemporary comedy by combining [[absurdist_humor_in_monty_python_and_the_life_of_brian | absurdity]], [[social_and_political_satire_in_monty_pythons_the_meaning_of_life | satire]], and [[postmodernism_in_monty_pythons_work | postmodern-reflexivity]] into some of the most influential comedies ever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Postmodernism

[[postmodernism_in_monty_pythons_work | Postmodernism]], a concept coined by French philosopher Jean-Francois Lyotard in 1979 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>, reveals the chaos and disorder beneath traditional "metanarratives" – grand mythologies that provide universal insights and reinforce morals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

*   **Influence on *Deadpool***
    *   *Deadpool* is highlighted as a prime example of a film that encapsulates the [[postmodernism_in_monty_pythons_work | postmodern]] movement through its main character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. Deadpool is "rebelliously self-aware," constantly winking at his own narrative and mocking the superhero genre <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. This self-reflexivity tears down what comic books stand for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
    *   However, [[monty_pythons_impact_on_shows_like_south_park_and_rick_and_morty | Monty Python]] took [[postmodernism_in_monty_pythons_work | postmodern]] deconstruction to an even greater level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

*   **[[postmodernism_in_monty_pythons_work | Postmodernism]] in *Monty Python and the Holy Grail***
    *   Unlike *Deadpool*, which largely lampoons the comic book metanarrative, *Monty Python and the Holy Grail* is defined by breaking down multiple metanarratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
    *   The film dismantles and mocks Arthurian chivalry, Christianity, formal logic, and the very film medium itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.
    *   The film's constant self-referential humor, like using coconuts for horse sounds due to budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a> or directly addressing the film's own artifice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>, reveals it to be its own metanarrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.
    *   This layered deconstruction of religion, logic, heroic tropes, and the film medium makes *Monty Python and the Holy Grail* "the ‘Inception’ of [[postmodernism_in_monty_pythons_work | postmodern]] film" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.

## Comedy of the Absurd

The "Comedy of the Absurd" is an existential-based humor that focuses on the fallout of confronting a world devoid of meaning, finding humor in tragic insignificance rather than wallowing in despair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. This tragic [[absurdist_humor_in_monty_python_and_the_life_of_brian | absurdity]] is foundational to [[monty_pythons_impact_on_shows_like_south_park_and_rick_and_morty | Monty Python]]'s comedy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.

*   **Influence on *Rick and Morty***
    *   *Rick and Morty* ties its [[absurdist_humor_in_monty_python_and_the_life_of_brian | absurd humor]] with thought-provoking insight, often exploring the meaninglessness of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.
    *   For example, in the "Get Schwifty" episode, people worship giant alien heads as gods, only for them to be revealed as reality TV show participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. This reflects the same "misappropriation of meaning" seen in [[monty_pythons_impact_on_shows_like_south_park_and_rick_and_morty | Monty Python]]'s work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.
    *   The humor in these comedies stems from the discrepancy between reality and people's beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.

*   **[[absurdist_humor_in_monty_python_and_the_life_of_brian | Absurdity]] in *Monty Python's Life of Brian***
    *   In *The Life of Brian*, Brian's entire existence is an "absurd misunderstanding" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. He is mistaken for the Messiah, a projection of significance onto an insignificant person, reflecting Albert Camus's rejection of a desperate search for meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.
    *   Despite Brian's efforts to deny his divinity, his disciples grow more fervent, leading to his crucifixion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>. However, his "crucifixion buddies" cheerfully lament the situation, breaking into song and embracing the "bright side of life," similar to the Myth of Sisyphus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. This highlights that when faced with insignificance and impending doom, laughter is the only real option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.

## Satire

[[social_and_political_satire_in_monty_pythons_the_meaning_of_life | Political satires]] derive humor by revealing hypocrisy in established rules and orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.

*   **Influence on *South Park***
    *   [[social_and_political_satire_in_monty_pythons_the_meaning_of_life | Satire]] has become more vital than ever in modern comedy, as seen in shows like *Full Frontal with Samantha Bee* and *[[south_parks_approach_to_social_satire | South Park]]* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.
    *   *[[south_parks_approach_to_social_satire | South Park]]* creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone frequently cite [[monty_pythons_impact_on_shows_like_south_park_and_rick_and_morty | Monty Python]] as the single biggest influence on their show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.

*   **[[social_and_political_satire_in_monty_pythons_the_meaning_of_life | Satire]] in *Monty Python's The Meaning of Life***
    *   In their final feature, *The Meaning of Life*, [[monty_pythons_impact_on_shows_like_south_park_and_rick_and_morty | Monty Python]] openly comments on English imperialism, economic disparity, and the classist social hierarchies of the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.
    *   They satirize capitalism, showing how self-interest does not lead to the greater good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>. The "Miracle of Birth" sketch depicts doctors more concerned with expensive equipment than their patient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>, while "Live Organ Transplants" shows bureaucrats forcefully removing a liver from an impoverished man for the good of the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>.
    *   The film also skewers British imperialism, such as a military officer being struck down by God for insisting Britain needs an army to put down differing ideologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>.

> [!QUOTE] Christopher Hitchens
> Christopher Hitchens stated that the "essential founding gag of [[monty_pythons_impact_on_shows_like_south_park_and_rick_and_morty | Monty Python]] is the bubbling magma of [[absurdist_humor_in_monty_python_and_the_life_of_brian | absurdity]] that lay beneath the fragile crust of British reserve. At any moment, a man with a bowler hat or an umbrella might become a raging cross-dresser or barking sadist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>.

This unpredictability, a mixture of the [[postmodernism_in_monty_pythons_work | postmodern]], the political, and the [[absurdist_humor_in_monty_python_and_the_life_of_brian | absurd]], makes [[monty_pythons_impact_on_shows_like_south_park_and_rick_and_morty | Monty Python]] unique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>. By merging social commentary, existential angst, and silliness, they defied convention, concocting a brand of comedy so singular that the word "Pythonesque" was created for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>.

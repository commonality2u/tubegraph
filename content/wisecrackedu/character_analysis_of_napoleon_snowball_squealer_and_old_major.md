George Orwell's *[[plot_summary_of_animal_farm | Animal Farm]]* is an allegorical novella where key animal characters represent prominent figures and entities from the Russian Revolution and the early Soviet Union. The characters of Old Major, Napoleon, Snowball, and Squealer are central to the unfolding events of the revolution and the subsequent corruption of its ideals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

## Old Major
Old Major is introduced as a "prize boar" on the Manor Farm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. He initiates the idea of rebellion after having a "trippy ass dream" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. He preaches "raw gospel" to the other animals, arguing that men are the only creatures that consume everything but produce nothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. He asserts that the only obstacle between animals and "righteous livin'" is the need to confront and overcome their "two legged oppressors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

Allegorically, Old Major is a blend of two significant figures:
*   **Karl Marx** - The "O.G. commie theorist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
*   **Vladimir Lenin** - "The brain behind the revolution" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

His sermon to the animals echoes the spirit and concluding lines of *The Communist Manifesto* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>, with its call for a "forcible overthrow of all existing social conditions" and the rallying cry, "Working men of all countries unite!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

## Napoleon
Following the animal uprising and the renaming of the farm to Animal Farm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>, Napoleon, a pig, begins to "call the shots" alongside Snowball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. He and Snowball are frequently at odds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. Their conflict escalates over the idea of building a windmill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. When the other animals start to side with Snowball, Napoleon reacts by chasing Snowball off the farm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

Napoleon's character represents **Joseph Stalin**, the Soviet dictator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. Under his rule, the pigs become increasingly "crooked," eventually mimicking human oppressors by walking on two legs and carrying whips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

## Snowball
Snowball is another pig who takes charge after the successful rebellion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. He and Napoleon are consistently "gettin up in each other's grill" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. The major point of contention between them is the proposal to build a windmill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. When the other animals begin to favor Snowball's plan, Napoleon forcibly expels him from the farm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. After his expulsion, Squealer falsely portrays Snowball as a "snitch and a traitor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

Snowball embodies **Leon Trotsky**, a communist leader whose conflict with Stalin ultimately led to his exile from Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

## Squealer
Squealer is a pig known for his rhetoric. After Snowball is driven away, Squealer convinces the other animals that Snowball was nothing but a "snitch and a traitor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

Squealer's "smooth talking tendencies" symbolize **Pravda**, the official newspaper of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. Pravda "spit lies to the people in order to further Stalin's cause" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

## Themes of Power and Corruption
Through these characters, *[[plot_summary_of_animal_farm | Animal Farm]]* offers "legit truths about all humanity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. The novel highlights the dangerous reality that "no matter who you're with, power can corrupt your mind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. The narrative demonstrates how leaders, even those who start with revolutionary ideals, can succumb to the temptations of control, twisting the initial principles of equality until "all animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. This ultimately leads to a situation where the new oppressors become indistinguishable from the old ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

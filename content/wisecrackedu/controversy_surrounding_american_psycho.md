The film *American Psycho* has consistently been a source of controversy since its release in 2000, following the uproar caused by Bret Easton Ellis's original novel nine years prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Much of the debate surrounding the film stems from varying interpretations of its intent and impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## Core Controversies

The central questions around *American Psycho* include:
*   Is the film a [[american_psycho_as_a_critique_on_consumerism | critique on the consumerism]] and superficiality of 80s yuppie culture, or does its excess glorify this lifestyle? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>
*   What is the meaning behind the film's violence, particularly towards women? Some viewers proclaim *American Psycho* a feminist masterpiece, while others label it misogynistic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
*   What should audiences make of Patrick Bateman—is he an antihero, a villain, or something else entirely? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>

## Film Summary

Set in 1988, at the peak of Wall Street's "rich yuppie" era, *American Psycho* follows Patrick Bateman, a handsome, wealthy businessman obsessed with superficialities like trendy restaurants and his status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. Beneath his polished exterior, Bateman harbors a murderous side, secretly killing homeless men and prostitutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. His world spirals after he brutally murders a business rival, Paul Allen, leading to a police investigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. As Bateman descends into madness, the line between reality and fantasy blurs, with apparent inconsistencies like Paul Allen still being alive after Bateman's confession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

## [[american_psycho_as_a_critique_on_consumerism | Satire of Consumerism]] and Superficiality

*American Psycho* satirizes the shallow, consumer-driven lifestyle of the 1980s, reveling in excess from extravagant dinners to Bateman's elaborate morning routine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. Bateman's obsession with status, from securing reservations at exclusive restaurants like Dorsia to his grooming habits and business cards, highlights the era's materialism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

The film frequently references Donald Trump, who in the 80s was seen as the epitome of yuppie excess, embodying the billionaire Wall Street tycoon image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. Bateman's meticulous focus on trivial details, such as the font of a business card, underscores the absurdity of this status-conscious environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

Christian Bale's performance as Bateman is noted for capturing the film's satirical tone, making the minutiae of yuppie life both nonsensical and sadly believable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

### Commodification of Life
Everything in Patrick Bateman's life is commodified and used as a token of perceived superiority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. The film suggests that in a society preoccupied with acquiring goods, people become interchangeable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. Class is depicted as a competition, aligning with Thorstein Veblen's theories on conspicuous consumption—the display of wealth to prove one's superiority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. Bateman consistently defines himself in relation to others, hating Paul Allen for fancier restaurant access and thinking he's superior to his doppelganger, Marcus, due to a slightly better haircut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

Bateman's lectures to lower-class prostitutes about music, like Genesis and Whitney Houston, exemplify his flaunting of knowledge and wealth to assert dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. The film suggests that beneath Bateman's desire for luxury lies a "literal bloodlust," portraying consumer capitalism as a "bloodsport" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

Patrick's declaration at the start of the film—"There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman, some kind of abstraction, but there is no real me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>—contrasts with his feeling of being "whole" after succumbing to murder, suggesting his baser desires make him "self actualized," albeit as a serial killer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. This implies that the true nature of the consumer capitalist is that of a "cold-blooded serial killer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

## [[cultural_fascination_with_patrick_bateman | Audience Fascination and Misinterpretation]]

Despite its brutal critique, there is an undeniable [[cultural_fascination_with_patrick_bateman | seductive quality to Patrick Bateman]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. The "Patrick Bateman lifestyle" has permeated culture, inspiring clothing lines, grooming guides, and virtual tours of his apartment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.

### [[interpretation_and_impact_of_american_psychos_satirical_elements | Parody's Competing Interpretations]]
Parody, by its nature, can offer competing interpretations, both legitimizing and subverting its subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. While *American Psycho* subverts, it also "revels in excess" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. Bateman's attractiveness, wealth, and job contribute to the appeal of his lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. The film often portrays Bateman's monstrous acts as comedic or cuts away from their direct impact, such as his murder of Paul Allen set to Huey Lewis and the News, or Christine's death where only the aftermath is shown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. This approach may allow the audience to identify more with the "glitz and glamour" and overlook his gruesome deeds, potentially undermining the film's satirical depth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>.

## [[perception_of_masculinity_and_sexism_in_american_psycho | Violence, Sexism, and Male Ego]]

A significant controversy revolves around the film's violence, particularly its explicit targeting of women and the lower-class, with some accusing the film of glorifying these "grotesque deaths" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. Detective Kimball's concern solely for Paul Allen's disappearance, not the women Bateman killed, highlights this aspect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>.

However, the filmmakers counter this interpretation. Screenwriter Guinevere Turner stated in a 2015 interview that she considers *American Psycho* a "feminist film," a "satire about how men compete with each other" where "women are even less important than your tan or your suit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. Director Mary Harron echoed this, calling it "a great parody of masculinity" and "an attack and satire of sexism and of male ego" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.

The film showcases the "cavalier attitudes many men have for women" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. Patrick Bateman treats women as objects, dictating their attire, paying them for sex, and believing he can do as he pleases with their bodies, including killing, mutilating, and even eating them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>. The chilling truth the film presents is that "Patrick's right, he can and does get away with it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.

## Unintended Impact and Continuing Relevance

While *American Psycho* aims to satirize male ego and consumer society, its impact has ironically been to uphold the very lifestyle it critiques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>. Despite his monstrous acts, Patrick Bateman is often lauded as an "anti-establishment antihero" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.

This phenomenon mirrors Patrick Bateman's own experience within the film: he constantly confesses his murders, yet others either mishear him (e.g., "mergers and acquisitions" instead of "murders and executions") or dismiss his confessions as jokes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. Similarly, *American Psycho* the film has been misinterpreted as misogynistic or pro-consumer, or treated merely as a joke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>.

The issues *American Psycho* addresses—status obsession, sexism, and wealth inequality—remain relevant today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>. As Bateman states at the film's conclusion, "This confession has meant nothing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>. The film cynically ridicules a society "run amok" but ultimately acknowledges that its own "confession too will mean nothing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>.

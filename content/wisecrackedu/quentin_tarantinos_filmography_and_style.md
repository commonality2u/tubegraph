When considering the films of [[tarantinos_love_for_cinema_and_film_homages | Quentin Tarantino]], certain elements frequently come to mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. His work is often associated with the career comebacks of actors, such as [[interconnected_stories_and_characters_in_pulp_fiction | John Travolta]] in *Pulp Fiction*, notable for his stylish wig <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Other memorable aspects include actors like BJ Novak transitioning from a temp job to hunting Nazis, as seen in [[the_role_of_film_in_inglourious_basterds | Inglourious Basterds]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. His films are also recognized for an "inspiring cacophony" of Samuel L. Jackson's dialogue, often featuring expletives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

Beyond these characteristic elements, [[tarantinos_love_for_cinema_and_film_homages | Tarantino's]] films frequently offer clever and nuanced critiques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This is exemplified in *Django Unchained*, a film that, despite its typical [[tarantinos_love_for_cinema_and_film_homages | Tarantino]] hallmarks, provides a "comprehensive subversion of the logic of slavery" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## [[symbolic_subversion_and_cultural_appropriation_in_django_unchained | Subverting the Logic of Slavery in Django Unchained]]

*Django Unchained* follows Django, a captured runaway slave who is rescued by King Schultz, a German bounty hunter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Schultz teaches Django his craft, and they embark on a mission to rescue Django's wife, Broomhilde, from the villainous plantation owner Calvin Candie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. While the film features a revenge narrative of a former slave burning down a Southern plantation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>, it also provides three more subtle commentaries on slavery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

### Language and Civilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>

[[the_role_of_language_and_culture_in_django_unchained | Language]] plays a significant role in *Django Unchained* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. From the perspective of white slavers like Big Daddy and Calvin Candie, white bodies are associated with culture and civilization, while black bodies are deemed uncivilized and incapable of proper language or cultural appreciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

Schultz, an eloquent German who speaks English as a second language, challenges this racist binary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. His mastery of English vocabulary and rhetorical skills confounds native-speaking slavers, making them appear "wildly uncivilized" by comparison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. Schultz serves as a walking reminder that these "self-styled men of culture" are disingenuous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

The historical idea that slaves were incapable of proper language, stemming from Aristotle's concept of "logos" (speech and reason) versus "phonos" (animalistic communication), is inverted in the film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. *Django Unchained* depicts cruel slavers as incoherent, contrasting them with "clearly intelligible slaves" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

Schultz's treatment of slaves also contrasts with other white characters:
*   He uses the honorific "Fraulein" for Broomhilde, unlike the N-word used by others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.
*   He uses titles as a form of voluntary respect, while Candie demands "Monsieur" as mandatory submission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.
*   The act of Schultz buying Django a beer symbolizes a transition to a co-worker relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>, in stark contrast to Candie's use of beer as a reward for brutal slave fighting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

Even the "multilingual European man of culture" is not entirely civilized, as Schultz is a bounty hunter who kills for a living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. He buys Django out of self-interest and forces him into cooperation, though he at least acknowledges this pragmatic, rather than moral, act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

The film's peak contrast of Schultz with the "faux-civilized white southerners" occurs with Calvin Candie, who demands the title "Monsieur" despite not understanding French <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. Schultz reaches a boiling point when a beautiful product of his culture, Beethoven, is appropriated by those he views as savages, highlighting a profound disconnect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

The film also addresses how the Christian Bible was used to justify slavery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. In one scene, a Brittle brother quotes Genesis 9:2—a verse granting mankind power over beasts—while preparing to whip a slave, with a page of the Bible pinned to his shirt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. Django's shot through this page exposes the "bloody hypocrisy of using Christianity to justify savagery" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

### Symbolic Subversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>

[[symbolic_subversion_and_cultural_appropriation_in_django_unchained | Tarantino]] employs fashion, music, and iconography to "flip the logic of slavery on its head" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.

*   **Fashion**: Inspired by figures like Joseph Cinque of the Amistad Rebellion, who was depicted in the style of his enslavers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>, Django's attire is deliberately abrasive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. His "three musketeers" outfit and horseback riding, historically associated with the well-to-do, draw ire and surprise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. This represents "disidentification," a strategy of taking cultural logic and mangling its symbols from within, rather than escaping or assimilating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. Django abuses the notion of the Southern Gentleman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

*   **Music**: [[tarantinos_love_for_cinema_and_film_homages | Tarantino]] uses rap music in a mid-19th century Western setting, which initially seems out of sync <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. However, this choice makes sense as rap has been used by those facing racial and economic inequality to call for resistance against systemic white supremacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>. Songs like "100 Black Coffins" (written by Rick Ross and Jamie Foxx for the film) directly reflect themes of revenge against injustice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.
    *   Schultz also uses Richard Wagner’s "Twilight of the Gods" to frame Django's journey, making Django the Siegfried of his own revenge story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. This connects Django to a Nietzschean "ubermensch" who creates new values in response to nihilistic ones, metaphorically burning down the institution of slavery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. [[tarantinos_love_for_cinema_and_film_homages | Tarantino]] likely acknowledges Wagner's association with German nationalism, thus using a narrative appropriated by Nazis to "destroy white supremacy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.

*   **Genre Subversion**: [[tarantinos_love_for_cinema_and_film_homages | Tarantino]] frames this slave revenge fantasy within the Western genre <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. Unlike traditional Westerns featuring "strong jawed white dudes" killing Native Americans, *Django Unchained* shows white cowboy types being eliminated by a freed slave, a subject largely absent from the Western canon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>.

### [[agency_and_acting_as_forms_of_resistance_in_django_unchained | Agency and Acting as Forms of Resistance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>

The film explores the role of [[agency_and_acting_as_forms_of_resistance_in_django_unchained | acting]] as a primary means for Django to exert agency within the confines of slavery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>. Schultz prepares Django to "play a character" with a specific wardrobe during their mission to trick Candie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>.

Django's agency is expressed through his decisions within this role, such as berating other slaves, lashing out at Candie's crew, or appearing to approve of a runaway slave being attacked by dogs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>. These decisions are not necessarily good or bad, but rather pragmatic choices made within his limited scope of agency for survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>. This [[agency_and_acting_as_forms_of_resistance_in_django_unchained | acting]] skill later allows Django to outsmart a gang of Australians to regain his freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>.

Stephen, Candie's head house slave, also exemplifies [[agency_and_acting_as_forms_of_resistance_in_django_unchained | agency]] through [[agency_and_acting_as_forms_of_resistance_in_django_unchained | acting]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>. Stephen has "performed his way" out of harsh field labor into relative comfort, even gaining influence and the ability to disagree with his master <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. He uses performed laughter to gain trust and influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>, and is the one who ultimately realizes Schultz and Django's deception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>. Stephen also uses non-verbal [[agency_and_acting_as_forms_of_resistance_in_django_unchained | acting]], faking a limp and using a cane to appear physically weak and disarm suspicion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>.

While Stephen is depicted as a villain, his villainy is framed within the context of slavery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>. He served his white master's interests over fellow slaves, but it is implied that he had few other avenues to achieve any form of freedom or power given his circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>.

Ultimately, *Django Unchained* is presented as one of the sharpest criticisms of slavery and white supremacy in recent cinema <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>.

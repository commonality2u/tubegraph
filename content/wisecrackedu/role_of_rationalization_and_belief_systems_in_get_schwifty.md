The *Rick and Morty* episode "Get Schwifty" is a key example of the show's tendency to trivialize deeply held human beliefs, particularly religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. While the series often overtly expresses Rick's contempt for religion, reducing it to superstition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>, "Get Schwifty" offers a more complex exploration of how humans [[rationalization_and_dehumanization | rationalize]] such thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## The Emergence of "Headism"

When a colossal floating head, known as a Cromulon, appears and demands "SHOW ME WHAT YOU GOT!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>, catastrophic global events ensue, including earthquakes, sinkholes, fires, and massive flooding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. Amidst this chaos, the show initially satirizes the opportunistic nature of organized religion, depicting churches demanding more faith and money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

However, the episode shifts its focus to two groups: those aware the Cromulons are filming a reality show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a> and those who are completely clueless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. This lack of knowledge about the Cromulons' true purpose leads to the formation of "Headism," a cult based on a fundamental misunderstanding of the cosmic situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Without insight into the reality behind the curtain, people naturally form a cult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

## Satire of Logical Fallacies

"Get Schwifty" serves as a scathing indictment not just of religious practices, but of the reasoning behind all belief structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. The episode targets two common [[philosophy_in_rick_and_morty_episode_get_schwifty | logical fallacies]] that confuse correlation with causation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>:

### Cum Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc

This fallacy, meaning "with this, therefore because of this," is the mistaken belief that two simultaneous unrelated events have a causal connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.
*   **Headism's Genesis**: Principal Vagina's prayer coincides with the cessation of cataclysmic events, leading to the belief that his prayer caused the events to subside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. In reality, the Cromulons stopped their destruction because they were pleased with Rick's impromptu performance of "Get Schwifty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
*   **Misinterpretation of Cromulon Displeasure**: When Principal Vagina tries to ascend Beth and Jerry, the Heads begin booing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. The Headists interpret this as the Heads being angered by their actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. However, the Heads are actually displeased with Rick's terrible performance without Morty and a nuclear strike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

### Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc

This fallacy, meaning "after this, therefore because of this," is the idea that because one thing precedes another, it must be the cause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.
*   **The President's Death List**: The President believes The Dream, Billy Corgan, Randy Newman, and Pharrell are all dead because he named them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

Throughout these instances, characters with a limited perspective believe their mundane ceremonies influence the omnipotent Heads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. Beth and Jerry repeatedly highlight this [[philosophy_in_rick_and_morty_episode_get_schwifty | logical fallacy]], stating, "It's possible that we may have been correlating some things that weren't actually related at all" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a> and "we don't know there's a cause-effect relationship" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

## Rationalization and Cognitive Biases

The episode posits that people don't simply stumble into absurd beliefs out of pure irrationality. Instead, they over-rationalize their thinking to the point of absurdity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. Cognitive psychologists suggest that pseudo-scientific belief systems are resilient because they are sustained by the inherent structure of the human brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. These beliefs persist and spread through appeals to rationality, not just through deception or public ignorance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

The human brain is naturally inclined to seek logical conclusions and simple explanations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>, leading people to believe what aligns with their existing worldview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. This phenomenon is known as **confirmation bias**: the tendency to seek out and interpret information that confirms one's own beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. Confirmation bias explains why individuals might overlook glaring flaws in a belief system for personal benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>, as seen when Summer's thriving in the cult makes her parents ignore its problematic aspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

> [!INFO] Example
> "Summer is doing really well here. She's not getting pregnant, or doing drugs, or missing curfew..." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>
> "That's not our business as long as Summer is thriving." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>

## Broader Implications

These fallacies and biases are not exclusive to religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. [[rationalization_and_dehumanization | Post hoc rationalization]] is an inherent outcome of the human brain's cause-and-effect thought process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Even the audience of *Rick and Morty* can be fooled by the brain's tendency to accept [[philosophy_in_rick_and_morty_episode_get_schwifty | logical fallacies]], as demonstrated by Rick's "snake and wristwatch" trick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. This trick plays on the brain's desire to attribute event A as the cause of event B, even when no such link exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

Ultimately, "Get Schwifty" not only delivers the irony that a religion can be built on woefully inaccurate interpretations of cosmic events – a reality TV show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a> – but it also challenges the very human capacity to make predictions and comprehend the complexity of existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. This approach distinguishes *Rick and Morty* from contemporary satire, as it asserts that nothing, not even belief itself, is safe from scrutiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

The novel *Lord of the Flies* contains various symbols and motifs that can be interpreted through a [[freudian_analysis_of_video_games | Freudian]] lens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

## Key Symbols

### The Lord of the Flies
The central symbol in the story is the pig's head impaled on a stick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07">[03:07]</a>, which is referred to as "The Lord of the Flies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. This name is another term for Beelzebub, the prince of demons, also known as the Devil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. The Lord of the Flies symbolizes the destruction, decay, and demoralization of humankind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.

From a [[freudian_analysis_of_video_games | Freudian]] perspective, "The Lord of the Flies" represents "the id" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. The id operates solely to ensure survival, disregarding laws, moral codes, and even intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

### Piggy's Glasses / Loss of Sight
The loss of Piggy's sight is a symbol for the fall of reason <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. When Jack steals Piggy's glasses to create fire for his group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>, it signifies the transition from the rule of reason to the rule of savagery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

## Recurring Motifs

### The Fall of Humankind
A significant motif throughout the book is the recurring pattern of "falling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. Examples include Piggy falling off the cliff with the conch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>, the falling parachutist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>, and Ralph falling at the feet of the naval officer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. These instances collectively emphasize the "fall of human kind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

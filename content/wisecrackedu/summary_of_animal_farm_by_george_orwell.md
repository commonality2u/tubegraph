[[Animal Farm by George Orwell]] is an allegorical novel that explores the themes of power, corruption, and revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Initial Rebellion and Animalism

The story begins at Manor Farm, where a prize boar named Old Major shares a profound dream with the other animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. He preaches that men are the only creatures on the farm who consume everything without producing anything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Old Major asserts that the only path to "righteous livin'" for animals is to overthrow their two-legged oppressors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

Following this sermon, the animals rise up one night, successfully driving Farmer Jones and his men off the farm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. They rename their newly acquired territory "Animal Farm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a> and establish a new philosophy called [[animalism_and_rebellion_in_animal_farm | Animalism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. The central tenet of Animalism is "All animals are equal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## The Rise of the Pigs and Internal Conflict

After the revolution, two pigs, [[character_analysis_of_napoleon_and_snowball | Napoleon]] and [[character_analysis_of_napoleon_and_snowball | Snowball]], emerge as leaders and begin to direct the farm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. They frequently clash, disagreeing on various matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. When humans attempt to retake the farm, the animals unite and fiercely repel the invasion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

However, the conflict between [[character_analysis_of_napoleon_and_snowball | Napoleon]] and [[character_analysis_of_napoleon_and_snowball | Snowball]] intensifies, particularly over the idea of building a windmill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. When other animals start siding with [[character_analysis_of_napoleon_and_snowball | Snowball]], [[character_analysis_of_napoleon_and_snowball | Napoleon]] becomes enraged and uses force to chase [[character_analysis_of_napoleon_and_snowball | Snowball]] off the farm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. Another pig, Squealer, then manipulates the other animals by claiming that [[character_analysis_of_napoleon_and_snowball | Snowball]] was a traitor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

## Corruption and Downfall

While the other animals tirelessly work on building the windmill, the pigs realize they cannot acquire all necessary goods on their own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. Consequently, they begin to trade regularly with their human enemies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

Over time, the seven commandments of Animalism are gradually altered and distorted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Eventually, only one commandment remains, which is twisted to: "All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:02:00]</a>. The pigs become increasingly corrupt, adopting human behaviors such as walking on two legs and carrying whips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. By the end, it becomes impossible to distinguish the pigs from the humans, signaling a full circle back to the farm's original state of oppression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

## Allegorical Interpretations

[[Animal Farm by George Orwell]] serves as a profound [[allegory_of_the_soviet_union_in_animal_farm | allegory of the Soviet Union]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

*   **Pigs and the Communist Party**: The pigs represent the leading figures of the Communist Party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
*   **Napoleon and Stalin**: [[character_analysis_of_napoleon_and_snowball | Napoleon]] symbolizes Joseph Stalin, the Soviet dictator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.
*   **Snowball and Trotsky**: [[character_analysis_of_napoleon_and_snowball | Snowball]] represents Leon Trotsky, a communist leader who was exiled due to his conflict with Stalin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.
*   **Squealer and Pravda**: Squealer's manipulative rhetoric mirrors Pravda, the Soviet newspaper used to spread propaganda and further Stalin's agenda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
*   **Old Major and Marx/Lenin**: Old Major embodies both Karl Marx, the original communist theorist, and Vladimir Lenin, the architect of the revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. Old Major's speeches echo sentiments from *The Communist Manifesto* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>, such as:
    > "The communists openly declare that their ends can be attained only by the forcible overthrow of all existing social conditions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>
    > "Working men of all countries unite!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>

The animal revolt in Chapter 2 parallels the Bolshevik Revolution of October 1917 against the Tsar (Mr. Jones) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. The human attempt to retake the farm in Chapter 4 reflects the civil war between Russian loyalists and Bolsheviks in 1918 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

Orwell's choice of animals for this allegory may be linked to Karl Marx's ideas about human alienation in labor, where "The worker in this human functions no longer feels himself to be anything but animal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

## Themes

Beyond its specific historical allegory, [[Animal Farm by George Orwell]] offers universal [[themes_of_corruption_and_power_in_animal_farm | truths about humanity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. It highlights how power can corrupt the mind, regardless of who wields it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. The novel also shows how even well-intentioned individuals, like Boxer, can come to worship a corrupt leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

Ironically, the revolution at Manor Farm is presented as legitimate in its initial premise, but ultimately returns to its starting point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. The pigs, who started as victims of human oppression, become the new oppressors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

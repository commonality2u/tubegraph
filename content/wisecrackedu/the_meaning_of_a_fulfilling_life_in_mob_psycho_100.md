*Mob Psycho 100*, created by ONE, the Japanese manga artist behind *One Punch Man*, explores what it means to live a fulfilling life through the unique challenges faced by an overpowered protagonist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Unlike [[character_study_of_saitama_and_his_motivations | Saitama]], Shigeo Kageyama, known as Mob, finds peace and satisfaction with his abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This article will delve into the [[philosophy_of_mob_psycho_100 | Philosophy of Mob Psycho 100]] and its take on achieving a meaningful existence.

## Mob's Approach to Life

Mob is a middle schooler born with near-godlike psychic powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. He works for Reigen Arataka, a con man who masquerades as a powerful psychic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. Reigen instructs Mob to never use his powers against another human, warning that misusing such great power will only destroy him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

Mob spends his days trying to live a normal middle-schooler's life, repressing the rage that fuels his powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. Despite attacks from other superpowered humans, or "espers," Mob is torn between defending loved ones and his promise not to harm others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

Mob's reluctance to use his powers stems from his belief that an easy life built solely on innate gifts would be "pointless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. He desires things he must work for, such as muscles, the ability to understand girls, or read social cues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. Taking a cue from Reigen, Mob believes that accepting or realizing limitations can positively influence one's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

## The Pitfall of Egocentricity

In contrast to Mob, most other espers and powerful beings in this world are profoundly egocentric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. They view themselves as "main characters" of an unfolding story, rather than ordinary people with limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. For example, Teru, the "shadow leader" of a rival Middle School gang, uses his powers to bully schoolmates and achieve attention, respect, and power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. Dimple, a power-hungry ghost, even states that Mob should use his psychic powers to "live a fulfilling life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

Mob, however, doesn't desire Teru's superficially perfect life; he prefers to earn a more fulfilling existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. He recognizes that without their psychic powers, these espers would be "empty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>, dependent on their abilities for their sense of identity and worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

## The Sublime and Personal Growth

The show aligns with the philosophy of Irish philosopher Edmund Burke, known for his description of "the sublime" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. The sublime is the feeling of experiencing oneself as infinitesimally small in the face of vast, uncontrollable forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. Burke believed such experiences were vital for a healthy life, forcing individuals to acknowledge their non-central position in the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

A life spent avoiding challenging scenarios that evoke the sublime can become unhealthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. Burke argued that the sublime exercises parts of our minds and bodies that "tense up" in response to fear, which are vital for well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. He stated that "Labour [is] a thing absolutely requisite to make us pass our lives with tolerable satisfaction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>, and that a "relaxed state of body" can lead to "melancholy, dejection, despair" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

This "relaxed" state is the trap the majority of the show's espers fall into <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. Like the Paradisers in *One Punch Man*, Teru and the leaders of Claw carry a massive sense of entitlement that leaves them miserable when the real world doesn't give them what they believe they deserve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. Their abilities, like [[character_study_of_saitama_and_his_motivations | Saitama]]'s strength, are a double-edged sword, fostering the belief that they are inherently superior and deserving of special treatment, leading to deep dissatisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.

### The Espers' Reality Check

These espers need a "reality check" â€“ a reminder that they are subject to the same rules as the rest of humanity, through an overwhelming experience with the sublime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.

Teru serves as a clear example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. When Mob defeats him, Teru is overwhelmed, experiencing terror and utter helplessness as he is stripped of his hair, clothes, and hoisted into the sky by Mob's powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. This moment, reminiscent of Romantic art portraying small human subjects against vast nature, brings Teru true peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. He realizes, "I guess...I'm just an average person after all" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

Reigen also exposes the remaining "Scars" to the sublime, crushing their delusions of grandeur through Mob's transferred powers and his own rhetoric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. He reminds them that even with powers, they are "nothing more than a commoner" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>, forcing them back to reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. For the espers, freedom comes from realizing their humanity and vulnerability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.

## Mob's Path to Fulfillment

Mob already wants to be a normal person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. He joins the Body Improvement Club to improve his physical and social skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a> and admires his brother Ritsu's accomplishments without psychic powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.

However, Mob is also plagued by a delusion: that he must be in total control of his world and is profoundly responsible for everything that happens during his unconscious psychic episodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>. This leads him to repress emotions, causing pain and a feeling of powerlessness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. This clinging to an image of himself as the "main mover and shaker" is his benevolent version of the other espers' greedy desire for godhood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>.

It takes Reigen, an adult Mob respects, to remind him that he is just a kid and doesn't always have to bear the world on his shoulders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. Reigen tells him, "When things go south, it's okay to run away" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>. This revelation shocks Mob into an experience of the sublime, allowing him to feel his own insignificance and temporarily transfer his powers to Reigen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>. This enables him to come to terms with his abilities and live a good life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>.

## Conclusion

Both *Mob Psycho 100* and *One Punch Man* explore what constitutes a good life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>. The struggles of Mob and [[character_study_of_saitama_and_his_motivations | Saitama]] reveal that a fulfilling existence is not simply getting whatever one wants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>. In the ONE-iverse, happiness is the result of deliberate struggle and growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>. As Mob puts it, "fight on fight on fight on" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>.

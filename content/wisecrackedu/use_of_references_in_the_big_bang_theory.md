*The Big Bang Theory* is discussed as a show that deals with science and comics, yet is criticized for its poor quality, particularly in its use of references <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. The show has become a recurring target for criticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

The core issue identified with *The Big Bang Theory* is its extensive reliance on referentiality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## How References are Used

The series frequently references cornerstones of nerd culture, such as *Star Trek* and *Battlestar Galactica*, along with scientific facts and mathematical formulas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. These references are "slipped in" to continually remind the audience that characters like Leonard, Sheldon, and company are "diehard nerds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

Examples of such references include:
*   Sheldon's "Star Date" log <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
*   A mention of an "original series Battlestar Galactica flight suit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
*   Sheldon's explanation of slipping in a bathtub using terms like "low coefficient of static friction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. The joke here is the definition of friction itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
*   Sheldon's medical diagnosis of a dislocated "humerus" from the "glenoid socket" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

The fundamental problem identified is that the actual science or subject matter is not the joke; rather, the *fact that* the characters are talking about science is presented as humorous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. Friction isn't funny, but the *reference* to friction is treated as such <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

## [[comparison_between_big_bang_theory_and_futurama | Contrast with Futurama]]

In [[comparison_between_big_bang_theory_and_futurama | Futurama]], a reference to "aleph null"—the mathematical symbol for an infinite set of countable numbers—is used in a movie theater setting to imply an infinite number of screens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. This serves as an Easter egg for mathematically inclined viewers, but more importantly, the joke lies in the *impossibility* of a movie theater having infinite screens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. The humor is derived from the *subject* of aleph-null, not merely its mention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. This approach imbues the joke with additional meaning, in contrast to *The Big Bang Theory*'s opposite effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

## Philosophical Critique: Jean Baudrillard and Simulacra

The show's reliance on references without substantial subject matter is likened to the concerns of French philosopher Jean Baudrillard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. Baudrillard posited that humanity is living in a state where reality has been "obliterated" through four levels of representation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>:

1.  **First level:** A perfectly accurate representation of reality, like a picture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
2.  **Second level:** An unfaithful copy, a filter that obscures the actual face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. Optimistically, *The Big Bang Theory* could be seen as a distorted view of real nerd culture, getting details wrong but still being *about* it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.
3.  **Third level:** A representation that deliberately hides the absence of reality, like an artist rendering someone they've never seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. Pessimistically, *The Big Bang Theory* is seen as a show about nerd culture with no relation to reality, a copy of something that never existed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. It has science without actual science and portrays nerds as someone who has never met a nerd might imagine them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.
4.  **Fourth level:** Signs and representations referencing other signs and representations, where all sense of reality is lost, such as photoshopping a photoshopped image or memes of other memes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. Baudrillard believed society already lives in a world controlled by "fourth order simulacra," where reference to original reality is lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

From Baudrillard's perspective, *The Big Bang Theory*'s "bad science references" become relevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. The jokes rely on characters cramming in scientific explanations relevant to the action without requiring audience understanding of the science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. For example, Sheldon explaining why roadways are slippery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>, or how locks work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. The humor comes from the simple recognition that it *is* a scientific reference, not from understanding the science itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

In contrast, [[comparison_between_big_bang_theory_and_futurama | Futurama]]'s joke about a "mobius strip" relies on laughing *at* the actual science referenced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

Baudrillard's dismal vision sees these copies of reality becoming their own reality, leading to the "death of meaning" and making all ideas interchangeable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. Because the jokes are "apropos of nothing," characters can "spew meaningless nonsense under the guise of a meaningful joke" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. The game "Mystic Warlords of Ka’a" is cited as an example, starting as a *Magic the Gathering* parody but quickly devolving into interchangeable, meaningless terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. The humor functions by selling an empty joke disguised as a meaningful one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.

## Humor at the Expense of Characters

If *The Big Bang Theory*'s references point at nothing, the question arises: what is the audience laughing at <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>? It is suggested that the show largely "sh*ts on its characters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.

Examples include:
*   Leonard and Raj considering hiring a prostitute for Howard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.
*   A joke implying Leonard's Ph.D. from Princeton suggests the institution has gone "downhill" since Albert Einstein taught there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.
*   Sheldon defending Amy by mentioning she "severed the webbing between her own toes" at fourteen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.

This style of humor aligns with the Superiority Theory of Humor, which originated with Plato's view of laughter as a form of scorn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. Thomas Hobbes modified this, linking laughter to competitive nature and triumph over others or watching their downfall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. Descartes also described laughter as scorn from perceiving "some small evil in a person whom we consider to be deserving of it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. These philosophers generally agree that laughter often comes at the expense of others to make oneself feel good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.

However, the show's characters are stated to be "extraordinary people" by showrunner Chuck Lorre, rather than "horrible people deserving our scorn" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>.

## Disservice to Nerd Culture

The "big picture problem" is that instead of building up nerd culture, *The Big Bang Theory* "tears it down" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. By merely paying "lip service to nerdom" and mechanically inserting references for their own sake, the show reveals a contempt for real nerds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. The specific details of nerd culture are deemed irrelevant, as long as the characters "sound like wanky assholes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. This ultimately does a disservice to nerds, presenting caricatures rather than genuine reflections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

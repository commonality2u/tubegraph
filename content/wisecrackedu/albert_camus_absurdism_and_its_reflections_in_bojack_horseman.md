*BoJack Horseman* initially appears as a vibrant, lighthearted cartoon with talking animals and Hollywood glamour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. However, this facade hides a dark, depressing reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, focusing on the disillusionment that arises when one looks beneath the surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. The show reveals the ugly, narcissistic truth behind "Hollywoo's" dazzling exterior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. As character Charlotte states, "Hollywoo’s a real pretty town that’s smack on top of all that black tar. By the time you realize you’re sinking, it’s too late" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

More broadly, Hollywoo serves as a metaphor for existence itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Just as Hollywoo's facade conceals a hollow industry, the routines of daily life often mask the inherent meaninglessness of existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. This concept, known as [[Existential Nihilism in BoJack Horseman | existential nihilism]], is a foundational theme in *BoJack Horseman* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

## Distraction as a Coping Mechanism

A primary method for coping with the anguish of a meaningless world is simply to [[Distraction as a coping mechanism in a meaningless world in BoJack Horseman | distract oneself]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Naomi Watts expresses this sentiment: "I just wanted to do something light and fun to distract me from the deep well of sadness that is my life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

Many characters embody this coping mechanism:
*   **Princess Carolyn** constantly distracts herself with her job and a compulsive need to fix others' lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. Despite complaining about work, she struggles with free time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
*   **Todd** remains happy as long as he has a task to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. When idle, he spirals into existential despair, asking, "Do I have a purpose?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
*   **Mr. Peanutbutter** lives in a constant state of distraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. He acknowledges the "cruel uncaring void" of the universe, stating that "The key to being happy isn't the search for meaning. It's to just keep yourself busy with unimportant nonsense. And eventually... you'll be dead" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
*   **BoJack** himself has a life full of distractions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>, often not even shown what he's doing due to its triviality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. He admits, "I didn't do any of those things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

The 17th-century philosopher Blaise Pascal, considered a precursor to existentialists, suggested that humans, when given too much time to think, inevitably contemplate their own insignificance, leading to unhappiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. Pascal stated:

> "I have discovered that all the unhappiness of men arises from one single fact: that they cannot stay quietly in their own chamber... namely, the natural poverty of our feeble and mortal condition so miserable that nothing can comfort us when we think of it closely" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

Pascal believed humans have a natural psychological defense mechanism: easy distraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. When distracted, people stop thinking about existence and can be functional, if not happy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. He applied this to figures like kings, much like BoJack's celebrity status:

> "Yet, when we imagine a king attended with every pleasure he can feel, if he be without diversion and be left to consider and reflect on what he is, this feeble happiness will not sustain him" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

BoJack, like Pascal's king, lacks a serious struggle to occupy his life, instead constantly trying to distract himself from his reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. This charade collapses when he reads Diane's book, "One Trick Pony," forcing him to confront his self-deception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. As the book suggests about his fame, it allowed him "to be constantly surrounded by distraction and wouldn't have to be alone with yourself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

For Pascal, once diversion fails, the only recourse is God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. However, Hollywoo is depicted as a "post-God-Is-Dead world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>, as illustrated by Santa Claus representing the non-existence of a guiding order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

## Radical Freedom

Initially, BoJack rejects responsibility, proclaiming, "I’m responsible for my own happiness? I can’t even be responsible for my own breakfast" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. He desires to escape the consequences of his poor life choices, asserting, "EVERYTHING IS MEANINGLESS! NOTHING I DO HAS CONSEQUENCE!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

BoJack fears what 20th-century French philosopher [[JeanPaul Sartres Radical Freedom as depicted in BoJack Horseman | Jean-Paul Sartre called "Radical Freedom"]], a core concept of [[Absurdism and Existentialism in the series | Existentialism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. Sartre's philosophy is summarized by "Existence Precedes Essence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. An object's essence is its purpose; for example, a hammer's essence (hammering) precedes its existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. For an [[Existential Nihilism in BoJack Horseman | existential nihilist]], humans exist without a predetermined purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.

In *BoJack Horseman*, there's no inherent purpose for BoJack's existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. He has complete control over his choices, which is "Radical Freedom" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. Sartre famously stated:

> "That is what I mean when I say that man is condemned to be free. Condemned, because he did not create himself, yet is nevertheless at liberty, and from the moment that he is thrown into this world he is responsible for EVERYTHING he does" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.

Diane encapsulates this: "I don’t think I believe in 'deep down.' I kinda think all you are is just the things that you do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. BoJack is defined solely by his past choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. While this may seem bleak, it offers hope: BoJack is not "doomed to be the person in that book" forever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. He has the freedom to change his actions and himself, though it is entirely his responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

## Embrace The Absurd

The show also explores the philosophy of [[Absurdism and Existentialism in the series | Absurdism]], notably through Mr. Peanutbutter and Cuddly Whiskers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. When Mr. Peanutbutter's brother falls ill, he has his own existential crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>, but soon realizes, "None of this matters!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. Similarly, BoJack’s old writing partner, Cuddly Whiskers, finds happiness only after abandoning his Hollywoo life, declaring, "An Oscar is meaningless. It's all meaningless. Only after you give up everything can you begin to find a way to be happy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.

These characters' paths to happiness, even *because* of the realization of nihilism, invoke the 20th-century French thinker Albert Camus and his philosophy of Absurdism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. For Camus, "The Absurd" is the discrepancy between an irrational, meaningless universe and humanity's desperate need to find reason and meaning within it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>.

Upon realizing "The Absurd," Camus proposed three choices:
1.  Return to the cycle of daily life and ignore it (distraction) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.
2.  Commit suicide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.
3.  Rebellion: Accept the absurd and choose to be happy anyway, defying the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>.

Camus illustrates these ideas in his essay, *The Myth of Sisyphus*, about a man condemned to eternally push a rock up a hill, only for it to roll back down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. Sisyphus becomes Camus's "Absurd Hero" when he recognizes the futility of his task but decides to be happy despite it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.

*BoJack Horseman* directly references *The Myth of Sisyphus* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>:
*   Princess Carolyn states, "I have to push a boulder up a hill and then have it roll over me time and time again" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.
*   A recurring symbol is the baboon jogging up the hill outside BoJack’s house, echoing Sisyphus's struggle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>. The baboon offers profound advice: "It gets easier. Everyday it gets a little easier. But you gotta do it everyday. That's the hard part" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.

At the end of Season 3, BoJack confronts the meaningless loop of his life through a young actress from "Ethan Around" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>. As Camus describes, "It happens that the stage set collapses... At the end of the awakening comes, in time, the consequence: Suicide or recovery" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. BoJack flees the "stage set" by driving aimlessly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>, a form of escape. When he releases the steering wheel, he appears to submit to the Absurd and to suicide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. However, seeing the Wild Horses presents an alternative: embracing the absurd, carrying out the meaningless task, and finding happiness despite it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. These horses are portrayed as absurd heroes, running purely for its own sake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.

## Conclusion

The show briefly offers family as a potential solution to BoJack's struggle for meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. Scenes from his old show "Horsin' Around" often revolve around the in-show family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>, and BoJack has visions of a simple family life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>. The Wild Horses, beyond representing the "Absurd Hero," might also symbolize the "herd" and a sense of belonging that BoJack lacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>. While the show seems to explore this theme further, the video suggests that even family may not be able to fill the void <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>.

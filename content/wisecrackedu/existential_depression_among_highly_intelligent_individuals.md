The character dynamic between Rick and Jerry in *Rick and Morty* provides a fictional lens through which to explore the question of whether [[Intelligence and its correlation with happiness and misery | intelligence can lead to misery]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. [[philosophers_influencing_existential_and_cosmic_nihilism | Fyodor Dostoevsky]] famously stated in *The Idiot*, “It is better to be unhappy and know the worst, than to be happy in a fool’s paradise” <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. This idea is particularly apt for the show, as Rick's despondency stems from his knowledge that nothing matters, while Jerry often exists in a "fool’s paradise" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## The Tortured Genius Stereotype

Rick Sanchez, despite being the smartest man in the universe, exhibits relatable traits such as self-loathing and self-destructive behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. He is practically omnipotent, capable of inventing, transforming, and destroying to get what he wants, yet he remains miserable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. His catchphrase, "Wubbalubbadubdub," actually means "I am in great pain, please help me" in his people's tongue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>, and he even attempts suicide in season 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

[[the_stereotype_of_the_tortured_genius_and_its_cultural_implications | The stereotype of the tortured genius]] is deeply ingrained in popular culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. The media often highlights the connection between brilliance and madness, making it seem as though depression is a prerequisite for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. However, many brilliant individuals do not suffer from mental illness and are considered "normal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

### Research on Intelligence and Depression

Some studies suggest a correlation between high intelligence and a propensity for depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.
For instance, a 2017 study by Dr. Ruth Karpinski surveyed 3,700 Mensa members, finding that over a third reported dealing with depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. This figure is approximately five times the national average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. While the study relied on self-reported data and may not represent all intelligent individuals, it raises questions about a potential link <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

### The "Hyper Brain" Hypothesis

Dr. Karpinski proposed a "hyper brain" concept, suggesting that people with IQs of 130 and above can comprehend the world's problems, uncertainties, and possibilities more easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. This idea is based on the work of psychiatrist Dr. Kazimierz Dabrowski, who observed that his exceptionally smart patients tended to overly contemplate everything, especially negative aspects, and often experienced deeper depression than intellectually average individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

Dabrowski termed these traits "overexcitability," which he viewed not as a negative but as predictive of one's potential for self-actualization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. He noted that individuals with several forms of overexcitability "sees reality in a different, stronger and more excitable manner" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

Overexcitabilities manifest in five forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>:
*   Excessive energy or nervousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>
*   Deep appreciation for art or music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>
*   Extreme curiosity or an active mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>
*   A vivid imagination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>
*   Extreme and complex emotional experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>

Rick Sanchez embodies all of these characteristics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

## Existential Depression

Psychologists suggest that individuals who think in this "hyper brain" manner may be more prone to [[absurdism_and_existentialism_in_the_series | existential depression]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. This condition involves feelings of hopelessness stemming from questions about life's ultimate meaninglessness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. Dr. James Webb, a psychologist studying gifted children, notes that while it can affect anyone after a crisis, it is more likely to occur spontaneously in people with above-average intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.

Rick's pronouncements reflect this sentiment: "When you know nothing matters, the universe is yours. And I’ve never met a universe that was into it... There’s no other way off" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. He is also perpetually bored by the mundane, seeking temporary relief through his portal gun adventures and alcohol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.

## Social Isolation and Eccentricity

Highly intelligent individuals, like Rick, may exhibit eccentricities that overwhelm "normal-minded" people, leading to social isolation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. Attempting to conform to societal norms can result in a "crisis of self," leaving them feeling lost about their true identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. Rick is arguably in a perpetual crisis of self, often compromising his nature for his family's sake, as seen when he attends therapy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

> "I have no doubt that you would be bored senseless by therapy the same way I’m bored when I brush my teeth and wipe my tush. Because the thing about repairing, maintaining and cleaning is...it’s not an adventure.” <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>

## Intelligence, Wealth, and Happiness

Conversely, some studies suggest that intelligence can unlock opportunities that lead to better health and happiness, particularly through greater wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. Being smarter is associated with higher income, which in turn leads to better health and reduced stress from poverty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. This complex relationship means that in some studies, a higher IQ has been correlated with greater self-reported happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.

## Conclusion: Rick vs. Jerry

While Jerry lacks the traits associated with a "hyper brain" and doesn't suffer to the same degree as Rick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>, he faces his own struggles with social skills and general incompetence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. Rick survives through intimidation and knowing everything, while Jerry relies on the pity of others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

Ultimately, whether it is better to be a miserable "Rick" who knows the worst or a happy "Jerry" in a "fool's paradise" is a subjective question without a concrete psychological answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. Limited evidence suggests that while a "Jerry" might be less prone to [[absurdism_and_existentialism_in_the_series | existential depression]], a "Rick" is more likely to live a better life overall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.

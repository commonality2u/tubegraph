Dark Souls, with its themes of fighting, magic, fantasy, and "infinite frustration," presents a storyline that is "incredibly cryptic" and "impossibly baffling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. Namco even offered ten thousand dollars to anyone who could explain the story, but attempts have only led to "feelings of defeat and utter frustration" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

Instead of focusing on a clear plot, the game's narrative may deliberately lead nowhere, acting as a "distraction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. This approach is not uncommon, especially in avant-garde cinema.

## Story as Distraction

Similar to pioneering Italian filmmaker [[comparison_of_dark_souls_and_avantgarde_films | Michelangelo Antonioni]], the creator of Dark Souls, Hidetaka Miyazaki, seems to craft meaning not through explicit plot, but through other means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. Antonioni's films, like *Blow Up* and *La Aventura*, often present intriguing setups that deliberately remain unresolved, shifting focus to character studies or thematic exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. For instance, *Blow Up* leads viewers to believe a murder mystery is central, but it's actually "a character study about a narcissistic artist mired by ennui" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. Similarly, *La Aventura* is not about a missing woman but "the hollow decadence of her spoiled friends" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

## Visual Storytelling and Identity

In Dark Souls, meaning is primarily created through [[visual_symbolism_in_dark_souls | visual design]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. An example from *Dark Souls 2* is an old lady spinning yarn at a sewing machine; her sparse dialogue is cryptic, but visually, she references the Norns of Norse mythology, who spin the yarns of fate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

The game's thematic core, despite "sparse dialogue," echoes a journey of self-discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. The game asks players to "Think back, deep into your past" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a> and states, "At least you know your own name" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. Ultimately, Dark Souls is about "piecing together a broken past and figuring out who we are" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. This focus on [[overpowered_protagonists_and_selfidentity | identity]] is highlighted at the character creation screen, which prompts the question: "Is this your TRUE self?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a> The game can be seen as "a nightmarish descent into the unconscious, where it explores our identity and our deepest desires" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

### The Womb and Birth Imagery

Both *Dark Souls* and *Dark Souls 2* begin with striking visual representations of birth.

*   **Dark Souls 1:** The camera plunges into a crevice shaped like a vagina, through a tunnel resembling an ovary, and into a pit resembling a womb "full of… things being born" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
*   **Dark Souls 2:** The scene is structured in reverse, starting inside a labyrinth of tunnels and caverns, requiring players to work their way out through a "vagina-like crevice into the light" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. This 'tutorial' section is presented as being in the womb, from which the character emerges once "developed enough" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

Womb and ovary-like landscapes are prevalent throughout the games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. In *Dark Souls 1*, the crucial item "Humanity" is "deliberately vagina shaped" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>, and *Dark Souls 2* is "full of mother symbols from the start" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

Yonic (vagina-like) imagery is common in popular media, including [[psychology_and_identity_in_fight_club | Fight Club]], Rick and Morty, the Alien franchise, and Videodrome, often used to convey themes of birth, rebirth, and sex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

Beyond the initial birth scenes, Dark Souls continues to feature birth imagery:
*   Mysterious nests and eggs transport the player <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.
*   The Demon Ruins are "covered with hideous egg monsters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.
*   Players can get infected with a "horrible egg head" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
*   Pregnant monsters are hidden in cells, as if "repressed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.
*   *Bloodborne* (a related game) features bloody birth scenes, screams of pregnant women, and the collection of umbilical cord parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>, concluding with a "bizarre, lovecraftian baby alien" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. The "blood dregs look suspiciously like semen," and some speculate the blood players drink could be menstrual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. The title *Bloodborne* itself is suggestive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

In these games, players are "creatures moving around the alien womb-world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. The central question becomes whether the player is trying to get out or "back in" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. The game suggests a desire to keep "plunging deeper within it, trying to get to the secrets held inside these depths" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>, transforming the familiar video game trope of 'Tomb Raiding' into 'Womb Raiding' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

This intense focus on birth imagery ties back to the game's core theme of "lost identity and about working out who we really are" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. As one character states, "Sometimes I feel obsessed with this insignificant thing called self" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

## Freudian Psychoanalysis and Desire

The game's themes align with the ideas of psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud, who believed that the complexity of identity leads individuals to look back to their origins, even to their time in the mother's womb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. Freud called the moment of conception the "primal scene," an event that starts us and which, he argued, we "always dream of" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. The opening line of *Dark Souls 2* — "perhaps you’ve seen it, maybe in a dream. A murky, forgotten land" — echoes this concept, framing the game as an "endless search for our identity" by trying to return to this "murky forgotten land" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

### Castration Anxiety

However, physically re-entering the womb is impossible due to social taboos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. Freud proposed that the father metaphorically "says ‘no’" and prevents access to the mother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. Dark Souls visually represents this Freudian concept. Players are constantly confronted with "arched doorway[s] which we want to access, only to have our path blocked by a series of male guards with big, erect, throbbing uh… weapons" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

These guards are depicted as "castrators blocking us from entering crevice like passages" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. The majority of enemies are guards wielding "large sharp swords, spears, halberds and other phallic weaponry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. The boss "The Penetrator" in *Demon's Souls* is a stark example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. Freud considered swords symbols of castration, with enemies threatening to "cut off our d*cks" as players attempt to reach the metaphorical mother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.

The game's notorious difficulty, marked by the "YOU DIED" screen appearing an average of "739 times" in *Dark Souls 2*, fosters a pervasive feeling of "constant failure" and "impotence" that directly mirrors "Freudian castration" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. Being "destroyed by a giant hulking male giant wielding a formidable phallus" is a potent symbol of deflated manhood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.

Female enemies also play a role in this symbolism:
*   **Scorpioness Najka** and **Mytha the Baneful** in *Dark Souls 2* feature attractive upper halves combined with weaponized lower halves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.
*   **Queen Queelag** has "monstrous teeth in place of a vagina," conveying that attempting to re-enter the womb is the "ultimate social taboo" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. This is a classic representation of 'Vagina Dentata' (a vagina with teeth), an ancient folklore concept adopted by philosophy and psychoanalysis to represent a "vagina with secretly hidden ferocious penis decapitating fangs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.

Dark Souls visually embodies Freud’s idea of castration anxiety by showing desire and then thwarting it, leaving players "weak and unfulfilled" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.

## The Throne of Want and Endless Desire

The ending of *Dark Souls 2* reverses the initial birthing scene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. After navigating a "very obviously vagina-like door," the hero is welcomed to "the seat at the heart of the mother’s womb by a comforting female voice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>, telling them to "Take your throne" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. This throne, called "The Throne of Want," is based on a 'kiln' (oven), historically associated with wombs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>. It symbolizes "the embodiment of ultimate desire – the place where we have our deepest and most repressed wishes fulfilled" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. To reach it, players must again defeat "penis wielding giant alpha males" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.

Despite the character achieving "satisfaction" by sitting on the Throne of Want <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>, the player is left "frustrated again" and unfulfilled, as "The Curse wasn’t even lifted!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a> The game's conclusion suggests that we "never work out the puzzle of our desires or our identities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. The mysterious female voice reinforces this by stating, "souls will flourish anew and all of this will play out again" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.

This unfulfilled state aligns with the ideas of Jacques Lacan, a follower of Freud, who argued that "we can never be fulfilled because as soon as we get what we want, we stop wanting it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. The Ancient Dragon in *Dark Souls 2* explicitly states this Lacanian argument: "the curse of life is the curse of want" – indicating that we are "destined forever to be unfulfilled, always unsatisfied" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.

## Dark Souls as a Metaphor for Life

Hidetaka Miyazaki has commented that the *Dark Souls* games explore the "strange crossover between life and death," asking questions like "what is death, and for that matter, what is life?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>. Viewed through this lens, Dark Souls can be considered a "metaphor for life itself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>:
*   You are "developed in the womb" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.
*   Then you are "born" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.
*   You are "plagued with endless desire, frustration, and misery" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.
*   Until you "confront death" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>.
*   And "through death, you return to the peaceful oblivion of your mother’s womb" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.

Dark Souls visually renders "our horrific unconscious desires, our complicated relationship with birth, and our endless failure to be fulfilled with a nightmarish flair" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.

The animated comedy series *Archer* sustains its humor, in part, by inverting narrative tropes of the spy genre and employing sound and language gags to build a unique arsenal of humor that explores deeper character psychology [[archers_use_of_humor_and_character_psychology | character psychology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## The Role of Sound and Language

Communications scholar Ian Dawe argues in his essay, “Archer: A Spy Parody For The Ears," that the show's preoccupation with sound and language generates laughs and provides deeper insights into [[archers_use_of_humor_and_character_psychology | character psychology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

Dawe's study of *Archer*'s third and fourth seasons found that linguistic or sound-specific references — including language jokes, puns, foreign language references, and loud gunfire followed by Archer’s tinnitus — occurred, on average, 10 to 11 times per episode, approximately once every two minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. These language jokes are often employed at the most inopportune moments, creating comic effect akin to the contrast between life-threatening action sequences and mundane office politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

### "Lana?" Calls

One simple, ongoing gag involves Archer frequently calling out loudly to Lana, even when she is nearby <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. This act is reminiscent of a baby calling out for its mother, signaling Archer's inability to control his demand for attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. Other characters eventually adopt this gag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. Dawe suggests that the growing frequency of these appeals for attention highlights themes of power, demand, control, and psychological repression, emphasizing the characters' need to be heard, but not too quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

### The "Phrasing" Joke

Archer’s classic “phrasing” joke is a prime example of what Freud called “double entendre,” where the humor depends specifically on a sexual meaning, even though the words also have a non-sexual interpretation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:09:04]</a>. Freud believed such jokes release nervous energy from repressed sexual or aggressive desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. This is particularly significant when Archer directs the joke at his mother, hinting at an Oedipal complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.

When Archer says “phrasing,” he is willfully misinterpreting the speaker’s words, thus derailing the conversation and ensuring the person is not heard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. This tactic quickly becomes one of Archer’s favorite ways to hijack conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. The joke spreads among other characters, eventually becoming so ubiquitous that it falls out of fashion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:10:00]</a>. Archer’s anxiety over its plummeting popularity underscores how important these attention-grabbing antics are to his identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.

### Voicemail Ruses

Archer's elaborate voicemail messages are another running gag he uses to avoid hearing characters, particularly his mother, Mallory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. He takes great pleasure in tricking Mallory into believing she is speaking to him, having entire conversations with his prerecorded voice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. This juvenile means allows Archer to temporarily reclaim power and undermine Mallory’s dominance over him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.

### Struggles with Rules of Language

Just as Archer struggles with the rules of bureaucracy, he often finds himself struggling with the rules of language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:11:02]</a>. Both restraints prevent him from living the badass spy narrative he envisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.

In the three-part series “Heart of Archness,” when Archer declares himself king of the pirates, he struggles to address his "subjects" through a translator because he relies heavily on idioms, which do not translate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. He chafes against the rules of language, much like he chafes against bureaucratic rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.

Even without language gaps, Archer has trouble expressing himself and is not gifted with pithy one-liners, unlike his [[parody_of_the_spy_genre_in_archer | James Bond]] counterpart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:12:01]</a>. He frequently regrets his failure to come up with the perfect witty line, parodying Bond by turning off-handed innuendos into a chore where Archer still falls short <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:12]</a>.

### Obscure Cultural References

Archer's language can also isolate him, especially when he tries to connect with others through his favorite obscure [[cultural_references_and_their_role_in_archer | cultural references]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. Despite constantly grasping to be heard and impress with his "brainy" call-outs, he rarely receives affirmation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>. The disappointment of his thoughtful [[cultural_references_and_their_role_in_archer | cultural references]] falling flat is a recurring theme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>.

Much of the show's humor rests in the linguistic communications between characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:11]</a>. Archer's lingering adolescent sense of being an outsider, formed during 15 years at boarding school, is perfectly expressed in his over-enthusiasm for coining group slang and his wildly obscure [[referentiality_and_humor_in_television | pop culture references]] that inevitably fall flat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:25]</a>. Ultimately, Archer embodies the perennial secret agent struggle, reduced to a man-child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.

Negrophilia is a term describing white fascination with black culture, which helps in understanding films like Jordan Peele's *Get Out* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:49">[03:11:49]</a>. The term originated in 1920s Paris, where it characterized a craze for black culture among the era's "hipsters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:04">[03:19:04]</a>. Writer Petrine Archer-Straw noted that for these Parisians, blackness symbolized young Parisian "modernity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>.

## Problematic Aspects
While seemingly a form of acceptance, negrophilia has a problematic flipside: it denies the normality of black individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>. Black personalities were either "lionised or demonised," preventing them from being seen as actual people. Instead, they were reduced to one of two stereotypes: brilliant artists or uncultured animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>. Ultimately, the white perspective dictates how black people are defined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>.

### Not True Understanding
Negrophilia is not about genuinely understanding black people and their culture; rather, it's about using them to fulfill one's own desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:00">[04:33:00]</a>. This approach is described as "collecting" humans rather than understanding them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>.

## Negrophilia in *Get Out*
In *Get Out*, the Armitage family and their guests demonstrate negrophilic tendencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>. Chris Washington, the protagonist, encounters white people who are unnaturally eager to discuss "black people stuff" or express their admiration for black culture, such as stating that "black is in fashion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>. This over-performance of "acceptance" often alienates Chris and highlights the underlying difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.

The film explores how this fascination extends beyond culture to the desire for the black body itself, both sexually and athletically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>. Characters express a desire for Chris's physical attributes, such as his athletic potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a> and presumed sexual prowess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:00">[04:19:00]</a>.

### Literal Colonization of the Black Body
*Get Out* pushes classic negrophilia to an extreme by depicting the literal colonization of the black body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>. This is manifested through the Coagula procedure, where white consciousness is implanted into black bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. Examples include:
*   Grandpa Armitage having his brain implanted into an athletic black body after being bested by Jesse Owens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:00">[05:24:00]</a>.
*   Grandma Armitage inhabiting Georgina's body to enjoy her "golden years playing dress up as a beautiful black woman" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>.
*   Chris being auctioned to a blind man who desires his "award winning photographerâ€™s eyes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>.

This extreme form of [[racism_and_justice_themes | racism]] is highlighted when Chris's potential new owner explicitly denies racial motivation, claiming his desire for Chris's eyes is "deeper" and not about skin color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:00">[05:49:00]</a>. The film suggests that this desire for the black body, even to transform into it, is a perverse extension of negrophilia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>.

[[rick_and_morty_and_existentialism | Rick and Morty]] explores themes related to religion and atheism, often [[critique_of_religion_and_belief_systems_in_rick_and_morty | critiquing belief systems]] by applying a purely [[rick_and_mortys_approach_to_scifi_and_science | scientific]] lens to demystify perceived sanctity or spirituality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">00:00:00</a>.

## Atheism and Demystification
The show exhibits a unique kind of [[atheism_themes_in_rick_and_morty | atheism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">00:00:00</a> that consistently invalidates religious figures by reducing them to mere scientific phenomena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">00:00:00</a>. Rick, a character embodying extreme rationalism, uses [[rick_and_mortys_approach_to_scifi_and_science | science]] to demystify everything, even explaining love as merely a set of chemical reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">00:00:00</a>. In one instance, Rick beats the devil, effectively "playing out the death of God" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">00:00:00</a>.

This perspective aligns with Friedrich Nietzsche's concept of the "death of God," where, after the Enlightenment and the [[rick_and_mortys_approach_to_scifi_and_science | scientific]] revolution, a "big being in the sky" that once provided value to human lives is no longer relevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">00:00:00</a>. Following this "death of God" in [[philosophy_and_absurdism_in_rick_and_morty | philosophy]], what remains is [[existentialism_and_nihilism_in_rick_and_morty | nihilism]]—a void of meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">00:00:00</a>.

## Critique of Religious Fundamentalism
[[rick_and_morty_and_existentialism | Rick and Morty]] also acknowledges the frequent misuse of [[rick_and_mortys_approach_to_scifi_and_science | science]] by those with religious agendas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">00:00:00</a>. In the episode "Something Ricked This Way Comes," Jerry's "personal" interpretation of [[rick_and_mortys_approach_to_scifi_and_science | science]] leads him on a crusade to reinstate Pluto’s planet-hood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">00:00:00</a>. He encounters the Plutonians, whose eyes feature subtle crosses, drawing a comparison to religious fundamentalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">00:00:00</a>. This situation is revealed to be a ploy to manipulate the Plutonians into accepting the destruction of their planet by corporate overlords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">00:00:00</a>.

## Human Tendency to Worship
The show demonstrates the human tendency to seek meaning or worship in the face of the unknown or incomprehensible. In "Get Schwifty," when Earth is approached by a giant space-head (a Cromulon), a cult quickly develops to worship this cosmic entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">00:00:00</a>. This highlights the human inclination to create belief systems when confronted with overwhelming, unexplainable forces, even if the entity is merely an object of entertainment for its creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">00:00:00</a>.

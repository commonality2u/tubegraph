Monoculture refers to a shared cultural experience, where large groups of people consume and engage with the same media and ideas, leading to a widely accepted set of beliefs and behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. Historically, cinema played a significant role in fostering American monoculture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

## Cinema as a Monocultural Force

Quentin Tarantino's film *Inglourious Basterds* suggests that cinema was a powerful cultural safeguard capable of defeating negative ideologies, such as Nazism, in the minds of the populace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. The film posits that 35-millimeter film and the medium of cinema at large were responsible for cementing anti-Nazism as the norm in American culture, which was then exported globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. Tarantino himself stated that "all that happens in Inglorious Bastards is because of the cinema, and it's not a metaphor, the 35 millimeter cinema killed the Third Reich" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

The communal act of going to the theater, where many people experience the same thing simultaneously, was a key aspect of cinema's power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. This communal viewing created a ritual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. Rituals, defined as activities that distinguish a moment from mundane time, such as paying for a ticket and finding a seat, lend importance to the experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. For Tarantino, the additional ritualistic elements of film — the projector's sound, changing reels, and the need for a projectionist — supercharged this ritual, allowing film stories to have a lasting impact strong enough to suppress negative ideologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.

## Decline of Monoculture

Despite cinema's historical influence, the idea that 35-millimeter cinema eradicated Nazism permanently has been challenged by the rise of xenophobic, neo-fascist political groups, antisemitic and racist violence, and Nazi-esque content online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. This suggests that cinema's monocultural influence has waned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

The primary cause for this decline is the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. Engagement with movies on personal devices, like laptops, lacks the built-in ritual of theater-going <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. This means movies no longer resonate as strongly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. Furthermore, individuals can now curate their own cultural experiences, hyper-tailored to their specific interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.

[[marshall_mcluhans_theories_on_media_and_culture | Marshall McLuhan]], in his final work *The Global Village*, predicted "global media networking" would lead to the "death of monoculture," with everyone engaging in their own cultural activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. McLuhan termed this phenomenon "robotism," or right hemisphere thinking, which describes a capacity for conscious presence in multiple places at once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. He contrasted this with "left hemisphere thinking," associated with hierarchical reasoning and shared culture, such as the widely accepted belief that "Nazis are bad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. [[marshall_mcluhans_theories_on_media_and_culture | McLuhan]] argued that technology pushes society from left hemisphere thinking (shared culture) to right hemisphere thinking (individualized beliefs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.

### Loss of a Ruling Center

[[marshall_mcluhans_theories_on_media_and_culture | McLuhan]] explains the decline of monoculture as a result of the "loss of a ruling center" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>. Robotism decentralizes culture, making "each point in the net as central as the next," dissolving traditional hierarchies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>. A ruling center refers to the collective beliefs society shares to function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. As this shared agreement weakens, previously suppressed negative behaviors, like Nazism, can re-emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>.

Society is compared to an electrical circuit where each point contributes to the whole rather than a central source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. Similarly, in contemporary culture, there is no fixed ethical center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. Individuals may derive their ethics from diverse digital platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, 4chan, or YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>. This prevents collective agreement on rules and behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.

### Consequences

The splintering of society due to the decline of monoculture is a "double-edged sword" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>. On one hand, it allows for diverse and specialized content, such as a YouTube channel analyzing philosophy and culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>. On the other hand, it also creates space for behaviors that were once socially agreed to be unacceptable, such as Nazism, to flourish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. Where cinema once conveyed "critical social messages" that defined society, the widespread "robotism" of modern culture has diminished this ability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>.

Even traditionalists like Tarantino have had to adapt to this changing cultural landscape, as evidenced by his release of *The Hateful Eight* as a mini-series on Netflix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. This adaptation reflects an acknowledgment that the power of cinema as a central cultural ritual is no longer as prevalent as it once was <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.

Self-aware humor is prevalent in media, with examples like [[satire_of_superhero_films | Deadpool]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, *Cabin in the Woods*, and *Galaxy Quest* making fun of the very genres they inhabit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. This growing trend of media that critiques itself highlights the complex nature of self-criticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. To understand this, it's important to distinguish between satire and parody <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Criticizing the World Through Storytelling
Both satire and parody serve the purpose of criticizing the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. They twist genre archetypes to make observations about what is often taken for granted in storytelling, such as the types of heroes, their expected actions, and their motivations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

### Distorted Archetypes and Power
Examples like [[analysis_of_one_punch_man_as_parody | One Punch Man]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a> and [[analysis_of_watchmen_as_satire | Watchmen]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a> demonstrate this twisting of familiar character types:
*   **[[analysis_of_one_punch_man_as_parody | One Punch Man]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>: Distorts anime tropes like magical girls (e.g., Sailor Moon) with a "swole ex-convict," portrays the hardworking everyman hero as a "debuffed version of Toku Hero Kamen Rider," and depicts a Goku-esque world savior as a "low rent halloween costume attached to an egg" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   **[[analysis_of_watchmen_as_satire | Watchmen]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>: Features an army of superhero knock-offs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. Rorschach and Ozymandias are distillations of Batman elements, with Ozymandias as the charismatic, rich, and intelligent Bruce Wayne, and Rorschach as the obsessive detective Batman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. Nite Owl is a recreation of the nerdy inventor Batman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

Both narratives explore a more realistic version of superhero power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. Characters like Saitama from [[analysis_of_one_punch_man_as_parody | One Punch Man]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a> and Dr. Manhattan from [[analysis_of_watchmen_as_satire | Watchmen]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a> confront the boredom that comes with omnipotence, contrasting with traditional protagonists like Batman or Goku who struggle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. Physical confrontations are often over before they start for these characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

## Satire: Attacking Vice and Folly
Satire is defined as a work "designed to attack vice or folly," aiming to persuade an audience that "something or someone is reprehensible or ridiculous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. When satire adopts another literary structure, it tends to subvert it or direct its energies toward "alien ends" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

### [[analysis_of_watchmen_as_satire | Watchmen]] as Satire
[[analysis_of_watchmen_as_satire | Watchmen]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a> specifically assaults the idea of anyone possessing powers akin to a nuclear weapon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. It is largely about nuclear fear, symbolized by Dr. Manhattan, who was created in a nuclear accident and recruited as a weapon to win the Vietnam War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. His name itself is a reference to the Manhattan Project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. The graphic novel clearly emphasizes nuclear security and fear, driving conflicts and riots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

[[analysis_of_watchmen_as_satire | Watchmen]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a> critiques the dangers and indifference of power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. Dr. Manhattan's boredom with everything leads to a conflicted existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. This is presented as a grim joke about Superman: why would an all-powerful being worry about humanity? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>

The Comedian in [[analysis_of_watchmen_as_satire | Watchmen]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a> further exemplifies the corrupting influence of power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. He is a hyper-capable super soldier akin to Captain America or Wolverine, yet also a sadist and psychopath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.

[[analysis_of_watchmen_as_satire | Watchmen]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a> uses the superhero genre's form and content to persuade its audience that the very idea of superheroes is a dangerous fantasy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.
<br>
> [!EXAMPLE] Analogy to Jonathan Swift's "A Modest Proposal"
> Just as Swift's essay used the form of a political proposal to expose the indifference to suffering among those in power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>, [[analysis_of_watchmen_as_satire | Watchmen]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a> uses the superhero narrative to depict superheroes as dangerous and problematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. It argues that superheroes create an asymmetry of power that defies regulation, leading to violence and ethical conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.

Ultimately, [[analysis_of_watchmen_as_satire | Watchmen]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a> condemns superhero fiction because it promotes a dangerous fantasy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.

## Parody: Affirming and Expanding a Genre
Parody differs from satire in its persuasive function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. While it exaggerates elements of its target, parody "ultimately affirms the literary form it inhabits" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. According to Robert Phiddian, parody "accepts the logic and rules of its genre and takes them seriously as tools of its criticism," operating "from inside of the texts and ideas it criticizes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>.

### [[analysis_of_one_punch_man_as_parody | One Punch Man]] as Parody
[[parody_and_satirical_elements_in_one_punch_man | One Punch Man]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a> pokes fun at superheroes from manga and Western comics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>, using exaggerated villain monologues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>, dramatic backstories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>, and familiar anime/manga tropes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. It is in conversation with other works in its genre, but without the judgment seen in [[analysis_of_watchmen_as_satire | Watchmen]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.

The show's creators love the genre, but don't consider it above ridicule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>. It critiques superhero stories by exaggerating the overpowered hero archetype, questioning the necessity of other characters when one hero (Saitama) can defeat any enemy in a single punch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. Characters like Genos and Mumen Rider, despite their efforts, can never match Saitama's strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>.

[[parody_and_satirical_elements_in_one_punch_man | One Punch Man]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a> introduces reality into superhero narratives. Mumen Rider, with a classic hero's motivation, constantly gets beaten up, conveying that some people simply "don't have what it takes to be a superhero" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>. Saitama's boredom with his immense power is a relatable reaction, contrasting with the typical happy superhero ending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>.

Parody's critical point is that the "body of words is always preloved and redirected" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>. It aims to reveal flaws in beloved things, not to demolish a flawed genre like [[analysis_of_watchmen_as_satire | Watchmen]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>. [[parody_and_satirical_elements_in_one_punch_man | One Punch Man]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a> mocks anime to expand its possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>. Parody is a tool for criticism that assumes the genre it critiques is "worth improving" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>. It encourages exploring other types of stories beyond the "bigger monster, bigger gun" model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>.

## The Critical Difference
Both [[analysis_of_one_punch_man_as_parody | One Punch Man]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a> and [[analysis_of_watchmen_as_satire | Watchmen]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a> use overpowered characters to make points about their genres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>. However, [[analysis_of_watchmen_as_satire | Watchmen]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a> condemns social systems beyond superheroes and even the superhero genre itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>. [[parody_and_satirical_elements_in_one_punch_man | One Punch Man]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>, while advocating for a refresh in storytelling, doesn't abandon heroic narratives completely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>. It critiques a specific kind of superhero narrative, but does not disavow the value of heroes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>.

*Neon Genesis Evangelion* is a complex narrative that explores deep themes beneath its surface story of giant biomechanical monsters and alien-angel-robot battles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. The series extensively incorporates [[philosophical_themes_in_neon_genesis_evangelion | philosophical]], [[psychological_analysis_of_characters_in_evangelion | psychological]], and, notably, religious symbolism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. This article focuses on the pervasive religious imagery and concepts woven throughout the original twenty-six-episode series and its films (*End of Evangelion*, and *Death and Rebirth*) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

## The Title: A New Beginning

The title "Neon Genesis Evangelion" itself is steeped in religious meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>:
*   **Neon**: Derived from the Greek *neos*, meaning "new" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
*   **Genesis**: Refers to a beginning and is a direct reference to the opening book of the Bible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
*   **Evangelion**: Means "the Gospel" or "the good news," from the same root as "evangelize" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

Thus, the full title translates to "a new telling of the gospel: genesis," or a re-imagining of the Book of Genesis incorporating technology, brooding, and sex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

## Christian and Biblical References

The show is "overflowing with religious iconography" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>, some of which is overtly Christian:
*   **Dead Sea Scrolls**: The series explicitly references the Dead Sea Scrolls as a source of prophecies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
*   **Number 666**: Ritsuko installs a "666-type firewall" to protect the Magi system from cyberattacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   **Angels**: Creatures called "Angels" attack Earth, and two of them are named Adam and Lilith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
*   **Magi System**: NERV's supercomputer network, named Magi, has three parts: Casper, Balthasar, and Melchior, after the three wise men who visited baby Jesus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

## Jewish Mysticism and Kabbalah

The majority of *Evangelion*'s religious imagery is rooted in Jewish mysticism and the Kabbalah <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
Kabbalah is an investigative practice of faith and mystical teachings that seeks religious revelation and sacred knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

### Angels and Divine Names
Most of the Angels in *Eva* are taken directly from texts within Judaism's extended universe, such as the Zohar (Kabbalah's bible), the Talmud, and the Book of Enoch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. Others are written using "el theosophy," a form of mystical writing that uses the "el" suffix (one of the Hebrew words for God) to tie names to the divine, seen in names like Ramiel, Sachiel, and Matarael <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

### Adam and Lilith
While Adam is a familiar biblical name, Lilith is Adam's female counterpart in Jewish folklore, created around the same time as Adam and often described as a mother of demons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. In *Eva*, humans are depicted as the descendants of Lilith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

### Adam Kadmon and the Second Impact
In Kabbalistic tradition, the first being is Adam Kadmon, a being of light, which bears a striking resemblance to *Eva*'s first Angel, also named Adam, who explodes in the Second Impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. This Second Impact kills half the planet's population and turns the oceans red, reminiscent of Revelation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

### Shevirat ha-Kelim and Tikkun ha-Olam
This destruction is a callback to the Kabbalistic concept of *Shevirat ha-Kelim*, or "the breaking of vessels" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. This concept suggests that in the beginning, everything was connected in a universal unity that broke apart, creating the separated world humans inhabit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. It's described as a "theological big bang" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

The purpose of Kabbalah is *Tikkun ha-Olam*, or "the restoration of the world," traditionally practiced through good deeds and prayer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. In *Evangelion*, this concept is taken literally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. The ethical call of the Kabbalah is the reunification of the world, specifically the fragmented parts of Adam called the Sefirot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. The Sefirot are depicted as the Tree of Lifeâ€”ten circles in a particular pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. This visual is seen in *Eva* when random circles appear around Eva Unit 01 during an attack by manufactured angels, fulfilling the sacred duty or purpose of the Kabbalah <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

This reunification, by making the universe a complete whole, destroys the individuality and separation that defines life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. Many characters in *Eva* pursue the goal of literally reunifying the world by combining all different consciousnesses into one place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. This goal is achieved when Adam and Lilith's DNA combine inside Rei, leading to the reunification of the masculine and feminine aspects of the angels, and consequently, the world itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. This process culminates in Instrumentality, a merging of all human consciousness into a primordial soup called LCL, a desire to return to tranquility and the "peace and harmony of the womb" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>.

## Themes of Rebirth and a New Adam and Eve

The desire to return to a primordial state and attain "eternal balance" is explicitly stated as "a return to Lilith and *Tikkun ha-Olam*" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>. Despite the pervasive drive towards this unified state, Shinji ultimately rejects Instrumentality, choosing a world with individuality, pain, and separation, but also hope and joy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>.

The series concludes with Shinji and Asuka as the only two individuals remaining after the Third Impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:44">[00:20:44]</a>. This final image positions them as a "new Adam and Eve," symbolizing a "new Beginning" and touching upon [[significance_of_birth_and_rebirth_imagery_in_dark_souls | rebirth imagery]] after the previous world's demise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>.

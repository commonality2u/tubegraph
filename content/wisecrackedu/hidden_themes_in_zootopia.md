[[social_and_political_parallels_in_zootopia | Zootopia]] takes place on Earth in the 24th century, after humans have wiped themselves out and animals have taken over, raiding human wardrobes [00:00:26]. The film's protagonist is Judy Hopps, an enthusiastic rabbit who leaves her family to become a cop [00:00:33]. Despite graduating at the top of her class, Judy is initially assigned parking duty due to her small size [00:00:43].

## Plot Overview

Judy worms her way onto a missing otter case with the help of the assistant mayor, a fellow "pipsqueak" [00:00:54]. She blackmails Nick, a fox, into becoming her unpaid intern [00:00:57]. They discover the missing otter went savage on his limo driver, a strange occurrence attributed to "night howlers" [00:01:04]. The limo driver also goes "Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever" on them [00:01:13].

Following clues, they find the otter and other missing predators, still acting erratically [00:01:32]. The lion mayor is also found and arrested, leading to his replacement by the sheep assistant mayor [00:01:38]. This causes panic among the Zootopioids about predators being "psycho killers" [00:01:44].

Judy learns that "night howlers" are not wolves (as in an "old wolves' tale" [00:01:26]), but a type of flower that causes madness [00:01:53]. She discovers that the new mayor, a sheep, is behind the plot, manufacturing a serum from these flowers [00:02:03]. After Nick pretends to be affected by the serum, they record the mayor's confession, and Judy and Nick become partners [00:02:27].

## Nature vs. Nurture

At its core, [[social_and_political_parallels_in_zootopia | Zootopia]] explores the question of nature versus nurture: whether identity is biologically determined or can be elevated through nurture [00:02:40]. Initially, the film suggests that the "veneer of civilization" is the only thing preventing predators from reverting to their wild instincts [00:02:49]. Nick, a fox, outwardly defies negative stereotypes, but privately displays his "sly nature" [00:02:58].

When predators begin to go savage, biological determinists assert "I told you so," believing it's due to "biology" [00:03:08]. However, the revelation that a poison from an "obscure" plant is the cause shifts the blame away from the animals' inherent biology [00:03:18].

## Challenging Stereotypes

The film actively illustrates the fallacy of relying on prejudice by inverting established stereotypes [00:03:29]:
*   Judy’s childhood fox bully becomes a pacifist pastry chef [00:03:35].
*   Flash, the slow sloth, is revealed to be a speed demon drag racer [00:03:39].
*   The "dumb bunny" (Judy) solves the case, and the "sly fox" (Nick) gets an honest job [00:03:43].
*   The "meek lamb" assistant mayor is the ruthless mastermind behind the entire conflict [00:03:47].

## Social and Political Parallels

[[social_and_political_parallels_in_zootopia | Zootopia]] mirrors the [[social_and_political_parallels_in_zootopia | social and political landscape of 20th century America]], particularly efforts to address societal inequalities [00:03:55]. The "Mammal Inclusion Initiative" in the film parallels Earthling diversity and affirmative action programs designed to "level the playing field for under-served minorities — and in the case of women: majorities" [00:04:05]. This parallel is highlighted by the use of language associated with the PC movement, such as Judy's declaration, "Sir, I'm not just some token bunny" [00:04:16].

However, the film's resolution, where citizens resolve all social ills through optimism and effort, is presented as overly simplistic [00:04:26]. Additionally, the film is critiqued for its limited scope of inclusion, ignoring reptiles, amphibians, fish, birds, and insects, which are presumed "all dead" [00:04:45]. This suggests that despite its themes of inclusion, the movie "go[es] out of their way to ignore all the freaks and uggos" [00:04:50].

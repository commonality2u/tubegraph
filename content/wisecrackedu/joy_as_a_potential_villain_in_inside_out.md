While *[[psychological_insights_in_inside_out|Inside Out]]* (2015) garnered critical acclaim for its entertainment value and light-hearted portrayal of the brain's workings, especially due to its consultation with psychologists to root its whimsical world in science, an alternative viewing perspective suggests Joy, the film's ostensible hero, could be seen as its primary antagonist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

## The Argument for Joy as Villain

Initially, viewers might perceive Joy as the protagonist on a quest to recover a core memory from the depths of Rileyâ€™s mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. The film's conclusion often highlights Joy's valuable lesson that Sadness is sometimes necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. However, an alternative interpretation frames Joy as a "gleeful egomaniac" who irreparably harms an innocent girl's brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

Joy is presented as the source of all problems in the narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. Her initial tampering with core memories and subsequent journey to recover them only exacerbate the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. She functions as a "petty dictator," bossing around and organizing the other emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. From the very first scene, Joy is shown "muscling Sadness out of the way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. Her determination that Sadness touching a memory is a negative event underscores her controlling nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. Joy's compulsive desire to maintain happiness, even in the face of hardship, sets Riley on a downward spiral of depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

## Societal Critique and the "Happiness Industry"

This perspective suggests *Inside Out* critiques the concept of "compulsory happiness" prevalent in 20th-century society, where not being happy is often not considered an option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. Doctors, psychologists, self-help gurus, and human resources departments often mandate a positive outlook, even suggesting medication if necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. However, this view overlooks the crucial functions of other emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. For instance, anger can heighten awareness of injustice, fear protects from danger, and disgust prevents harmful consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. Psychologists Dacher Keltner and Paul Ekman suggest emotions "organize, rather than disrupt, rational thinking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

The film's structure, with its drama primarily confined to Riley's mind, embodies the societal notion that happiness is a personal responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. This internal focus can divert attention from broader political and economic problems, as argued by economic sociologist William Davies in "The Happiness Industry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. Davies contends that "happiness science" is "critique turned inwards" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. He views compulsory happiness as a component of neoliberal capitalism, where happiness is manipulated by corporations and advertisers to encourage harder work and increased consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. For example, Riley's mother asking her to smile for her father, despite hardship, highlights a societal pressure to maintain a happy facade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

Davies's ideas align with the notion that Riley's depression could be seen not just as a neural event, but as a problem of disempowerment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. This is mirrored in real-life examples like corporate mindfulness or Silicon Valley workplaces that offer perks like ping-pong tables and beer kegs, masking long hours and mind-numbing work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. Joy, by compulsively maintaining happiness, embodies this logic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

## Conclusion

The film implicitly criticizes this "compulsory happiness" logic by casting Joy as an accidental villain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. It is only when Anger, Disgust, Fear, and Sadness collaborate during the film's climax that Riley begins her path to a better mental state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. The argument concludes that emotions like sadness and anger are vital for personal growth and contribute to a more robust form of happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. This aligns with the Ancient Greek philosophical concept of "Eudaimonia," espoused by figures like Plato and Aristotle, which defines happiness not as mere pleasure, but as the pursuit of virtue and justice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. This deeper understanding of happiness, which acknowledges inner virtue and avoids internal strife, appears to be the true message of *Inside Out* upon careful viewing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

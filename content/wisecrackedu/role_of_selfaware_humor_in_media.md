Self-aware humor is a prevalent trend in modern media, often appearing in well-loved works that mock the very genres they inhabit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Examples include *Deadpool*, *Cabin in the Woods*, and *Galaxy Quest* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This form of humor is part of a growing movement of media that engages in self-criticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Its purpose is to gain insight into how media "sh*t on the world around us" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

While both satire and parody serve to criticize the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>, understanding their distinct approaches is crucial for appreciating the complex nature of self-criticism in media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Satire

Satire is a form of self-aware humor designed to "attack vice or folly" and "persuade an audience that something or someone is reprehensible or ridiculous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. When satire adopts an existing literary structure, it tends to subvert it or direct its energies toward "alien ends" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

### Watchmen as Satire
*Watchmen* serves as a prime example of satire, not merely borrowing from the superhero genre but fundamentally assaulting it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.
*   **Critique of Power**: It specifically targets the idea of anyone possessing powers akin to a nuclear weapon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. The character Dr. Manhattan, a direct reference to the Manhattan Project, embodies nuclear fear and the indifference of immense power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. The graphic novel emphasizes this by referencing nuclear security and fear of nukes throughout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.
*   **Subversion of Archetypes**: *Watchmen* presents superhero knock-offs like Rorschach and Ozymandias, who distill elements of Batman into morally ambiguous figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. The Comedian, a character in the mold of Captain America or Wolverine, is depicted as a "sadist and a psychopath" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>, demonstrating that even "good guys" with power are not inherently deserving of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.
*   **Persuasive Function**: The series uses the form and content of the superhero genre to persuade its audience that the very idea of superheroes is a "dangerous fantasy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. It posits that superheroes create an asymmetry of power that defies regulation, leading to dangerous conflicts when different ethical frameworks clash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. This is akin to Jonathan Swift's "A Modest Proposal," which used the form of a political essay to expose the indifference of society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.

## Parody

Parody, unlike satire, exaggerates certain elements of its target but ultimately "affirms the literary form it inhabits" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. It operates "from inside of the texts and ideas it criticizes," accepting the genre's logic and rules as tools for its criticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>. Parody seeks to awaken audiences to flaws in beloved things, not to demolish a genre <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>.

### One-Punch Man as Parody
*One-Punch Man* is an example of parody that lovingly pokes fun at both manga and Western superhero comics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.
*   **Exaggeration of Tropes**: The series intentionally uses over-the-top villain monologues, dramatic backstories, and familiar anime/manga tropes like ocean creatures and Kaiju-style monsters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. It exaggerates the overpowered hero archetype, asking why other characters even exist when Saitama can defeat any enemy in one punch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.
*   **Affirmation of Genre**: Despite mocking, *One-Punch Man* does not condemn the genre but aims to expand its possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>. While characters like Genos and Mumen Rider are often rendered comical by Saitama's power, their desires and struggles are not treated as stupid; they simply become irrelevant due to Saitama's immense strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>.
*   **Critique for Improvement**: The show critiques the "bigger monster, bigger gun" storytelling model prevalent in series like *Dragon Ball Z*, suggesting a need for diverse narratives about everyday characters like chefs or ice skaters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>. It highlights the boredom that can come with omnipotence, offering a more relatable take on superhero power than traditional narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>. The show encourages recognition and emulation of bravery from characters like Genos and Mumen Rider, even as it acknowledges the silliness of the stories they inhabit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>.

## Shared Elements of Self-Aware Humor

Both satire and parody in self-aware humor share common ground in twisting genre archetypes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. They use these twisted versions of recognizable characters to make observations about what audiences take for granted in superhero stories, including the types of heroes, expected actions, and motivations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. This contrast explores a "more realistic version of superhero power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

For instance, both Saitama and Dr. Manhattan confront the boredom afforded by omnipotence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. Neither is a traditional protagonist who struggles in conventional ways; Saitama performs simple push-ups for training, while Dr. Manhattan already knows everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. Their god-like powers mean physical confrontations are over quickly, leading to a profound lack of challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

## Conclusion

The critical difference between satire and parody in self-aware humor lies in their ultimate goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>. *Watchmen*, as satire, condemns social systems and the superhero genre itself, arguing it promotes a dangerous fantasy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>. In contrast, *One-Punch Man*, as parody, seeks to refresh and expand the possibilities of superhero storytelling without abandoning the genre completely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>.

Other examples of satire include *Team America*, *Dr. Strangelove*, and *Heathers* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>. Examples of parody include *Deadpool*, *Galaxy Quest*, and *Blazing Saddles* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>. Self-aware humor is a powerful tool for [[referentiality_and_humor_in_television | referentiality]] and [[postmodernism_in_comedy | postmodernism in comedy]], allowing media to critically engage with its own conventions and impact.

The enduring appeal of [[darth_vaders_fear_of_death | Darth Vader]], arguably the most iconic villain in cinematic history, can be attributed to more than just his formidable presence or the revelation of his identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. His tragic descent to the dark side powerfully resonates because it illustrates a universal human struggle: an all-consuming fear of death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. *Star Wars* explores two distinct philosophical approaches to mortality through Vader's journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Anakin Skywalker's Struggle with Death Denial

Anakin Skywalker's transformation into Darth Vader is fundamentally driven by fear, specifically the fear of loss and death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. Cultural anthropologist Ernest Becker, in his 1973 book *The Denial of Death*, posits that much of human behavior is a way of managing the terror of our own demise and that of our loved ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. This anxiety, termed [[darth_vaders_fear_of_death | death denial]], is deeply rooted in Anakin's childhood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

Despite his prodigious abilities, including superhuman piloting skills, intelligence, and being a potential messiah figure with an unparalleled midi-chlorian count <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>, young Anakin is acutely vulnerable to the fear of death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. His distress over his mother's mortality becomes a haunting fixation as he ages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. Yoda quickly identifies this fear as a significant problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

The Jedi Council's hesitation to train Anakin due to his age, though not explicitly canon, suggests a concern about the ramifications of [[jedi_training_and_the_concept_of_death_denial | death denial]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. Psychologist James A. Graham notes that children begin to grasp death's permanence between ages 5-9, often perceiving it as something that happens primarily to the elderly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. By age 10, children typically realize death's universality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. At nine, Anakin is at a critical juncture, understanding his mother's mortality and on the brink of realizing his own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. The Jedi, by training children at a younger age, could more easily indoctrinate them to not fear death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

### Violence as a Response to Death Denial

Becker argues that human violence is a natural outcome of [[darth_vaders_fear_of_death | death denial]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. Inflicting death provides a sense of control over it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. This idea is foreshadowed in an original script for *Episode I*, where Anakin states, "Fear attracts the fearful. He was trying to overcome his fear by squashing you. Be less afraid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. This implies Anakin would attempt to "squash" death itself to overcome his anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

This plays out tragically when Anakin massacres an entire Tusken Raider village after his mother is mortally wounded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. According to Becker, killing others provides the illusion of controlling death, alleviating the very fear the Jedi warned him about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. The more Anakin kills, the more he feels a sense of ownership over death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

His anxiety intensifies with recurring dreams of Padmé dying in childbirth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>, leading him to believe he is responsible for both his mother's and Padmé's impending deaths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. At this critical juncture, Anakin faces a choice between the Jedi and Sith philosophical responses to death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

## Two Philosophical Responses to Death

### The Jedi Way: Death Acceptance and Nonattachment

When Anakin seeks Yoda's counsel regarding his prophetic dreams, Yoda advises him to "Train yourself to let go of everything you fear to lose" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. This advice echoes Buddhist philosophy, specifically the concept of *jaramarana*—the seductive human impulse to escape old age and death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. Nonattachment, or relinquishing desires, is presented as the only way to overcome this impulse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. Yoda exemplifies this principle, facing his own death with serene acceptance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

Becker, drawing from Søren Kierkegaard, would describe Yoda as a "knight of faith" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. Authentic faith in a power greater than death, for Yoda, the light side of the Force, is a potent way to manage existential terror <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. Yoda's teaching, "Death is a natural part of life. Rejoice for those around you who transform into the force" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>, underscores this acceptance. Such faith is not a choice but "a matter of grace and not of human effort" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.

The [[contrast_between_jedi_and_sith_attitudes_towards_death | Jedi's approach to death]] is further exemplified by Obi-Wan Kenobi's sacrifice in *A New Hope* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. His duel with Vader on the Death Star appears less like an attempt to kill and more like a deliberate offering of himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. His cryptic statement, "If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you could possibly imagine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>, highlights an alternative to Vader's death denial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. This "cheating death" is not conquering it but transcending it, allowing Jedi like Qui-Gon Jinn, Obi-Wan, and Yoda to interact with the living as Force ghosts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

### The Sith Way: Death Denial and Control

Lacking Yoda's faith, Anakin turns to Palpatine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. The [[contrast_between_jedi_and_sith_attitudes_towards_death | Sith approach]] is to embrace desires, including the desire to prevent death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. Palpatine tempts Anakin with the legend of Darth Plagueis the Wise, suggesting the dark side can enable one to defeat death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

Anakin's decision to become a Sith Lord is conditional: "Just help me save Padme's life, I cannot live without her" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. In refusing to accept death, he sacrifices his identity, loyalty, and conscience, becoming a "zombie trapped in a machine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. Becker describes this as the terminal point of [[darth_vaders_fear_of_death | death denial]]: "the person seeks to avoid death, but he does it by killing off so much of himself... that he is actually isolating and diminishing himself and becomes as though dead" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. Darth Vader, stripped of his protective purpose, becomes a mere instrument of power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.

## Redemption and the Acceptance of Mortality

The [[contrast_between_jedi_and_sith_attitudes_towards_death | distinction between Jedi and Sith]] is starkly visible in how Anakin and Luke confront death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. Anakin's confrontations led to indiscriminate slaughter and the tragic death of Padmé <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. In contrast, Luke is willing to sacrifice his own life to avoid succumbing to the dark side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. His refusal to kill Vader, even when ordered by Darth Sidious, exemplifies this willingness to accept death rather than inflict it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

It is only when Anakin follows his son's example, renouncing his own life, that he truly embraces the reality of death and conquers *jaramarana* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. The story of Anakin Skywalker illustrates how the denial of death can corrupt individuals, strip them of values, and drive them to terrible acts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. Becker suggests that this denial is responsible for human violence, conquest, and the desire for control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. Evil empires, both fictional and real, stem from this inability to accept mortality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.

However, the narrative of Darth Vader also offers hope: accepting the reality of death can foster dignity, courage, and compassion, even for those deeply entrenched in denial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. As long as one is breathing, there is an opportunity to come to terms with death or risk succumbing to the dark side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

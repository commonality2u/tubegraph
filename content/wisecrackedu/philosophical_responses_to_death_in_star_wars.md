Perhaps no villain in cinema is more iconic or important to a franchise than Darth Vader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. His story resonates powerfully because [[anakin_skywalkers_transformation_and_death_denial | Anakin Skywalker's descent]] to the dark side represents an all-consuming fear of death that everyone faces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Star Wars explores two distinct philosophical responses to death through the character of Vader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Death Denial and its Roots

[[darth_vader_and_the_fear_of_death | Darth Vader's transformation]] is ultimately driven by fear, specifically the fear of death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. As Master Yoda states, "Fear of loss is a path to the dark side" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

### Ernest Becker's *The Denial of Death*

Cultural anthropologist Ernest Becker, in his 1973 book *The Denial of Death*, argues that much of human behavior is a way of managing the fear of one's own demise and the demise of loved ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. This anxiety, known as [[anakin_skywalkers_transformation_and_death_denial | death denial]], is exceptionally present in [[darth_vader_and_the_fear_of_death | Darth Vader]] and originates in his childhood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

As a child, Anakin Skywalker, despite being a genius with superhuman piloting skills and a messianic prophecy surrounding him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>, is not immune to the fear of death. His distress over his mother's mortality becomes a haunting fixation as he grows older <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. Yoda recognizes this fear as a significant problem, noting Anakin's thoughts dwell on his mother, "Afraid to lose her I think" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

The Jedi's hesitation to train Anakin at his age may stem from concerns about [[anakin_skywalkers_transformation_and_death_denial | death denial]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. Psychologist James A. Graham suggests that children understand death as permanent between ages 5-9, but only as something that happens to others. It is around age 10 that children grasp the permanence of death for themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. Anakin, at 9, is on the cusp of understanding his own mortality, making him susceptible to the ramifications of this fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

### Violence as a Response to Death Denial

Becker posits that human violence is a natural response to [[anakin_skywalkers_transformation_and_death_denial | death denial]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. He states, "only scapegoats can relieve one of his own stark death fear" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. Inflicting death provides a sense of control over it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. For Anakin, this leads him down the path to the Dark Side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

An early script for Episode 1 foreshadows Anakin's arc: he tries to overcome fear by "squashing" death and gaining control over it, rather than confronting it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. This is exemplified when Anakin, after his mother is mortally wounded by Tusken Raiders, slaughters the entire village <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. This act of revenge is a form of control, assuaging the very fear the Jedi Council warned him about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. The more he kills, the more death feels like something he can own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

## Competing Philosophical Responses to Death

As Anakin's fear intensifies with anxiety dreams about Padmé dying in childbirth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>, he is presented with a choice: the [[sith_versus_jedi_approach_to_mortality | Sith way or the Jedi way]] of dealing with death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

### The Jedi Way: Nonattachment and Faith

Yoda's counsel to Anakin is to "Train yourself to let go of everything you fear to lose" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. This philosophy aligns with Buddhism, where "jaramarana"—the desire to escape old age and death—is a dangerous human impulse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. Nonattachment, or letting go of desires, is presented as the way to defeat it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. Yoda embodies this, remaining "chill" about his own death in *Return of the Jedi* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

Becker refers to Yoda as a "knight of faith," a term from Soren Kierkegaard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. Authentic faith in something more powerful than death is a way to manage terror <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. For Yoda, this nonattachment to jaramarana is rooted in his faith in the light side of the Force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. The Jedi believe, "Death is a natural part of life. Rejoice for those around you who transform into the force" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

### The Sith Way: Embracing Desire and Conquering Death

Anakin, lacking Yoda's faith, turns to Palpatine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. The [[sith_versus_jedi_approach_to_mortality | Sith approach]] is to embrace desires, in this case, the desire to prevent Padmé's death – pure [[anakin_skywalkers_transformation_and_death_denial | death denial]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. Palpatine tempts Anakin with the legend of Darth Plagueis, hinting that the dark side can defeat death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

Anakin becomes a Sith Lord on the condition that he can save Padmé's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. In refusing to accept death, Anakin sacrifices his identity, loyalty, and conscience, leading to the deaths of children, his wife, and an attempt on his mentor's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. He transforms into a "zombie trapped in a machine," illustrating Becker's concept of the terminal point of [[anakin_skywalkers_transformation_and_death_denial | death denial]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. Becker explains that avoiding death by killing off parts of oneself leads to isolation and diminishment, becoming "as though dead" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

## Transcendence and Redemption

The Jedi's understanding of death is further demonstrated by Obi-Wan Kenobi's sacrifice on the Death Star <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. His duel with Vader suggests he was not trying to kill him, but rather offered himself as a sacrifice, showing an alternative to Vader's [[anakin_skywalkers_transformation_and_death_denial | death denial]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. Kenobi's claim, "If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you could possibly imagine," foreshadows his ability to transcend death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

This power is later revealed as the ability to commune with the Force after death, taught by Qui-Gon Jinn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. It is not conquering death in the traditional sense, but rather transcending it by becoming a Force ghost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. Even Anakin joins this form of immortality after his redemption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

The contrast between Anakin's and Luke's approaches to death is telling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. Anakin's confrontations with death resulted in indiscriminate killing, including his mother's avengers and even Padmé <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. Luke, however, is willing to give up his own life to avoid turning to the dark side and refuses to kill Vader when prompted by Darth Sidious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. This willingness to accept death is what fundamentally separates a Jedi from a Sith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

Anakin's redemption occurs when he finally takes a cue from his son and renounces his own life, thereby embracing the reality of death and conquering jaramarana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. The story of Anakin Skywalker illustrates how the denial of death can corrupt personalities, strip values, and drive violence and control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. Evil Empires, both in fiction and reality, owe their existence to the inability to accept mortality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. However, accepting the reality of death, as shown by Vader's redemption, can bring dignity, courage, and compassion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. It is never too late to come to terms with death, or risk succumbing to the Dark Side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

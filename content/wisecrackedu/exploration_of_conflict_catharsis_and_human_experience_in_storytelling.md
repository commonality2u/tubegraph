*One-Punch Man* is an anime that defies typical genre conventions by virtually eliminating drama [00:00:31]. The protagonist, Saitama, can defeat any enemy with a single punch [01:26:00], leading to a predictable outcome for almost every episode [00:00:32]. This unusual structure allows the show to offer a subtle commentary on where humanity is headed as a civilization and the critical role of conflict in both fictional narratives and human experience [00:00:45].

## Saitama's Predicament: A Life Without Conflict

Saitama, once a young man seeking purpose, found a love for hero work [01:00:00]. However, after three years, the thrill has vanished [01:15:00]. Despite claiming to be a "hero for fun," he no longer enjoys it because he has become overwhelmingly powerful [01:19:00]. This experience is likened to playing a game without challenge [01:33:00].

While boredom is a prevalent theme [01:48:00], the show's deeper focus is on imagining a world without conflict, thereby highlighting its importance not only to a fictional story but to human experience itself [01:50:00].

## The Indispensable Role of Conflict in Storytelling

Conventional narratives, whether horror, sitcom, or action, are fundamentally driven by conflict [02:06:00]. Screenwriting expert Robert McKee notes in his book *Story*, that "The music of story is conflict...as long as conflict is progressing and building in the story, it moves forward in time" [02:12:00]. Without conflict, characters lack motivation and purpose [02:23:00].

In typical stories, characters encounter obstacles that force them to change and grow, driving the narrative towards a climax [02:37:00]. For instance, in the original *Star Wars* trilogy, Luke Skywalker's development from an inexperienced youth to a hero is a result of overcoming numerous challenges, such as the death of Obi-Wan and the loss of his hand [02:54:00].

This kind of character development is absent in *One-Punch Man* [03:14:00]. Saitama is too powerful, decimating any conflict with ease and never experiencing the fear of defeat [03:20:00]. Consequently, he has nothing to strive for, and remains essentially the same throughout the series, even his training lacks progression [03:31:00].

## The Anti-Narrative and Deus Ex Machina

Since Saitama is immune to conflict, *One-Punch Man* episodes often shift focus to supporting characters, establishing their backstories and placing them in challenging situations [04:10:00]. Characters like Genos display classic character arcs, such as the wandering warrior seeking strength from a reluctant teacher to avenge past injustices [04:30:00]. Even villains, like Dr. Genus, have developed motivations for their actions [04:57:00].

However, Saitama's mundane motivations—being a hero "for fun" [05:21:00]—and the effortless acquisition of his powers [05:29:00] undermine the struggles of other characters [05:34:00]. Just as these supporting characters gain narrative traction, Saitama often intervenes, destroying the dramatic tension [05:53:00].

This repeated intervention makes Saitama a "human deus ex machina" [07:33:00] – a plot device where an external element unexpectedly solves a seemingly unsolvable problem [07:13:00]. This is shown when Saitama effortlessly defeats Vaccine Man [06:08:00] or when he renders Genos's self-sacrificing struggle against Mosquito Girl irrelevant by easily destroying the villain [06:17:00]. Such narrative bail-outs are typically avoided in creative writing [07:07:00].

## The Absence of Catharsis

When conflicts are resolved too easily, the narrative momentum is lost, and the audience is deprived of catharsis [07:43:00]. Catharsis, defined as the emotional release of repressed emotions [07:51:00], is crucial for audiences to connect emotionally with stories [07:57:00]. Viewers celebrate heroic victories and commiserate with defeats, leading to an emotional payoff at the story's climax [08:03:00].

Philosopher Richard Kearney, in "Narrating Pain," suggests that stories allow us to "repeat the past forward" by revisiting our own lives through characters' experiences [08:26:00]. We feel sympathy for Genos, who lost his family [08:35:00], and encouragement for the Mumen Rider, who struggles against a superior foe [08:43:00], because these experiences resonate with our own [08:51:00].

Cultural examples illustrate this concept:
*   Post-WWII Japan found emotional release watching wrestler Rikidozan defeat American "villains," addressing emotions associated with the war [09:09:00].
*   Kaiju movies like *Godzilla* served a similar function by depicting devastation akin to atomic bomb havoc [09:18:00].
*   Following 9/11, American cinema explored emotions related to terrorist attacks [09:28:00].

*One-Punch Man*, in contrast, provides "anti-catharsis" [09:44:00]. While visually similar to kaiju movies, Saitama's minimal effort in defeating threats prevents the audience from experiencing drama or emotional release [09:49:00]. The show intentionally frustrates the audience by priming them for an emotional payoff and then denying it [10:09:00]. This is exemplified when the Mumen Rider's heroic but ultimately futile struggle against the Sea King is dismissed with an anticlimactic comment [10:19:00].

## The Value of Hardship in Human Experience

Beyond comedy, the show highlights what is missing in a life devoid of conflict [11:04:00]. Japanese theorist Masahiro Morioka observed that civilization's drive to minimize pain and discomfort can drain value from life [11:10:00]. While pain reduction seems beneficial, Morioka argues that it causes us to "lose the opportunity of experiencing the joy of life that comes from encountering an unwanted situation and being forced to transform ourselves to find a new way of thinking and being..." [11:30:00].

Saitama's frustration stems from his inability to change and progress through failure and pain [12:08:00]. His first battle against Crablante had meaning because it required struggle [11:49:00]. His subsequent easy victories, like defeating Vaccine Man, bring frustration rather than triumph [12:17:00]. Without meaningful hardship, Saitama's life becomes devoid of purpose [12:30:00]. Just as a story needs conflict to progress, so does a human being [12:35:00].

This idea is reinforced when Saitama dismisses the Paradisers' manifesto, which advocates for "success with no effort," as "pretty boring" [12:47:00]. Morioka echoes this, questioning if people might "end up with losing sight of joy, and forgetting the meaning of life, in a society pervaded by pain reduction mechanisms and filled with pleasure" [13:02:00].

Ultimately, *One-Punch Man* serves as a warning through Saitama's unfulfilled existence: embrace your failures, pain, and [[Suffering and ethical selfunderstanding | suffering]], because without them, life lacks meaning [13:45:00].

The *Fallout* series, set in the 23rd century within an [[alternate_history_and_cold_war_fallout_lore | alternate reality]] where 1950s culture persisted and a global conflict erupted due to dwindling oil supplies in the 2050s, explores complex themes of society, culture, and propaganda after a nuclear war in 2077 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. As a goldmine for [[philosophical_critiques_of_society_and_government_in_fallout | philosophical analysis]], *Fallout* interrogates how different factions and forms of government emerge in the post-apocalyptic Wasteland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

## Modern Theories of International Relations

Beyond illustrating historical political theories, *Fallout* effectively explains modern theories of international relations through the interactions of its various factions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.

### Hegemonic Stability Theory

Caesar's Legion in *Fallout: New Vegas* aims to unite humanity under a dystopian banner where everyone is enslaved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. Though superficially modeled after the Roman Empire, Caesar's foreign policy reflects "hegemonic stability theory," which posits that peace is achieved when a single superpower intimidates other entities into behaving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. Caesar believes peace is only attainable once his Legion is the sole dominant faction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. In the game, this theory proves partially effective, as traders prefer Legion territory due to its safety from raiders, who have been eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. Every faction in *Fallout* essentially seeks to become the local hegemon, akin to a playground bully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

### Balance of Power

Another option to avoid total enslavement is a "balance of power" among factions, which makes war too costly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. For example, the New California Republic (NCR) has not invaded New Vegas because the cost would be too high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. The Boomers, like a post-apocalyptic Switzerland, maintain their independence by using constant artillery fire to protect their borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.

### Realist Model

Adherents to a "realist" model of international relations believe that each faction or state acts solely to ensure its own survival, viewing power as a zero-sum game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. Security is achieved by having more power than rivals, and peace is merely an uncertain ceasefire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. Alliances are fleeting and exist only to combat more powerful threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. This model, while present in the game, is debatable in its effectiveness and can preclude cooperation and trust between factions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>.

## Philosophical Dilemmas of Governance

The stakes of diplomatic relationships in *Fallout* are consistently high, involving life-and-death struggles for humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>. Players are often confronted with moral choices: should the NCR resort to unethical means for security and democracy, or should technology be used for humanitarian aid versus a devastating virus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>?

### The Brotherhood of Steel

The Brotherhood of Steel represents one response to the technological dilemma: a secretive order that hoards advanced technology in heavily armored bases to prevent it from falling into the "wrong hands" â€“ meaning anyone but themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. They are willing to go to war with any faction possessing advanced tech, raising the question of whether they themselves can be trusted with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

### Caesar's Legion and Technology

In contrast to the Brotherhood, Caesar's Legion rejects technology, except for tools that enhance killing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. Caesar believes technology makes people weak and dependent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. Despite this, his brutal, totalitarian state still inflicts immense suffering without advanced tech, suggesting technology may not be solely to blame for societal ills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.

### The Problem of "Security Logic"

According to some philosophers like Daniel Callahan, "security logic" is totalizing, meaning there's no limit to the terrible actions people will justify in the name of survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. As Benjamin Franklin famously stated, "Those who surrender freedom for security will not have, nor do they deserve, either one" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

### The Enclave

The Enclave, remnants of the U.S. government, exemplifies this "security logic" to an extreme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. President John Henry Eden, an artificial intelligence, declares that details of his election are withheld "in the interest of national security" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>. The Enclave is willing to exterminate all "mutated riff raff" to "save" what they consider "real" humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. This extreme measure is a direct manifestation of how far a group will go to maintain its perceived security.

### Mr. House and Autocracy

In *New Vegas*, if the player allies with Mr. House, the ending depicts him running the city "his way, a despotic vision of pre-War glory" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. The Wasteland's chaos can be tamed, but at the cost of personal freedoms and democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. Mr. House explicitly disdains freedom, advocating for "firm control in the hands of a technological and economic visionary" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>. Historically, dictators often manufacture crises and exaggerate threats to justify repressive laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>; *Fallout*'s world offers no shortage of such exploitable crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>.

## Humanity's Enduring Flaws

*Fallout*'s central theme, that "War never changes," could equally be interpreted as "humanity never changes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. Beyond the mutated creatures, the most terrifying aspect of the Wasteland is its rehashed history of regrettable human governance, including slavery-obsessed Romans, Orwellian dictatorships, and genocidal governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>. The series constantly interrogates human society and government, suggesting that history, indeed, repeats itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.

Harvey Dent, the District Attorney of Gotham City, plays a pivotal symbolic role in *The Dark Knight* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. Initially presented as a beacon of hope and [[the_concept_of_justice_and_morality_in_the_dark_knight | order]], his tragic transformation into Two-Face encapsulates the film's exploration of [[duality_in_batman_the_dark_knight | duality]] and the fragility of societal ideals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

## The White Knight

Before his transformation, Harvey Dent is seen as the "White Knight," a figure Batman hopes can replace him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. His campaign slogan, “I believe in Harvey Dent,” carries religious connotations, presenting him as a "Christ figure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. This imagery suggests a character who might sacrifice himself for an ideal or for the good of humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. Dent represents [[chaos_versus_order_in_the_dark_knight | order]] through idealism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

He carries a double-sided coin, symbolizing his rigid adherence to [[the_concept_of_justice_and_morality_in_the_dark_knight | justice]], [[the_concept_of_justice_and_morality_in_the_dark_knight | morality]], and [[chaos_versus_order_in_the_dark_knight | order]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Dent's belief that he makes "my own luck" underscores his commitment to control and predictability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

## Transformation to Two-Face

The Joker’s ultimate act of corruption is the downfall of Harvey Dent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. Following an explosion where his love interest Rachel Dawes is killed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>, Dent is scarred and changes his name to Two-Face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. This transformation visually embodies [[duality_in_batman_the_dark_knight | duality]] with his two-sided face and coin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

After becoming Two-Face, his coin is scarred on one side, transforming it into a "regular coin" with a 50/50 chance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. This change signifies that Dent has been "infected by the Joker's vision," where "the only morality in a cruel world is chance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. He descends into a state where cosmic anarchy rules his reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

## Symbol of a False Ideal

The film presents a "daring and modern interpretation of the Christ image" through Dent, showing a Christ without [[themes_of_resurrection_truth_versus_lies_and_doubling_in_the_dark_knight_rises | resurrection]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. He becomes a "false Ideal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>, but one that must be upheld as a beacon of hope for mankind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. Batman takes on the responsibility to uphold this facade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>, maintaining [[chaos_versus_order_in_the_dark_knight | order]] by sacrificing his own reputation for the greater good of the city's morale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.

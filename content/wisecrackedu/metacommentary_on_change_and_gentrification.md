*South Park* Season 19, a show at the top of its game after almost two decades, shifted to a serialized narrative, telling an overarching story from episode to episode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. This season is considered highly intelligent, chronicling the small Colorado town's significant social changes, introducing a new central character, and commenting on America’s current political climate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. One of its most clever aspects is its layered commentary, addressing both modern social conditions and the show itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## Meta-Commentary on the Show's Evolution
The season begins with Principal Victoria's firing due to a "hot cosby" incident, making way for a new appointee tasked with making South Park Elementary "a more progressive place that fits in with today's times" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>. This dialogue serves as a meta-commentary on *South Park* the show, questioning if its signature vulgar sensibility can survive in a politically correct world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>. The town's rapid changes can be interpreted as the show itself facing transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>. Characters like the Mayor and Officer Barbrady explicitly discuss how "the times changing so fast" makes some feel like a "relic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>.

## Neoliberalism: The Unifying Critique
The season's plotline involving PC culture, gentrification, and advertising might seem disparate, but it's tied together by the concept of neoliberalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>.

Neoliberalism is an economic ideology emphasizing personal freedoms and market-based solutions for societal problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>. Philosopher Henry Giroux outlines its tenets:
*   Consumerism is the primary duty of a citizen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>.
*   Individual freedoms outweigh public freedoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.
*   All public social issues are addressed at a private level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.

This framework neatly connects gentrification, PC culture, and advertising within the show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>.

### Gentrification and PC Culture as Marketable Brands
The season highlights how neoliberalism's goal is to make everything marketable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>. A key line from the season posits: "What is PC but a verbal form of gentrification? Spruce everything up, get rid of all the ugliness, in order to create a false sense of paradise? Only one thing can actually live in that world: ads" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>.

Gentrification, for example, is presented as the free market's solution to neglected neighborhoods, where developers profit by selling overpriced goods without addressing underlying poverty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:00">[03:23:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>. Even diversity and multiculturalism are co-opted to serve profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>. *South Park* suggests that advertisers manipulate PC culture to gentrify areas, turning "otherness and diversity" into marketable brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>.

The show makes this explicit, noting how "ads are using PC for their own games" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>. These "ads" evolve into human form, assimilating or destroying everything in their path, often subtly and behind the scenes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>. This creates anxiety: are friends, family, or even TV shows merely sponsored content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:00">[04:33:00]</a>? Advertising's danger lies in its ability to conceal reality and distract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>. Ultimately, only "reduced versions of ourselves, of cultures, that can be neatly packaged and sold" can thrive in this world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>. This includes "cultures of social acceptance that are more of a brand than actual tolerance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:00">[05:02:00]</a>.

While *South Park* does not argue against diversity, it critiques how neoliberalism employs "cooptation," absorbing identities and diversity to make multiculturalism a trendy, purchasable brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:00">[05:29:00]</a>. For South Park town to advance economically, it must adopt these "marks of tolerance" to attract businesses and residents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>.

### Whole Foods as a Symbol
Whole Foods becomes a central symbol for the town's progressive changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>. Its presence is directly linked to the town's newfound "gay kids" and "police-free environment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:00">[06:14:00]</a>. Whole Foods transcends being merely a place to buy organic food, transforming into "a set of lofty ideals that we buy into every time we purchase that $6 bottle of Asparagus Water" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22:00">[06:22:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:00">[06:26:00]</a>.

The metacommentary becomes explicit as characters like Craig and Tweek receive money for being perceived as gay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:39:00">[06:39:00]</a>. This conveys that "the spectacle of inclusion is good for business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:00">[06:42:00]</a>. The season questions whether this affirmation is for the characters or for the viewer, as the "spectacle of inclusion is sold just like any other commodity" in the neoliberal economy, offering a "healthy dose of self righteousness" in return for cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:00">[06:46:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:53:00">[06:53:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:58:00">[06:58:00]</a>.

## The Danger of "Pleasant" Politics
Slavoj Zizek's theory suggests that modern political systems can be more dangerous because they are "just so dang pleasant" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03:00">[07:03:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:00">[07:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>. It's easier to identify clear villains, unlike the "pleasant facade" that hides motivations in PC culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:13:00">[07:13:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>. Zizek describes political correctness as "just a form of self-discipline which doesn’t really allow you to overcome [racism, misogyny, and so on.]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42:00">[07:42:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>. If PC culture is dangerous, it's because it merely offers "a nice paint job over the same old discriminatory reality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>.

There is no longer a clear villain to oppose, only "self-satisfying acts of social justice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>. The "progressive" world of South Park involves people spending hundreds at Whole Foods but feeling good by donating a token dollar to charity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:00">[08:11:00]</a>. This "Whole Food style charity" represents a marriage between inaction and action, where change becomes a commodity, and criticism is disarmed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:25:00">[08:25:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:32:00">[08:32:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40:00">[08:40:00]</a>.

Zizek's concept of "inter-passivity" denotes doing things *not* to achieve something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:58:00">[08:58:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>. Political correctness, in this view, is about "changing something all the time so that, globally, things will remain the same" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:04:00">[09:04:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:10:00">[09:10:00]</a>. *South Park* directly attacks this hypocrisy, revealing the town's true feelings about the poor when the homeless surround Whole Foods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:00">[09:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:18:00">[09:18:00]</a>.

### Charity Cannibalism and Narcissism
The show targets economic hypocrisy and how multiculturalism becomes a "badge to wear" rather than a genuine political project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:27:00">[09:27:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:00">[09:30:00]</a>. The town's residents remain ignorant but feign knowledge of other cultures for perceived benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:43:00">[09:43:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:46:00">[09:46:00]</a>. The metacommentary questions if token inclusion leads to true inclusivity or merely boosts ratings without genuine cultural understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:00">[10:04:00]</a>.

The show suggests that this display of tolerance is more about "making white liberals feel good" than genuinely helping marginalized people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:17:00">[10:17:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:21:00">[10:21:00]</a>. The PC fraternity house, despite its rhetoric, is entirely white <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:35:00">[10:35:00]</a>. Their passion to help the disabled is depicted as a cover for selfish motives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:41:00">[10:41:00]</a>.

French philosopher Jean Baudrillard's concept of "charity cannibalism" is invoked, where "Other people's destitution becomes our adventure playground" to "secure the conditions of reproduction of the catastrophe market" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:45:00">[10:45:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:50:00">[10:50:00]</a>. This implies that when real tragedies are scarce, new ones are invented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:59:00">[10:59:00]</a>. PC Principal's interaction with Jimmy, a disabled person who doesn't want his help, exemplifies this, as he seeks out Nathan, who fits his narrative of a helpless victim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:13:00">[11:13:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:18:00">[11:18:00]</a>. This protector-victim dynamic disempowers the victim, whose validation depends on their helplessness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:40:00">[11:40:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:44:00">[11:44:00]</a>.

Zizek argues that this form of PC culture is more intolerant because it accepts everyone only if they fit into a consumable type of difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:47:00">[11:47:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:52:00">[11:52:00]</a>. The example of Caitlyn Jenner, despite complex realities, is simplified and plastered on *Vanity Fair* because "It’s simple, it’s consumable, it sells" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:58:00">[11:58:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:11:00">[12:11:00]</a>.

*South Park* criticizes the deep-rooted narcissism behind both political extremes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:08:00">[13:08:00]</a>. Buying into the PC brand is often about self-gratification rather than enacting real change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:14:00">[13:14:00]</a>. Randy's charity donations, for example, mutate into providing iPads to children in developing countries to protect the fragile egos of people like him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:19:00">[13:19:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:26:00">[13:26:00]</a>. This "Whole Foods activism" represents selling out to the system while making meaningless gestures for self-worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:39:00">[13:39:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:41:00">[13:41:00]</a>.

Cartman, a known narcissist, adopts PC culture to protect his ego <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:46:00">[13:46:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:52:00">[13:52:00]</a>. Conversely, Mr. Garrison's "fuck-em-all-to-death" attitude, a nationalist version of the "special snowflake" complex, is fueled by a narcissistic obsession with himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:59:00">[13:59:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:03:00">[14:03:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:18:00">[14:18:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:24:00">[14:24:00]</a>. Neoliberalism, by promoting a consumerism centered on the individual, fuels this mass self-obsession, resulting in a "cult of victimhood" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:32:00">[14:32:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:34:00">[14:34:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:46:00">[14:46:00]</a>.

## Conclusion
*South Park* doesn't suggest that all advocates for safe spaces or patriots are extreme caricatures, but rather that reasonable logic has been "caught up in a whirlwind of societal bullshit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:10:00">[15:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:13:00">[15:13:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:16:00">[15:16:00]</a>. The creators likely don't hate all aspects of PC culture, but rather its shallow, mainstream versions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:22:00">[15:22:00]</a>.

PC Principal's redemption, where he murders "inauthentic" PC bros after realizing he's been manipulated by ads, highlights this nuance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:33:00">[15:33:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:36:00">[15:36:00]</a>. The creators acknowledge their own privileged position, hinting at the difficulty of navigating a changing society without appearing bigoted while avoiding "the trappings of phony inclusion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:42:00">[15:42:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:46:00">[15:46:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:56:00">[15:56:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:59:00">[15:59:00]</a>. *South Park* must navigate the current political climate, and as a TV show, it needs ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:29:00">[16:29:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:33:00">[16:33:00]</a>.

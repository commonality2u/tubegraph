South Park, after nearly two decades on air, reached the top of its game with Season 19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Unlike earlier seasons, Season 19 adopted a serialized narrative, weaving an overarching story across episodes, a concept toyed with in Season 18 but not as comprehensively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. This season is considered arguably the smartest, chronicling South Park's social changes, introducing a new central character, and commenting on America’s political climate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Layered Commentary and Self-Reflection
A key aspect of Season 19 is its layered commentary, which not only addresses modern social conditions but also reflects on the show itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. The season begins with the firing of Principal Victoria, leading to the appointment of a new principal aiming to make South Park Elementary "a more progressive place that fits in with today's times" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This dialogue serves as a direct [[political_correctness_and_its_critique_in_south_park | meta-commentary on South Park the show]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

The core question raised is whether [[south_parks_approach_to_social_satire | South Park’s signature vulgar sensibility]] can survive in a world increasingly focused on [[political_correctness_and_its_critique_in_south_park | political correctness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. The town's rapid changes are interpreted as a meta-commentary on the show facing its own evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. Characters like Officer Barbrady and Mr. Garrison, who embodies "unbridled profanity," symbolize the "relics" of another time, struggling to adapt to the changing landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

## Neoliberalism, Gentrification, and PC Culture
The season ties together seemingly disparate themes: gentrification, [[political_correctness_and_its_critique_in_south_park | PC culture]], and advertising, through the lens of neoliberalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. Neoliberalism, an economic ideology, emphasizes personal freedoms and market solutions for societal problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. Its tenets include [[consumerism_and_social_commentary_in_south_park | consumerism]] as a civic duty, individual freedoms over public freedoms, and addressing social issues privately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

The show suggests that [[political_correctness_and_its_critique_in_south_park | PC culture]] is a "verbal form of gentrification," sprucing things up and removing "ugliness" to create a "false sense of paradise" where only "ads" can truly thrive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. Neoliberalism's goal is to make everything marketable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. Even diversity and multiculturalism are co-opted, becoming "marketable brands" to sell products and services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

The series explicitly highlights how ads are using [[political_correctness_and_its_critique_in_south_park | PC culture]] for their own gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. The ads are personified as an "inhuman force of [[south_park_and_capitalism | neoliberal capitalism]]" that assimilates or destroys everything in its path, often unnoticed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. This raises anxiety about whether friends, family, or even beloved TV shows are just "ads or sponsored content" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. The danger of ads lies in their ability to obscure reality and distract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

## The Illusion of Inclusion and Critique of PC Culture
South Park does not argue against diversity itself, but rather against neoliberalism's process of "cooptation," which absorbs identities and diversity to turn multiculturalism into a "trendy brand" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. The town's adoption of "marks of tolerance" (like having "gay kids" or a "police-free environment" after Whole Foods arrives) serves to attract businesses and residents, not necessarily to foster genuine inclusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

Whole Foods becomes a symbol of lofty ideals that people "buy into" when purchasing overpriced items, effectively turning social values into a commodity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. The show depicts people showering characters like Craig and Tweek with money for being gay, highlighting that the "spectacle of inclusion is good for business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. This "spectacle of inclusion" is sold as a commodity, providing consumers with a "healthy dose of self-righteousness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

Slovenian theorist Slavoj Zizek's ideas are invoked, suggesting that modern political systems are dangerous because they are "pleasanter," making it harder to identify a clear "bad guy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. [[political_correctness_and_its_critique_in_south_park | Political correctness]] is described as a "form of self-discipline" that doesn't truly overcome issues like racism or misogyny; instead, it's a "nice paint job over the same old discriminatory reality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

In this "progressive" world, consumers spend excessively at places like Whole Foods but feel good by donating a token dollar to charity, a "token gesture" that washes away guilt without addressing underlying problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. This "Whole Food style charity" represents a marriage of inaction and action, where criticism is disarmed because one can be a "good [[south_park_and_capitalism | neoliberal consumer]]" while feeling like they are fighting the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. Zizek's concept of "inter-passivity" applies: "Let’s go on changing something all the time so that, globally, things will remain the same" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

South Park further targets economic hypocrisy by revealing the town's true feelings about the poor when Whole Foods is surrounded by the homeless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. Multiculturalism becomes a "badge to wear" rather than a genuine political project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. The show criticizes both individuals and other media for "token inclusion," questioning if it truly leads to inclusivity or merely boosts ratings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. This "show of tolerance" is often more about making white liberals "feel good" than genuinely helping marginalized people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

## Narcissism and "Charity Cannibalism"
The show argues that behind both political extremes—[[impact_of_2016_presidential_election_on_south_park | Trump-esque conservatism]] and liberal arts activism—lies a "deep rooted narcissism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. Much of buying into the [[political_correctness_and_its_critique_in_south_park | PC brand]] is about self-gratification rather than real change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>. Randy's charity morphs into one where children in developing countries receive iPads to protect the "fragile egos of people like Randy" from [[trolling_and_internet_culture_in_south_park | trolls]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>. This "Whole Foods activism" is about being a "sell-out to the system" while making meaningless gestures for self-worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>.

Characters like Cartman adopt [[political_correctness_and_its_critique_in_south_park | PC culture]] and "safe space" language to protect his ego, consistent with his narcissistic and pathological liar traits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>. Conversely, Mr. Garrison's "fuck-em-all-to-death attitude" and American exceptionalism are portrayed as a nationalist "special snowflake" complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>. Neoliberalism fuels a culture of [[consumerism_and_social_commentary_in_south_park | consumerism]] centered on the individual, leading to a "cult of victimhood" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>.

French philosopher Jean Baudrillard's concept of "charity cannibalism" is introduced: "Other people's destitution becomes our adventure playground," where new tragedies are invented when none exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. This is exemplified when PC Principal seeks out a victim (Nathan) who fits his narrative, validating the victim by virtue of their helplessness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.

## South Park's Self-Awareness and Future
While acknowledging that not everyone advocating for safe spaces or loving their country fits these extreme caricatures, South Park argues that "reasonable logic has been caught up in a whirlwind of societal bullshit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>. The creators don't hate every aspect of [[political_correctness_and_its_critique_in_south_park | PC culture]], but rather its "shallow versions propagated in the mainstream media" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>.

The show demonstrates self-awareness through PC Principal's redemption arc, as he goes on a rampage against "inauthentic" [[political_correctness_and_its_critique_in_south_park | PC bros]] after realizing he's been manipulated by ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>. Creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker also explicitly acknowledge their "privileged position" as "two privileged straight white boys who have theirs laughs about things we've never had to deal with" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>. The finale concludes that PC Principal is here to stay, underscoring the ongoing challenge of navigating society without being a bigot while avoiding "phony inclusion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>.

Looking ahead to Season 20, the question remains whether South Park will fully yield to societal pressures or double down on its "off-color roots" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>. The show must navigate the current political climate, and like any TV show, it needs ads, which also extends to the production itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>.

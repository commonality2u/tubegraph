At first glance, [[analysis_of_the_purge_movie_themes | *The Purge*]] seems like a typical horror film featuring a simple concept, questionable acting, and violent carnage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. The core concept of the film is that "Any and all crime will be legal for 12 continuous hours" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. However, its true terror lies in its ability to highlight dehumanizing policies within society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. With a closer look, [[analysis_of_the_purge_movie_themes | *The Purge*]] can be seen as a [[social_critique_using_popular_media | commentary]] on sociopolitical existence, serving as a thinly veiled allegory for corrupt politics, rigged economic systems, and a culture of violence in America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Ritual and Reaffirmation

[[analysis_of_the_purge_movie_themes | *The Purge*]] shares similarities with ritualistic festivals such as Mardi Gras, Carnival, or Halloween <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. While the Purge involves more murder and theft compared to dancing and feasting, these events all represent designated times when people can violate social norms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. Rather than undermining the power of law and religion, such events actually reaffirm these social structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

The New Founding Fathers of America (NFFA), who sanction the Purge ritual, are not challenged by it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. Instead, the night's chaos makes people long for the return of law the next day, leading to a "Purge hangover" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Just as Carnival makes people accept Christian tenets, the Purge ensures acceptance of the ruling social ideology, which is best described as Neoliberalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

## Neoliberalism and Disposability

Neoliberalism's core idea is that the government should prioritize policies that promote the free flow of goods and protect corporate interests, rather than interfering with the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Each film in [[analysis_of_the_purge_movie_themes | *The Purge*]] series reflects a different facet of this neoliberal economy, with characters' responses to the Purge highlighting their respective economic classes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

### Class Perspectives

*   The original *Purge* (2013) focuses on an upper-middle-class suburban family, the Sandins, who experience issues such as a homeless infiltrator, jealous neighbors, and family conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Their home security system, paid for by the fear generated by the Purge, shields them from the violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.
*   *The Purge: Anarchy* (2014) delves into the economic struggles of a working-class family, exemplified by Eva Sanchez, who cannot afford medicine for her father <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. The inner city is depicted as rife with Purge traps, gangs, and abductions for perverse games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. The comparison between the settings of the first two films can be seen as a metaphor for "white flight," where the retreat of upper-class individuals from cities exposes those left behind to disproportionate crime, homelessness, poverty, and Purging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
*   *The Purge: Election Year* (2016) explores the impact of the Purge on small business owners, such as Joe, whose Purge insurance premiums are inexplicably raised, forcing him to protect his deli with inadequate defenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. This highlights a common issue when government checks are absent, allowing insurance companies unchecked power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. Joe ultimately loses his life defending his business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

These examples collectively illustrate the injustices not only of the Purge but also of the broader economic system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. Those who prosper under neoliberalism benefit from the Purge, while those disadvantaged by it suffer further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

### The Politics of Disposability in Action

[[critique_of_societal_systems_in_the_purge | *The Purge*]] exposes how neoliberal economics fosters a "politics of disposability," a concept explained by thinkers Henry Giroux and Brad Evans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. In the original film, suburbanites view groups of people as superfluous and disposable, referring to a homeless stranger as "swine" and "filth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. James Sandin justifies torturing his house guest as a means to save his family, only seeing him as fully human when the stranger volunteers to sacrifice himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.

In *The Purge: Anarchy*, Papa Sanchez is forced to "sell" his life to the wealthy for a sum of money to ease his family's economic hardship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. His life becomes more valuable as a disposable object than as an actual person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. Wealthy individuals engage in their own form of Purging by buying poor and sick people to kill them in safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

Giroux and Evans argue that people become disposable under an economic system characterized by healthcare privatization, bank deregulation, and the erosion of government safety nets like social security and welfare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. The NFFA's legalization of murder aims to decrease the poor population, thereby reducing government spending on welfare, healthcare, and housing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. The Purge's rationale for shutting down medical and police services aligns with this policy goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. This elimination is justified by the banner of economic growth, sacrificing the elderly, infirm, poor, and "non-contributors" so the economy can grow unhindered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. This parallels the "slow death" experienced in the real neoliberal economy, where people die due to unaffordable medication, poor nutrition, and exposure to pollution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

## Historical Justification: Malthusian Theory

The justification for [[analysis_of_the_purge_movie_themes | *The Purge*]] traces back to Thomas Robert Malthus's 1798 book, *Essay on the Principle of Population* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. Malthus argued that a growing population would outpace production, leading to massive food shortages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. His proposed solution was to employ laws that kept birth rates low and death rates high through famine, disease, and wars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. Caleb Warrens, head of the NFFA in *The Purge: Election Year*, echoes this by stating that not everyone can "have" because there's "not enough to go around" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.

However, Friedrich Engels critiqued Malthus, arguing that the issue wasn't population growth but an economic system that devalued workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. Engels believed Malthus's model was merely an excuse to mistreat poor people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. The NFFA's over-the-top Purge ceremonies demonstrate that their motivations extend beyond simple economic concerns, taking the mistreatment of the poor to an extreme level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.

## The Purge's Genius as Social Critique

While neoliberal policies can be abstract, the genius of [[analysis_of_the_purge_movie_themes | *The Purge*]] lies in its visceral depiction of how this economic system generates predatory profits through "murder night" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. The privileged profit immensely from weapon sales, insurance, private bodyguards, and home security systems, while the poor struggle merely to survive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.

## The Audience as "Murder Tourist"

[[analysis_of_the_purge_movie_themes | *The Purge*]] movies offer a glimpse into a dystopian future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. However, most of the main characters don't enjoy Purging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. The *Rick and Morty* episode about Purging provides an interesting counterpoint, where Rick's sick enjoyment of brutal violence may say more about the audience than the films <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. Sitting through any of *The Purge* movies puts viewers in Rick's position, as they excitingly wait for shocking and new content in each sequel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. The success of the films may reveal a simple truth: people enjoy watching violent content, sometimes just because it feels good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

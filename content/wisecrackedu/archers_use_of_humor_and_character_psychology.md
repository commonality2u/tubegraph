From: [[wisecrackedu]] <br/> 

*Archer*, starring "Sterling Malory Archer" and his "snarky, foul-mouthed spies," has sustained eight seasons of comedy through drastic reboots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. The show feels familiar despite taking absurd leaps that would typically end other series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. *Archer* achieves its success by inverting the rules, characters, and narrative tropes of the spy genre, while employing sound and [[language_and_communication_in_archer | language]] gags to create a distinct comedic style that delves into deeper character psychology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## [[parody_of_the_spy_genre_in_archer | Parody of the Spy Genre Tropes]]

*Archer* openly borrows thematic elements from James Bond films <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. These comedic elements go beyond shallow nods to 007 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. Bond films often contrast the "freewheeling titular stud" with "stuffy, boring rule-makers" like M <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. This dynamic became important during a period sociologist Thomas Andrae identified as a "crisis of masculinity" in America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. During this time, male desire for autonomy was displaced by pressures of corporate desk jobs, leading many men to feel like "alienated but conforming employee[s] of a large corporate bureaucracy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. Spy thrillers, with James Bond embodying ideals of independence and individualism, served as a perfect form of escapism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

### Bureaucracy vs. Glamour

Unlike the fantastical reality of Bond, who reportedly didn't have to prepare expense reports, *Archer* exploits the humor of unglamorous espionage bureaucracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. Mindless paperwork frequently jeopardizes Archer's spy life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. The show juxtaposes its fantastical action with the mundane realities of office life, creating comic effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. Archer often escapes bureaucratic consequences only through the forgiveness of his boss and mother, Mallory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. Later, when the agency transitions to a private investigation firm, Archer must suffer the indignity of working for the Figgis Agency under Cyril, who is the only one eligible for a PI license <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. While Cyril thrives in this bureaucratic spy world, Archer's "swashbuckling antics" are typically counterproductive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

### Deconstructing Hyper-masculinity

Archer serves as the ultimate James Bond [[parody_of_the_spy_genre_in_archer | parody]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. He exemplifies Bond's known qualities but takes them to an unromantic, logical conclusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. Like Bond, Archer is wild and untamed, relying on drinking, fighting, womanizing, cars, and guns to affirm his manliness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

However, the show mocks how Bond's hyper-masculinity is used to sell products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. Archer's car, unlike Bond's fetishized Aston Martins, is a birthday gift from his mother, presented like a "Super Sweet Sixteen" surprise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. This adolescent feel is heightened by the car causing Archer an embarrassing erection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. His "masculine power" is repeatedly "yanked away by his more powerful mother," who confiscates the car days later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

While Bond is cinema's famous seducer, Archer is also hyper-sexual, constantly hiring sex workers, sleeping with colleagues, and propositioning most women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. Yet, unlike Bond's legendary prowess, Archer's is notably "less than that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. His sex life frequently results in STDs and paying for abortions, contrasting with Bond's seemingly consequence-free encounters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

### Physical Consequences of the Spy Life

The show takes the health effects of the Bondian lifestyle to a logical extreme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. While Bond enjoys liquor, Archer's substance use is superhuman, including chugging germicide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. His drinking contributes to him getting breast cancer, a stereotypically feminine disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. Even becoming a father is a twisted form of emasculation for Archer, as Lana secretly uses his frozen sperm without his permission or knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.

Another health ramification of his secret agent life is tinnitus, or hearing loss, caused by constant gunfire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. The show even makes tinnitus a recurring "pet cause," with characters attending an annual fundraiser for the American Tinnitus Association <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. This again subverts the "bulletproof James Bondian fantasy" by confronting Archer with the "bleakest realities of his mortal body" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.

## [[language_and_communication_in_archer | Language and Communication as Humor and Insight]]

Communications scholar Ian Dawe argues that Archer's tinnitus is more than a gag; it's central to the show's preoccupation with sound and [[language_and_communication_in_archer | language]], which both generate laughs and provide insight into character psychology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. Dawe's study of seasons 3 and 4 found that sound and language-specific references (puns, foreign language, tinnitus-inducing gunfire) occurred approximately once every two minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. These [[language_and_communication_in_archer | language]] jokes are often used at inopportune moments, similar to how mundane office politics contrast with action sequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

### The "Lana!" Gag: A Call for Attention

A simple, ongoing gag is Archer's loud calling out to Lana, even when she's nearby <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. Dawe suggests this mimics a baby calling for its mother, reflecting Archer's unfulfilled need for comfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. His increasingly louder appeals signal his inability to control his demand for attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. This gag eventually spreads to other characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. Dawe notes that "it is very important in this show for characters to be heard," but also that they "not be heard too quickly," bringing up themes of "power, demand, control and psychological repression" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

### "Phrasing!": Miscommunication and Control

Archer's classic "phrasing" joke is a prime example of what Freud called "double entendre," relying on a sexual meaning despite an alternative, non-sexual one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. Freud believed such jokes released nervous energy from repressed sexual or aggressive desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. This is particularly significant when Archer directs the joke at his mother, hinting at an Oedipal complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. By choosing to miscommunicate and misinterpret, Archer often derails conversations, ensuring the speaker "won't be heard at all" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. This tactic becomes his preferred way of hijacking dialogue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>, and the joke eventually becomes so ubiquitous that it falls out of fashion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. Archer's anxiety over its plummeting popularity highlights how crucial these "attention-grabbing antics" are to his identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.

### Voicemail Ruses: Undermining Authority

Archer also avoids listening through elaborate voicemail ruses, tricking his mother into thinking she's speaking to him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. Mallory has entire conversations with his prerecorded voice before realizing she's been duped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. This "hilarious, if juvenile" tactic allows Archer to temporarily reclaim power and undermine Mallory's dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.

### Struggling with Language Rules and Idioms

Just as he struggles with ISIS's Human Resources department, Archer often struggles with the rules of [[language_and_communication_in_archer | language]] itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>. These linguistic restraints, like bureaucratic ones, prevent him from living the badass spy narrative he envisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. In "Heart of Archness," as the "king of the pirates," he finds it impossible to address his subjects without relying on idioms, to his frustration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. This demonstrates Archer chafing against [[language_and_communication_in_archer | language]] rules, mirroring his resistance to bureaucracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.

### Failed Witty Lines and Obscure [[cultural_references_and_their_role_in_archer | Cultural References]]

Unlike James Bond's pithy one-liners, Archer is not so gifted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>, frequently regretting his failure to come up with the perfect witty line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. *Archer* [[parody_of_the_spy_genre_in_archer | parodies]] Bond by turning the expectation of funny innuendos into a chore where Archer still falls short <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.

Archer's [[language_and_communication_in_archer | language]] also isolates him when he tries to connect through his favorite obscure [[cultural_references_and_their_role_in_archer | cultural references]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>. Despite constantly grasping to be heard and impress with "brainy call-outs," he rarely receives affirmation, experiencing the "shame" of his thoughtful references falling flat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.

## Archer's Character Psychology

Much of *Archer*'s humor, despite its fantastical action, derives from the [[language_and_communication_in_archer | linguistic communications]] between characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.

### Man-Child Archetype

Archer's lingering "adolescent sense of being an outsider," formed during his fifteen years at boarding school, is perfectly expressed through his over-enthusiasm for coining group slang and his wildly obscure [[cultural_references_and_their_role_in_archer | pop culture references]] that inevitably fall flat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>. He embodies the "perennial secret agent struggle" born from the 1950s masculine anxiety about being "cogs in the corporate machine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>, but often appears as a "man-child" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

### Oedipal Complex and Maternal Dominance

Archer's relationship with his mother, Mallory, is a significant psychological element. Her dominance frequently undermines his supposed masculine power, as seen with the car gift and confiscation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. His "phrasing" jokes directed at her hint at an Oedipal complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>, while his voicemail ruses are juvenile attempts to temporarily reclaim power over her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.

### Attention-Seeking and Insecurity

Archer's frequent, loud calls to Lana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a> and his efforts to impose his "phrasing" joke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a> reveal his inability to control his demand for attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. His anxiety over the joke's declining popularity further confirms how important these attention-grabbing antics are to his identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. His repeated failures to deliver witty lines and his unappreciated [[cultural_references_and_their_role_in_archer | cultural references]] also highlight an underlying insecurity and desire to impress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>.

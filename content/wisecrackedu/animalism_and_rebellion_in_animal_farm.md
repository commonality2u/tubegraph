[[summary_of_animal_farm_by_george_orwell | George Orwell's *Animal Farm*]] begins with the animals living on Manor Farm under the oppression of Farmer Jones [00:00:19]. The catalyst for change is an old boar named Ol' Major, who shares a "trippy ass dream" with the other animals [00:00:24].

## The Spark of Rebellion

Ol' Major preaches that men are the only creatures on the farm that consume everything but produce nothing [00:00:33]. He asserts that the only path to "righteous livin'" for the animals is to confront and "stomping their two legged oppressors" [00:00:36]. This call to action is the genesis of the rebellion [00:00:41]. Ol' Major's rhetoric echoes the end of the Communist Manifesto, specifically the line, "The communists openly declare that their ends can be attained only by the forcible overthrow of all existing social conditions" [00:03:09]. His character is an [[allegory_of_the_soviet_union_in_animal_farm | allegory]] for Karl Marx, the original communist theorist, and Vladimir Lenin, the architect of the revolution [00:02:55].

## The Animals' Uprising

One night, the animals execute their plan, rising up and expelling Farmer Jones and his men from the farm [00:00:45]. Taking control of their own land, they rename the farm "Animal Farm" [00:00:51]. This revolt in Chapter 2 of the book parallels the Bolshevik Revolution of October 1917, where the Tsar is represented by Mr. Jones [00:03:18].

Later, when humans attempt to retake the farm in Chapter 4, the animals fiercely defend their independence, driving them away [00:01:11]. This event mirrors the civil war between Russian loyalists and Bolsheviks in 1918 [00:03:28].

## The Principles of Animalism

After securing their freedom, the animals establish a new system called Animalism [00:00:56]. Its core principle, or "main verse," is declared as "All animals are equal" [00:00:59].

Leadership initially falls to two pigs, [[character_analysis_of_napoleon_and_snowball | Napoleon]] and [[character_analysis_of_napoleon_and_snowball | Snowball]] [00:01:02]. While [[character_analysis_of_napoleon_and_snowball | Snowball]] advocates for building a windmill, [[character_analysis_of_napoleon_and_snowball | Napoleon]] opposes it, leading to a power struggle [00:01:20]. [[character_analysis_of_napoleon_and_snowball | Napoleon]] eventually chases [[character_analysis_of_napoleon_and_snowball | Snowball]] off the farm [00:01:25], and another pig, Squealer, falsely declares [[character_analysis_of_napoleon_and_snowball | Snowball]] a traitor [00:01:31].

## The Corruption of Animalism

Over time, the ideals of Animalism begin to erode. The initial Seven Commandments of Animalism are gradually altered [00:01:51]. The pigs, needing goods they cannot produce themselves, begin trading with humans [00:01:41].

Eventually, only one commandment remains, twisted from its original form:
> "all animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>

This transformation highlights the [[themes_of_corruption_and_power_in_animal_farm | corruption of power]] [00:04:05]. The pigs eventually start walking on two legs and carrying whips, becoming indistinguishable from humans [00:02:03]. This signifies a complete return to the original state of oppression, with the pigs now acting as the oppressors [00:02:08].

## The Ironic Outcome of the Rebellion

The revolution on Manor Farm, despite its initial righteous aims, is ultimately ironic [00:04:15]. By definition, a revolution ends where it began [00:04:21]. The "porky players" who were initially exploited by their human oppressors become the exploiters themselves [00:04:25]. This illustrates that [[themes_of_corruption_and_power_in_animal_farm | power can corrupt]], regardless of who wields it [00:04:05].

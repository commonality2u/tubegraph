The animated series *Rick and Morty* chronicles the deeply irresponsible and awesome space adventures of a mad scientist and his naive grandson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The show is deeply rooted in the traditions of [[Scifi horror and fantasy themes in Rick and Morty | sci-fi horror]], often paying homage to works like *Ghostbusters*, films by David Cronenberg, *Nosferatu*, and Freddy Krueger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Among these influences, *Rick and Morty* exhibits a particular affinity for cosmic horror <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Defining Cosmic Horror

Cosmic horror, pioneered by literary legend H.P. Lovecraft, emphasizes the terror of that which is beyond human grasp to comprehend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Similar to Lovecraft, *Rick and Morty* uses the cosmos to explore deep philosophical questions by imagining what lies hidden in the black depths of space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The show's opening even includes a visual reference to Lovecraft's Cthulhu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

Cosmic horror transcends cheap jump-scares, instead presenting the vast unknown and unimaginable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It evokes a simultaneous feeling of fright, disgust, and dread when incomprehensible entities from space suddenly intrude upon our reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

### Confronting the Unknown

Rick's portal gun constantly confronts the characters and audience with this unknown, leading to results that are sometimes horrifying, sometimes hilarious, and sometimes both, as he jumps head-first into other realities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Occasionally, this terrifying reality comes to Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

One notable example is in the episode "Get Schwifty," where Earth is approached by a giant space-head (a Cromulon) whose sheer gravitational mass causes mayhem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This cosmic entity commands Earth to "show them what they've got," leading to a bizarre intergalactic talent show where failure means disintegration by a giant space laser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

Giant floating cosmic entities are not new to [[Significance of science fiction and horror references in Rick and Morty | science fiction]]; H.P. Lovecraft frequently used this idea, developing a race of "Great Old Ones" described in works like *The Call of Cthulhu* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Philosophical Implications: Cosmic Pessimism

Cosmic horror raises the fundamental question: Are we significant? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> Most [[Significance of science fiction and horror references in Rick and Morty | science fiction]] centers humanity, but cosmic horror inverts this premise, asking what if the universe simply doesn't care about us <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. For the Cromulons in *Rick and Morty*, humanity is merely an object of entertainment, and annihilating a planet is a casual act, not a cause for concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This portrayal of giant entities demonstrating humanity's insignificance is truly terrifying, or, in *Rick and Morty*'s case, darkly hilarious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

Contemporary American Philosopher Eugene Thacker describes this "[[Cosmic nihilism and its depiction in Rick and Morty | Cosmic Pessimism]]" in the horror genre as imagining a "world-without-us" and conceiving the universe as "absolutely unhuman, and indifferent to the hopes, desires and struggles of human individuals and groups" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. *Rick and Morty* embodies this [[Nihilism and cosmic pessimism in Rick and Morty | cosmic pessimism]] almost perfectly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

### The Insignificance of Existence

The show often highlights the insignificance of life; Rick and Morty themselves die, only to be replaced by infinite other versions of themselves from alternate realities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This suggests that humanity is not just a speck of dust in the cosmos, but one of an infinite number of identical specks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

*Rick and Morty* encourages laughter at this insignificance rather than terror <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It presents a recursive view of cosmic horror: while humans are specks to cosmic entities, humans can also be cosmic horrors to other specks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. In "The Ricks Must Be Crazy," Rick's car battery is powered by a micro-universe whose sole purpose is to produce energy, and that universe then creates another mini-universe, and so on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Rick effectively becomes a Lovecraftian cosmic deity to the inhabitants of these micro-verses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This concept of "cosmic inception" suggests that in a multiverse beyond comprehension with infinite possibilities, values and meanings begin to slip away, leaving only pessimism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

### Connection to [[Philosophy and existentialism in Rick and Morty | Existentialism]]

The show connects this cosmic insignificance to the [[Nihilism and existential themes in Rick and Morty | nihilism and existential themes]] of individual human life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Rick and Morty offer two contrasting responses to this "pathetic existence":

*   **Jerry:** Seems oblivious to the soul-crushing mediocrity and pointlessness of his life, finding contentment even in a poor simulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. He is arguably better off than Rick because he's too "dumb to realize his life is pointless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.
*   **Rick:** Understands and accepts the meaninglessness of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Despite his sarcasm and nonchalant attitude, Rick is an alcoholic whose catchphrase, "Wubbalubbadubdub," means "I am in great pain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

The pure rationalism presented by science in the show further emphasizes the insignificance of human lives, creating a paradox where science explains the universe but leaves humans confronting the bleak, arbitrary nature of their existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Science can strip away sanctity and emotion, rendering the human experience meaningless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

This crisis of values, of our own meaning in life, aligns with existentialist thought, particularly Friedrich Nietzsche's concept of the "death of God," which signifies the loss of an external source of value after the Enlightenment and scientific revolution, leading to a void of meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Rick Sanchez embodies this struggle with the lack of meaning, using science to demystify everything, even beating the devil and playing out the "death of God" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

Ultimately, *Rick and Morty* uses its [[Scifi horror and fantasy themes in Rick and Morty | sci-fi horror]] setting and the absurdities of a purely rational universe to provoke fun, yet depressing, questions like "Why am I here?" and "What's the point of it all?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

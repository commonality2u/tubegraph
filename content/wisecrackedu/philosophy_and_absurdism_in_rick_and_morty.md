The animated series *Rick and Morty* has gained significant attention for its deep philosophical underpinnings, particularly in its third season. While the internet buzzed about the return of Szechuan dipping sauce, the show itself delves into profound themes beyond a random promotional condiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Existing Philosophical Themes

*Rick and Morty* has a history of exploring [[Existentialism and Nihilism in Rick and Morty | existential themes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. This is evident through Rick's creations despairing over their existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>, a persistent resentment towards creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>, and Morty's unique life [[Philosophy and Cosmic Horror in Rick and Morty | philosophy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## Absurdism: A Cruel Existence

Beyond [[Existentialism and Nihilism in Rick and Morty | existentialism]], the show also incorporates "Absurdism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. According to French philosopher Albert Camus, human existence is cruel and absurd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Humans are cursed with seeking meaning in a universe that remains silent, a concept metaphorically represented by a person pushing a boulder up a mountain for all eternity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

In this vein, *Rick and Morty* portrays an absurd, meaningless multiverse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. Rick consistently trivializes everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>, disregarding concepts like love or tradition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. His companionship with Morty is allegedly a means to hide his genius brain waves from the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

### Themes in "The Rickshank Redemption"

The season 3 premiere, "The Rickshank Redemption," reinforces these themes, highlighting:
*   The arbitrary nature of social systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>
*   Mocking sentimentality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>
*   The overall pointlessness of it all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>

The idea of living in a meaningless world is shared by both Absurdism and [[Existentialism and Nihilism in Rick and Morty | existentialism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. The transition from season 2 to season 3 further solidifies *Rick and Morty* as an "absurd" work by offering glimpses of meaning and hope, only to shatter them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

## Undercutting Meaning: Season 2's Deception

At the end of season 2, Rick momentarily deviates from his sociopathic behavior, sharing a heartfelt moment at Birdperson's wedding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. However, this is immediately undercut when Tammy is revealed to be a spy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. This subversion is notable because Rick's flirtation with normalcy is undermined by an external force, not his own cynicism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

Later, after the family is forced into hiding due to his actions, Rick overhears their hardships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. In a moment of apparent anguish, he surrenders to the Galactic Federation, seemingly sacrificing himself and facing lifelong imprisonment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. This sacrifice suggests Rick is confronting something new: living with meaning, choosing to do right by his family despite knowing the meaninglessness of love and life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. This cliffhanger teased a potential shift in the show’s [[Existentialism and Nihilism in Rick and Morty | existential themes]], hinting at the creation of meaning in a meaningless world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

## Camus's Rejection of Hope

This potential shift, however, is firmly rejected by Camus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. This parallels Camus's critique of thinkers like Fyodor Dostoevsky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. Camus argued that authors like Dostoevsky present absurd worlds with characters who understand life's frivolity, but then "chicken out" and retreat to the comfort of meaning, such as religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. For Camus, Dostoevsky's flaw was offering a "reply" to the absurd, a form of meaning, whereas an absurd work "does not provide a reply" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

[[Existentialism and Nihilism in Rick and Morty | Existentialists]] like Jean-Paul Sartre or Dostoevsky may recognize the absurdity of existence, but their analysis falters by resorting to hope or attempts to create meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. Camus stated they "deify what crushes them and find reason to hope in what impoverishes them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

## Season 3's Double Down on Absurdity

While season 2's ending suggested a retreat into meaning and sentimentality, *The Rickshank Redemption* proved this was not the case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. Instead, the show doubled down on the absurd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>:
*   Rick's imprisonment was a mere ploy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.
*   The prospect of a humanized Rick was dismissed in favor of a darker journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.
*   Much of the comedy in "The Rickshank Redemption" stems not from jokes about life's meaninglessness, but from the audience's *attempt* to derive meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

For instance, when Rick explores a memory of creating the portal gun, revealing Beth and Diane's brutal murder and positioning Rick as a tragic, Walter White-style anti-hero, this is revealed as a ruse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. The show actively plays with the audience's desire for hope and meaning, much like an "internet troll" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

Other examples include Rick saving Earth from the Galactic Federation, which initially seems like a selfless act for a greater good, only for Summer to point out that the "new world order" doesn't sound any better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. Similarly, the idea that Rick cares about Morty and Summer is constantly toyed with. He rushes to rescue them from the Council of Ricks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>, then exhibits casual disregard for Summer's life in a standoff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>, only to reveal it was all part of a strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. Finally, this "Rick-caring-theory" disintegrates as he explains he only saved them so Beth wouldn't kick him out of the house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

## The Szechuan Sauce: The Ultimate Absurdity

The climactic revelation of Rick's motivation—the Szechuan sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>—serves as the ultimate undercutting of meaning. Rick is not driven by family, justice, or love, but by a forgotten Mulan McNugget dipping sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. The show suggests Rick's entire series arc will be a quest for this promotional food item <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.

However, the sauce itself means nothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. The quest for Szechuan sauce isn't about creating meaning; it's a reflection of the absurdity of being driven by *anything* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. In a world utterly void of meaning, why not dedicate oneself to an absurd quest for plum-flavored McNugget sauce for 9 seasons, or 97 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>? The quest is meaningful only as a joke about meaninglessness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

## Rick as an Absurd Hero

Camus defined an "Absurd hero" as a figure who understands and finds happiness in the pointlessness of it all, comprehending the "cosmic indifference" that surrounds them through "lucid indifference" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. This description aligns with Rick Sanchez:
*   A man whose knowledge of the vast multiverse, where everything terrible and good has happened, defines his existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.
*   A man who reduces basic morals to genetic programming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.
*   A man who, despite being able to accomplish anything, yearns only for Szechuan sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.

However, a key difference exists: absurd heroes find happiness in the absurd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. As the show makes clear, Rick is in great pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. This suggests that Rick's true arc might not be to become more caring or moral, but to ultimately find enjoyment in the absurdity of it all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

The "April Fool's joke" of the season 3 premiere was not just its surprise release, but the very notion of Rick finding meaning, particularly through the Szechuan sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. If one believed Rick's self-sacrifice indicated a belief in family, justice, or anything of substance, then "you've been had" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.

In cinematic analysis, even the most seemingly trivial elements of a film can carry profound meaning and contribute layers of complexity to a piece of art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. Details such as a single shot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>, a needle drop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>, a line of dialogue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>, or a sudden cut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a> often convey more in under twenty seconds than other films might express in two hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Case Study: The Closing Shot of *The Wolf of Wall Street*

The final shot of *The Wolf of Wall Street* serves as a prime example of how a simple detail can alter the meaning of an entire film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. The shot, described as "just a simple push-in and crane-up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>, initially appears straightforward. However, as a client describes "the pen," his voice fades, and solemn music begins to play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. This shift is notable because, up to this point, the film primarily uses poppy, upbeat music to highlight the debauchery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. The sudden introduction of serious and meditative music prompts a re-evaluation of the film's message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

For most of its runtime, *The Wolf of Wall Street* showcases Jordan Belfort’s lavish excess, funded by defrauding investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. Unlike many films where corrupt figures face justice, *The Wolf of Wall Street* lacks overt moralizing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. Belfort's prison sentence is depicted as a "cakewalk," and he doesn't even serve his full term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. In the end, "nothing has changed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>: Belfort continues to sell, and people continue to buy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

The final shot can be interpreted in several ways, revealing the film's complex nature:

### 1. The Audience as Accomplice

One interpretation is that the final shot functions as a mirror, implicating the moviegoers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. A backlight behind the seminar audience evokes a projector shining, suggesting the film is reflecting back on its viewers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. While it's easy to blame Jordan Belfort solely for the film's moral depravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>, the shot implies that blame also rests on the audience and the culture that enables and encourages such behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

Early in the film, Belfort states that people want to get rich quickly, desiring "something for nothing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. The film suggests that Belfort's scams succeed because people share his dream of instant wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. Director Martin Scorsese seemingly calls out the audience, who have spent three hours "partying with Jordan, laughing and reveling in his exploits" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. Belfort's lack of punishment at the end reflects the audience's vicarious enjoyment of his life, wishing they could live it themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

### 2. Money as a New Religion

Another interpretation draws a parallel between the audience at Belfort's seminar and religious worship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. Scorsese, a devout Catholic, often explores faith in his films <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. However, in *The Wolf of Wall Street*, characters "worship at the altar of something else: MONEY" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. The camera focuses on the "painfully average faces" of these desperate, plain-looking people, seeking meaning and elevation from their mundane existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. Scorsese cynically suggests a link between the transformative power of faith and the transformative power of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>, noting that "The Almighty never promised a million bucks in eight easy steps" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

### 3. The Enjoyment of Exploitation

A third, more sinister interpretation suggests that by solemnly portraying a crowd that worships Belfort despite his detestable actions, Scorsese implies that people actually enjoy being taken advantage of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. This idea aligns with French philosopher Jean-François Lyotard's statement:
> "The English unemployed did not become workers to survive, they… enjoyed the hysterical, masochistic, whatever exhaustion it was of hanging on the mines, in the foundries, in the factories, in hell, they enjoyed it… enjoyed the mad destruction of their organic bodies… the decomposition of their personal identity… enjoyed the dissolution of their families and villages, and enjoyed the new monstrous anonymity of the suburbs and the pubs in the morning and evening.” <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>

Applied to the film, this suggests the closing image indicates the voluntary submission of the masses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. They not only tolerate white-collar criminals stealing their money but find a "perverse enjoyment" in their banal existence under the heel of figures like Jordan Belfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

Ultimately, this single shot exemplifies the complexity of *The Wolf of Wall Street*, making it a "true totem of our culture of excess" that defies easy answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

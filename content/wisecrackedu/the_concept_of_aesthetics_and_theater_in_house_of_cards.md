The American version of *House of Cards* delves into the "dark and scandalous world of politics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, chronicling the quest for power by [[character_analysis_of_frank_and_claire_underwood | Frank and Claire Underwood]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Unlike many American political dramas that offer morally righteous characters or redemption, *House of Cards* rejects this narrative, instead presenting a process where "raw power and cunning wins every time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. The show's central driving question seems to be: "Is there more to politics than pure spectacle?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. This question is explored through the series' pervasive focus on aesthetics and theater, which highlight the idea that appearance drives politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>.

## Aesthetics and Art in Politics

In the cynical world of *House of Cards*, characters consistently maintain a carefully crafted image, both publicly and privately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. The show's creators demonstrate an "obsession with aesthetics," meaning art and beauty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>. Important political dealings are often conducted while characters reflect on art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>. [[character_analysis_of_frank_and_claire_underwood | Claire Underwood's]] appearance, for instance, is meticulously manicured, with her wardrobe frequently discussed within the show and even generating real-life fashion coverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>. However, the show suggests that "once you peel away the pretty aesthetics and art references," there is "Well... nothing" behind the world of *House of Cards* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>.

## Theatrical Elements and Shakespearean Influences

The show's preoccupation with aesthetics extends to its frequent tributes to theater, particularly to William Shakespeare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>. [[character_analysis_of_frank_and_claire_underwood | Frank Underwood]] often uses soliloquies and asides, a theatrical device heavily employed by Shakespeare, to explicate his inner thoughts directly to the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>. Critics have also noted that much of the show's plot and characters evoke Shakespearean classics such as *Macbeth* and *Richard III* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>, which inspire [[character_analysis_of_frank_and_claire_underwood | Frank's]] "charming asides about his terrible behavior" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>. Even the character Petrov quotes Gorbachev quoting Richard III's famous line: "...of an end to our winter of discontent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>.

The use of theater reinforces the idea that [[the_role_of_appearances_in_politics_based_on_house_of_cards | politics is theater]], or "at the very least, its own kind of performance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>. For example, [[character_analysis_of_frank_and_claire_underwood | Frank]] visits his father to "seem more human," openly admitting, "I wouldn't be here if I had a choice. But I have to do these sorta things now. Makes me seem more human" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>. [[character_analysis_of_frank_and_claire_underwood | Frank's]] breaking of the fourth wall blurs the distinction between the show and reality, highlighting the theatrical nature of politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>.

## Appearance as Reality: Hannah Arendt's Influence

Contemporary commentators often lament that [[house_of_cards_critique_of_american_politics | politics has become entertainment]], with slogans replacing substantive argument <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>. *House of Cards* illustrates this through [[character_analysis_of_frank_and_claire_underwood | Frank's]] manipulation of media, such as destroying Michael Kern's career over an op-ed he didn't write <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>, or fabricating a brick through his window to symbolize a stance against "out of control teachers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>.

However, the show complicates this view through the lens of German [[philosophical_influences_and_references_in_house_of_cards | philosopher Hannah Arendt]], who argued that "the realm of appearances is the realm of politics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>. For Arendt, the idea of stripping away appearances to find a "core" is pointless, as they are one and the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>. This concept originates from the ancient Greek *Polis*, where politics involved entering the Agora, a public realm where only words, rhetoric, and deeds were judged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>. Arendt states that for humans, "appearance—something that can be seen or heard by others as well as ourselves, constitutes reality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>.

[[character_analysis_of_frank_and_claire_underwood | Frank Underwood]] seemingly understands this, stating, "We are nothing more or less than what we choose to reveal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>. This challenges the ancient Platonic distinction between appearance and reality, seen in Plato's allegory of the cave, where misleading shadows must be shed to discover a "true" world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>. Unlike this millennia-old argument that a "true" reality lies behind appearances, *House of Cards*, through [[character_analysis_of_frank_and_claire_underwood | Frank]] and Arendt, posits that "appearance is reality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>.

## Hypocrisy and Fluid Identity

The show explores [[exploration_of_moral_themes_in_the_show | Frank's]] character through his "lack of sincerity and frequent use of deception" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:00">[04:33:00]</a>. If viewers cannot hate [[character_analysis_of_frank_and_claire_underwood | Frank]], it's "because there is no stable identity to hate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a>. He presents different personas: a "sometimes good husband to [[character_analysis_of_frank_and_claire_underwood | Claire]]," a "manipulative murderer to Zoe," a "kind boss and one-time lover to Meechum," a "supportive friend to Freddy," and a "job creator for the masses," while being a "two-timing liar to... well everybody else" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>.

[[character_analysis_of_frank_and_claire_underwood | Frank]] is the epitome of a hypocrite, openly admitting, "Do you think I'm a hypocrite?... Well you should" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>. The term "hypocrite" itself originates from the Ancient Greek word for "playacting," further linking [[the_role_of_appearances_in_politics_based_on_house_of_cards | politics]] in *House of Cards* to theater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:00">[06:28:00]</a>. [[character_analysis_of_frank_and_claire_underwood | Frank]] asserts, "The road to power is paved with hypocrisy... and causalities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:39:00">[06:39:00]</a>. Arendt cautions that the "search for motives" and the demand for inner authenticity "transforms all actors into hypocrites and 'hypocrisy' begins to poison all human relations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:59:00">[06:59:00]</a>. For Arendt, the solution is to acknowledge our inability to distinguish between "being and appearance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:00">[07:10:00]</a>.

## Claire's Struggle with Authenticity

In contrast to [[character_analysis_of_frank_and_claire_underwood | Frank]], [[character_analysis_of_frank_and_claire_underwood | Claire's]] portrayal suggests "there is something behind the mask" that she must inhibit to pursue power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>. Her immediate turn to applying makeup after hearing of Zoe Barnes' death implies that "aesthetics suppresses her true feelings of disgust about [[character_analysis_of_frank_and_claire_underwood | Frank's]] deeds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41:00">[07:41:00]</a>. While [[character_analysis_of_frank_and_claire_underwood | Frank's]] authenticity is elusive, [[character_analysis_of_frank_and_claire_underwood | Claire's]] "love of art seems to indicate a yearning for authentic self expression—to stop performing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a>. She seeks authenticity in photography and origami, and is even "seduced by his genuine bohemian lifestyle" in her relationship with a photographer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:59:00">[07:59:00]</a>.

## Politics as Spectacle: Jean Baudrillard's Perspective

The show depicts American politics as largely devoid of democracy, reduced to "backroom dealings and media" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:16:00">[11:16:00]</a>. [[character_analysis_of_frank_and_claire_underwood | Frank]] explicitly states, "Democracy is so overrated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:27:00">[11:27:00]</a> and manipulates public opinion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:34:00">[11:34:00]</a>. The media, protected as integral to democracy, is merely part of a larger political game, used for propaganda or as a tool for [[character_analysis_of_frank_and_claire_underwood | Frank's]] machinations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:52:00">[11:52:00]</a>.

French [[philosophical_influences_and_references_in_house_of_cards | philosopher Jean Baudrillard]] takes the idea of deception masking reality a step further, arguing that in the modern media landscape, "there is no truth behind the lies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:21:00">[12:21:00]</a>. Lies told by politicians and media take on "lives of their own," and information circulates "like commodities on the stock market" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:34:00">[12:34:00]</a>. Baudrillard states, "Where we think that information produces meaning, the opposite occurs. Information devours its own content" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:15:00">[13:15:00]</a>. This is exemplified when [[character_analysis_of_frank_and_claire_underwood | Frank]] tells Zoe, "Is that true? It will be after you write it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:23:00">[13:23:00]</a>.

This "circuit of information" is seductive, as is [[character_analysis_of_frank_and_claire_underwood | Frank Underwood]] himself, not just to other characters but to the viewer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:25:00">[13:25:00]</a>. His famous line, "Great man once said, that everything in life is about sex... except sex. Sex is about power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:37:00">[13:37:00]</a>, and his defiant ring knock at the end of Season 2, leave viewers with a sense of awe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:45:00">[13:45:00]</a>. The show prompts reflection on whether audiences enjoy the performance of politics and if they are "doomed to fall in love with the real [[character_analysis_of_frank_and_claire_underwood | Frank Underwoods]] of the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:50:00">[13:50:00]</a>.

Ultimately, *House of Cards* is a complex show about "the politics of appearance," explored through its emphasis on art and theater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:01:00">[14:01:00]</a>.

*Attack on Titan* is a colossal series known for its fight scenes and its in-depth exploration of serious themes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. While many anime [[exploration_of_death_in_attack_on_titan | explore death]], few delve into its visceral reality quite like *Attack on Titan* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Titans are presented as physical personifications of [[exploration_of_death_in_attack_on_titan | death]], serving as walking reminders of human mortality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. However, the series' darkest element isn't the existential confrontations with [[exploration_of_death_in_attack_on_titan | death]] or the Titans themselves, but rather the construction of the society behind the walls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Carl Schmitt's Influence on Societal Structure

The society within *Attack on Titan* is an anachronistic, quasi-Germanic setting, featuring German architecture, war cries, and character names <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Its political ideology aligns with the beliefs of [[nazi_ideology_and_carl_schmitts_influence_on_attack_on_titan | Carl Schmitt]], a notorious [[nazi_ideology_and_carl_schmitts_influence_on_attack_on_titan | Nazi]] philosopher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. It's important to note that the show explores [[nazi_ideology_and_carl_schmitts_influence_on_attack_on_titan | Schmitt]]'s ideas without endorsing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. *Attack on Titan* is considered provocative because it presents a society maintaining stability, despite facing a horrific enemy, while reflecting [[nazi_ideology_and_carl_schmitts_influence_on_attack_on_titan | Nazi ideology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. It dares to ask if such a controversial philosophy might be the only thing preventing societal collapse in a dystopian setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

Central to [[nazi_ideology_and_carl_schmitts_influence_on_attack_on_titan | Schmitt]]'s philosophy, and the civilization in *Attack on Titan*, is the concept of "the political" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. For [[nazi_ideology_and_carl_schmitts_influence_on_attack_on_titan | Schmitt]], a stable society is built upon three concepts: conflict and inequality, clear [[friend_enemy_distinction_in_politics_and_attack_on_titan | distinctions between friends and enemies]], and [[role_of_sovereignty_and_state_of_emergency_in_attack_on_titan | sovereignty]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

### Inevitable Conflict and Inequality

[[nazi_ideology_and_carl_schmitts_influence_on_attack_on_titan | Schmitt]] posits that conflict, division, and inequality among humans are inevitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. This view stems from the understanding that humanity's basic nature is savage and hellish, and that "life isn’t fair" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. Characters like Mikasa, Armin, and Eren, express views aligned with this thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. The show frequently emphasizes that it's a "dog eat dog world" where one must fight to survive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

[[nazi_ideology_and_carl_schmitts_influence_on_attack_on_titan | Schmitt]] takes this further, asserting that hostility is unavoidable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. For him, inequality is inevitable because people will always differ in intelligence, fitness, and attractiveness, and it is not the role of politics to rectify this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. Instead of attempting to eliminate antagonism or inequality, a strong [[role_of_sovereignty_and_state_of_emergency_in_attack_on_titan | sovereign]] should focus on maintaining order and control of the population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. Social issues like inequality, for [[nazi_ideology_and_carl_schmitts_influence_on_attack_on_titan | Schmitt]], are distractions from "the political" – nationalism and survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

## Depiction of Inequality in Attack on Titan

In *Attack on Titan*, social classes are literally separated by walls, with each wall section acting as its own caste system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
*   **Wall Maria:** Residents are less safe than those in Wall Rose and Sina <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
*   **Trost vs. Inner City:** While people in Trost face being eaten by Titans, those in the inner city reside in castles, enjoying leisure activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.
*   **Military Branches:** The Scouts venture beyond the walls, risking their lives, while the Military Police (MP's) in the inner walls are depicted as barely knowing how to use their Omnidirectional Mobility Gear and often getting drunk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

Unlike most media narratives that would depict severe inequality as something to be remedied, *Attack on Titan* initially shows little evidence of this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.

## The Sovereign's Role in Maintaining Order and Inequality

The [[role_of_sovereignty_and_state_of_emergency_in_attack_on_titan | sovereign]] possesses the power to declare [[role_of_sovereignty_and_state_of_emergency_in_attack_on_titan | states of emergency]], justifying the sacrifice of populations for the greater good, such as sending a battalion to reclaim Wall Maria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. This ability is deemed crucial for the long-term stability of societies, preventing political bickering from hindering efforts against existential threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. The [[role_of_sovereignty_and_state_of_emergency_in_attack_on_titan | sovereign]] can also grant exceptions to the law, such as special citizen status for those living inside Wall Sina <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.

The leadership structure within the walls appears to be based on martial law and military rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>. Leaders send millions to their deaths to ensure the safety of the remaining population within the walls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. Pixis explains that the retaking of Wall Maria was essentially a thinly disguised [[social_stratification_in_the_purge | purge]] to alleviate stress from the massive influx of refugees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. This decision involved killing off part of the population for the perceived "greater good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. For [[nazi_ideology_and_carl_schmitts_influence_on_attack_on_titan | Schmitt]], the [[role_of_sovereignty_and_state_of_emergency_in_attack_on_titan | sovereign]] must retain the capacity to perform even the most horrific actions to maintain order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>.

*Attack on Titan* presents a stark exploration of these concepts. Were the Titans to vanish, the series prompts the viewer to consider whether society would descend into anarchy or civil war, or if it would be an opportunity for liberation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. For [[nazi_ideology_and_carl_schmitts_influence_on_attack_on_titan | Schmitt]], eradicating an enemy isn't an option due to the inherent drive for warfare; eliminating one enemy only leads to another, eventually targeting one's own population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. The show could evolve to critique or complicate these [[nazi_ideology_and_carl_schmitts_influence_on_attack_on_titan | Schmitt]]-style politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.

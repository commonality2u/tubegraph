Contemporary cinematic villains are often the most compelling aspects of a film, embodying a strange relatability and offering cogent critiques of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Viewers may find themselves empathizing with their logic or feeling a modicum of empathy towards them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This shift is evident in characters like Killmonger from *Black Panther* and Screenslaver from *The Incredibles 2* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Characteristics and Motivations

Today's villains reflect a deeply divided America, marked by low public trust in government, media, and religious faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>. They embody society's innate skepticism towards "any systems, all the systems!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>. Unlike 1950s villains who sought to corrupt inherently good systems, contemporary antagonists often confront "objectively evil systems" that they aim to improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>. Their villainy primarily stems from their "way too radical and usually mind-bogglingly violent" means of achieving change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>. The audience can often empathize with their critique and desire for change, even if their methods are extreme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:44">[00:20:44]</a>.

In this paradigm, heroes often become "slightly-flawed protectors of a status quo that nobody’s really happy with" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:52">[00:20:52]</a>.

## Philosophical Stances of Contemporary Villains

### Challenging Corrupt Systems and Inequality

*   **Killmonger (Black Panther)**: Erik Killmonger's philosophy is rooted in a legitimate critique of global racism and Wakanda's passivity in the face of suffering among black communities worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>. He argues that the true villains are Wakandans who hoard vibranium while others suffer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>. His radical plan involves distributing Wakandan weapons globally to instigate a militant uprising, aiming for a Wakandan empire where black people are on top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>. Although defeated, his radicalism ultimately leads to positive policy changes in Wakanda, such as ending isolationism and establishing outreach centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:36">[00:19:36]</a>. This aligns with the broader topic of [[relatable_villains_and_social_critiques]].

### Utilitarianism and Extreme Solutions

*   **August Walker/John Lark (Mission: Impossible – Fallout)**: This villain proposes a utilitarian approach, believing that global peace can only be achieved through immense suffering. He intends to destroy one-third of the world's population, theorizing that the remaining two-thirds would unite in the aftermath of such a catastrophe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:43">[00:19:43]</a>.
*   **Thanos (Avengers: Infinity War)**: Thanos believes that the universe's resource scarcity can only be solved by eliminating half of all life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:03">[00:20:03]</a>. This solution is based on a radical interpretation of resource management, aiming for balance through extreme depopulation. This reflects [[philosophical_influences_on_marvel_characters]].

### Critiquing Modern Society and Passivity

*   **Screenslaver (The Incredibles 2)**: Screenslaver's motivation stems from a disdain for society's passive consumption of media and dependence on superheroes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>. She argues that the endless repackaging of life into consumable media has made people lazy observers, and superheroes perpetuate this docility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>. Her plan involves mind-controlling superheroes to cause a massive accident, thereby ruining their public approval and forcing people to learn self-reliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>.

## Evolution and Comparisons

The shift towards contemporary villains represents a complex evolution in cinema, as discussed in [[evolution_of_villains_in_cinema]] and [[comparative_analysis_of_villains_1950s_to_present]].

*   **Opposition to Nihilism**: Unlike the nihilistic villains of the 2000s, such as The Joker (The Dark Knight) or Anton Chigurh (No Country For Old Men), who embrace meaninglessness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>, contemporary villains "do believe that there is a cause worth fighting for" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a>.
    *   The Joker, for instance, represents "anarchy and chaos of a particularly destructive and nihilistic nature," believing the "only sensible way to live in this world is without rules" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>. His character explores [[the_influence_of_existential_and_philosophical_ideas_on_the_jokers_character]].
    *   Anton Chigurh, an "active nihilist," uses a coin flip to decide fates, believing all morality is contrived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>.
    *   Frank Costello from *The Departed* also embodies a belief that life is meaningless, with actions justified if they sustain one more day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>.
*   **Echoes of the 1970s and 1990s**: Today's villains merge the complexity and perceived innocence of 1990s villains with the broadened social critiques seen in the 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:14">[00:21:14]</a>. The 1970s saw villains who embodied corrupt social systems, reflecting public disillusionment with government following events like Watergate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. Figures like Nurse Ratched (*One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest*) and the warden in *East from Alcatraz* represented institutional evils <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. The 1990s introduced "complex anti-villains" like Howard Payne (*Speed*) and John Doe (*Se7en*) who fought localized battles through radical means, hinting at philosophical motivations beyond mere greed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>. This period also saw villains, like General Hummel in *The Rock*, with genuinely noble causes, raising questions about whether noble ends justify violent means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. These shifts are explored further in [[impact_of_historical_events_on_villain_archetypes]].

Ultimately, if contemporary villains were to adopt different blueprints for social change, they might be reinterpreted as complex heroes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:33">[00:21:33]</a>.

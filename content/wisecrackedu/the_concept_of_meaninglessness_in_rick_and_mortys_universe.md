The animated series *Rick and Morty*, particularly following its Season 3 premiere, *The Rickshank Redemption*, delves deeply into the concept of meaninglessness, often using it as a central [[philosophy_and_absurdism_in_rick_and_morty | philosophical theme]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. The show challenges the audience's natural inclination to find meaning, opting instead to double down on an absurd, meaningless existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

## Absurdism and Existential Themes

*Rick and Morty* has consistently explored [[existentialism_and_nihilism_in_rick_and_morty | existential themes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>, showcasing creations despairing over their existence, a persistent resentment towards creators, and Morty's unique life philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. A key concept explored is [[philosophy_and_absurdism_in_rick_and_morty | Absurdism]], a philosophy related to [[rick_and_morty_and_existentialism | existentialism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

According to French philosopher Albert Camus, humans are cursed with seeking meaning in a universe that remains silent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. The image of Sisyphus pushing a boulder up a mountain for eternity serves as a metaphor for this absurd human condition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. In line with Camus, *Rick and Morty* depicts an absurd, meaningless multi-verse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. Rick frequently trivializes everything, rejecting concepts like love and tradition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. His companionship with Morty is even alleged to be a means to hide his genius brain waves from the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

*The Rickshank Redemption* reinforces these ideas by portraying the arbitrary nature of social systems, mocking sentimentality, and highlighting the inherent pointlessness of existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

## Undercutting Meaning and Hope

The transition from Season 2 to Season 3 solidified *Rick and Morty* as an "absurd" work by dangling meaning and hope before the audience, only to shatter it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

### The Undermined Sacrifice
At the end of Season 2, Rick momentarily steps away from his sociopathic behavior to have a heartfelt moment at Birdperson's wedding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. This moment is undercut when Tammy is revealed to be a spy, with the betrayal coming from an outside force rather than Rick's own cynicism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

Later, after the family is forced into hiding due to Rick's actions, Rick overhears their hardships and, in a seeming moment of anguish, turns himself over to the Galactic Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. This sacrifice suggests Rick is grappling with living with meaning, choosing to do right by his family despite his knowledge of life's meaninglessness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. The cliffhanger teased a potential shift in the show's [[rick_and_morty_and_existentialism | existential themes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

However, *The Rickshank Redemption* refutes this, doubling down on the absurd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. Rick's imprisonment is revealed to be a ploy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>, and the prospect of a humanized Rick is replaced with a journey promised to be "darker than ever" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

### Rejecting Meaning-Making Philosophies
The show's decision to reject the idea of creating meaning in a meaningless world aligns with Camus, who firmly rejected this approach, unlike other [[rick_and_morty_and_existentialism | existentialists]] such as Jean-Paul Sartre or Fyodor Dostoevsky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. Camus criticized authors like Dostoevsky for proposing absurd worlds only to retreat to the comfort of meaning, such as religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. For Camus, an absurd work should not provide a reply or offer hope to the absurd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

## Jokes Derived from Attempted Meaning

*The Rickshank Redemption*'s comedy often stems from the audience's *attempt* to draw meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. The writers playfully manipulate the viewer's desire for hope and meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

For instance:
*   **Rick's Origin Story**: When Rick explores a memory of creating the portal gun, it shows Beth and Diane's brutal murder, seemingly providing a tragic Walter White-style origin for his madness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. This baits the audience to empathize, but it's revealed to be a ruse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.
*   **Saving Earth**: Rick saves Earth from the Galactic Federation, which might lead viewers to believe he acts for a "greater good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. However, Summer's comment implies the new world order isn't much better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.
*   **Caring for Family**: The show constantly toys with the idea that Rick cares about Morty and Summer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. He rushes to rescue them from the Council of Ricks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>, but then exhibits casual disregard for Summer's life in a standoff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. Ultimately, he reveals he only saved them to avoid being kicked out by Beth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

## The Szechuan Sauce and the Absurd Hero

The ultimate symbol of the show's commitment to meaninglessness is Rick's stated motivation: the McDonald's Szechuan dipping sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. Rick is not motivated by family, justice, or love, but by a forgotten promotional condiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. The show suggests his entire series arc will be a quest for this absurd item <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

The love of Szechuan sauce means nothing; it is not a creation of meaning, but a reflection of the absurdity of being driven by anything at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. In a world utterly devoid of meaning, why not dedicate oneself to an absurd quest for plum-flavored McNugget sauce, even for 97 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>? The quest is meaningful only as a joke about meaninglessness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

Camus describes an "Absurd hero" as a figure who understands and finds happiness in the pointlessness of existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. This hero must fully comprehend the "lucid indifference" of the cosmic surroundings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. This description closely mirrors Rick, whose existence is defined by his knowledge of a vast multiverse where all possibilities have occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>, who reduces basic morals to genetic programming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>, and who yearns only for Szechuan sauce despite being able to accomplish anything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.

However, a crucial difference exists: Camus's absurd heroes find happiness in the absurd, while Rick is clearly in great pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. Perhaps Rick's true arc will not involve becoming more caring or moral, but rather learning to enjoy the inherent absurdity of it all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. The show's ultimate joke may be the prospect of Rick finding meaning, or the very idea that his self-sacrifice indicated a belief in family or justice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

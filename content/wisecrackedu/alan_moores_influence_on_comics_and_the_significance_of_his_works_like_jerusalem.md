Alan Moore, described as "everyone's favorite drug-addled Gandalf," is the author of many of the most acclaimed comics of all time, including *Watchmen*, *Miracleman*, and *The Killing Joke* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. He is said to straddle the line between genius and insanity, much like the Joker and Batman in *The Killing Joke* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Moore openly declares himself a ritual magician, not one who pulls rabbits from hats, but rather like the Steven Strange variety who consults grimoires and conjures demons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. While his claims about magic might initially seem like superstition, they reveal a fascinating philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## [[alan_moore_and_his_philosophy_on_magic_and_hermeticism | The Philosophy of Alan Moore's Magic]]

Moore is a student of [[alan_moore_and_his_philosophy_on_magic_and_hermeticism | Hermeticism]], an occult tradition that is less a religion and more a set of interrelated practices and principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. The goal of Hermeticism is to understand the world through three methods: alchemy, astrology, and theurgy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. Theurgy refers to the process of achieving spiritual perfection to grow closer to God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. Hermeticism's teachings are largely based on the *Corpus Hermeticum*, attributed to the mythical Hermes Trismegistus, a blend of the Greek god Hermes and the Egyptian god Thoth, both gods of language and wisdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

For Moore, [[the_intersection_of_art_language_and_consciousness_in_moores_works | the mixture of language and understanding is the heart of magic]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. In his upcoming *The Moon and Serpent Bumper Book of Magic*, Moore defines magic as "a purposeful engagement with the phenomena and possibilities of consciousness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

### Material vs. Immaterial Reality

Moore posits that reality can be divided into two categories: the material and the immaterial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
*   **Material:** Encompasses physical aspects like matter, energy, space, time, and fundamental forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.
*   **Immaterial:** This is the mental model our brain constructs of the external world based on limited sensory information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

Magic, in Moore's view, bridges the gap between these two realms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. Art, language, and symbols are the tools of the magician <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. He states that "magic is intrinsically connected with art, language and consciousness to the point where these four things almost become different aspects of the same phenomenon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.

#### Illustrative Examples

*   **Watchmen**: Moore's initial idea for *Watchmen* was an ephemeral thought that became tangible when artist Dave Gibbons gave it form through penciled panels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. An intangible thought thus had a tangible effect on the arrangement of atoms that became the comic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. Conversely, a physical sound (voice) can alter perception, conjuring an image (like Doctor Manhattan's appearance) in the mind, which Moore considers casting a genuine spell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.
*   **Rabbit-Duck Illusion**: This illusion demonstrates how initial interpretation (e.g., "duck") is not fixed; simply being told it's also a "rabbit" can change perception, illustrating "storytelling as spell-craft" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
*   **Miracleman**: As an anarchist, Moore views money as a destructive illusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. In *Miracleman*, when the character aims to create a utopia, one of his first actions is to abolish money, explaining that "Money’s imaginary. Real if we believe in it…" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.
*   **Promethea**: This comic most clearly shows how altering thought can magically change something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. In *Promethea*, protagonist Sophie faces the demon-king Asmodeus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. When Sophie and her companions accept that demons are merely parts of human nature, Asmodeus's appearance shifts to human form, as he explains, "Approach us humanely and with respect, and we will be human and respectable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. This highlights that "expectation creates perspective" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. Even Doctor Manhattan, who externally appears as an "ageless aquamarine Adonis with alopecia," does so because this is how he internally perceives himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

### Macrocosm and Microcosm

One of Hermeticism's core principles, "As above, so below," dictates that every level of reality reflects every other, like an infinite fractal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. Understanding one part of the pattern aids in understanding the whole, allowing movement from lower to higher levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

Moore applies this in *Promethea*, where the entire series structure is based on the Kabbalah's Tree of Life, a structure that repeats at both macrocosmic (entirety of existence) and microcosmic (individual soul) levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.
*   **Tree of Life as a Roadmap**: For Moore, the Tree of Life maps all reality, including inner lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.
    *   Lowest rung: Perception (seeing the rabbit or duck) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.
    *   Above: Imagination (making mental models of unapprehended things) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.
    *   Above: Art and language (tying ideas to sounds, symbols, pictures, stories) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.
    *   Above: Emotion and reason <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.
*   **Macroscopic Level**: The physical universe is the "basest sphere of the world's soul," followed by collective unconscious, and finally "The All. The One. God" at the very top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.
*   **Promethea's Structure**: The series is thirty-two issues long, corresponding to the ten Spheres and twenty-two Paths of The Tree of Life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. The thirty-second issue, with thirty-two pages each expounding on a Path, is a microcosm of the series, and the series a macrocosm of the issue, embodying "As above, so below" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.

### Solve et Coagula

Another Hermetic principle employed by Moore is "Solve et Coagula" ("Separate and Combine"), which involves breaking something into its parts to understand the whole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.
*   **Doctor Manhattan**: In *Watchmen*, Doctor Manhattan initially understands "separate" by mentally breaking humans down into their base components, detaching from humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. His breakthrough on Mars is learning to "recombine" and perceive humans as holistic, four-dimensional objects, moving beyond merely abstract arrangements of atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.
*   **Promethea Issue #6**: Sophie defeats the writer Marto Neptura, who wields power over the land of fiction, by understanding that Neptura is the collective pen name of various novelists, allowing her to break down his unique styles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.

## The World's End and Jerusalem

Moore believes that if a sufficiently compelling story can change the perception of a single phenomenon, then a story that is a complete model of the world could change the perception of an entire species <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. For Moore, when everyone's way of viewing the world ends, the "World" itself ends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

In *Promethea*, Sophie's task is to bring about this "Apocalypse" by explaining the Hermetic principles, leading everyone to perceive the immaterial and material worlds as equally "real" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. This "leap from matter to mind" is seen as humanity slithering "from the beach, from one element into another" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. Moore links this to the origin of human culture itself, where "representation" allowed for verbal language, leading to our unique form of consciousness, and subsequently writing, painting, song, theatre, science, and politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

Moore also contemplated how our world would end in a similar fashion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:56]</a>. In *Promethea*'s twelfth issue, he used the Tarot to trace world history from the Big Bang to a coming leap to expanded consciousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. In 1999, he predicted this end would occur in 2017, when the sum total of human knowledge would double every half second, requiring new ways of understanding the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.

In September 2016, on the eve of his prophesied world's end, Moore released his magnum opus, *Jerusalem* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. While *Promethea* was a spell to change individual minds, *Jerusalem* was a ritual "to bring about world-wide Revelation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. Moore considers *Jerusalem* his "most sophisticated and complex magical working thus far" and "certainly the most ambitious in its aims" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.

Moore aims for readers to experience higher states of consciousness as the narrative describes them, similar to how the Heptapod's language in *Arrival* profoundly affects Lois Lane's perception of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.
*   A chapter told from Lucia Joyce's perspective employs the linguistic style of her father's *Finnegans Wake* to replicate her condition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. Moore explores how those deemed "insane" might perceive external reality more accurately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>.
*   Like Einstein, Moore views time as "a stubbornly persistent illusion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>. Doctor Manhattan's simultaneous perception of all moments makes him "more sane" than those who perceive only the present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.

To encourage readers to perceive more dimensions, Moore applies "Solve et Coagula" to language itself, separating phonetics (how vocalized words sound) from graphetics (how written words appear) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>. He writes dialogue that looks like gibberish but makes phonetic sense, forcing readers to find multiple layers of meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. For example, he spells "dimension" to resemble "dementia" or "universe" to resemble "loony," teaching readers to perceive more dimensions in text about a multi-dimensional universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>.

Although Moore's predicted revelation did not occur in 2017, his status as the "most influential writer in the history of comics" suggests his literary efforts will remain influential for centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>.

## Conclusion: Is Magic Real?

If Moore's philosophy holds true, magic is "at least as real as our imagination" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>. As stated in *Promethea*'s Revelation, directed at the reader:
> "I’m an idea, but I’m a real idea. I’m the idea of human imagination, which, when you think about it, is the only thing we can really be certain isn’t imaginary… I’m imagination. I’m real and I’m the best friend you’ve ever had. Who do you think got you all this cool stuff? The clothes you wear, the room, the house, the city that you’re in. Everything in it started out in human imagination. Your lives, your personalities, your whole world. All invented…" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>

To the list of "cool stuff imagination has given us," one can certainly add the highly imaginative works of Alan Moore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>.

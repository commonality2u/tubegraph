The film *Shrek* includes numerous attacks on the [[critique_of_disney_in_shrek | Disney aesthetic]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a> due to a purported feud between Disney CEO Michael Eisner and his former employee, Jeffrey "J Money" Katzenberg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:00">[04:38:00]</a>.

## Katzenberg's Tenure at Disney

For a decade, Jeffrey Katzenberg ran Disney's movie and television division under Michael Eisner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>. During this period, Katzenberg was credited with revitalizing Disney's animated film catalog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>, contributing to hits such as "The Little Fish Lady," "Interracial Couple," and "The Genie Saves Hanukkah" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>.

## Departure and the Formation of Dreamworks

Despite his efforts and successes, Disney reportedly refused to promote Katzenberg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>. This refusal led Katzenberg to leave and establish Dreamworks, allegedly "out of pure spite" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>.

## *Shrek* as a Critique

*Shrek* is seen as a direct consequence of this feud. Some speculate that the character Lord Facebook in *Shrek* was based on Michael Eisner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:00">[05:02:00]</a>. Lord Facebook's kingdom is described as a "dead ringer for Disneyland," featuring employees in costumes and puppets singing incessantly about "what a small and pitiful world Earth is" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:00">[05:09:00]</a>.

Through Dreamworks, Katzenberg and his collaborators criticized the notion that beautiful people are inherently "destined for greater rewards than 'normal,' less valuable people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19:00">[05:19:00]</a>. *Shrek* challenges the traditional fairy tale ending where a "lovely princess and handsome hero live 'happily ever after'" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a> by making both its heroes "ugly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>, implicitly suggesting a "rocky" marriage that would "probably end in divorce" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a>.

Jordan Peele’s social thriller *Get Out* explores [[racism_and_justice_themes | race]] in America by uniquely targeting white liberals rather than typical subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. The film follows Chris Washington as he meets his white girlfriend’s parents, leading to the horrifying discovery that their party is a slave auction where an old white man intends to implant his brain into Chris's body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. Peele conceived the story reflecting on how many Americans believed the Obama presidency signaled a "post-racial" era, with the film arguing that this "so-called post-racial liberalism" is more terrifying than imagined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

## The Illusion of "Post-Racial" Liberalism

Throughout *Get Out*, Chris encounters white individuals who claim to have "moved beyond" [[racism_and_justice_themes | racism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. This disavowal of [[racism_and_justice_themes | racism]] paradoxically reinforces a problematic relationship with black people, ranging from suspicious to outright horrific <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. The attempts of these characters to prove their "not racist" stance only further alienate Chris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. The Armitage family, for instance, seems unnaturally eager to discuss "black people stuff" around Chris, like praising Obama, as if to demonstrate their anti-racist credentials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. This "over-performance" of "acceptance" of black culture deepens the sense of difference and makes Chris uncomfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Even mentions of black figures like Tiger Woods serve to emphasize Chris's "otherness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. This behavior suggests that overt [[racism_and_justice_themes | racism]] can be excused as long as one demonstrates familiarity with black culture and anti-racist ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

## Negrophilia and the Objectification of the Black Body

The film delves into "negrophilia," a term that emerged in 1920s Paris to describe a craze for black culture among "hipsters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. Writer Petrine Archer-Straw notes that for these Parisians, blackness symbolized "modernity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. However, this fascination had a problematic aspect: "Black personalities were either lionised or demonised in a manner that denied normality," meaning black individuals were reduced to stereotypes rather than seen as actual people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

In *Get Out*, party guests express fascination with Chris's blackness, asking about his experience in America and declaring "black is in fashion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. Chris is celebrated for his cultural background, yet simultaneously objectified, as seen when the creepy brother suggests Chris could be a "f***ing beast" if he "really pushed [his] body" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. This highlights how the "white perspective" dictates the definition of black people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. Negrophilia extends to a desire for the black body itself, sexually ("So, is it true? Is it better?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a> and athletically ("So Chris, what's your sport?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. This desire is not about understanding black individuals but about using them to fulfill one's own desires, effectively "collecting them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. The film escalates this into the literal colonization of the black body during its third act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

For instance, Grandpa Armitage, unable to overcome being bested by Jesse Owens in the 1936 Berlin Olympics, implants his brain into an athletic black body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. Grandma Armitage's brain is placed into Georgina, allowing her to "play dress up as a beautiful black woman" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. Chris is destined for a similar fate, auctioned to a blind man who desires his award-winning photographer's eyes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. The blind man, in an extreme example of liberal [[racism_and_justice_themes | racism]], denies his purchase is racist, stating, "I don't give a s*** what color you are. What I want is deeper. I want those things you see through" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

## The Psychological Burden of Navigating White Spaces

*Get Out* offers insight into the psychological experience of black Americans in white America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. Chris's experience of being lost in a white suburb serves as a metaphor for the emotional maze he must navigate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. Many of his interactions are modulated for his white audience; for example, he prioritizes not upsetting a police officer, unlike Rose who insists on making a scene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. He anxieties over seemingly simple situations, such as meeting his girlfriend's parents and wondering, "Do they know I'm... do they know I'm black?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.

Philosopher Frantz Fanon's experience as a black man in 20th-century France mirrors Chris's, describing a "burdensome weight" when meeting "the white man's eyes," leading to discomfort and feeling out of place in a white-dominated world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. Chris, like Fanon, is burdened by trying to fit into a world from which he feels fundamentally excluded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. He is caught between integrating into Rose's world and retaining his own identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>, feeling "like they haven't met a black person that doesn't work for them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. This forces Chris to become "two people at the same time: a black man with his own identity, and, Rose’s black boyfriend who is nice to everyone no matter how absurd their questions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

## The Sunken Place and Double Consciousness

To navigate this, Chris must silence his own identity, a process made literal in the "Sunken Place" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. This hypnotic state separates one's mind from their body, leaving them to passively observe their own experiences through a screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. Jordan Peele tweeted that "The Sunken Place means we’re marginalized. No matter how hard we scream, the system silences us" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. This suggests that societies built on inequality inevitably silence those on the outside, or at least temper their voices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

This concept can be understood through W.E.B. Du Bois's "double consciousness," an internal conflict experienced by African Americans in a structurally racist society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. These conditions lead black people to view themselves through the perspective of the dominant societal force—in this case, white people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. Chris is constantly evaluated by white society's standards and desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>, leading to the "two-ness" that Du Bois describes in the black soul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. This imposition causes confusion about the authenticity of one's experiences, leaving Chris feeling like a helpless spectator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. The deer he and Rose kill reminds him of his mother's death, symbolizing his own life as a helpless spectator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.

## Resistance and the Systemic Nature of Racism

The fear of losing oneself is literalized in the "Coagula procedure," where black consciousness is pushed to the background for the white mind, risking permanent entrapment in the Sunken Place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. Chris avoids this by plugging his ears with cotton picked from his chair, a direct inversion of poet Audre Lorde’s idea that "the master’s tools will never dismantle the master’s house" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. *Get Out* suggests the opposite: Chris re-purposes a symbol of slave labor (cotton) to assert his identity and escape a new form of slavery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. He also uses a bocce ball, a symbol of the white elite, and a mounted deer, recalling his spectatorship, to fight back, signifying his triumph over his past powerlessness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>. Chris's escape is a radical assertion of his black identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.

Despite Chris's escape, the film's most terrifying moment, according to the presenter, comes from the potential encounter with police, as the "real monster of Get Out isn’t a fictional boogeyman, but rather, the horrors of the system itself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. This systemic horror cannot be heroically defeated at a film's conclusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.

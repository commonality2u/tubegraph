Storytelling methods differ significantly between television and film, primarily due to their distinct goals and formats. Showrunners Dan Harmon and Justin Roiland demonstrate a mastery of [[narrative_structure_and_the_golden_rule_in_storytelling | story structure]] in *Rick & Morty* that highlights these differences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## Dan Harmon's Story Embryo

Dan Harmon posits that every story, from *The Odyssey* to a simple fart joke, adheres to an eight-step "story embryo" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>:

1.  A character is in a zone of comfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.
2.  But they want something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.
3.  They enter an unfamiliar situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>.
4.  Adapt to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>.
5.  Get what they wanted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>.
6.  Pay a heavy price for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>.
7.  Then return to their familiar situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>.
8.  Having changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>.

This general structure, however, adapts based on the genre and medium, especially for television <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>.

## Fundamental Goals

The core difference lies in the ultimate objective of each medium:
*   **Movies** aim to provide a self-contained experience, sending viewers "out on a 90 minute high" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>.
*   **Television** aims for continuity, striving to "keep people watching television. Forever" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>. This approach can be seen as designed to put the brain in a "vegetative state" for commercials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>.

## Emphasis on Change vs. Status Quo

Television shows are inherently "less about change, and more about preserving the status quo" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>.
*   For instance, in *The Dark Knight Rises*, Batman saves Gotham and moves on to a new life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>.
*   Conversely, in *Batman: The Animated Series*, each episode begins and ends with Batman fighting a different villain in the same Gotham, reinforcing that "change is unnecessary" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. This contrast is often highlighted in [[critique_of_narrative_and_execution_in_the_dark_knight_rises | critiques of narrative and execution]] in such films.

## Television Episode Structure

Given this need for continuity, the structure of a TV episode often deviates from Harmon's story embryo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>:

1.  "I (the protagonist)" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>
2.  "Notice a small problem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>
3.  "And make a major decision" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>
4.  "This changes things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>
5.  "To some satisfaction, but" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>
6.  "There are consequences" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>
7.  "That must be undone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>
8.  "And I must admit the futility of change" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>

## Character Adaptation and Fulfillment

*   **Step 4: Adaptation**
    *   In movies, this stage often serves as a "training phase" where characters undergo internal change, breaking down neuroses and psychological baggage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>.
    *   For TV, this stage focuses more on external changes, as the goal is to preserve the status quo for ongoing viewership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:39:00">[06:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:45:00">[06:45:00]</a>.

*   **Step 8: Change or Futility**
    *   Normally, this is where a hero achieves fulfillment, integrating new skills into their life, such as Daniel in *The Karate Kid* mastering Kung Fu, or Amanda becoming the next Jigsaw Killer in *Saw II* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:59:00">[12:59:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:07:00">[13:07:00]</a>.
    *   However, in television, the hero "can never be fulfilled" to ensure they desire further adventures and maintain viewer engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:13:00">[13:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:16:00">[13:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:18:00">[13:18:00]</a>. Shows like *Happy Days* and *Leave It To Beaver* exemplify this return to the starting point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:09:00">[14:09:00]</a>.

*Rick & Morty* effectively uses this circular television structure to highlight "the depressing, crippling futility of change" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:13:00">[14:13:00]</a>. Despite its radical differences and critiques of popular culture, the show's core structure remains consistent with television norms, demonstrating a strong belief in the power of [[narrative_structure_and_the_golden_rule_in_storytelling | story structure]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:51:00">[13:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:01:00">[14:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:32:00">[14:32:00]</a>.

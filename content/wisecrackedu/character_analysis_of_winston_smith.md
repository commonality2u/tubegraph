Winston Smith is introduced as a mid-level member of "The Party," a totalitarian regime in George Orwell's *1984* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Initial Rebellion

Winston eventually becomes frustrated with the system and begins expressing his thoughts in a journal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. This act is highly dangerous, as speaking ill of "Big Brother" could lead to imprisonment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Relationships

Winston develops a relationship with Julia, who expresses her love for him via a note <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Winston comes to believe he has deep affection for her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

He also encounters O'Brien, whom he perceives as someone who shares his desire to rebel against Big Brother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:56]</a>. Winston brings Julia to O'Brien's residence, where O'Brien claims to be part of a rebel organization known as "The Brotherhood" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:01:02]</a>. Winston enthusiastically agrees to join this group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

## Capture and Torture

While reading a book provided by O'Brien, Winston and Julia are apprehended by the "5-O" (Thought Police) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:12]</a>. It is revealed that O'Brien was secretly a member of Big Brother's Thought Police <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

To force Winston to align with the Party's ideology, O'Brien tortures him until he confesses to fabricated crimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:28]</a>. O'Brien states that the torture will continue until "everything be dead inside" Winston, after which he will be filled with "Big Brotha-ly love" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:42]</a>.

Despite the torture, Winston initially maintains his resolve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. However, O'Brien then takes him to Room 101, the "wackest torture chamber" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. There, O'Brien uses a cage of rats to break Winston, causing him to scream, "Do it to Julia! Not me!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:02:04]</a>.

## Transformation

Ultimately, the Party succeeds in stripping Winston of his individuality, leaving him only with love for Big Brother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. This highlights the [[critique_of_totalitarian_regimes_in_1984 | critique of totalitarian regimes in 1984]] presented in the novel, where individual qualities are "kicked straight to the curb" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:29]</a>, making it impossible for an individual to know they exist if they are only what the government dictates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:03:33]</a>.

Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) technologies could experience a resurgence in 2024, primarily due to the anticipated release of the Apple Vision Pro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:46">[02:57:46]</a>. This device is scheduled for release in early 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:54">[03:00:54]</a>.

## Potential Impact
Should these VR goggles gain traction, they could unlock new opportunities for app developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:05">[03:07:05]</a>. However, it's considered unlikely to appeal to the general public, especially given its estimated cost of $3,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:47">[03:11:47]</a>. The product is largely expected to be a niche item, appealing to some users but not the average consumer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:41">[03:20:41]</a>.

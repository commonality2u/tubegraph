The artificial intelligence landscape saw significant developments in late 2023, with Google unveiling its highly anticipated Gemini model. This release marks a new phase in what has been termed the "great AI war of 2023," following Microsoft's earlier advancements with GPT-4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. As AI models become more sophisticated, their capabilities suggest a profound [[impact_of_ai_on_job_markets_and_education | impact on various professions]].

## Advancements in Google's AI Models

Gemini is a multimodal large language model designed to replace previous Google models like Lambda and PaLM 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. Similar to GPT-4, Gemini is trained on diverse data including text, sound, images, and video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

Key capabilities demonstrated by Gemini include:
*   Real-time recognition and response to actions in a video feed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.
*   Ability to track objects in an ongoing video feed, such as finding a ball under scrambled cups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.
*   Performing tasks like "connect the dots" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
*   Multimodal outputs, including generating images (similar to Stable Diffusion) and music from prompts, even image-to-audio conversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
*   Proficiency in logic and spatial reasoning, demonstrated by its ability to determine which car would go faster based on aerodynamics from pictures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

The advancements in AI suggest that a range of professions, not just software engineering, could see significant changes.

### Engineering
AI models like Gemini could assist or even automate tasks in fields such as civil engineering. For instance, a civil engineer could take a picture of land, and the AI could instantly generate blueprints for a bridge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. This indicates that traditional engineering roles might be impacted by AI's analytical and generative capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

### Programming and Software Development
Google also introduced AlphaCode 2, an AI that performs better than 90% of competitive programmers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. This model can solve highly complex, abstract problems found in coding competitions like Codeforces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. AlphaCode 2 is capable of breaking down problems into smaller parts using techniques like dynamic programming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. These advancements have direct [[impact_of_ai_on_coding_and_programming_skills | impact on coding and programming skills]] and suggest a significant shift in the [[future_of_programming_with_ai | future of programming with AI]], leading to [[future_implications_of_deepthinking_ai_models_on_programming_jobs | future implications of deepthinking AI models on programming jobs]].

Gemini's ability to generate images and music, as well as understand and respond to video input, indicates a potential [[impact_of_ai_on_creative and technical professions | impact on creative and technical professions]]. Tasks requiring visual or auditory creation and interpretation could be augmented or, in some cases, automated by these AI capabilities.

## AI Benchmarks and Real-World Performance
While Google's demos for Gemini are impressive, its real-world performance varies depending on the model size. Gemini comes in three sizes: Nano (for devices like Android phones), Pro (general purpose), and Ultra (the largest and most powerful) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

Currently, the mid-range Gemini Pro is available in the Bard chatbot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. While an improvement over previous versions, it is acknowledged that Gemini Pro is not yet as capable as GPT-4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

However, Gemini Ultra shows exceptional performance on benchmarks, outperforming GPT-4 in nearly every category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. Notably, it is the first model to surpass human experts on the massive multitask language understanding (MMLU) benchmark, which tests across a wide array of subjects, similar to the SATs for AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

Conversely, Gemini Ultra underperforms GPT-4 on the HellaSwag benchmark, which evaluates common sense natural language understanding by asking the AI to finish vague or ambiguous sentences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. The ability to perform well on this benchmark is considered important for an AI to feel human-like <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.

The development of Gemini involved training on newly unveiled version 5 Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) deployed in "super PODS" of 4,096 chips, capable of dynamically reconfiguring their topology to reduce latency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. The training data includes extensive internet content, such as web pages, YouTube videos, scientific papers, and books, filtered for quality and fine-tuned using reinforcement learning with human feedback to avoid hallucinations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

While the smaller Gemini Nano and Pro models became available on Google Cloud on December 13th, the most powerful Gemini Ultra is not expected until next year, pending additional safety tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. The phased rollout underscores the ongoing safety and ethical considerations in the deployment of advanced AI, which will inevitably shape its [[impact_of_ai_on_job_markets_and_education | impact on job markets and education]].

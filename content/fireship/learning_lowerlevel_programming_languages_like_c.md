One common regret among experienced developers is not having learned [[lowlevel_systems_programming_languages | lower-level languages]] like [[c_language_characteristics_and_usage | C]] earlier in their careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:00">[05:09:00]</a>.

## Why Learn C?

Most programmers today begin their journey by learning [[beginner_programming_languages_and_learning_tools | high-level languages]] such as Python and JavaScript <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a>. It's possible to build an entire career without ever delving into languages lower than these <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>. However, even if direct use of a [[lowlevel_systems_programming_languages | low-level language]] is not a career requirement, understanding the basics of [[c_language_characteristics_and_usage | C]] can significantly enhance a programmer's overall skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>.

The speaker, having started with [[high-level languages]] like Java and PHP, expressed a preference for having learned [[c_language_characteristics_and_usage | C]] first if they could go back in time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>. This is because [[c_language_characteristics_and_usage | C]] provides an excellent foundation for all other programming concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a>.

## Getting Started with C

Learning the basics of [[c_language_characteristics_and_usage | C]] is often perceived as more difficult than it actually is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>. Resources like "100 seconds" tutorials or channels focused on low-level learning can aid in the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:00">[05:29:00]</a>. Successfully writing one's first piece of C code is jokingly referred to as officially becoming a "real programmer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:00">[05:34:00]</a>.

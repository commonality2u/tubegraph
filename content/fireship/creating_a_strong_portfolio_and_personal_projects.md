For a self-taught programmer, especially one without prior experience, creating an impressive personal project is crucial to demonstrate capability to potential employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. This project should be non-trivial and ideally something that is mind-blowing and cannot be ignored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

## Characteristics of a Strong Project
When building your portfolio, quality is significantly more important than quantity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.
*   **Focus on Quality over Quantity** Instead of having ten mediocre apps, aim for one truly awesome app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. Hiring managers, who are often experienced programmers, can discern if a portfolio is merely a collection of cookie-cutter projects recreated from tutorials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.
*   **Time Commitment** Allocate three to six months to develop something genuinely impressive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.
*   **Innovative Examples** Consider projects that showcase advanced skills, like Bruno Simon's portfolio, which uses 3js to create an interactive 3D landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. The goal is to elicit a reaction of "wow, that would not be an easy app to pull off" from other developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.

## Building in Public
An effective strategy is to "build in public" by transparently documenting the entire development process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.
*   **Blogging** The most common method is blogging. While platforms like Dev.to and Medium are easy to use, building and blogging on your own custom site expresses more passion for web development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.
*   **[[building_a_professional_online_presence_through_social_media | Social Media Documentation]]** Document the process on [[building_a_professional_online_presence_through_social_media | LinkedIn]] and [[building_a_professional_online_presence_through_social_media | Twitter]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.
*   **YouTube Channel** Consider starting your own YouTube channel to document the journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.
*   **Feedback Loop** Building in public creates a valuable feedback loop. You can provide feedback to other startups building in public, and in return, they will offer insights to improve your project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

## Potential Outcomes
A well-executed project built in public can lead to unexpected opportunities:
*   **Monetization** If your project is sufficiently good, you might accidentally create a job for yourself by monetizing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.
*   **Success Stories** An example is Superhuman, an email application built in public that gathered extensive feedback from potential customers during its development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. This approach can be applied to your personal brand while job searching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

[[basic_bash_commands_and_scripts | Bash]] offers capabilities for implementing [[boolean_algebra_in_programming | conditional logic]] and loops within its [[basic_bash_commands_and_scripts | scripts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>.

## Loops

You can create loops in [[basic_bash_commands_and_scripts | Bash]], such as a `do while` loop, to prompt a user for input to continue or exit a [[basic_bash_commands_and_scripts | script]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:53">[01:54:53]</a>.

## Conditional Logic

[[boolean_algebra_in_programming | Conditional logic]] can be implemented using an `if` statement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>. An `if` statement tests if a value on the left side is less than a value on the right side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:05">[02:05:05]</a>. If the condition is true, a specified [[basic_linux_commands_and_shell_usage | command]] will run; otherwise, an `else` [[basic_linux_commands_and_shell_usage | command]] will execute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.

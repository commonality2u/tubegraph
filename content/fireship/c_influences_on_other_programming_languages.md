From: [[fireship]] <br/> 

[[c_language_characteristics_and_usage | C]] is a statically typed procedural programming language, created in 1972 by Dennis Richie at Bell Labs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. It went on to become "the mother of all languages" due to its widespread influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Syntactic Inspiration
C's syntax has inspired many other programming languages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Languages whose syntax was directly influenced by C include:
*   C++ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>
*   C# <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>
*   [[javas_influence_on_other_programming_languages | Java]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>
*   [[popular_programming_languages_for_web_development | JavaScript]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>
*   Perl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>
*   [[popular_programming_languages_for_web_development | PHP]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>

## Low-Level Control
Although C is considered a high-level language designed for humans, it provides [[lowlevel_systems_programming_languages | low-level control]] over memory and hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. This capability, where code directly manages its own memory without a garbage collector, has been a defining characteristic that influences how memory is handled or abstracted in subsequent languages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

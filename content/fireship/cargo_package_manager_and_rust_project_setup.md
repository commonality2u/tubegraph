[[Rust]] utilizes a package manager known as Cargo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:54">[01:27:54]</a>. Each individual package in Rust is referred to as a "crate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:10">[01:29:10]</a>.

## Creating a New Project

To begin a new Rust project, first ensure that Rust is installed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:17">[01:30:17]</a>. Then, you can run the command `cargo new` from the command line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:17">[01:30:17]</a>.

## Project Structure

Within a new Rust project, you will find a `main.rs` file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:13">[01:32:13]</a>. This file contains the `main` function, which serves as the program's starting point for execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:01">[01:35:01]</a>.

## Compilation

To compile your Rust code into an executable, you use the [[rust_standard_library_and_compile_process | Rust compiler]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:08">[02:07:08]</a>. The resulting executable is designed to be memory-safe and capable of handling demanding [[rusts_performance_benefits_for_systems_programming | performance]] requirements for system-intensive applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:07">[02:09:07]</a>.

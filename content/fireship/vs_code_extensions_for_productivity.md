[[Modern code editors like Visual Studio Code and JetBrains | Visual Studio Code]] (VS Code) is a powerful tool for developers, offering numerous [[developer productivity tools | productivity-boosting features]] beyond a simple text editor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. While VS Code itself is robust, its functionality can be significantly enhanced through various extensions that streamline workflows and automate tedious tasks.

## Key Productivity Extensions

### Quokka
Quokka is an extension that automatically runs JavaScript code in the background and appends its output directly into the editor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. This feature facilitates rapid prototyping, especially when the goal is to write plain JavaScript code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. It can be started and stopped via the [[Command Palette Usage in VS Code | Command Palette]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

### Auto Rename Tag
The Auto Rename Tag extension automatically renames the closing HTML tag when the opening tag is edited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. It can also work with languages beyond HTML <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

### Add JSDoc Comments
For JavaScript projects, adhering to JSDoc standards for comments is common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. The Add JSDoc Comments extension allows users to highlight a function and then use the [[Command Palette Usage in VS Code | Command Palette]] to automatically add a comment block to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. Within JSDoc comments, the `@link` tag can be used to link to other symbols in the source code, providing interactive navigation when hovering or clicking the link <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

### Better Comments
The Better Comments extension enhances readability by providing automatic highlighting for comment text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. For example, lines starting with "!" can appear red, and "TODOs" can be highlighted in orange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.

### GitLens
For projects with multiple developers, the GitLens extension is highly recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. It offers additional ways to visualize and explore code changes within Git, including identifying who last modified a line of code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.

### Paste JSON as Code
When working with TypeScript, converting a JSON object into a set of TypeScript types for schema representation can be a tedious process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>. The Paste JSON as Code extension streamlines this by automatically inferring types from JSON data using a tool called QuickType, potentially saving hours of work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.

## Remote Development Extensions

Microsoft provides a suite of extensions that transform VS Code into a comprehensive Integrated Development Environment (IDE) by enabling remote development capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.

### Remote Repositories
This extension allows developers to work directly with Git repositories hosted on GitHub without needing to clone them to their local system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. Users can log in with their GitHub account and contribute to any repo, including creating new branches, editing code, and submitting pull requests, all from within VS Code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

### Remote SSH
The Remote SSH extension enables connection to a remote server directly from VS Code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.

### Remote Containers
With Remote Containers, developers can use a Docker container as their primary development environment instead of their local machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.

## Utilizing Pre-built Snippets

Beyond creating [[Custom Snippets and Boilerplate Code in VS Code | custom snippets]], the Extensions panel is a valuable resource for finding pre-built snippets provided by the community or framework authors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. These can often meet common needs without requiring custom configuration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.

## Conclusion

[[Using extensions and snippets in VS Code | Extensions]] are fundamental to maximizing [[developer productivity tools | productivity]] in VS Code. By leveraging both general and specialized extensions, developers can significantly speed up coding, improve code quality, and simplify complex tasks like version control and remote development.

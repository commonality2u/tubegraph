[[Introduction to CUDA | CUDA]] (Compute Unified Device Architecture) is a parallel computing platform developed by Nvidia in 2007, based on the prior work of Ian Buck and John Nichols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It enables the use of a [[GPU vs CPU in Parallel Computing | Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)]] for general-purpose computation beyond just graphics rendering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Since its inception, [[Introduction to CUDA | CUDA]] has significantly advanced the field of artificial intelligence by allowing large blocks of data to be computed in parallel, unleashing the potential of deep neural networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## GPU vs. CPU in Parallel Computing

Historically, [[GPU vs CPU in Parallel Computing | GPUs]] were designed for graphics computation, performing extensive matrix multiplication and vector transformations in parallel to render millions of pixels at high frame rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Modern [[GPU vs CPU in Parallel Computing | GPUs]], like the RTX 4090, boast over 16,000 cores and are measured in teraflops, indicating trillions of floating-point operations per second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. In contrast, modern [[GPU vs CPU in Parallel Computing | CPUs]], such as the Intel i9, typically have around 24 cores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. While [[GPU vs CPU in Parallel Computing | CPUs]] are designed for versatility, [[GPU vs CPU in Parallel Computing | GPUs]] are optimized for rapid parallel processing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

[[Introduction to CUDA | CUDA]] allows developers to leverage this massive parallel power of [[GPU vs CPU in Parallel Computing | GPUs]], which is crucial for training powerful [[Optimizing with CUDA for Deep Learning | machine learning models]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## How CUDA Works

The general workflow for a [[Introduction to CUDA | CUDA]] application involves the following steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>:
1.  **Write a [[CUDA Kernels and Functions | CUDA kernel]]:** A function designed to run on the [[GPU vs CPU in Parallel Computing | GPU]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
2.  **Copy Data:** Transfer necessary data from the main system RAM to the [[GPU vs CPU in Parallel Computing | GPU's]] memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
3.  **Execute Kernel:** The [[GPU vs CPU in Parallel Computing | CPU]] instructs the [[GPU vs CPU in Parallel Computing | GPU]] to execute the [[CUDA Kernels and Functions | kernel]] in parallel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. This code execution is organized into blocks, which in turn organize threads into a multi-dimensional grid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
4.  **Copy Results:** The final result from the [[GPU vs CPU in Parallel Computing | GPU]] is copied back to the main memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

## Building a Basic CUDA Application

To build a [[Introduction to CUDA | CUDA]] application, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
*   An Nvidia [[GPU vs CPU in Parallel Computing | GPU]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
*   The [[Introduction to CUDA | CUDA]] toolkit, which includes device drivers, a runtime, compilers, and development tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

### Coding the Application
[[Introduction to CUDA | CUDA]] code is most often written in [[Applications and usage of C | C++]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

#### 1. Define the CUDA Kernel
Use the `__global__` specifier to define a function (a [[CUDA Kernels and Functions | CUDA kernel]]) that runs on the [[GPU vs CPU in Parallel Computing | GPU]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

```cpp
// Example: Vector Addition Kernel
__global__ void addVectors(const int* A, const int* B, int* C) {
    // Calculate the global index of the thread
    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    // Perform the operation for this element
    C[i] = A[i] + B[i];
}
```
*   The function takes pointer arguments for the input vectors (`A`, `B`) and the result vector (`C`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
*   Inside the kernel, calculate the global index of the thread using `blockIdx.x`, `blockDim.x`, and `threadIdx.x` to identify which element the current thread is responsible for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
*   For data access, the `managed` keyword can be used to tell [[Introduction to CUDA | CUDA]] that data can be accessed from both the host [[GPU vs CPU in Parallel Computing | CPU]] and the device [[GPU vs CPU in Parallel Computing | GPU]] without manual copying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

#### 2. Write the Main CPU Function
The `main` function for the [[GPU vs CPU in Parallel Computing | CPU]] is responsible for launching the [[CUDA Kernels and Functions | CUDA kernel]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

```cpp
int main() {
    // 1. Initialize arrays with data (e.g., using a for loop)
    // For simplicity, using raw pointers. In practice, use C++ vectors or managed memory.
    int* A, *B, *C;
    int N = 256; // Example size

    // Allocate managed memory (accessible by both CPU and GPU)
    cudaMallocManaged(&A, N * sizeof(int));
    cudaMallocManaged(&B, N * sizeof(int));
    cudaMallocManaged(&C, N * sizeof(int));

    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        A[i] = i;
        B[i] = i * 2;
    }

    // 2. Configure and launch the CUDA kernel
    // Example: Launch 1 block with 256 threads
    int threadsPerBlock = 256;
    int blocksPerGrid = (N + threadsPerBlock - 1) / threadsPerBlock;
    addVectors<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(A, B, C);

    // 3. Synchronize device execution
    cudaDeviceSynchronize();

    // 4. Use the result and print it to standard output
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        printf("%d + %d = %d\n", A[i], B[i], C[i]);
    }

    // Free managed memory
    cudaFree(A);
    cudaFree(B);
    cudaFree(C);

    return 0;
}
```

*   **Initialization:** Use a `for` loop to initialize arrays with data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
*   **Kernel Launch Configuration:** The triple brackets `<<<>>>` are used to configure the [[CUDA Kernels and Functions | CUDA kernel]] launch. They control the number of blocks and threads per block used to run the code in parallel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. This configuration is crucial for [[Optimizing with CUDA for Deep Learning | optimizing multi-dimensional data structures]] like tensors used in [[Optimizing with CUDA for Deep Learning | deep learning]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   **Synchronization:** `cudaDeviceSynchronize()` pauses the [[GPU vs CPU in Parallel Computing | CPU's]] execution until the [[GPU vs CPU in Parallel Computing | GPU]] has completed its operations and copied the data back to the host machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
*   **Result Handling:** Once synchronization is complete, the results can be used and printed to the standard output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

### Compilation and Execution
After writing the code, compile it using the [[Introduction to CUDA | CUDA]] compiler (often integrated into IDEs like Visual Studio, where a "play button" can execute the code) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. This process compiles the [[CUDA Kernels and Functions | kernel]] for the [[GPU vs CPU in Parallel Computing | GPU]] and the `main` function for the [[GPU vs CPU in Parallel Computing | CPU]], linking them into an executable.

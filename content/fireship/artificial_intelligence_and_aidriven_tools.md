Artificial intelligence (AI) has significantly advanced in recent years, impacting developers directly with new tools and trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

## AI's Impact on Developers

In 2021, AI began to affect developers through tools like GitHub Co-pilot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. GitHub Co-pilot is an AI-driven tool that automatically writes [[programming_software | code]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. While it's not yet at a point where it can replace developers, this possibility is anticipated in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.

### Dominance of Large Corporations

Currently, AI is largely dominated by major companies that control powerful algorithms, such as GPT-3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. It is extremely challenging for individuals or startups to train AI models that can compete with these, primarily due to the massive amounts of data required and the substantial computing power needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. This challenge could become even more pronounced if quantum computers become widely useful for training AI models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

### Data Science Skills

Despite the dominance of large companies, learning data science remains a valuable skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. Processing and analyzing vast amounts of data is still a difficult task, leading to many high-paying job opportunities in this role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

## AI in Databases

AI is also being integrated into databases, such as MindsDB, to simplify [[aws_machine_learning_and_analytics | machine learning]] workflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

## Startup Ideas Leveraging AI

One potential startup idea involves utilizing the public API for GPT-3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. For example, an AI-driven psychic hotline could use GPT-3 to automatically generate responses, allowing customers to interact with "lost loved ones" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

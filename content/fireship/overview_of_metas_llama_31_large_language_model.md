Meta has released Llama 3.1, its largest and most advanced large language model (LLM) to date, which is free and largely considered open source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Development and Technical Specifications

Training Llama 3.1 involved months of work on 16,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs, a process estimated to have cost hundreds of millions of dollars and consumed enough electricity to power a small country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. The flagship model is a massive 405 billion parameter model with a 128,000 token context length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

Llama 3.1 is available in three sizes: 8B, 70B, and 405B, where 'B' denotes billions of parameters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. These parameters are the variables the model uses to make predictions; generally, more parameters can capture more complex patterns, although more parameters do not always guarantee a better model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. The model uses a relatively simple decoder-only Transformer architecture, distinguishing it from mixture-of-experts approaches found in models like its open-source rival, Mixtral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. The actual training code is only about 300 lines of Python and PyTorch, utilizing Fair Scale for distributed training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

## [[the_open_source_aspects_of_llama_31_and_licensing | Open Source Aspects and Licensing]]

A significant aspect of Llama 3.1 is its [[the_open_source_aspects_of_llama_31_and_licensing | open-source]] nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. While users can monetize applications built with Llama 3.1, a license from Meta is required if an application exceeds 700 million monthly active users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Crucially, the model weights are open, which is a major advantage for developers creating AI-powered applications, potentially reducing reliance on costly APIs like GPT-4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. However, the training data, which may include publicly available information like blogs, GitHub repositories, Facebook posts, and potentially WhatsApp messages, is not open source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

## [[Technical details and performance of Llama 31 | Performance and Benchmarks]]

According to benchmarks, Llama 3.1 is mostly superior to [[comparison_of_llama_31_with_openais_gpt_models | OpenAI's GPT-4o]] and even outperforms Claude 3.5 Sonnet on some key metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. Initial feedback from the community suggests that the larger Llama models might be somewhat disappointing, while the smaller versions are quite impressive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

### [[Challenges and testing with language models | Testing and Capabilities]]
In practical testing, Llama 3.1's 405B model struggled with complex coding tasks, specifically failing to generate a Svelte 5 web application with Runes, a feature it seemed unaware of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. This task was previously only correctly accomplished by Claude 3.5 Sonnet in a single attempt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. Overall, while decent at coding, it still lags behind Claude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. For creative writing and poetry, Llama 3.1 performs well but is not considered the best available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

The true strength of Llama models lies in their ability to be fine-tuned with custom data, which is expected to lead to amazing [[uncensored large language models | uncensored fine-tuned models]] in the near future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

## Availability and Hosting

Self-hosting the larger Llama 3.1 model is not cheap; for instance, the 405B model's weights alone weigh 230 GB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. Although local use with tools like Ollama is possible, it requires substantial hardware like an RTX 4090 GPU <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. Fortunately, users can try Llama 3.1 for free on platforms such as Meta's own platform, Groq, or Nvidia's Playground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

## Industry Impact

Llama 3.1's release highlights a current plateau in large language model capabilities across various companies, with [[Overview of OpenAIs o1 model | OpenAI's]] GPT-4 being a significant leap, but subsequent advancements being incremental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. Despite earlier concerns about AI's rapid advancement and potential threats, artificial super intelligence remains distant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. Meta is seen as a key player in keeping the AI space "real," offering an important step forward for general users and developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

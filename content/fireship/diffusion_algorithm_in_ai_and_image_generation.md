The Diffusion algorithm is a machine learning algorithm that serves as the basis for modern [[creating_aigenerated_images_using_stable_diffusion | AI image generators]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. It was originally developed at [[openai_gpt_40_image_generator | OpenAI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

## Conceptual Origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>

The concept of diffusion originates from thermodynamics, where particles naturally spread from areas of higher concentration to lower concentration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. In artificial intelligence, the Diffusion algorithm reverses this process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

## How it Works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>

The algorithm operates in two primary phases:

1.  **Forward Phase (Noise Addition)**: The algorithm begins by gradually adding noise to an image, step by step, until the image becomes completely random <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. This is analogous to moving from a structured state to high entropy in thermodynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
2.  **Reverse Phase (Image Reconstruction)**: In the second phase, the algorithm reverses the noise addition process, reconstructing the random noise back into a coherent, structured image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. This is akin to moving towards lower entropy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

To function effectively, a model must first be trained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. This training involves running the algorithm over millions of labeled images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. Through this process, a collection of "weights" is generated, which can then be used to create entirely new images from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

## Applications and Future Directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>

The Diffusion algorithm is highly compute-intensive but is capable of generating new images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. Beyond images, it also performs well with audio generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. The next frontier for Diffusion is video generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

[[Introduction to TensorFlowjs | TensorFlow.js]] is a JavaScript library that enables users to [[building_and_training_machine_learning_models_in_the_browser | build, train, and make predictions from machine learning models directly in the browser]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. A key feature of [[Introduction to TensorFlowjs | TensorFlow.js]] is its ability to import models that have been trained in Python <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. This functionality allows developers to create machine learning models on a local system and then upload them to a web application for users to interact with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

## Why Transfer Models from Python?

Training complex neural networks can be very CPU and memory intensive, making it impractical to run the training process directly in the browser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. By training models in Python environments, which typically have better access to computational resources (like GPUs), developers can leverage the strengths of Python for model development and then deploy the pre-trained models to the web using [[Introduction to TensorFlowjs | TensorFlow.js]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

## The Conversion Process

The process involves training a model in Python, exporting it, and then converting it to a format compatible with [[Introduction to TensorFlowjs | TensorFlow.js]].

### 1. Training with Keras

Many machine learning models can be built and trained using Keras in Python <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. Keras allows you to export your trained model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.

### 2. Installing the Conversion Tool

[[Introduction to TensorFlowjs | TensorFlow.js]] provides a tool to convert Keras models into a [[Introduction to TensorFlowjs | TensorFlow.js]] compatible format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. To install this tool, you need to install `tensorflowjs` using the Python package manager `pip` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

### 3. Converting the Model

Once installed, the `tensorflowjs` tool provides a command to convert the Keras file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. This command not only converts the model to [[Introduction to TensorFlowjs | TensorFlow.js]] format but also shards the file, which allows for efficient loading on the web <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.

### 4. Hosting the Converted Model

For web deployment, the converted model files should ideally be hosted in a cloud storage bucket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. While local asset directories can be used for development (e.g., the assets directory in Angular) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>, cloud storage is recommended for real-world applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

### 5. Loading the Model in JavaScript

After conversion and hosting, the model can be loaded into your JavaScript application. For example, within an Angular application, you can add a method to `ngOnInit` to load the model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. Pre-trained models can be loaded with a simple `tensorflow.loadModel` call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

## Making Predictions with Imported Models

When making predictions with an imported model in [[Introduction to TensorFlowjs | TensorFlow.js]], specific considerations apply:

### Memory Management
Neural networks can consume significant memory, so it's important to prevent memory leaks in client-side applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. This can be achieved by running code inside the `tensorflow.tidy` method, which ensures that all tensors are released from memory once a prediction is finished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

### Data Preparation
Input data needs to be prepared in the correct format for the model:
*   **Conversion to Tensor**: Image data, for example, extracted from an HTML canvas, can be converted into a tensor suitable for the [[Introduction to TensorFlowjs | TensorFlow.js]] graph <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.
*   **Reshaping**: The data needs to be reshaped to match the dimensions the model was trained on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. For instance, a model trained with 28x28 pixel images with one color channel would require the input tensor to be reshaped to `[batch_size, 28, 28, 1]` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. The batch size is typically 1 for a single image prediction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.
*   **Data Type Conversion**: If the Python model was trained using an integer data type, [[Introduction to TensorFlowjs | TensorFlow.js]] might require it to be a floating-point type. This conversion can be done using `tensorflow.cast`, as all data types within a tensor must be consistent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.

Once the data is in the correct format, it can be passed to the model's `predict` method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. The prediction will be returned as a tensor, which then needs to be converted into an array for use in the application, by calling `dataSync` on the tensor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.

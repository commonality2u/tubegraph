The worldwide web is considered a critical pillar of human civilization today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. John Perry Barlow referred to it as "cyberspace, the new home of the Mind" in his "Declaration of Independence of Cyberspace" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. He envisioned a world where anyone, anywhere, could express their beliefs without fear of coercion or conformity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

The freedom offered by the web has had profound impacts, including causing governments to fail, minting millions of new millionaires, and allowing humble cat memes to be viewed trillions of times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## The Threat to Openness: Browser Centralization

Despite its foundational importance, there is an existential threat to the web's openness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Users access cyberspace primarily through web browsers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. Chrome, Safari, Edge, and Firefox collectively account for over 90% of the browser market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. Critically, these browsers either share technology or receive funding controlled by Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. This consolidation means that hypothetically, if Google were to act maliciously, it could exert significant control over internet content, such as removing specific types of content like cat memes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

The "browser wars" are currently ongoing, with new developments like Firefox launching sidebar-managed tabs, a feature already supported by the Arc browser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## Efforts to Counter Centralization: Open Source Browsers

In response to this centralization, several open-source browsers are emerging:
*   **Verso**: Built with the Servo engine and written in Rust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
*   **Blitz**: A super minimal web renderer, also built in Rust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

### Ladybird: A Futuristic Open Source Browser

One of the most ambitious projects is Ladybird, a futuristic open-source browser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

#### Origin Story
The project began in October 2018 with Andreas Kling, a software engineer who previously worked on WebKit at Apple and Nokia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. After a three-month Swedish rehab program, Kling found himself unemployed and bored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. This boredom led him to extreme endeavors, such as building his own operating system, Serenity OS, from scratch, including everything from the kernel to a web browser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. Serenity OS features a 1990s GUI and a late 2000s Unix CLI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. The name "Serenity OS" is derived from the Serenity Prayer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>:
> "God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>

#### Ladybird's Independence and Development
On July 4, 2022, the Serenity OS browser engine declared its independence as a cross-platform project and was renamed Ladybird <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. Two years later, with over a thousand contributors and half a million lines of C++ code, Andreas Kling partnered with one of GitHub's co-founders to establish a non-profit organization to manage the browser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. The project operates on the belief that having no incentives is the best way to avoid bad incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

Ladybird is funded entirely by sponsorships and donations, and its code is entirely free and does not borrow from other browsers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. This distinguishes it even from privacy-focused browsers like Brave, which is for-profit and built on Google's Chromium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

#### Challenges and Future
Developing a web browser from scratch is an extremely complex undertaking, with many believing it to be impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. Browser engines must adhere to the W3C specification, which contains over 4 million words and constantly evolves with new features, raising the barrier to entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. Ladybird's developers have built their own HTML and JS engines, creatively named `libHTML` and `libJS`, respectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. They also leverage established tools like FFmpeg for video support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

The project is currently in the "make it work" phase of software development, with "make it good" and "make it faster" phases yet to come <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

The first alpha version for [[History of Linux | Linux]] and Mac OS is not expected until the summer of 2026, with the Windows version arriving even later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. However, the code is available on GitHub for those who wish to build it from source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

Regardless of the market share Ladybird ultimately achieves, its existence is beneficial as it challenges the increasing consolidation of power on the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

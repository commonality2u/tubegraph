[[Introduction to Linux | Linux]] is a revolution based on the principle that software should be free and open <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Its history is deeply intertwined with the development of various [[Linux distribution options | Linux distributions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Origins of [[History of Linux | Linux]] and Early Development

The [[History and creation of Linux | Linux]] project began on August 25, 1991, when Linus Torvalds, a 21-year-old graduate student in Helsinki, announced he was creating a free operating system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. What started as a hobby evolved into one of the most significant projects in computing history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

Before [[Introduction to Linux | Linux]], the Unix operating system was created in 1969 by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. Unix was popular with businesses and universities, but its code was owned by AT&T <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. This led to issues like AT&T suing UC Berkeley in 1977 over their Berkeley Software Distribution, which restricted Unix development and started the "Unix wars" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

In 1983, Richard Stallman initiated the GNU project, aiming for a free and open replacement for Unix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. By the early 1990s, GNU had many applications like `tar`, `bash`, and `emacs`, but it lacked an operating system kernel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. An operating system kernel sits between hardware and software, allocating CPU and memory resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

It was around this time that Linus Torvalds was developing his hobby operating system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. Though he initially considered naming it "Freeax," the FTP server admin changed it to "[[Introduction to Linux | Linux]]" without his consent, and the name stuck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

Initially, [[Introduction to Linux | Linux]] was released with a proprietary license, but by the end of 1992, it was released under the GNU General Public License <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. This union created the complete operating system known today as GNU/[[Introduction to Linux | Linux]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. The [[Linux kernel and its role | beauty of the Linux kernel]] allowed developers to build custom operating systems that felt like Unix but without the legal risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. This led to the first [[Linux Distributions and their Origins | Linux distributions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

> [!INFO] What is a [[Linux distribution options | Linux Distro]]?
> A distribution (distro) is a complete operating system based on the [[Linux kernel and its role | Linux kernel]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. It typically includes packages, libraries, a package manager, and often a windowing system for a graphical user interface (GUI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. Many distros share common user interfaces like Gnome, KDE Plasma, MATE, or Cinnamon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. Today, there are nearly a thousand different [[Linux distribution options | Linux distros]], each customized for specific purposes, such as enterprise, home users, servers, or embedded devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. Each distro is usually supported by a community with its own philosophical and technical opinions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

## Prominent [[Linux distribution options | Linux Distributions]]

### Early Adopters and Persistent Survivors

Some of the first [[Linux Distributions and their Origins | Linux distributions]] included Softlanding, Yggdrasil, and Slackware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. Most older distros are no longer maintained, but Slackware is an exception, having released updates as recently as 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

*   **Slackware**: One of the earliest distros, it has spawned variations, most notably the openSUSE project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
*   **openSUSE**: A popular general-purpose distro often associated with professional power users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

### The Debian Family Tree

The most significant distro from 1993 was Debian, established by Ian Murdock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. Its name combines Ian's name with his ex-wife's name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. Debian's first official release, version 1.1 Buzz, came out in 1996, and subsequent releases are code-named after Toy Story characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

*   **Debian**:
    *   Known for its advanced package tool (APT), originally called Deity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
    *   Has a large community and is popular on servers, though it can also be used as a general-purpose distro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.
    *   Its minimal and stable nature has allowed it to father a vast number of offspring distros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.
    *   Specialized descendants include Raspberry Pi OS and SteamOS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

*   **Ubuntu**:
    *   The most popular child of Debian, first released in 2004 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.
    *   Managed by British company Canonical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.
    *   Follows a semi-annual release schedule, with releases named after an animal and a word starting with the same letter (e.g., Cosmic Cuttlefish) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.
    *   Extremely beginner-friendly and helped bring [[Introduction to Linux | Linux]] to mainstream home computer users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
    *   Despite recent criticisms from the [[Introduction to Linux | Linux]] community for closed-source software and data selling, it remains very popular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.
    *   Has various official "flavors" like Kubuntu, Xubuntu, and Lubuntu, which offer variations on the original <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. Kubuntu, for instance, is designed as a great entry point for those transitioning from Microsoft Windows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
    *   Other notable variations spawned from Ubuntu include [[Linux distribution options | Linux Mint]], Peppermint, and Pop!_OS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.

### The Red Hat Family

Another influential [[Linux distribution options | Linux distro]] with a large family tree is Red Hat, created by Marc Ewing in 1994 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

*   **Red Hat**:
    *   Known for its focus on security and reliability for enterprise users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.
    *   Adopted a business model of maintaining an open-source operating system and generating revenue by selling consulting, integration, and add-on services to large enterprise clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.
    *   Generates billions in revenue and was acquired by IBM for an 11-figure price tag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.
    *   Most of its descendants are associated with enterprise work and use either the RPM or YUM package manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
    *   Popular descendants include RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux), CentOS, and Fedora <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

*   **Fedora**: Not only great for enterprise servers but also effective as a personal workstation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. It is notably the distro of choice for Linus Torvalds himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

### Minimalist and Performance-Focused Distros

In the early 2000s, two [[Linux distribution options | Linux families]] emerged focusing on simplicity, performance, and minimalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

*   **Gentoo**: Emerged in 2000 with its Enoch distro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.
*   **Arch**: Released in 2002 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.
    *   Favored for its simplicity, using its own package manager called Pacman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.
    *   Adopts a "rolling release" model, continuously delivering small updates rather than major new versions every few months like Ubuntu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.
    *   Parent of Manjaro, one of today's most popular distros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

### Independent and Specialized Distros

Many popular independent [[Linux distribution options | distros]] exist beyond these family trees:

*   **Alpine**: An extremely lightweight option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.
*   **Fire OS**: Used for Amazon devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.
*   **Android**: Used by billions daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

## The [[Role of Linux Kernel in Operating Systems | Role of Linux Kernel]] and the Diversity of Distros

The multitude of [[Linux distribution options | Linux distros]] can be understood by thinking of the [[Linux kernel and its role | Linux kernel]] as an "engine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. Just as different cars are designed for speed, comfort, enterprise, or fun, [[Linux distribution options | Linux distros]] are customized for varied purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. For a developer, [[Introduction to Linux | Linux]] acts as a free engine to build a custom system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. This freedom, combined with GNU and the broader open-source ecosystem, encourages innovation and new developments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Git Creation
> In 2005, the source code for [[Introduction to Linux | Linux]] was managed under a proprietary version control system called BitKeeper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. Due to its proprietary nature, Linus Torvalds created Git <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.

Even Microsoft now fully supports [[Introduction to Linux | Linux]] through its WSL project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. The evolution of [[Linux Distributions and their Origins | Linux distributions]] over time showcases the dynamic and collaborative nature of the open-source community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

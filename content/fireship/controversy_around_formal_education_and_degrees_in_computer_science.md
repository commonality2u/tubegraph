The necessity of a formal computer science degree for a successful career in programming is a widely debated topic in the tech industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

## Arguments Against Needing a Degree

Many influencers suggest that a degree is not a prerequisite for success as a programmer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. The prevailing sentiment is that formal college education is unnecessary because "everything is available basically for free" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. One can learn "anything you want for free" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

Indeed, many large companies have removed degree requirements for developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. The speaker, for instance, does not possess a computer science degree, having learned everything through self-study or on the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. Many other highly paid developers also lack a degree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>, reinforcing the idea that a degree is not essential to break into the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

## Arguments for Pursuing a Degree

Despite the success stories of self-taught programmers, some argue that a computer science degree contributes to being a more well-rounded programmer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. The speaker, if given the chance to go back in time, would likely pursue a computer science degree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

A degree can provide a fast track to opportunities like internships at major companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. Furthermore, a foundational knowledge gained from a formal education would likely enhance a programmer's skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

## Cost-Benefit Analysis

A key consideration in the [[value_of_obtaining_a_computer_science_degree | value of obtaining a computer science degree]] is whether it is worth the significant investment of four years and potentially "a hundred thousand dollars in student debt" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. College is not suitable for everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>, and a notable advantage of the tech industry is the ability to achieve success without a degree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

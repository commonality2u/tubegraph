To understand [[linux_system_architecture_and_components | Linux]], it's essential to first understand its predecessor, Unix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Unix
Unix is an [[linux_system_architecture_and_components | operating system]] developed at AT&T Bell Labs in the 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## POSIX Standard
The development of Unix led to the creation of a standardization known as POSIX <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. POSIX stands for "Portable [[linux_system_architecture_and_components | Operating System]] Interface" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Its primary purpose was to ensure compatibility between different systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

### Influence of POSIX
The influence of POSIX remains significant today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. Modern systems such as macOS, Android, FreeBSD, and most [[linux_distributions_and_desktop_environments | Linux distributions]] are POSIX compliant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

The release of GPT 4.5 has led to an observation that the "AI hype train" is now "on life support" due to the model's underwhelming capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This suggests that instead of a "technological singularity," the world might be heading towards a "sigmoid of sorrow" in [[future_trends_in_technology | technological advancements]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. A key question being raised is whether the limits of pre-training in generative pre-trained transformers have been reached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Current State of AI Models

GPT 4.5, unveiled by OpenAI, is noted as the most expensive AI model produced to date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Despite its cost, it reportedly fails to "crush any benchmarks, win any awards, or offer any novel capabilities whatsoever" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Its primary selling point is its ability to "chat in a more natural human-like way," described as "Vibes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

The model's expense is significant, costing $75 per million input tokens and $150 per million output tokens, making it five times more expensive than Claude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Currently, it is exclusively available to $200 per month Pro users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

OpenAI introduced a new "Vibes Benchmark" to measure creative thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. While GPT 4.5 reportedly has a lower hallucination rate, it still makes "silly mistakes" and lacks self-awareness, not knowing what GPT 4.5 is and citing an incorrect training cut-off date of October 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. For programming and science tasks, it is not expected to perform as well as "deep thinking models" like 03 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. On the AER polyglot coding benchmark, GPT 4.5 is described as worse at programming than DeepSeek and hundreds of times more expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. These points highlight some of the [[limitations_and_challenges_of_current_ai_technologies | limitations and challenges of current AI technologies]].

## Competition and Scaling

As of late February 2025, xAI's Groq is considered the "best model in the world" according to betting markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. While OpenAI is still favored to have the best model by the end of 2025, its odds are declining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

OpenAI is raising billions of dollars as it transitions to a for-profit entity, needing to maintain a massive valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. Sam Altman, OpenAI's CEO, believes there is "no wall" and that these models can be scaled almost infinitely, assuming significant investment from entities like SoftBank and the Saudis to build data centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

## Future Expectations and Outlook

A theory suggests that OpenAI may have failed to train GPT-5 with significant improvements despite scaling up parameters and compute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. GPT 4.5 is noted as the largest model OpenAI has ever created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

Expectations for GPT-5 are being lowered, with Altman describing it as more like a "router" that automatically chooses the best model based on a user's prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. This revised expectation contrasts with earlier, more futuristic predictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. This represents a significant shift in [[future_prospects_of_computing_technology | future prospects of computing technology]].

## Implications for Professions

For computer science students and programmers, this perceived "plateau" in AI development is seen as good news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. [[Developments in artificial intelligence and AIpowered tools | AI coding tools]], while "incredible," are considered most useful to human programmers who possess foundational knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. This suggests that the role of human programmers is unlikely to change significantly in the near future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. This perspective offers insight into the [[implications_of_ai_advancements_on_different_professions | implications of AI advancements on different professions]] and the [[future_of_programming_with_ai | future of programming with AI]]. It indicates that the [[future_of_programming_and_ai_agents | future of programming and AI agents]] will likely see collaboration rather than replacement, challenging some [[future_implications_of_ai_in_programming | future implications of AI in programming]] and [[future_implications_of_deepthinking_ai_models_on_programming_jobs | deepthinking AI models on programming jobs]].

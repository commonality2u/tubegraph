Holy C is a custom programming language developed by Terry Davis, the creator of TempleOS, an open-source 64-bit operating system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Davis, an exceptionally talented programmer diagnosed with schizophrenia, wrote the entire operating system, including its core components and applications, using Holy C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. He believed he was "God's chosen programmer" and implemented features described as a modern-day way of "speaking in tongues" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Core Features

The underlying language, Holy C, resembles [[c_language_characteristics_and_usage|C]] or C++ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. However, it possesses distinct characteristics:
*   **Unique Function Invocation** Functions can be invoked without the need for parentheses or arguments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
*   **Just-In-Time Compilation** Holy C utilizes just-in-time compilation, allowing it to double as a shell language that can be executed directly from the terminal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This differs from other operating systems like Linux or Windows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## Integration with TempleOS

Holy C is integral to TempleOS, powering all its components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. The operating system's bootloader, kernel, window manager, 3D graphics library, and multiple games are all built with Holy C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

TempleOS operates entirely in "ring zero," meaning everything, including user programs, happens directly within the kernel. This design grants users complete control over the operating system's source code and hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. Users can easily open the source code, make modifications, and then "Holy C reboot and enjoy" the changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. This level of accessibility is facilitated by the Red Sea File System, which makes every line of code readily available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

The entire operating system, written in Holy C, remarkably fits under 100,000 lines of code and occupies only 1.4 megabytes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

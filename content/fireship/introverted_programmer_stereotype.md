The introvert is considered the most stereotypical programmer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Characteristics
This stereotype is often described as a savant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Their ideal lifestyle is likened to what society calls "quarantine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. An introverted programmer is typically very good at math and can program without relying on Google or Stack Overflow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. However, they struggle with holding conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

Historically, this stereotype was "100% true" when programming was considered more difficult, specifically before the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Extroverted individuals, such as Steve Jobs, were known to leverage introverted programmers like Steve Wozniak to achieve significant wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## Comparison to the New Paradigm Programmer
As programming became more mainstream, a "new paradigm" programmer emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. This new archetype tends to have more social opportunities than the introvert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a> and possesses better communication skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

One of the most dreaded messages a software engineer can receive is a cloud billing alert, particularly when working with services like [[aws_cloud_computing_solutions | AWS]]. These alerts can notify you that a modest budget, for example, $25, has been exceeded by millions of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:47">[01:48:47]</a>.

## Causes and (Humorous) Reactions to Cloud Billing Alerts

Such catastrophic billing alerts often occur if a wrong button was clicked or an infinite loop was accidentally created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>. When faced with such an alert, the immediate advice is not to panic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:94">[02:02:94]</a>.

Humorous "solutions" proposed for dealing with an overwhelming cloud bill include:
*   **Abandoning the service** The easiest solution is to stop using [[aws_cloud_computing_solutions | AWS]] and pretend nothing ever happened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:97">[02:03:97]</a>.
*   **Feigning a hack** If approached by the service provider, one could claim their account was hacked, though this may not always work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:24">[02:08:24]</a>.
*   **Finding solidarity** There is comfort in knowing that many others have faced similar issues, such as forgetting to turn off an [[overview_of_aws_services | EC2 instance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:93">[02:12:93]</a>.

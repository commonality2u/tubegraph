The worldwide web is considered a critical pillar of human civilization, enabling free expression and significant economic and social impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Access to this "cyberspace" is primarily through web browsers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. Currently, Chrome, Safari, Edge, and Firefox dominate over 90% of the market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. A significant concern is that much of this browser technology or funding is controlled by Google, posing an existential threat to the web's openness if power becomes too consolidated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## The Modern Browser Wars

Today, the [[importance_and_impact_of_browser_competition | browser wars]] are ongoing, with new [[development_of_open_source_web_browsers | open-source web browsers]] emerging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. Examples include Firefox's new sidebar tab management, features already present in the Arc browser, and newer open-source browsers like Verso (built with the Servo engine) and Blitz (a minimal web renderer), both developed in Rust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## Case Study: Ladybird Browser

An ambitious [[development_of_open_source_web_browsers | open-source web browser]] project called Ladybird exemplifies the immense [[challenges_of_finishing_software_projects | challenges involved]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. The project began in October 2018 when Andreas Kling, a former Apple and Nokia software engineer, started building his own operating system, SerenityOS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. This required building everything from the kernel to the web browser from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

On July 4, 2022, the SerenityOS browser engine became an independent, cross-platform project, renamed Ladybird <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. After two years, over a thousand contributors, and half a million lines of C++ code, Andreas Kling and a GitHub co-founder formed a non-profit to manage the browser, aiming for "no incentives" to prevent bad outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. Ladybird is funded entirely by sponsorships and donations, and its code is completely free, explicitly not borrowing from other browsers like Brave, which is built on Google's Chromium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

### The Disappointing Timeline
The first Alpha version of Ladybird for Linux and macOS is not expected until the summer of 2026, with a Windows version even further in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

## Core Challenges in Browser Development

Building a web browser from scratch is regarded as "extremely complex" and, by general consensus, "impossible to pull off" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

### Immense Complexity
For [[introduction_to_web_development | web developers]] to build websites using HTML, CSS, and [[state_of_javascript_in_modern_development | JavaScript]], browser engines must adhere to the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) specification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. This specification is over 4 million words long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

For Ladybird, developers had to build their own HTML and JavaScript engines, named `libHTML` and `libjs`, respectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. They also leverage established [[web_application_tools_for_developers | tools]] like FFMPEG for video rendering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

### Constant Evolution and Barrier to Entry
The W3C specification constantly evolves with new features, continuously raising the barrier to entry for new browser development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. This makes it a monumental undertaking, far from a "weekend project" that can be generated by AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

### Long Development Cycle
The general [[challenges_of_finishing_software_projects | software development cycle]] progresses from "make it work" to "make it good" to "make it faster" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. Ladybird is currently in the initial "make it work" phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

## The Importance of the Effort

Despite the immense [[challenges_of_finishing_software_projects | challenges]], the effort to create new browsers like Ladybird is beneficial for everyone, regardless of market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. It helps counteract the increasing consolidation of power on the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

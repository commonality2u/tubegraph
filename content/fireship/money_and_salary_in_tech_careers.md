In the programming world, the amount of money an individual makes is presented as directly tied to the value they bring to the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39">[01:39]</a>. This correlation forms the basis of the "money flex," a way programmers boost their ego by showcasing their earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37">[01:37]</a>.

## The "Money Flex" Hierarchy

The concept of the "money flex" illustrates a hierarchical progression of earnings and perceived value in the tech industry:

*   **Junior Developer Flex** A junior developer earning $50,000 annually might "flex" on former colleagues making $45,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42">[01:42]</a>.
*   **Negotiation Flex** A peer in the next cubicle, having negotiated a better salary, earns $225,000 per year, out-flexing the junior developer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49">[01:49]</a>.
*   **FAANG Engineer Flex** An engineer at Netflix, earning $900,000 annually, in turn flexes on the peer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54">[01:54]</a>. Getting a job at a FAANG company (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google) is seen as a significant achievement, often requiring extensive preparation, such as grinding on LeetCode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18">[05:18]</a>.
*   **Early Employee/Investor Flex** A former early engineer at Uber, with a net worth of $25 million, flexes as a "genius technology investor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58">[01:58]</a>.
*   **Billionaire Crypto Bro Flex** At the top of this particular hierarchy is the billionaire crypto investor who amassed wealth through "rug pulling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06">[02:06]</a>.

This progression highlights that in programming, there are only two states of being: imposter syndrome or superiority complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49">[00:49]</a>. This hierarchy demonstrates how individuals use their financial success to assert dominance and gain a sense of superiority over others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44">[00:44]</a>, showcasing the [[influence_of_salary_on_happiness | influence of salary on happiness]] or ego satisfaction.

## Other Financial "Flexes"

Beyond direct salary, other financial indicators can be used for "flexing":

*   **YouTube Premium** Owning YouTube Premium is presented as a "flex" for "lazy developers" obsessed with optimizing their time by avoiding ads and accessing offline tutorials and music streaming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17">[02:17]</a>.
*   **Domain Name Investments** For web developers, a GoDaddy account with valuable domain names is considered more valuable than a Robinhood investment account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25">[05:25]</a>. These domains are viewed not just as failed side projects, but as long-term investments to be passed down through generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30">[05:30]</a>.

Software engineering is a field where individuals can learn to code and secure high-paying jobs, even without fully understanding the underlying mechanics of how computers operate; it often "feels like magic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The core concepts of computer science provide the foundational knowledge for understanding the "garbage code" developers might be writing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Core Computer Components

A computer can be simplified as a Turing machine, a theoretical device consisting of a tape holding ones and zeros and a mechanism to read and write to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. In theory, a Turing machine can compute anything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

At the heart of modern computers lies the Central Processing Unit (CPU) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Inside a CPU are billions of tiny transistors, acting as microscopic on/off switches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
*   **Bit**: The value at one of these switches is called a bit, representing the smallest piece of information a computer uses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
*   **Byte**: A single bit is not very useful, so bits are packaged in groups of eight, known as a byte <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. One byte can represent 256 different values, such as the characters typed on a keyboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. Characters are mapped to binary values using character encodings like ASCII or UTF-8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
*   **Binary**: This is a base-2 counting system using only two characters: one and zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
*   **Hexadecimal**: Humans find binary difficult to read, so it's often represented in hexadecimal (base-16) format, where ten numbers and six letters represent a four-bit group called a nibble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
*   **Machine Code**: When developers write code in a programming language, it is eventually converted into machine code, a binary format executable by the CPU <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

The CPU does not store application data; for that, computers use Random Access Memory (RAM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. RAM is organized like a neighborhood, where each "house" holds a byte, and each location has a memory address that the CPU can read from and write to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. The CPU and RAM act as the computer's "brain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

## Input, Output, and Operating Systems

For a computer to be useful, it requires input devices (like a keyboard and mouse) and output devices (like a monitor) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Developers typically don't need to concern themselves with how hardware connects, thanks to operating system kernels like Linux, macOS, and Windows. These kernels control hardware resources via device drivers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

The primary entry point for interacting with an operating system is the shell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. A shell is a program that exposes the operating system to the user, wrapping the kernel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. It takes a line of text input and produces output, forming a command line interface (CLI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. CLIs can connect to local machines or remote computers over a network using protocols like Secure Shell (SSH) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

## Programming Languages

A programming language is a [[developer_productivity_tools | tool]] that uses the abstraction principle to simplify complex computer systems, making them practical for humans to work with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

*   **Interpreted Languages**: Some languages, like Python, are interpreted. An interpreter program executes each line of code one by one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
*   **Compiled Languages**: Others, like C++, are compiled. They use a compiler to convert the entire program into machine code in advance, creating an executable file that can run without additional dependencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

### Data in Programming

Every programming language has built-in data types to represent data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>, which are more human-friendly than raw bytes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

*   **Variables**: The fundamental way to use data is to declare a variable, which attaches a name to a data point for reuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.
    *   **Dynamically Typed**: Languages like Python are dynamically typed, automatically figuring out the data type assigned to a variable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
    *   **Statically Typed**: Languages like C are statically typed, requiring explicit specification of a variable's data type when defined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
*   **Memory Management**: Variable values are stored in memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.
    *   **Pointers**: A pointer is a variable whose value is the memory address of another variable, used for low-level memory control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
    *   **Garbage Collector**: Many languages avoid low-level memory management by implementing a garbage collector, which automatically allocates and deallocates memory when an object is no longer referenced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
*   **Common Data Types**:
    *   `int`: Represents whole numbers, which can be signed (for negative numbers) or unsigned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
    *   `float` / `double`: Represents numbers with decimal points. `float` uses less memory for a certain range and precision, while `double` uses twice the memory for more range or precision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.
    *   `char`: Represents a single character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
    *   `string`: Represents multiple characters together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.
*   **Endianness**: The order in which characters are stored in memory addresses.
    *   **Big Endian**: The most significant byte is stored at the smallest memory address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
    *   **Little Endian**: The least significant byte is stored at the smallest memory address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

## Data Structures

One of the most fundamental aspects of practical [[software engineering and development tools | software engineering]] is organizing data into data structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

*   **Array (or List)**: Organizes multiple data points in order and maintains an integer index starting at zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.
*   **Linked List**: Each item has a pointer to the next item <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
*   **Stack**: Follows the Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) principle; data is "popped" off the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.
*   **Queue**: Follows the First-In, First-Out (FIFO) principle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.
*   **Hash (or Map/Dictionary)**: Similar to an array, but uses developer-defined keys instead of integer indexes, creating a collection of key-value pairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.
*   **Trees**: Organize nodes hierarchically, allowing for faster traversal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.
*   **Graph**: Connects multiple nodes in virtually unlimited ways, with a node representing data and an edge representing the relationship between data points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

## Algorithms

Data structures are inert; to perform useful actions, an algorithm is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. An algorithm is simply code that solves a problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

### Algorithm Implementation Mechanisms

*   **Function**: A block of code that takes an input, performs an action, and returns an output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. Functions have names and can be called from other parts of the code with different input parameters (arguments) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.
    *   **Void Function**: A function that does not have an output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.
*   **Operators**: Built-in mechanisms in languages for comparing values, such as equality (`==`), greater than (`>`), and less than (`<`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.
*   **Boolean**: A data type representing true or false values, often the result of an expression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.
*   **Expression vs. Statement**: An expression produces a value, while a statement simply performs an action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.
*   **If Statement**: Handles conditional logic, executing code if a condition is true, or an `else` block if false <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.
*   **Loop**: Repeats a block of code.
    *   **While Loop**: Runs repeatedly until a condition becomes false <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.
    *   **For Loop**: Commonly used to iterate over an iterable data type like an array <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.
*   **Recursion**: Occurs when a function calls itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. Without a base condition to terminate, recursion can lead to an infinite loop and a "stack overflow error" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. The "call stack" is a short-term memory chunk used for executing functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

### Algorithm Analysis

*   **Big-O Notation**: A standard format for approximating an algorithm's performance at scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.
    *   **Time Complexity**: How fast an algorithm will run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.
    *   **Space Complexity**: How much memory is required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.

### Types of Algorithms

*   **Brute Force**: Loops over every possible combination to find a solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.
*   **Divide and Conquer**: Breaks a problem into smaller, similar sub-problems, like binary search, which repeatedly halves the problem space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.
*   **Dynamic Programming**: Breaks a problem into smaller sub-problems and stores the results of each computation for later use (memoization) to avoid recomputing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.
*   **Greedy Algorithms**: Make the most beneficial choice in the short term without considering the overall problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>, an example being Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.
*   **Backtracking Algorithms**: Take an incremental approach, exploring all possible options, like a rat in a maze <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

## Programming Paradigms

There are multiple ways to implement code.
*   **Declarative Programming**: Describes *what* a program does and its outcome, without specifying control flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. Often associated with functional languages like Haskell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.
*   **Imperative Programming**: Uses statements to provide explicit instructions on *how* to produce an outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. Associated with procedural languages like C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.
*   **Multi-Paradigm Languages**: Most general-purpose languages today (e.g., Python, JavaScript, Kotlin, Swift) support multiple paradigms simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

OOP is a programming paradigm that uses classes as blueprints for data or objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.
*   **Class**: Encapsulates variables (properties) and functions (methods) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. It's a common way to organize and reuse code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.
*   **Inheritance**: Classes can share behaviors through inheritance, where a subclass extends and overrides the parent class's behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. This opens the door to design patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.
*   **Object**: A class itself doesn't do anything; it's used to instantiate objects, which are actual chunks of data living in computer memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.
*   **Heap**: Long-lived data is stored in the heap, a separate memory area from the call stack that can grow and shrink dynamically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. This allows passing objects by reference, where multiple variables point to the same memory chunk without increasing memory footprint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.

## Concurrency and Parallelism

Modern CPUs contain multiple threads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. A thread breaks a physical CPU core into virtual cores, enabling simultaneous code execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.
*   **Parallelism**: Some programming languages support parallelism, allowing code to execute on two different threads simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.
*   **Concurrency**: Many single-threaded languages achieve concurrency by implementing models like event loops or co-routines. These models pause or delay normal code execution to handle multiple jobs on a single thread at the same time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.

## Cloud Computing and Networking

In modern computing, developers rarely work with bare-metal CPUs and RAM. Instead, they work in the cloud, utilizing virtual machines (VMs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>. A VM is software that simulates hardware, allowing large physical computers to be split into many smaller virtual computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.

These virtual machines form the backbone of the internet and are connected via the Internet Protocol (IP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>.
*   **IP Address**: Each machine has a unique IP address to identify it on the network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.
*   **URL & DNS**: An IP address is usually aliased to a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) registered in a global database called the Domain Name Service (DNS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.
*   **TCP Handshake**: To establish a connection, two computers perform a TCP handshake, enabling them to exchange messages (packets) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>.
*   **SSL**: A security layer like SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) is typically used to encrypt and decrypt messages over the network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.
*   **HTTP**: Computers securely share data using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>. For example, a client requests a webpage, and the server responds with HTML <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.
*   **API**: Modern servers provide a standardized way for clients to request data through an Application Programming Interface (API) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.
*   **REST**: The most common [[api_debugging_tools | API]] architecture is REST (Representational State Transfer), where URLs are mapped to different data entities available on the server <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>.

Securing a high-paying job in the tech industry requires significant effort, often described as a "very difficult grind" that demands high motivation and persistence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. While technical skills are essential, building a strong network and online presence significantly increases job prospects, especially for self-taught programmers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## Online Presence and Social Media

Developing a robust [[building_a_professional_online_presence_through_social_media | professional online presence]] is crucial.

### Twitter
There is a specific subculture called "tech twitter" where many individuals have successfully landed jobs by contributing value to the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
To leverage Twitter for networking:
*   Follow influential people you aspire to work for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
*   Create a transparent profile that shows your journey to land a tech job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.
*   Respond to others' tweets with encouragement and positivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
*   Post new learnings, code tips (using tools like Carbon), and resource lists for developers (like best YouTube channels) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
*   Engage with open-ended questions and create memes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
*   Consistency is key, with some accounts tweeting multiple times daily to generate followers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
*   Avoid negative or complaining tweets, as they can quickly harm your reputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

### LinkedIn
LinkedIn hosts many recruiters who can assist in job placement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.
To build your network on LinkedIn:
*   Send connection requests to people you admire, expressing your interest in tech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. Most individuals are willing to connect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
*   Join groups related to technologies you are interested in and actively participate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.
*   Share content, potentially reusing material from Twitter threads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.

### GitHub
For self-taught programmers, an active GitHub profile is vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. Consistent contributions demonstrate your ability to write code daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.
*   Contribute to open-source projects; even fixing typos in documentation (like Fireship.io) can add to your timeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.
*   Open issues when you find problems in open-source libraries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.
*   Look for issues tagged with "good first issue" to get started with contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.
*   These contributions, while unpaid, strengthen your GitHub profile and provide valuable developer experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

### [[creating_a_strong_portfolio_and_personal_projects | Building a Personal Project]] in Public
It is recommended to build a non-trivial, impressive personal project to showcase your abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. Quality over quantity is preferred for portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.
*   Document the entire process of building your application transparently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.
*   Use blogging platforms like Dev.to or Medium, or preferably, a custom-built site to express passion for web development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.
*   Also document progress on LinkedIn and Twitter, and consider starting a YouTube channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.
*   Building in public creates a feedback loop, allowing you to give and receive feedback from other developers and startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. This can even lead to accidentally creating your own job if the project is successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

## Real-Life Networking

Face-to-face interactions offer unique advantages that digital communication cannot replace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.

### Meetups
*   Local programming meetups are a traditional way to meet people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. Attending them offers opportunities to connect with important individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

### Conferences
*   Attending conferences, though more expensive, is beneficial as many hiring managers and employees attend, often looking for talent interested in their [[introduction_to_tech_stacks | tech stack]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.
*   Developing basic small talk and self-introduction skills is crucial for landing a job, as getting into a room with the "right people" is highly impactful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

## Mentorship

*   Securing a mentor, which is easier with real-life connections, is a powerful strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.
*   A mentor can be someone with extensive experience or even just one step ahead in their career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.
*   Having an industry professional for honest conversations helps validate or criticize your actions, accelerating your learning process and avoiding mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. Many individuals are willing to mentor for free, having once been in a similar position themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.

## Cultural Fit and Persistence

Beyond technical skills, companies seek candidates who align with their company culture, core values, and management style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.
*   Before interviews, research the company's core values and social media presence to understand their messaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.
*   Persistence is key; successful individuals fail repeatedly without giving up until they find success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. Rejection should be viewed as an opportunity to gain feedback and improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.

By implementing these strategies, individuals like "Bob" (an average guy with programming skills but no initial connections or degree) can significantly increase their chances of landing a six-figure tech job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

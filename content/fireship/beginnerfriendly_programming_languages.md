The article discusses programming languages from a beginner's perspective, ranking them based on where one might encounter them when learning to code from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. The initial levels are designed to make programming as easy as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Getting Started: The Easiest Languages

For individuals with absolutely no prior programming knowledge, the best starting point is often a language designed for simplicity.

### Scratch
[[programming_languages_and_their_execution_models | Scratch]] is recommended as the best place to start for absolute beginners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
*   It was developed at MIT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
*   Instead of typing code, users drag and drop blocks together like Lego bricks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
*   These blocks represent fundamental programming concepts like variables, control flow, and operators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
*   This approach makes the underlying thinking process of programming much more accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

### BASIC
Long before [[programming_languages_and_their_execution_models | Scratch]], there was BASIC, which stands for "Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   It originated from Dartmouth in 1964 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
*   At the time, Fortran was popular but not considered beginner-friendly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
*   BASIC offered simple commands such as `print`, `go to`, and `for` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
*   Its inclusion in most personal computers made it the primary choice for people learning to code for the subsequent 50 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

## Popular Dynamic High-Level Languages

The next tier includes extremely popular dynamic high-level languages that are commonly used today for a wide range of applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

### Python
[[popular_dynamic_and_highlevel_programming_languages | Python]] is the language most people start with today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
*   It is known for its minimal syntax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.
*   It does not require curly braces or semicolons, instead using indentation to delineate code blocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

### JavaScript
[[popular_dynamic_and_highlevel_programming_languages | JavaScript]] is another widely used high-level language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
*   While syntactically described as "pretty ugly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>, it is a prerequisite for [[building_web_apps_with_various_programming_languages | web development]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
*   Nearly every developer will interact with it at some point in their career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
*   It's humorously noted that "any application that can be written in javascript will eventually be written in javascript" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

Mastering one of these languages can enable a developer to build almost anything imaginable and sustain a career in software engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

## Specialized but Accessible Languages

This tier includes languages that are highly popular but serve more specialized purposes.

### Scripting Languages
[[specialized_languages_and_scripting_languages | Scripting languages]] like Bash and PowerShell allow programmers to interact with their computer programmatically from the terminal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>, enabling the automation of repetitive commands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

### Web Development Languages
For [[building_web_apps_with_various_programming_languages | web development]], HTML and CSS are essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. They are used to define the structure and style of websites, rather than for programming in the traditional sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

### Database Languages
Structured Query Language (SQL), also referred to as SQL or Squeal, is the most common language for working with databases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. It is Turing complete but primarily used for reading and writing data in relational databases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

### Other Dynamic Languages
While Python is popular, other dynamic languages might be better suited for specific projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
*   **PHP** facilitated the easy creation of server-side web applications in the 1990s and remains popular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
*   **Lua** is simpler and faster than Python and is embedded in various engines, such as Roblox and World of Warcraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
*   **Ruby** is an object-oriented language that is easy to learn and frequently used for [[building_web_apps_with_various_programming_languages | web apps]] with the Rails framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   In data science, **R** is used for statistics and data visualization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>, while **Julia** is a more modern alternative for scientific computing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

All these languages share a dynamic type system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

## Modern Statically Typed Languages

As software complexity increases, a more rigid framework, often provided by a static type system, becomes beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. This tier constitutes a significant portion of production code globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

### Java
[[programming_languages_and_their_execution_models | Java]] revolutionized programming with the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), compiling code to bytecode that can run on any computer architecture from a single codebase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. While its syntax can be challenging for beginners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>, explicit types enhance code understanding and refactoring, and modern IDEs simplify coding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

### C#
Microsoft developed [[static_type_systems_and_productionlevel_programming_languages | C#]], a language similar to Java but often preferred by its users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. It is used in game development with Unity, as well as for web and desktop applications using the .NET framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

### TypeScript
Another Microsoft tool, [[static_type_systems_and_productionlevel_programming_languages | TypeScript]], extends [[popular_dynamic_and_highlevel_programming_languages | JavaScript]] by adding a type system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>, making it significantly easier to manage large, complex projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

### Mobile Development Languages
For modern mobile application development:
*   **Kotlin** is commonly used for Android <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.
*   **Swift** is the primary language for iOS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.
*   **Dart** is used with the [[flutter_programming_languages_and_ecosystem | Flutter framework]] for cross-platform development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
These languages are all statically typed but employ modern, concise approaches like type inference to reduce boilerplate code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

### Go
[[lowlevel_systems_programming_languages | Go]], developed at Google, is a high-performance language designed for building [[lowlevel_systems_programming_languages | low-level systems]] and intended as a replacement for C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.
*   Its concise syntax makes it approachable for beginners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
*   It includes a garbage collector, eliminating the need for manual memory management that is present in languages like C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

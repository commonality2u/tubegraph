[[React introduction and history | React.js]] is described as a functional UI library originally created at Facebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It is currently used by millions of developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## History and Origins
[[React introduction and history | React.js]] was invented by Mark Zuckerberg in 2013 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. It is credited as the first declarative UI library <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>, although it adopted many ideas from AngularJS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## Core Concepts and Design
[[React introduction and history | React.js]] is built on [[JavaScript basics and history | JavaScript]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a> and offers various ways to solve problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

Key concepts include:
*   [[Reactjs functional and classbased components | Functional and class-based components]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>
*   [[React Hooks explained | Hooks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>
*   Forward Ref <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>
*   Higher-order components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>
*   Mix-ins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>
*   Render props <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>
*   Suspense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>

While it promotes writing pure functional code, useful functionality often requires imperative functions with state and effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. This approach can make simple reactive state more complicated than necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

### React Hooks
[[React Hooks explained | Hooks]] are a core part of [[Reactjs functional and classbased components | React.js functional components]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>, providing a "magical hipstery way" to achieve what classes do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. The [[React Hooks explained | `useEffect` Hook]] is noted for potentially introducing issues like infinite loops, performance problems, and hard-to-figure-out bugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

### JSX
Templating in [[React introduction and history | React.js]] is handled by JSX, a non-standard way of writing HTML that represents the UI entirely in non-portable "callback hell" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

## [[The challenges and complexity of using Reactjs | Challenges and Complexity]]
[[The challenges and complexity of using Reactjs | React.js]] has an "extremely high learning curve" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. As a library rather than a framework, building applications requires finding and installing numerous external packages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Styling in [[React introduction and history | React.js]] can be particularly challenging, leading to the development of hundreds of CSS-in-JS libraries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. Performance in [[React introduction and history | React.js]] is contingent on flawlessly implementing various "weird tricks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

## [[Popularity and impact of Reactjs in web development | Popularity and Influence]]
Despite its complexities, [[React introduction and history | React.js]] has been the most popular and influential library in frontend web development for the last decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. It has achieved its status by doing many things correctly, earning respect for its impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

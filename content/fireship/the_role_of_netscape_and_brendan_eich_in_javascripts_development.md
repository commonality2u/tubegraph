The journey of JavaScript, from a simple scripting language to a globally impactful technology, is heavily intertwined with the contributions of Netscape and its principal developer, Brendan Eich <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## The Web Before JavaScript

In December 1991, the "gore bill" provided funding for the first mainstream web browser, Mosaic, developed by Marc Andreessen and Eric Bina at the University of Illinois <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. Released for UNIX systems in January 1993, with Macintosh and Windows ports following later that year, Mosaic played a significant role in bringing the internet to the mainstream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. At this stage, there was no JavaScript, only the Document Object Model (DOM), which itself was not yet standardized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## Netscape's Vision and the Birth of a "Glue Language"

After graduating in 1993, Marc Andreessen co-founded Netscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. Within a couple of years, Netscape Navigator commanded approximately 80% of the browser market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. During this period, Andreessen recognized the necessity for browsers to become more dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Web designers required a "glue language" to enhance the interactivity of their websites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

Initially, the trendy Java programming language from Sun Microsystems was considered, but this idea was quickly dismissed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

## Brendan Eich and the Genesis of JavaScript

Netscape's Plan B was to recruit Brendan Eich <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. His task was to integrate the Scheme programming language into the browser while ensuring its syntax resembled Java <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

Remarkably, just ten days later, the first version of JavaScript was created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

### Early Features and Design Philosophy
Originally named **Mocha**, the language featured a curly-bracket syntax, similar to Java or C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. It already incorporated several features that are central to [[history_and_evolution_of_JavaScript | modern JavaScript]], such as:
*   First-class functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>
*   Dynamic typing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>
*   Prototypal inheritance, inspired by the Self programming language from Sun Microsystems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>

Brendan Eich understood that creating a perfect programming language in ten days was impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. Instead of a highly specialized language for 1990s browsers, he designed a flexible, multi-paradigm language that developers could adapt to their own patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. This foresight enabled its evolution and widespread adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

### Renaming and Marketing
By September 1995, Mocha was rebranded as **LiveScript** and was included in the first beta releases of Netscape Navigator 2.0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. Just a few months later, in December, it was renamed **JavaScript** to associate it with Java, which was the "hottest programming language" of the day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

## Netscape's Role in Standardization

From its inception, [[basics_of_javascript_and_its_history | JavaScript]] began impacting the user experience, initially with features like pop-up windows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. As its popularity grew, Microsoft reverse-engineered JavaScript for their Internet Explorer browser, naming their version JScript <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. By 1996, with two almost identical languages (JavaScript and JScript) in circulation and the internet expanding rapidly, the need for standardization became apparent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

Netscape took the initiative and approached the European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA), a neutral body for setting IT industry standards since 1961 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. By June 1997, the first version of ECMA-262, or [[standardization_of_javascript_and_the_ECMAScript_specification | ECMAScript]] as it's commonly known, was released <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. This provided browser vendors and server-side applications with a consistent specification for implementing the [[history_and_evolution_of_JavaScript | JavaScript]] language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

One notable aspect of early JavaScript, which Brendan Eich regretted, was its lenient equality operator, designed to make the language more accessible to non-programmers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. This was later addressed with the introduction of the strict equality operator in ECMAScript version 3 (ES3), released in December 1999 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.

Despite the subsequent challenges like the dot-com bubble burst and Microsoft's dominance with Internet Explorer, the foundation laid by Netscape and Brendan Eich set the stage for JavaScript's continued evolution and its eventual renaissance in the mid-2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

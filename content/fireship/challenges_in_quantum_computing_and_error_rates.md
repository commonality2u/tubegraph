Despite significant [[quantum_computing_advancements | breakthroughs]] by companies like Google and nations like China, [[quantum_computing_advancements | quantum computing]] technology is currently not yet practically useful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:59">[01:31:59]</a>. This is primarily due to several inherent challenges, especially concerning the stability and accuracy of quantum bits (qubits).

## Delicate Nature of Qubits and Error Rates

A major challenge in quantum computing is the extreme delicacy of qubits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:99">[02:44:99]</a>. Qubits are prone to errors and inconsistencies, with some exhibiting higher error rates than others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:99">[02:46:99]</a>. This necessitates constant error correction to maintain the stability of the quantum system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:59">[02:51:59]</a>.

## Environmental Requirements

For quantum chips to function, they must be maintained at temperatures near absolute zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:49">[02:55:49]</a>. This stringent environmental requirement makes quantum computers impractical for common applications like personal devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:99">[02:58:99]</a>.

## Qubit Coherence Time

Another significant challenge is the limited time qubits can maintain their quantum superposition state, known as coherence time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:79">[03:17:79]</a>. Historically, this state could only be maintained for about 20 microseconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:99">[03:22:99]</a>. While Google's Willow chip has increased this to 100 microseconds, it is still a very short duration for complex computations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:49">[03:24:49]</a>. A key future milestone is to develop a long-lived logical qubit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:49">[03:30:49]</a>.

## Advancements in Error Correction

Despite these challenges, there have been improvements in managing errors:
*   **Google's Willow Chip:** This chip can identify qubits with high error rates and dynamically reconfigure them to reduce the overall error rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>.
*   **Exponential Improvement:** Error-corrected qubits show exponentially better performance as they increase in size, with Willow being the first chip to demonstrate this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:49">[03:10:49]</a>.

## The Importance of Error Rate Reduction

The primary factor to watch in [[quantum_computing_advancements | quantum computing]] is the error rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:99">[04:05:99]</a>. Once the error rate drops sufficiently low, it will enable quantum computers to scale exponentially, leading to [[potential_impact_of_quantum_computing_advances_on_future_technology | transformative changes]] in the world, both beneficial and detrimental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>. This inflection point is crucial for the future impact of quantum technology.

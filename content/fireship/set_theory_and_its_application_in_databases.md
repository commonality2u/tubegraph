While it's often said that math isn't necessary for programming, understanding certain concepts, like set theory, can make complex computer operations, such as those found in computer graphics and neural networks, much clearer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. It helps developers think more like engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## What is a Set?

At its core, a set is defined as an unordered collection of unique values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

## Application in Relational Databases

One of the most practical examples of set theory in programming is its application in relational databases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. In a relational database, each table can be thought of as a set of unique rows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. The principles of set theory are fundamental to how these tables are joined together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>:

*   **Inner Join (Intersection)**: An inner join is used to select records that match in both tables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. This operation directly corresponds to an intersection in set theory, where only the elements common to both sets are returned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
*   **Full Outer Join (Union)**: A full outer join retrieves all matching records from both tables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. In set theory, this is known as a union, combining all unique elements from both sets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.
*   **Left and Right Joins**: These types of joins combine concepts like an intersection with the difference between the two sets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

## Discrete Math

It's important to note that set theory, when dealing with structures that have a finite number of elements, falls under the umbrella of [[Data Structures and Algorithms#Discrete Math|discrete math]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. This is in contrast to continuous math, such as geometry and calculus, which deals with real numbers and approximations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

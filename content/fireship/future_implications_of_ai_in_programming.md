From: [[fireship]] <br/> 

The **[[future of programming with AI | future of programming]]** is undergoing significant transformation due to advancements in artificial intelligence. Historically, automation has led to job displacement across various sectors, from farming to manufacturing and service industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While programming was once seen as the "new literacy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>, the emergence of AI tools is now questioning the longevity of this field. This shift has led to discussions about the [[future_implications_of_deepthinking_ai_models_on_programming_jobs | future implications of deepthinking AI models on programming jobs]] and the broader [[impact_of_ai_on_job_markets and education | impact of AI on job markets]].

## The Rise of AI in Coding

Initially, AI began to assist programmers with tools like Co-pilot, which wrote small code snippets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>, followed by GPT-4, capable of writing substantial amounts of code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. The landscape dramatically changed with the introduction of **Devin**, an AI developed by Cognition Labs, which some refer to as the "first AI software engineer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Devin: An AI Software Engineer

Devin is designed to autonomously write code in an "infinite feedback loop" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. It has access to the same developer tools as human engineers, including a terminal, browser, and code editor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. This enables Devin to solve problems by:
*   Creating a plan of action from requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
*   Searching the web for API documentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
*   Writing and running code, then fixing errors in a continuous loop until the problem is resolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
*   Mimicking human engineers by using resources like Google and Stack Overflow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

This functionality is akin to tools like AutoGPT, which leverage large language models (LLMs) to perform actions and react to feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

### Performance and Capabilities

Devin has shown significant improvements over other AI models in benchmarks. On the Software Engineering Benchmark (SWE-Bench), which tests AI's ability to solve real-world GitHub issues:
*   GPT-4 completes tasks only 1.74% of the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
*   Devin, as of March 2024, achieves a 13.86% success rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

While this is a substantial improvement, a 13% success rate is not yet sufficient to entirely replace most software engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. However, this figure is expected to improve in the [[future_developments_and_expectations_for_ai_technology | future]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

Devin is already performing real-world tasks, including completing paid jobs on platforms like Upwork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. Its capabilities include:
*   Learning new technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   Building and deploying applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
*   Fixing bugs in existing codebases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.
*   Training its own AI models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

The concept of AI generating multiple solutions in parallel, similar to Google's Alpha Coder which can beat 85% of competitive programmers by generating thousands of solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>, suggests a future where AI could offer a multitude of apps for a single job posting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. This highlights the evolving [[impact_of_ai_tools_on_coding_and_developers | impact of AI tools on coding and developers]].

### Investor Confidence and Competition

Cognition Labs, the creator of Devin, is backed by notable investors such as Peter Thiel's Founders Fund, the Collison brothers from Stripe, and other Silicon Valley heavy hitters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. Another stealth startup, Magic.dev, has secured over $100 million in funding with shared investors like Elad Gill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. These investments indicate a strong belief within Silicon Valley that replacing programmers with AI is a lucrative goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

## Skepticism and Counterarguments

Despite the significant advancements, there is skepticism regarding AI's immediate capacity to fully replace human programmers.
*   **Overhyped Technology**: Some predict that this technology, like self-driving cars or 3D printing, might not deliver on its revolutionary promises in the grand scheme of things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.
*   **Limitations with Complexity**: Current AI tools are highly effective for simple problems but can become "counterproductive" and detrimental when dealing with more complex coding challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

## Future Outlook

Leading figures like Jensen Huang believe that the ultimate goal is to create computing technology where "nobody has to program" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>, effectively making "everybody in the world... a programmer" through AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. This vision suggests a future where programming as a specialized skill could become archaic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>, leading to significant [[implications_of_ai_advancements_on_different_professions | implications of AI advancements on different professions]] and a redefinition of the [[role_and_value_of_ai_tools_in_programming | role and value of AI tools in programming]].

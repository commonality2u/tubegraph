The [[gnu_project_and_core_utilities | GNU Project]] was created in 1983 by Richard Stallman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. Its purpose was to be a free and [[the_open_source_aspects_of_llama_31_and_licensing | open]] replacement for [[unix_and_posix_standard | Unix]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>. Replacing [[unix_and_posix_standard | Unix]] was a challenging task due to its complexity and hundreds of applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>.

Over several years, the [[gnu_project_and_core_utilities | GNU Project]] successfully recreated many applications commonly used today, often associated with [[linux_kernel_and_its_role | Linux]], such as `tar`, `bash`, and `emacs` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>. By the early 1990s, the [[gnu_project_and_core_utilities | GNU Project]] had developed extensive software but lacked an essential component: the operating system [[linux_kernel_and_its_role | kernel]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>. A complete operating system requires a [[linux_kernel_and_its_role | kernel]] to manage CPU and memory resources between hardware and software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>.

## [[gnu_project_and_core_utilities | GNU]] + [[linux_kernel_and_its_role | Linux]]

By the end of 1992, the [[linux_kernel_and_its_role | Linux]] [[linux_kernel_and_its_role | kernel]] was released under the [[gnu_project_and_core_utilities | GNU]] General Public License <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>. This combination led to the creation of the complete operating system known today as [[gnu_project_and_core_utilities | GNU]] + [[linux_kernel_and_its_role | Linux]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>. The following year, numerous developers began adapting the [[linux_kernel_and_its_role | Linux]] project to the [[gnu_project_and_core_utilities | GNU]] environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>.

The collaboration between [[gnu_project_and_core_utilities | GNU]] and the broader [[the_open_source_aspects_of_llama_31_and_licensing | open source]] ecosystem provides [[freedom_in_ai_development | freedom]] that encourages innovation and new developments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.

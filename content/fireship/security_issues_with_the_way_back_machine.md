The Internet Archive, home to the [[significance_of_the_internet_archive_in_preserving_internet_history | Way Back Machine]], has recently faced significant [[website_security_vulnerabilities | security vulnerabilities]] and attacks, prompting concerns about the preservation of internet history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This vital [[significance_of_the_internet_archive_in_preserving_internet_history | website]], which has archived webpages including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images since 1996, holds over 890 billion archived web pages, weighing nearly 100 petabytes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This vast amount of data is practically irreplaceable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

## Recent Security Incidents

The Internet Archive has been under attack from multiple angles, leading to its temporary offline status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

Key incidents include:
*   **Data Breach** A [[data_breach | data breach]] exposed 31 million email addresses and password hashes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
*   **Website Defacement** The website was defaced with JavaScript graffiti, triggering an alert message about the data breach before its official disclosure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.
*   **DDoS Attacks** The site has been subjected to continuous Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, which have been occurring aggressively since at least May <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

There is significant concern that [[hackers_and_their_motivations_for_targeting_the_internet_archive | hackers]] may have gained access to the archived website data, potentially giving them the power to erase the history of the World Wide Web <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

## Timeline of Recent Events (October 2024)

*   **September 30th:** HIBP (Have I Been Pwned) was informed of the Internet Archive's [[data_breach | data breach]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.
*   **October 5th:** The [[data_breach | data breach]] was confirmed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
*   **October 6th:** The Internet Archive was officially notified, and provided a 72-hour window before public disclosure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.
*   **October 8th:** Brewster Kahle, founder of the Internet Archive, posted about a DDoS attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
*   **October 9th:** The website was defaced with JavaScript, triggering an alert about the data breach before official disclosure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.
*   **October 10th:** The website remained under attack and completely offline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

## Attacker and Motivation

An activist group named "Black Meta" has claimed responsibility for the attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. They state they will continue their attacks until all their systems are completely down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. The group has expressed a political message regarding the situation in the Middle East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. However, the exact motivations for targeting the Internet Archive specifically remain unclear, with some suggesting it might be a false flag operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

## Context: The Internet Archive's Mission and Challenges

Founded in 1996 by Brewster Kahle, the Internet Archive is a nonprofit service dedicated to universal access to all knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. Unlike commercial entities, it operates as a free public resource <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

The Internet Archive also runs Open Library, which digitizes physical books and allows one digital copy to be lent for each physical copy owned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. This service recently lost a significant [[legal_challenges_faced_by_the_internet_archive_and_open_library | legal battle]] against publishers for copyright infringement, potentially facing over $600 million in damages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. While not directly a [[security_vulnerabilities_and_exploits | security vulnerability]] for the Way Back Machine, this [[legal_challenges_faced_by_the_internet_archive_and_open_library | legal challenge]] adds to the overall pressures facing the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

The Internet Archive does comply with GDPR and will remove personal data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. However, some entities desire the removal of legitimate content, raising further challenges for content preservation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

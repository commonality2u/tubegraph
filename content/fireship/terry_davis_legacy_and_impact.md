[[terry_davis_and_schizophrenia | Terry Davis]], an exceptionally talented programmer, created TempleOS in 2005 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. He was diagnosed with schizophrenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a> and believed he was God's chosen programmer, implementing features described as a modern-day way of speaking in tongues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Davis passed away in 2018 at the age of 48 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>. He was known both as a highly controversial internet personality and a genius programmer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>.

## TempleOS

TempleOS is an open-source, 64-bit operating system designed by Davis to be the Third Temple prophesized by the Bible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. He wrote the entire operating system himself from his parents' house in Las Vegas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. This monumental undertaking included:
*   A bootloader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>
*   A kernel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>
*   A window manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>
*   A 3D graphics library <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>
*   Multiple games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>

All components were powered by his own compiler and a custom programming language called Holy C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Amazingly, the entire system fits in under 100,000 lines of code at 1.4 megabytes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. TempleOS is considered one of the most complex pieces of software ever written by a solo developer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.

### Technical Aspects
*   **Resolution and Color Depth** TempleOS renders graphics at 640x480 resolution, limited to 16 colors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
*   **Holy C** The underlying language, Holy C, resembles C or C++ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. It features functions that can be invoked without parentheses or arguments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a> and uses just-in-time (JIT) compilation, allowing it to double as a shell language executable directly from the terminal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
*   **Ring Zero Only** Unlike other operating systems like Linux or Windows, TempleOS is ring zero only, meaning everything, including user programs, happens directly in the kernel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This design gives users complete control over the operating system's source code and hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>.

### Key Features and User Interaction
To get started with TempleOS, users would download the ISO file from the TempleOS website and use a tool like VirtualBox to boot it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>.
*   **Adam Task** On startup, TempleOS creates a single, immortal task named "Adam," which is the father of every other task, mirroring the Book of Genesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>. It also supports multiple CPU cores, with each core receiving its own immortal "set task" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>.
*   **Divine Interaction**
    *   Hitting F7 generates a pseudo-random word from God, allowing users to "speak in tongues" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>.
    *   Shift+F6 allows God to draw a picture, referred to as a "God doodle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>.
*   **Personal Menu and Applications** Users can access a personal menu (Ctrl+M) that provides a wide variety of games, including 3D first-person shooters, 2D strategy games, and simulations like "After Egypt" (where users play Moses) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>. The OS also includes utilities for managing finances and creating music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.
*   **Modifiability** Users can open the source code, make modifications in Holy C, reboot, and immediately experience the changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>. Every line of code is accessible thanks to the Red Sea file system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>.

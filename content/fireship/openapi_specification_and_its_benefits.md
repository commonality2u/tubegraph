The OpenAPI Specification provides a standard way to describe an API in YAML <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. Its purpose is to describe an API in a way that can be understood by both humans and machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.

## Origin
The OpenAPI Specification originally came about from the Swagger framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.

## Benefits of using OpenAPI Specification
When building a serious API, using the OpenAPI Specification offers several significant benefits:
*   **Documentation** The API becomes fully documented, making it much easier for end-users to work with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.
*   **Code Generation** Due to its standard format, it allows for the automatic generation of client-side or server-side code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.
*   **Cloud Integration** The OpenAPI configuration can be uploaded to tools like [[Understanding RESTful APIs | API Gateway]] on AWS or Google Cloud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. This enables the API to be secured, monitored, and connected to backend infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.

## Tools
A free tool called Swaggerhub can be used to work with the OpenAPI Specification, allowing users to export boilerplate code automatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

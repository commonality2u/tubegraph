[[introduction_to_python | Python]] is a high-level, interpreted [[scripting_and_utility_programming_languages | programming language]] renowned for its "zen-like" code and widespread popularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It is easy to learn yet robust enough for significant projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Created by Guido van Rossum and released in 1991, [[history_of_python | Python]] was named after Monty Python's Flying Circus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Key Applications

[[introduction_to_python | Python]]'s versatility makes it a language of choice across various domains:

*   **Web Applications**
    [[introduction_to_python | Python]] is commonly used for building server-side applications, including web applications, often utilizing frameworks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. For example, YouTube's web application is built with [[introduction_to_python | Python]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.
*   **Data Analysis and Machine Learning**
    It is the preferred language for Big Data analysis and [[aws_machine_learning_tools | machine learning]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.
*   **Utility Programming**
    The language is practical for serious projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>, enabling its use in various utility and [[scripting_and_utility_programming_languages | scripting]] tasks.

## Frameworks and Ecosystem

[[introduction_to_python | Python]] boasts a vast [[python_ecosystem_and_libraries | ecosystem]] of third-party libraries and frameworks, simplifying development across many areas:

*   **Web Frameworks**
    Many web applications are built using [[introduction_to_python | Python]] frameworks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. While specific frameworks are not named in this excerpt, this is a common application area, potentially covered by [[comparison_of_web_development_frameworks | comparison of web development frameworks]] or [[django_framework_for_python_web_development | Django]].
*   **Deep Learning Frameworks**
    The [[python_ecosystem_and_libraries | ecosystem]] includes deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
*   **High-Performance Libraries**
    [[introduction_to_python | Python]] offers wrappers for numerous high-performance, low-level packages, such as Open Computer Vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. These are typically installed using the PIP package manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

## Language Design and Philosophy

[[introduction_to_python | Python]]'s design emphasizes readability, making it a popular choice for those learning to code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

*   **The Zen of [[introduction_to_python | Python]]**
    Key principles include "beautiful is better than ugly" and "explicit is better than implicit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. The language is simple and avoids "magic" that could lead to ambiguity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
*   **[[python_syntax_and_readability | Syntax and Readability]]**
    Semicolons are not required, and their use is considered "not pythonic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. Instead, [[python_syntax_and_readability | Python]] uses indentation to define code scope, eliminating the need for curly braces common in other languages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. For example, a function body is defined by indenting the next line, typically by four spaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
*   **Programming Paradigms**
    [[introduction_to_python | Python]] supports multiple programming paradigms, including functional programming patterns with anonymous functions using `lambda` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. It also utilizes objects for data abstraction, enabling object-oriented patterns like classes and inheritance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

## Getting Started

[[introduction_to_python | Python]] is currently at version 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. Files typically end with `.py` or `.ipynb` for interactive notebooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. The language is strongly typed (values don't change unexpectedly) but dynamically typed (type annotations are not required) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. Its efficient [[python_syntax_and_readability | syntax]] allows for declaring multiple variables on a single line and defining tuples, lists, and dictionaries with literal syntax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

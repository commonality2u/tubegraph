[[introduction_to_assembly_language | Assembly Language]] is a low-level programming language designed to simplify the instructions fed into a computer's Central Processing Unit (CPU) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It serves as a human-readable abstraction over machine code, eliminating the need for programmers to manually count ones and zeros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Origins

The First [[introduction_to_assembly_language | Assembly Language]] was created by Kathleen Booth in 1947 for the All-Purpose Electronic Computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Evolution and Early Dominance

Over the subsequent decade, [[introduction_to_assembly_language | Assembly Language]] evolved into various formats to power the supercomputers of its era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. An example of such a machine was the IBM 790, which had a price tag of $20 million in today's currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Writing code in [[introduction_to_assembly_language | Assembly Language]] was the standard practice until the emergence of high-level languages like Fortran a few years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Contemporary Uses

Despite the rise of high-level languages, [[uses_and_applications_of_assembly_language_today | Assembly Language]] continues to be utilized today for specific purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. Its primary applications include:
*   Direct access to bare-metal hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
*   Addressing low-level performance issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
*   Development of device drivers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.
*   Programming embedded systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
*   Running native software in web browsers via WebAssembly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

A notable characteristic of [[introduction_to_assembly_language | Assembly Language]] is that each specific language variant is designed to work only on a particular CPU architecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Examples include ARM for Apple silicon and Raspberry Pi, or x86 for Intel chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. To begin programming in [[introduction_to_assembly_language | Assembly]], one typically needs an assembler, such as the Netwide Assembler (NASM) for x86 chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

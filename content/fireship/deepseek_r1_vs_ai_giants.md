In a significant development, the Chinese company DeepSeek released its open-source R1 model, which has reportedly "shocked the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. The release of R1 has created substantial ripples across the artificial intelligence landscape, particularly impacting major tech companies and the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## DeepSeek R1's Performance

DeepSeek R1 is an open-source model that outperforms several established models from leading AI companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>:
*   It surpasses OpenAI's O1 reasoning model, which costs $200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.
*   R1 also beats Claude Sonnet and Gemini on key benchmarks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. For more information, see [[comparison_of_ai_models_from_openai_google_and_chinese_companies | Comparison of AI Models from OpenAI Google and Chinese Companies]].
*   It performs well in general use, passing the "Vibe test" for many internet users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, with the exception of specific historical queries like "what happened on April 15th, 1989?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.
*   The model demonstrates proficiency in mathematics, which is notable considering that OpenAI reportedly had prior access to answers in this domain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
*   Following its release, R1 rapidly gained popularity, becoming the number one app in America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Impact on the AI Industry and Market

The emergence of DeepSeek R1 poses a significant challenge to "Big Tech" companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. The prevailing narrative has been that advanced AI requires substantial resources, including thousands of GPUs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. However, DeepSeek R1 contradicts this, having cost less than $10 million to develop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a> and originating as a side project of a hedge fund focused on creating long-term social value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

This development has caused alarm on Wall Street, with fears of a "blood bath" for Nvidia stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Nvidia, a primary beneficiary of the AI boom due to its monopoly on AI training GPUs and proprietary CUDA libraries, has seen its market position challenged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. The stock market experienced a nearly trillion-dollar wipeout in value, with Nvidia, Taiwan Semiconductor, and Broadcom being among the biggest losers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

The ability to run DeepSeek R1's 680 billion-parameter model on "relatively cheap consumer hardware" like a few Apple M2 Ultras, combined with its open-source nature and Chinese origin, presents a significant concern for tech investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. This moment is being compared to the 1957 Sputnik moment, when Russia launched the first artificial satellite, shocking the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

## OpenAI's Response and Other Chinese AI Advancements

In response to DeepSeek's rise, OpenAI has taken steps to remain competitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. They are offering their O1 Mini model to free users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. Additionally, OpenAI released a new feature called "Operator," which grants AI models access to a browser, allowing them to click buttons and fill out forms on behalf of users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. This development could revolutionize online interactions, potentially reducing the future need for websites and user interfaces in favor of APIs that interact directly with AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. Currently, Operator is only available to users on the $200 plan and has received mixed reviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

Beyond DeepSeek R1, other notable advancements from Chinese AI companies include "Hunyuang 3D," which can generate 3D meshes and textures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. Mark Andreessen has hailed DeepSeek R1 as "one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs he's ever seen," calling it a "profound gift to the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

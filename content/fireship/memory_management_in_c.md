The [[C language characteristics and usage | C language]] is known for providing low-level memory and hardware control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

In C++, which is designed as a superset of C, memory can be managed manually using pointers and references <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. While C++ offers tools like `unique_pointer` for safer memory allocation, the underlying manual management with pointers and references is also a characteristic shared with C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

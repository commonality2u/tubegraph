One of the significant challenges of being a software engineer is preventing friends and family from discovering your profession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. The reason for this caution is the inevitable barrage of requests to build an app together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## The Problem
These app ideas are often described as "very dumb ideas that are impossibly complex to execute" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. Examples include "Uber but for horses or TikTok without the Chinese" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. Typically, such ambitious projects come with a very limited budget, sometimes as low as "$500" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

For software engineers, who are often introverted, these requests are particularly painful because they "have a hard time saying no" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. This contributes to general [[programmer_dissatisfaction | programmer dissatisfaction]] within the field.

## The Proposed Solution
A common strategy to deter these requests is to respond by stating a high hourly rate, such as "$300 an hour" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. However, this often leads to a predictable counteroffer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

## The Unfortunate Reality
The typical counteroffer is "zero dollars per hour but 10% equity in the company which will eventually be worth billions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. This is considered "pretty much Checkmate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. The suggested, albeit resigned, course of action is to "accepting the offer and building the app to get them to go away" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

One common regret among programmers is not having obtained a computer science degree earlier in their careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. While there's a [[controversy_around_formal_education_and_degrees_in_computer_science | controversy around formal education and degrees in computer science]], a degree can offer distinct advantages.

## Advantages of a Computer Science Degree

*   **Surefire Path to High-Paying Jobs:** Attending college, networking, and completing internships is considered "the most Surefire way" to secure a [[money_and_salary_in_tech_careers | high-paying job in Tech]] at a young age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
*   **Job Requirements:** Many jobs in the field specifically require a degree, even if its practical value is "arguably pointless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

## Perceived Disadvantages and Alternatives

Despite the benefits, college is not considered "the most efficient way to learn how to code" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.
*   **Alternative Learning:** Programmers often learn far more from real-world jobs or by building projects independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.
*   **No Degree Requirement:** It's possible to get a job in tech, even at large companies like Google or Microsoft, without a degree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

> "What you don't want to do is get scammed like all these Millennials who went to college for a useless degree like Egyptian studies only to find out that there's no jobs in that field" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

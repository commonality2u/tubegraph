Voice-activated programming is an emerging feature set expected to revolutionize how developers interact with code editors and write code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>. This capability is anticipated to significantly reduce the importance of typing speed in the "AI programming age" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>.

## GitHub Copilot X Integration

A key development in this area is the "Voice activated Copilot" feature, part of GitHub Copilot X <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>. This functionality allows users to control VS Code and write code entirely through voice commands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>.

## Benefits and Impact

*   **Increased Speed**: Voice-activated coding is presented as being faster than traditional typing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>.
*   **Enhanced Flexibility**: It allows programmers to write code in situations where typing would be difficult or impossible, such as while running on a treadmill or during a commute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.
*   **Reduced Reliance on Typing Skills**: The necessity for programmers to be extremely fast typists, capable of "churning out 150 words per minute in Vim," will become less critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>. This change implies a shift away from certain aspects of [[how_to_flex_as_a_programmer | programmer flexing]] based on typing prowess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>.
*   **Revolutionary Change**: While the keyboard will not become obsolete, voice activation is expected to revolutionize programming in a similar way that voice assistants like Alexa changed household interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.

[[react_introduction_and_history | React.js]], often humorously described as a "half-baked functional UI library" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, is widely adopted, with "millions of developers" using it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. While sarcastically attributed to Mark Zuckerberg in 2013 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>, [[react_introduction_and_history | React]]'s actual development began at Facebook in that year.

## Influence and Dominance

[[react_introduction_and_history | React]] is credited as the first declarative UI library <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>, though it drew many of its ideas from AngularJS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. Its popularity is a significant factor in its perceived standing within the development community.

> The only thing that matters is [[react_introduction_and_history | React]] is the most popular and that makes it undeniably the best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

[[react_introduction_and_history | React]] has been the "most influential library in front-end web development for the last decade" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. Despite various criticisms, it "does a lot of things right" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>, earning it continued respect in the field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

## Key Aspects of its Impact

[[react_introduction_and_history | React]] is considered "simple" because it is "just javascript" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, a characteristic that paradoxically leads to "dozens of weird ways to solve the same problems" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

### Architectural Approach
[[react_introduction_and_history | React]]'s "killer feature" is the ability to write pure functional code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. However, to achieve useful functionality, developers must write "imperative functions with state and effects" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This approach can make "simple things like reactive state much more complicated than they need to be" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

One notable feature, `useEffect`, was humorously (and perhaps tellingly) considered for the name `useFootGun` due to its potential to introduce "infinite loops, performance issues and bugs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

### Ecosystem and Community
[[react_introduction_and_history | React]] is a library, not a framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>, which means building a substantial application often requires finding and installing "hundreds of different packages" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>, many of which may be unmaintained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

### [[the_challenges_and_complexity_of_using_reactjs | Challenges and Complexity]]
[[react_introduction_and_history | React]] is noted for its "extremely high learning curve" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. Initial setup can lead developers into "tutorial hell" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Strict Mode in [[react_introduction_and_history | React]] is used to "hide baggage from previous versions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

*   **Component Structure**: While [[reactjs_functional_and_classbased_components | functional components]] are preferred for "functional programming" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>, [[reactjs_functional_and_classbased_components | class-based components]] are considered outdated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. Hooks provide a "magical, hipstery" way to achieve functionality similar to classes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
*   **JSX**: Templating is handled by JSX <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>, a "non-standard way to write html" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a> that can lead to "non-portable callback hell" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
*   **Styling**: Styling with [[react_introduction_and_history | React]] can be challenging, leading to a "hate" for CSS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>, though "hundreds of css and js libraries" address this issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
*   **Performance**: Despite the "extra complexity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>, [[react_introduction_and_history | React]] can be "blazingly fast," assuming all its "weird tricks" are flawlessly implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

Compared to other options, [[react_introduction_and_history | React]] is presented as not being as "fun like Svelte" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>, "fast like Solid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>, or "reliable like Angular" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>, nor does it possess "all of the above like Vue" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

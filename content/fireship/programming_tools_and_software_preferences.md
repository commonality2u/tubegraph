For programmers, the choice of tools and software can often be a point of pride or "flexing" among colleagues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Code Editors

### VS Code
[[developer_productivity_tools | VS Code]] is a popular code editor, and its themes, like "synthwave with power mode enabled," can be a way to show off a personalized setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Some users jokingly claim difficulty exiting it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

### Neovim / Vim
Using [[web_application_tools_for_developers | Vim]] (or Neovim) is considered a "Vim Flex," elevating the user to a "higher plane of Consciousness" allowing them to "look down upon the poor lost Souls" using other tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. True Vim users reportedly do not even use a mouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

### Other Editors
Editors like IntelliJ and Emacs are mentioned alongside VS Code as tools that "poor lost souls" might use, in contrast to Vim users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

## Operating Systems

The choice of operating system is another significant way for developers to "flex" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

### Macintosh (macOS)
A Macintosh is associated with wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. Combining it with an Apple Vision Pro is humorously suggested as a way to "tell people that you're a clown" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

### Linux
"Real developers" are said to use Linux <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
*   **Ubuntu:** Simply using Ubuntu can impress most people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
*   **Red Hat Enterprise Linux:** Paying for [[GNU project and core_utilities | Red Hat Enterprise Linux]] is considered "bowler" for impressing others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   **Arch Linux:** The statement "I use Arch by the way" is portrayed as the ultimate Linux "flex," implying countless hours spent configuring the OS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

### Windows
Windows is ironically declared the "ultimate distro" because using it tells people that a programmer has a life and possibly a girlfriend outside of programming, implying less time spent on OS configuration compared to Arch Linux users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

## Other Tools and Concepts

### Programming Languages and Frameworks
Adding [[Beginner programming languages and learning tools | TypeScript]] to a perfectly functional JavaScript function and advocating for end-to-end type safety is described as a "complexity Flex" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

### Design Patterns
Refactoring simple code into complex design patterns like Abstract Factory, Singleton, Adapter, Decorator, and Proxy, while referencing the "Gang of Four book," is part of a "complexity Flex" to appear as a "programming God" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

### GitHub
A significant aspect of a programmer's identity is their [[Software Engineering and Development Tools | GitHub]] commit history and profile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. A robust commit history and numerous awards and badges on a GitHub profile are seen as a "GitHub Flex," making one look like a "North Korean General" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

### Domain Names
For [[web application tools for developers | web developers]], owning valuable domain names through services like GoDaddy is considered an investment and a "flex" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

Apple has unveiled its latest computing technology, the new M4 chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. Apple claims it is the "biggest and baddest chip the PC market has ever seen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.

## Key Features
The M4 chip boasts several significant advancements:
*   Its CPU is 50% faster than the M2 chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>.
*   It includes built-in Ray Tracing capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>.
*   The neural engine can handle a remarkable 38 trillion operations per second (TOPS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>, positioning it as the fastest chip for [[ai_capabilities_in_modern_chips | AI workloads]] on the PC market today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>.

## Strategic Unveiling
Interestingly, Apple chose to unveil the M4 at its iPad event rather than its upcoming Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC), which is only a month away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>. This decision highlights the urgency and competitive nature of the current chip market.

## The ARM Race
The M4's release is part of a global "arms race" to build the best ARM-based chips and dominate the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>. Major players like Samsung, [[googles_willow_chip_and_its_capabilities | Google]], Microsoft, and even Intel are participating in this [[competition_in_the_arm_chip_industry | competition in the ARM chip industry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>.

### What is ARM?
Historically, personal computers running Windows or macOS used CPUs with the x86 architecture, primarily built by Intel or AMD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. x86 is based on a complex instruction set, making it versatile and fast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>.
However, smartphones adopted ARM processors, which are based on a reduced instruction set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>. ARM requires fewer transistors per instruction, making it more power-efficientâ€”a critical factor for battery-powered devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>.
The perception that ARM wasn't optimal for regular computers changed significantly in 2020 when Apple released the [[apple_silicon_m1_vs_intel_i9 | M1 chip]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>. This innovation led to Apple's laptops becoming faster and quieter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>.
Following Apple's success, Microsoft launched Project Voltera to run Windows on ARM chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>. Data centers, including AWS, Amazon, [[googles_willow_chip_and_its_capabilities | Google]], and Microsoft, have also recognized ARM's efficiency for cloud computing and are now developing their own ARM chips, such as AWS Graviton and [[googles_willow_chip_and_its_capabilities | Google Axion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.

ARM Holdings, the company behind the architecture, is worth over $100 billion but designs the architecture and licenses it to large companies, who then manufacture the chips, often at facilities like Taiwan Semiconductor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>.

## Focus on AI Capabilities
A key selling point of the M4 is its powerful neural engine, which is central to Apple's strategy in the [[ai_advancements_and_industry_challenges | AI race]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>. Apple's goal appears to be running large language models (LLMs) on-device or "on the edge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>. This approach would offer users offline functionality, low latency, and enhanced privacy for AI interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>.

## Competition in the AI Chip Market
Apple's lead in the ARM chip market may be short-lived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.
*   **Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite**: Expected to be released in a couple of weeks, this chip could outperform the M4, claiming 45 trillion operations per second compared to the M4's 38 TOPS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>. This chip is expected to power Windows on Surface laptops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>.
*   **Intel Arrow Lake**: Leaked documents suggest Intel's new processor, built for lower power consumption, could potentially handle over 100 trillion operations per second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>.
*   **AMD Ryzen AI 9**: AMD is also entering the fray with its new Ryzen AI 9 chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>.

The fierce competition in these numbers stems from the belief that in the near future, the device capable of running the best [[ai_capabilities_in_modern_chips | AI model]] natively will be the most sought-after by consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>. For Apple, a hardware company, it would be strategically embarrassing if Microsoft laptops could run [[ai_capabilities_in_modern_chips | AI better]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>.

## The Future of x86
Despite the advancements in ARM, the x86 architecture is deeply embedded in modern infrastructure, having existed for over 45 years, and is likely to persist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>. Companies like Intel and AMD continue to innovate within this architecture, with a clear focus on integrating and maximizing [[ai_capabilities_in_modern_chips | AI capabilities]] into their branding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>.

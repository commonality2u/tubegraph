In early 2025, two significant announcements emerged from tech giants in the realm of quantum computing: [[microsofts_new_quantum_computing_chip_and_its_significance | Microsoft's Myer on a one]] chip and [[googles_willow_chip_and_its_capabilities | Google's Willow chip]]. While both represent advancements, they employ fundamentally different approaches and are at varying stages of practical utility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>.

## [[microsofts_new_quantum_computing_chip_and_its_significance | Microsoft's Myer on a One]] Chip

[[microsofts_new_quantum_computing_chip_and_its_significance | Microsoft]] announced the Myer on a one quantum computing chip out of nowhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. They claim to have created an entirely new state of matter, a "topological supercomputer" or "topo computer," which is distinct from solid, liquid, gas, or plasma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

> "it is entirely a new state of matter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>

If this claim isn't "typical [[microsofts_role_in_ai_development | Microsoft]] BS," it could be a breakthrough on par with the transistor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. The transistor allowed scaling to millions of bits, and the topo computer could enable scaling to millions of qubits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This would make computers billions of times faster, allowing for tasks like developing new medicines, simulating entire worlds, or running [[microsofts_role_in_ai_development | Microsoft]] Windows updates in seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

### Underlying Science: Majorana Fermion

The Myer on a one chip uses a fundamentally different architecture based on the Majorana fermion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>. This subatomic particle is unique because it is its own antiparticle, like a mirror image of itself with no positive or negative side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>. This property makes it resistant to decoherence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>.

Quantum computers rely on properties like superposition and entanglement, allowing qubits to represent multiple states simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>. However, qubits are extremely delicate and susceptible to quantum decoherence, where they lose their quantum properties and collapse to a classical state due to environmental interference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>. This leads to high error rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>. The Majorana fermion's resistance to decoherence is its key advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>.

Majorana fermions were first theorized in 1937 but were not observed until 2020 in islands of gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>. [[microsofts_role_in_ai_development | Microsoft]] had previously claimed to observe them in 2018 but had to retract their research paper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>. Now, [[microsofts_role_in_ai_development | Microsoft]] claims they can not only observe but also control these particles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>. They have described "topological Quantum Computing," where particles are braided and fused on an atom-by-atom engineered nanowire, and then measured by checking for an even or odd number of electrons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.

### Topo Conductor and Scalability

The result is a new type of semiconductor called a "topo conductor," which is essentially a superconductor-semiconductor sandwich where the semiconductor mimics the superconductor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>. These can be chained together to scale up to millions of qubits on a small chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>. However, the chip requires a temperature near absolute zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>. As of February 21st, 2025, [[microsofts_new_quantum_computing_chip_and_its_significance | Microsoft]] has not yet scaled it to millions of qubits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>.

## [[googles_willow_chip_and_its_capabilities | Google's Willow Chip]]

[[googles_willow_chip_and_its_capabilities | Google]] announced its [[googles_willow_chip_and_its_capabilities | Willow chip]] just weeks before [[microsofts_new_quantum_computing_chip_and_its_significance | Microsoft's Myer on a one]] announcement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>. Like [[microsofts_new_quantum_computing_chip_and_its_significance | Microsoft's]] offering, [[googles_willow_chip_and_its_capabilities | Google's Willow chip]] is also currently "useless for all practical purposes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>. However, the [[googles_willow_chip_and_its_capabilities | Willow chip]] made a significant breakthrough in error correction rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>.

## Comparison and Outlook

As of early 2025, [[googles_willow_chip_and_its_capabilities | Google]] and IBM appear to be far ahead in the overall quantum computing race <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>. However, [[microsofts_role_in_ai_development | Microsoft]] has chosen a distinct "long game" strategy by being the only major company pursuing the topological approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>.

While [[googles_willow_chip_and_its_capabilities | Google's Willow chip]] focuses on improving error correction within what is implied to be a more conventional quantum computing architecture, [[microsofts_new_quantum_computing_chip_and_its_significance | Microsoft's Myer on a one]] aims to fundamentally overcome the decoherence problem through the unique properties of Majorana fermions and a "topo conductor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>. If [[microsofts_new_quantum_computing_chip_and_its_significance | Microsoft's]] claims are not overhyped, similar to the [[microsofts_role_in_ai_development | Microsoft]] Kin, the Myer on a one could be a transformative technology that accelerates the development of practical quantum computers from decades to years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>.

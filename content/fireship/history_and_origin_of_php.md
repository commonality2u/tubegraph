PHP is a dynamic, interpreted scripting language primarily used for building interactive websites on the server <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Despite some negative perceptions, it remains one of the most popular languages for back-end web development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Creation and Early Purpose

PHP was created in 1994 by Rasmus Lerdorf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. Its initial purpose was to manage his personal homepage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Name Evolution

Originally, PHP stood for "Personal Home Page" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. However, as the language grew to power multi-billion dollar enterprises, the name was retrospectively changed through cognitive dissonance to represent "Hypertext Preprocessor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Historical Significance

PHP holds a special place in the [[history_of_javascript | history of JavaScript]] because it predates it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. It was one of the first languages designed to be embedded directly within HTML, enabling websites to be built dynamically on a server <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

> [!INFO] Open Source Impact
> As an open-source technology, PHP played a role in revolutionizing the web by making application development more accessible to the average person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## Technical Foundations

The interpreter for PHP is implemented in [[history_and_creation_of_c | C]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. Its syntax draws inspiration from Perl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

From: [[fireship]] <br/> 

Microsoft has announced a new [[microsofts_new_quantum_computing_chip_and_its_significance | quantum computing chip]], Myerana-1, claiming to have created an entirely new state of matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This potential fifth state of matter, after solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, is called the "Topo computer" or "topological supercomput" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Significance of the Breakthrough

If this claim proves true, it could represent a breakthrough on par with the invention of the transistor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. The transistor allowed [[comparison_between_classical_and_quantum_computers | classical computers]] to scale to millions of bits, and the Topo computer could enable scaling to millions of qubits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

Such a development could make computers billions of times faster than current technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>, leading to incredible [[potential_impact_of_quantum_computing_advances_on_future_technology | advancements]] such as:
*   Developing new medicines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>
*   Simulating entire worlds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>
*   Significantly reducing the time for software updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>

### Current Status

As of February 21st, 2025, the Myerana-1 chip is considered "utterly useless for all practical purposes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. However, it is seen as a significant breakthrough that could accelerate the development of practical [[quantum_computing_advancements | quantum computers]] from decades to mere years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## The Science Behind Myerana-1

Unlike chips from competitors like Google's Willow chip, which focuses on error correction, Myerana-1 utilizes a fundamentally different architecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

### The Role of [[the_role_of_myeron_a_fon_particles_in_quantum_computing | Majorana Fermions]]

The chip is based on the [[the_role_of_myeron_a_fon_particles_in_quantum_computing | Majorana fermion]], a subatomic particle that is its own anti-particle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. Unlike an electron and its positron, which have opposite charges and annihilate upon meeting, the [[the_role_of_myeron_a_fon_particles_in_quantum_computing | Majorana particle]] is like a mirror image of itself with no positive or negative side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

This unique property makes the [[the_role_of_myeron_a_fon_particles_in_quantum_computing | Majorana fermion]] highly resistant to [[challenges_in_quantum_computing_and_error_rates | decoherence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Quantum Decoherence
> [[quantum_computing_advancements | Quantum computers]] rely on properties like superposition and entanglement, allowing qubits to represent multiple states simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. However, qubits are extremely delicate and susceptible to their environment, leading to quantum [[challenges_in_quantum_computing_and_error_rates | decoherence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. This process causes qubits to lose their quantum properties and collapse into a classical state, resulting in high error rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

### Topological Quantum Computing

Microsoft's approach involves "topological [[quantum_computing_advancements | quantum computing]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>, where they braid and fuse [[the_role_of_myeron_a_fon_particles_in_quantum_computing | Majorana fermion]] particles together on an atomically engineered nanowire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. Computation is performed by measuring whether there's an even or odd number of electrons in the wire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

This results in a new type of semiconductor called a "topo conductor," which is essentially a superconductor-semiconductor sandwich where the semiconductor mimics the superconductor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. These can be chained together to scale up to millions of qubits on a small chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>, though this scaling has not yet been achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. The chip does require operation at near absolute zero temperatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

### History of the [[the_role_of_myeron_a_fon_particles_in_quantum_computing | Majorana Fermion]]

The [[the_role_of_myeron_a_fon_particles_in_quantum_computing | Majorana particle]] was first theorized in 1937 but only observed in 2020 by researchers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. Microsoft previously claimed observation in 2018 but had to retract their research paper due to misrepresentation of results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. Now, a few years later, Microsoft claims not only observation but also control of these particles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

## The [[quantum_computing_advancements | Quantum Computing]] Race

While Google and IBM appear to be currently ahead in the [[quantum_computing_advancements | quantum computing]] race <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>, Microsoft is uniquely pursuing the topological approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. If their claims are not overhyped, this could indeed be a world-changing technology, necessitating programmers to optimize code for quantum hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

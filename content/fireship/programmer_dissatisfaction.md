Despite common perceptions of high pay, generous vacations, and remote work options, a significant portion of professional developers experience dissatisfaction with their careers. According to the 2024 Stack Overflow survey results, 80% of professional developers know the feeling of waking up for work unwillingly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. The survey, which gathered over 65,000 responses from professional developers globally, reveals that one in three programmers actively dislikes their job, and nearly half are simply "plowing through life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This leaves only 20% reporting happiness in their roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Interestingly, statistics suggest that farmers and plumbers are happier than programmers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Reasons for Dissatisfaction

### Money

While programmers are generally well-compensated, the reality of their salaries may not always match expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. For instance, PHP is listed as one of the lowest-paid languages, with a median salary of $49,000, a decline from the previous year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. Millionaires like Mark Zuckerberg who worked with PHP also became entrepreneurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Popular languages often yield lower salaries due to increased competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>, whereas more specialized or less popular languages like Erlang and low-level languages like Rust tend to command better pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. Salaries are notably higher in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>, and becoming a manager can also increase earning potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. However, paradoxically, depression rates are higher in the United States compared to regions like Southeast Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>, suggesting that money alone does not guarantee happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

### [[common_frustrations_in_software_engineering | Technical Debt]]

The leading shared frustration among professional developers is [[common_frustrations_in_software_engineering | technical debt]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. This occurs when a codebase is ugly and flawed but continues to be built upon because starting over is too difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Over years or decades, it accumulates "to do: I'll fix it later" comments, making it nearly impossible to make changes without breaking the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. For an individual programmer, there's little that can be done about it, as it's a systemic issue rather than the fault of one person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

### Hustle Culture and Unrealistic Expectations

The industry is often characterized by a "hustle or die" culture, where pressure from various levels—from tech leads to CEOs—cascades down to software engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. This results in unrealistic timelines and expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. One potential coping mechanism is to quit, as the turnover rate among software engineers is high; switching jobs can often lead to better pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

### Bureaucracy and Lack of Impact

Many companies are burdened by excessive bureaucracy, making it challenging for programmers to accomplish tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. Programmers may find themselves attending numerous meetings to schedule other meetings, leading to disillusionment and a feeling that their work contributes nothing of value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

### Job Insecurity and Physical Health

Recent layoffs and the aftermath of the COVID-19 boom have led to increased job insecurity within the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. Additionally, programming often involves being sedentary, which science suggests is more unhealthy than smoking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

## Coping with Dissatisfaction

Despite the challenges, the video suggests that recognizing the inevitability of suffering can be a way to cope, asserting that "out of suffering have emerged the strongest souls and the most massive characters are seared with scars" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. Engaging in exercise is also highlighted as a powerful remedy for depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

A core lesson for any developer is to work smarter, not harder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This principle can be achieved by utilizing tools that enhance productivity and simplify daily tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. The following seven tools are personally used and recommended by a front-end web developer, back-end engineer, UX designer, entrepreneur, and accidental YouTuber, making them highly geared towards developers involved in the full product creation process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. All of these tools are free and built with web technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

## Featured Tools

### 1. Bundlephobia
Bundlephobia is a [[web_application_tools_for_developers | web application]] designed to help determine the size an NPM package will add to a project's total bundle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. For modern front-end frameworks, keeping the bundle size as small as possible is crucial for optimizing initial page load times for new users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

*   **Functionality**: Users can enter a package name to view its bundle size, download time, whether it's tree-shakable, and other information across different versions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
*   **Advanced Feature**: It allows uploading an entire `package.json` file to see all project dependencies ranked by size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

### 2. Cloudcraft
Cloudcraft is a [[web_application_tools_for_developers | web application]] that assists in designing and budgeting cloud infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. While currently only available for AWS, its principles can translate well to other major cloud providers like Azure and GCP due to similar pricing models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

*   **Interface**: It offers an intuitive drag-and-drop interface for connecting various cloud infrastructure services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
*   **Budgeting**: Beyond planning, it includes a budget tab that provides an estimated breakdown of total costs for the designed infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

### 3. Figma
Figma is a widely recognized design tool for drawing graphics and creating application mock-ups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. It provides both a desktop application and a web application, with the web app matching the desktop version's performance due to its use of WebAssembly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

*   **Accessibility**: Being web-based, projects can be accessed instantly from any machine without manual file transfers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   **Developer-Centric Features**:
    *   Allows mocking up different events that occur on elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
    *   Enables exporting styles as CSS, Android, or iOS styles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

### 4. Font Flipper
Font Flipper is a [[web_application_tools_for_developers | web application]] built with Angular and Firebase, specifically designed to help users choose fonts for their designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. It simplifies the tedious process of selecting from hundreds or thousands of free Google Fonts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

*   **Customization**: Users can import their own graphics and experiment with various fonts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
*   **Unique UI**: Features a Tinder-style UI for font selection, where users swipe left for disliked fonts and right for liked ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. Liked fonts can then be directly downloaded from Google Fonts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

### 5. VizBug
VizBug is a Chrome extension released in 2019 that allows for visual interaction with websites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

*   **Live Editing**: Users can measure elements, move components, and change styles directly in the browser without writing CSS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. The modified CSS can then be copied from the inspector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.
*   **Element Search**: It provides the ability to search for specific element types, highlighting all instances on the page (e.g., all links) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
*   **Productivity**: While it has a learning curve, mastering VizBug can significantly save time in front-end development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

### 6. Insomnia
Insomnia is a back-end tool specifically designed for debugging APIs, supporting both REST and GraphQL APIs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. It helps organize the entire API workflow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

*   **Workflow Efficiency**: It allows saving reusable values, eliminating the need to rewrite tedious HTTP requests daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.
*   **GraphQL Integration**: For GraphQL APIs, Insomnia automatically performs introspection, providing intelligent auto-completion (IntelliSense) when typing queries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. This integration enhances the overall [[developer_experience_and_tooling_in_react_native_and_flutter | developer experience]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

### 7. Flare
Flare is a design tool dedicated to creating 2D vector animations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. Similar to Figma, it can be used for drawing graphics but adds a timeline with keyframes to control motion over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.

*   **Open Design**: Flare is part of the open design movement, enabling users to view and learn from other designers' animation work directly on the site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.
*   **Native App Integration**: A key advantage of Flare is its ability to export graphics that work seamlessly in Flutter, making it easier to implement high-performance animations in native mobile applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.

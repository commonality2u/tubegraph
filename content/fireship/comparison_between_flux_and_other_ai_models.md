Flux, developed by Black Forest Labs, has emerged as a significant new AI image generation model, often being referred to as the "Mid Journey killer" and a "next-gen Stable Diffusion replacement" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. It is notably the underlying model powering Grok's images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Comparison with Other Leading Models

### Flux vs. Grok 2 and Imagen 3
Last week, two new AI image generators were released: Imagen 3 from Google and Grok 2 from Elon Musk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Both are capable of generating hyperrealistic images with accurate text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. However, neither Imagen 3 nor Grok 2 are [[open_source_ai_models | open source]] or uncensored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. In contrast, Flux is an [[open_source_ai_models | open source]] and uncensored model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

### Capabilities and Ethical Considerations

*   **Realism and Uncanniness:** Images generated with Flux are so realistic that they do not feel uncanny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
*   **Impersonation:** Google DeepMind's recent paper identified impersonation as the top danger of generative AI, surpassing concerns about intimate images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Flux is particularly effective at generating impersonations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
*   **Censorship and Offensive Content:**
    *   Imagen 3 is "far better tuned for generating Nazis" but strictly prevents impersonation or the generation of "anything even slightly offensive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
    *   Image Gen 2, Imagen 3's predecessor, had to be taken down due to its ability to generate "ethnically diverse Nazis," a flaw so significant that Sergey Brin commented, "we definitely messed up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
    *   An image generated by Grok and Flux caused outrage online, though it was considered wholesome by some for depicting opposing political figures working together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

### User Interface and Features
*   **Imagen 3:** Features an impressive user interface that uses AI to generate prompts as the user types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. It also includes an editor allowing users to regenerate specific parts of an image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

### Relationship with Stable Diffusion
Flux was created by former employees of Stability AI who previously worked on Stable Diffusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. This development is exciting because it sets a new benchmark for [[open_source_ai_models | open source]] models, especially given the "fairly disappointing" performance of Stable Diffusion 3 Medium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Flux is expected to be rivaled only by Stable Diffusion 3 Large <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

### Flux Model Variations and Licensing
Flux offers three distinct models: Flux Pro, Flux Dev, and Flux Schnell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.
*   **Flux Schnell:** This is the smallest model and is licensed under Apache 2.0, making it suitable for commercial use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
*   **Flux Pro:** Accessible through the Black Forest Labs API <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
*   **Flux Dev:** Offers the highest quality and efficiency for experimentation but cannot be used commercially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

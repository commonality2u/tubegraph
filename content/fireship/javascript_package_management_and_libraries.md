Initially conceived as an "embarrassing toy language" in 1995 by Brendan Eich, who was given seven days to create it, [[javascript_for_interactivity_and_frameworks | JavaScript]] was originally intended for browser pop-ups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. However, its use significantly expanded, especially after Ryan Dahl brought [[javascript_for_interactivity_and_frameworks | JavaScript]] to the server with Node.js in 2005 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This shift led to its use in building memory-hogging desktop apps with Electron, "janky" mobile apps with [[react_ecosystem_and_libraries | React Native]], and "unreliable" APIs with Express.js <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Proliferation of Libraries and Frameworks

Regardless of the project, hundreds of "game-changing next-gen libraries" are available to accomplish tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. When a [[javascript_for_interactivity_and_frameworks | JavaScript]] developer encounters a problem, there's an instinct to create a new [[comparison_of_javascript_frameworks | framework]] and upload it to GitHub <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. The sheer volume of npm packages is notable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. This environment has allowed libraries like `is-odd`, which checks if a number is odd, to receive over 400,000 downloads per week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

## [[javascript_modules_and_package_management | Module Systems]] and Compatibility Challenges

The [[javascript_modules_and_package_management | JavaScript]] ecosystem features multiple [[javascript_modules_and_package_management | module systems]], such as CommonJS and ESM (ECMAScript Modules) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. This variety can lead to uncertainty about whether an installed package will function as expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

## [[javascript_modules_and_package_management | Module Bundling]]

After developing a [[javascript_for_interactivity_and_frameworks | JavaScript]] application, the next step often involves [[javascript_modules_and_package_management | module bundling]] using tools like Webpack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

Despite its perceived flaws and chaotic development history, [[javascript_for_interactivity_and_frameworks | JavaScript]] has evolved into a powerful language by 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

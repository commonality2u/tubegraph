## Web Development in 2024

[[state_of_javascript_in_modern_development | JavaScript]] development remains a dynamic field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. A projected trend for 2024 is a decrease in the creation of new JavaScript frameworks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. This is partly due to the evolving developer experience, where most modern frameworks now offer similar features, such as signal-based reactivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

Instead of new frameworks, the focus is expected to shift towards developing better tools for existing frameworks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. This includes:
*   More visual editors and Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) for frameworks like React, allowing users to drag and drop components rather than writing code manually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
*   Frameworks such as Nuxt (n) incorporating built-in developer tools to streamline workflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

### The Role of AI in Web Development

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is anticipated to play a significant role in code generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. Tools like Visual Copilot can automatically generate framework code, along with Tailwind CSS styles, directly from a Figma design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

It is predicted that in the near future, every JavaScript framework will feature specialized tooling and its own AI tailored for generating accurate and useful code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. The framework that excels in this area is expected to dominate [[comparison_of_web_development_frameworks | web development]] for the next decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

### Mobile Development's Influence on Web Opportunities

Trends in mobile development are contributing to new opportunities on the web <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. There's a declining interest in downloading new mobile applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. While traditional mobile app building hasn't changed much, cross-platform development is seeing an increase in low-code tools that enable drag-and-drop interfaces for both iOS and Android <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

## Low-Level Systems Languages

Beyond web development, there are notable trends in low-level systems languages:

*   **Rust** continues its rapid growth, with its code now integrated into the Linux kernel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.
*   **Zig** is another emerging low-level language, known as the language behind the JavaScript Bun runtime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.
*   **Mojo** is presented as a Python superset capable of low-level memory management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. This combination of approachability and high performance makes it an ideal choice for [[future_trends_in_technology | AI]] and machine learning applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

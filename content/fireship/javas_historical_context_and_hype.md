Java is described as a [[java_as_a_boilerplate_driven_language | boilerplate driven language]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> designed for writing [[javas_verbosity_in_code | verbose]], object-oriented, "instant legacy code" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## Origins and Launch

Java "came into being thanks to a relentless hype campaign by Sun Microsystems in the middle of the dot-com bubble" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. It was initially invented with the goal of creating a better TV remote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Java officially launched for public use in 1996 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Motto and Reality

Java's motto is "write once, run everywhere" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. However, developers often interpret this motto to actually mean "write once, debug everywhere" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. The Log4j fiasco is cited as an example of a situation for which Java can be blamed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Influence and Related Technologies

Despite its criticisms, Java has had significant [[javas_influence_on_other_programming_languages | influence on other programming languages]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. It has inspired an "entire class of programming languages designed to make Java better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>, including Groovy, Closure, Scala, and Kotlin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

Java also inspired [[history_of_javascript | JavaScript]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>, a language that reportedly took 25 years for developers to make "halfway decent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Java even attempted to take over JavaScript's role on the web with Java Applets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. Applets were perceived as being so ineffective that they made HTML, CSS, and JavaScript seem like "a good abstraction for building UIs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## Current Usage

For the last 25 years, Java has been running on three billion devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>, with a majority of these being Blu-ray players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

> "There are only two kinds of languages, the ones people complain about and the ones nobody uses." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>
> "Whether you love it or hate it, Java can get stuff done and for that it deserves our respect." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>

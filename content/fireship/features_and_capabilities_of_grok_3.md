[[grok_3_and_its_impact_on_ai_benchmarks | Grok 3]], developed by [[elon_musks_advancements_in_ai_with_grok_3 | Elon Musk]], is a deep-thinking large language model that has recently emerged, making a significant impact on existing benchmarks and achieving the number one spot on the LM Marina leaderboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## Core Features

*   **Intelligence** [[grok_3_and_its_impact_on_ai_benchmarks | Grok 3]] is described as "smart as hell" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.
*   **Uncensored Content Generation** It is mostly uncensored and capable of generating content that is illegal in many parts of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. This includes generating images of celebrities or crafting profanity-laced poems about racial stereotypes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
    *   A test revealed that [[grok_3_and_its_impact_on_ai_benchmarks | Grok 3]] was the only LLM that would respond to an offensive prompt that other models blocked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
*   **Deep Thinking Mode** [[grok_3_and_its_impact_on_ai_benchmarks | Grok 3]] features a deep thinking mode, similar to "deep c car 1" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.
*   **Text-to-Video Capability** It reportedly has the ability to perform text-to-video conversions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.
*   **Data Access** [[grok_3_and_its_impact_on_ai_benchmarks | Grok 3]] is the only model with direct access to the "fire hose of data" from Twitter and xAI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
*   **Truth Seeking Optimization** xAI developers have optimized the model for "maximum truth seeking," even if it means sacrificing political correctness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

## Performance and Benchmarks

[[grok_3_and_its_impact_on_ai_benchmarks | Grok 3]] currently leads the LM Marina leaderboard, a blind taste test where humans compare various LLMs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Another benchmark indicates that [[grok_3_and_its_impact_on_ai_benchmarks | Grok 3]] surpasses [[multimodal_capabilities_of_gemini | Gemini]], Claude, DeepSeek, and GPT-4 in areas like math, science, and coding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. However, this particular benchmark did not include OpenAI's GPT-3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>, nor did it include CodeForces and Arc AGI benchmarks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

In practical application, [[grok_3_and_its_impact_on_ai_benchmarks | Grok 3]] has successfully generated valid Svelte 5 code in a single attempt and assisted in building a game in Godot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. Its overall performance appears to be plateauing at a level similar to other state-of-the-art models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

## Availability and Future Developments

[[grok_3_and_its_impact_on_ai_benchmarks | Grok 3]] is currently accessible to users with Twitter Premium Plus subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. It is expected to become available in countries such as Germany and the UK in the near future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

A more powerful version, "Super Grok," is planned for future release through a paid subscription service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Super Grok is anticipated to cost $30 per month, which would be significantly more competitive than ChatGPT Pro's $200 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

## [[training_infrastructure_and_future_developments_of_grok_3 | Training Infrastructure]]

[[grok_3_and_its_impact_on_ai_benchmarks | Grok 3]] was trained at the Colossus supercomputer in Memphis, Tennessee, which is believed to be the world's largest AI supercomputer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. This facility houses a cluster of over 200,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs, with plans for expansion to 1 million GPUs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. The immense power requirements of the facility necessitate the use of portable diesel generators to supplement the grid's electricity supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. This extensive infrastructure will be crucial for powering future developments like Super Grok <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

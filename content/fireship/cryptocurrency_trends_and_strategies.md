## Overview of Cryptocurrency in 2025

The year 2025 sees continued activity in the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin, which was predicted to hit $69,420, is currently around $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. This rise has created opportunities for new "rug pulls" like "Daddy token" or "hawwa" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. Additionally, [[AI influencers and their financial success | AI-powered alt coins]] have managed to generate billions of dollars in value out of nothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.

## Investment Strategies

### MicroStrategy's Model

MicroStrategy has implemented a "free money glitch" strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. This involves borrowing money to purchase Bitcoin, which causes the price to increase faster than the cost to service the debt, creating a self-sustaining financial loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. This approach is described as a legal and transparent Ponzi scheme that theoretically continues until the US dollar becomes worthless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.

### Ponzi Schemes

It is suggested that one path to wealth is to engage in personal crypto Ponzi schemes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. However, Hawk TW was involved in a massive crypto scam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Political and Economic Impact

The future direction of cryptocurrency, like [[future_trends_in_technology | technology]] in general, is significantly influenced by political leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. Under former President Trump, a more free-market approach with less regulation for [[AI influencers and their financial success | AI]] is anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. This could benefit startup founders and potentially lead to the creation of a "federal crypto Reserve," which would be favorable for "Crypt Bros" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. Historically, [[future_trends_in_technology | tech booms]] have been driven by low interest rates and easily accessible money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. However, going into 2025, a tighter monetary policy is expected, and a significant market crash might be necessary before interest rates are lowered again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

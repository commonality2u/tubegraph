[[technical_interview_challenges | Technical interviews]] are described as high-stakes, "life or death game[s]" that can be a "psychological rollercoaster ride" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Despite the process potentially being broken, one must "play the game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. The objective is to learn the secrets to high-pressure [[problemsolving_and_coding_practice | problem solving]] on the spot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Initial Challenges and Overthinking

Candidates often experience intense anxiety during [[technical_interview_challenges | technical interviews]], leading to a feeling of being an "imposter" and "blacking out" when faced with a seemingly simple problem like FizzBuzz, despite prior preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. The pressure can lead to overthinking, expecting "something with a really complex solution" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

Magically, when the anxiety dissipates, often after feeling one has already failed, the ability to think clearly returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

## Strategies for High-Pressure Problem Solving

### Breaking Down the Problem
A key strategy is to break down the problem into smaller, manageable parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. For conditional problems, this might involve:
*   **Identifying conditions**: For example, recognizing three conditions in FizzBuzz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
*   **Visualizing or Pseudocode**: Using a flowchart on a whiteboard or writing pseudocode can help structure thoughts without worrying about syntax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. This ensures a full understanding of requirements before writing code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

### Thinking Out Loud
It is crucial to "think out loud and explain your decisions throughout the process" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. This allows the interviewer to understand the candidate's [[problemsolving_and_coding_practice | problem-solving]] process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. "Saying something is almost always better than saying nothing at all" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. Practicing talking while solving problems is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

### Asking Clarifying Questions
If confused or frozen, instead of sitting silently, try to formulate a question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. Asking a question can help clarify requirements and get back on track <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

### Maintaining Composure
It is vital to "keep our composure" during the interview, as losing it can lead to further difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

## Adapting and Improving Solutions

Initial solutions may not be optimal or robust. For example, using division and checking for integers to determine divisibility is less robust than the modulo operator, which is available in "basically every language" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. Avoiding "language specific magic" is generally a good idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

Solutions should also be adaptable to future changes. If many conditions need to be checked, it's beneficial to "extract the data out of that statement" by defining a variable to be mutated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. This eliminates redundant checks and allows for better scalability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

## Understanding Performance (Big O)

While candidates might intuitively describe their algorithm's performance as "strong to quite strong" due to perceived lack of lag, interviewers expect a formal understanding of [[importance_of_learning_new_skills_and_efficient_problemsolving | Big O time complexity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. For a problem like FizzBuzz iterating `N` times, it demonstrates linear time complexity (O(N)), though for a fixed number of steps (like 100), it technically simplifies to constant time (O(1)) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

## Conclusion

The [[technical_interview_challenges | technical interview]] process, while challenging, can be navigated by applying structured [[problemsolving_and_coding_practice | problem-solving]] techniques, clear communication, and adaptability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Despite the immense effort ("blood sweat and tears") put into preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>, external factors like hiring freezes can still lead to disappointment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

Predicting the future is challenging, but 2022 promises to bring significant shifts in the developer landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Despite external chaos, developers and entrepreneurs focus on finding ways to build with code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This article explores major trends influencing developers and highlights potential opportunities.

## Web3 (The Decentralized Web)
Web3, or the decentralized web, is seen by some as the convergence point for modern technology, leading to new, unimaginable innovations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Others view it as a buzzword for crypto scams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

### What is Web3?
Web3 envisions a completely decentralized internet, free from firewalls, tolls, or government regulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. In this vision, smart contracts and crypto regulate everything, contrasting with the current internet controlled by giants like Google, Facebook, and Amazon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

### Decentralized Applications (DApps)
In a decentralized application (dApp), users own all their data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Identity is linked to a blockchain wallet address, often connected via browser plugins like MetaMask <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. The application's code resides on the blockchain as a smart contract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. This concept offers users real control over their digital presence, unmediated by central corporations or governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

### Criticisms of Web3
Web3 faces several criticisms:
*   It can be chaotic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
*   Developing quality apps with current tools is difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
*   It doesn't practically benefit most mainstream businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
*   Many tokens are owned by Silicon Valley insiders, undermining decentralization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
*   Cryptocurrency isn't strictly necessary for building decentralized apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
*   Excitement for Web3 might wane if crypto prices collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

Despite these challenges, building a decentralized internet presents significant opportunities for developers willing to tackle these problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. Getting in early could prove highly beneficial if Web3 goes mainstream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

### Startup Idea: Decentralized News Network
Given the declining trust in corporate media, a decentralized news network could be valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. Journalists could upload content (video, articles, reports) and be compensated based on reach, incentivizing good journalism and preventing top-down propaganda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

## The [[metaverse_opportunities_for_developers | Metaverse]]
The general concept of the metaverse is an internet-based platform with multiple access points (phone, VR, AR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. Users would have a single profile to interact with businesses, apps, and other users in a virtual environment, similar to VR Chat or Second Life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

### VR Skepticism
While the concept is cool, the VR aspect may not become mainstream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. Despite advances, most people don't like using VR, and the idea of further detaching from reality with a headset doesn't seem appealing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

### Developer Opportunities
Regardless, metaverses are being built, creating opportunities for developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. Learning Unity, Unreal Engine, or 3D modeling software like Blender would be beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

### Startup Idea: Metaverse Builder Platform
During a gold rush, it's wise to "sell shovels" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. A platform like Squarespace or Shopify for the metaverse would allow businesses to build digital metaverse experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. Since AR/VR apps are complex to develop, such a platform could serve millions of potential customers lacking the technical skills to engage with the metaverse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

## Artificial Intelligence (AI)
AI significantly impacted developers in 2021 with the release of GitHub Co-pilot, an AI tool that writes code automatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

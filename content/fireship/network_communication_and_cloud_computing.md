## Network Communication

### Shell and Remote Access
The shell is a program that exposes the operating system to the end user by wrapping the kernel, taking text input and producing output in a command-line interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>. Beyond local computers, the shell can connect to remote computers over a [[understanding_the_internet_and_the_world_wide_web | network]] using the secure shell protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:37">[02:37:37]</a>.

### The Internet and IP Addresses
The [[understanding_the_internet_and_the_world_wide_web | Internet]] is built upon virtual machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:04:00">[12:04:00]</a>. Each machine connected to the [[understanding_the_internet_and_the_world_wide_web | network]] via the [[understanding_the_internet_and_the_world_wide_web | Internet Protocol]] has a unique IP address to identify it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:06:00">[12:06:00]</a>. This IP address is often aliased to a URL, which is registered in a global database known as the Domain Name Service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:11:00">[12:11:00]</a>.

### Establishing Connections
To establish a connection, two computers perform a TCP handshake, enabling them to exchange messages called packets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:18:00">[12:18:00]</a>. For security, a layer like SSL is typically used to encrypt and decrypt messages over the [[understanding_the_internet_and_the_world_wide_web | network]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:25:00">[12:25:00]</a>.

### Protocols
Secure data sharing between computers is facilitated by the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:32:00">[12:32:00]</a>. Modern servers often provide a standardized way for clients to request data through an Application Programming Interface (API) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:40:00">[12:40:00]</a>. The most common architecture for APIs is REST, where URLs are mapped to specific data entities available on the server <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:46:00">[12:46:00]</a>.

## Cloud Computing

### Virtual Machines
In modern computing, interactions rarely involve direct use of bare-metal CPU and RAM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:51:00">[11:51:00]</a>. Instead, work is often done in the [[overview_of_cloud_computing_services | cloud]] using a virtual machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:53:00">[11:53:00]</a>. A virtual machine is software that simulates hardware, allowing large physical computers to be divided into many smaller virtual ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:57:00">[11:57:00]</a>.

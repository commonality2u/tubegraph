Programmers often exist in one of two states: imposter syndrome or a superiority complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. To boost one's ego or establish dominance, "flexing" on other developers is a common practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. This article explores various ways programmers engage in [[how_to_flex_as_a_programmer | flexing]] to assert their perceived superiority.

## The Art of "Flexing"

An illustrative (though fabricated) scenario demonstrates the concept of [[how_to_flex_as_a_programmer | flexing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>: A staff engineer encounters a programmer, dismisses their VS Code theme, and swiftly fixes a bug by removing 469 lines of code in Neovim on an Arch Linux desktop, leaving a single commit message: "optimize sub optimal code" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This act, followed by driving off in a Tesla, signifies a clear demonstration of superiority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

Here are practical ways programmers [[how_to_flex_as_a_programmer | flex]] on friends and colleagues:

### The Complexity Flex
While a genius admires simplicity, most people are not geniuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. To [[how_to_flex_as_a_programmer | flex]], one can take a simple, functional JavaScript function and intentionally complicate it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. This involves adding TypeScript to preach end-to-end type safety, then refactoring it into convoluted design patterns like an abstract factory, singleton, adapter, decorator, or proxy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. When others don't understand, the "flexer" can claim they've never seen "clean code" and imply they should have read the "Gang of Four" book, making them appear as a "programming God" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

### The Money Flex
The amount of money a programmer makes is directly tied to their perceived value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. This [[how_to_flex_as_a_programmer | flex]] operates on multiple levels:
*   **Level 1:** A junior developer earning $50,000 yearly showing off to former colleagues making less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
*   **Higher Levels:** This escalates from a colleague earning $225,000, to a Netflix engineer making $900,000, to an early Uber engineer with a $25 million net worth, and ultimately to a billionaire crypto investor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:02:09]</a>.

The speaker also mentions [[how_to_flex_as_a_programmer | flexing]] by owning YouTube Premium, which saves time by removing ads and allowing offline downloads of tutorials, alongside access to music streaming, thus optimizing time and saving money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

### The Vim Flex
Using Vim elevates a programmer to a "higher plane of consciousness," allowing them to look down on those using less sophisticated tools like VS Code, IntelliJ, or Emacs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. True Vim masters don't even use a mouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>, aligning with the [[hacker_programmer_stereotype | hacker programmer stereotype]].

### The Operating System Flex
Operating system choice is a potent [[how_to_flex_as_a_programmer | flex]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
*   **Macintosh & Apple Vision Pro:** Signals wealth, though also humorously implies being a "clown" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
*   **Linux:** Real developers use Linux <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. Ubuntu is a basic impressor, but paying for Red Hat Enterprise Linux is "bowler" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.
*   **Arch Linux:** The ultimate [[how_to_flex_as_a_programmer | flex]] in this category is someone stating, "I use Arch by the way," which implies having countless hours to configure their OS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>, reinforcing the [[gearhead_programmer_stereotype | gearhead programmer stereotype]].
*   **Windows:** Ironically, Windows is the ultimate distro because it signifies that the programmer "actually have a life and maybe even a girlfriend outside of programming" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

### The GitHub Flex
A programmer's GitHub commit history is a strong indicator of dedication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. A "real programmer" has a dense commit history and a profile adorned with enough awards and badges to resemble a "North Korean General" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:04:03]</a>. This ties into the [[passion_for_programming_versus_treating_it_as_a_job | effectiveness of programming in spare time]].

### The Chainsaw PR Flex
This involves finding small, new projects from enthusiastic developers, forking the code, and removing every possible line while ensuring tests still pass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. A vague pull request explaining "cleaned up the code to use best practices" is then sent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. The goal is for the project to be abandoned due to the overwhelming "flex" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>, potentially leading to [[programmer_dissatisfaction | programmer dissatisfaction]] for the original developer.

### The Influencer Flex
For those who "can't code," becoming an [[influencer_programmer_stereotype | influencer]] is an alternative [[how_to_flex_as_a_programmer | flex]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. This involves paying for platform access (like X/Twitter) and posting outrageous, unagreeable "hot takes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. Egregiously bad advice can even elicit replies from prominent figures, which can then be flexed about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

### The Past Experience Flex (FAANG)
Having worked at a FAANG (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google, etc.) company grants the privilege to preface every sentence with "As an ex-Facebook engineer, I recommend..." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. FAANG experience is a desirable "club" that many aspire to join, often requiring extensive LeetCode grinding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

### The Domain Flex
For web developers, owning valuable domain names is a [[how_to_flex_as_a_programmer | flex]] and an investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. Domains like "best-SEO-backlink-tool.net" are considered valuable assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

### The Ultimate Anti-Flex: Farming
The ultimate [[how_to_flex_as_a_programmer | flex]] a programmer can do is to leave the tech world and become a farmer, effectively joining the Amish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. This individual becomes "invincible to all the flexes" because their identity is no longer tied to superficial programming metrics like code quality, GitHub stars, likes, followers, or even money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. By connecting with nature and accepting their insignificance, they transcend the need for external validation and the competitive cycle, reflecting a deeper form of [[mental_and_physical_health_in_programming | mental and physical health in programming]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

## What is End-to-End Testing?
[[Testing strategies in software development | End-to-end testing]] involves running an application in a simulated environment to emulate actual user behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. Unlike [[Implementing unit and integration tests with Jest | unit tests]], which are designed to be fast and simple, end-to-end tests are often long and complex as they simulate full user interactions in a browser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. These tests are considered highly valuable for ensuring the application functions as expected from the user's perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

## Introduction to Cypress
Cypress is a powerful tool specifically designed for writing and running end-to-end tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. It provides a browser-based test runner that allows you to program tests that simulate various user actions, such as clicking buttons, filling out forms, and asserting changes in the Document Object Model (DOM) or user interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

### Installation
To install Cypress, run the command:
```bash
npm install cypress
```
This process downloads an actual browser that will run your tests in a real-world environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.

### Running Cypress Tests
After installation, you can add an `end-to-end` script to your `package.json` file:
```json
"scripts": {
  "e2e": "cypress open"
}
```
Executing `npm run e2e` from the command line will open the Cypress test runner, which includes built-in examples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.

### Exploring the Cypress Test Runner
The Cypress test runner allows you to view examples, such as the "actions" example, which demonstrates a test suite filling out a form, clicking buttons, and performing other interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.

The source code for these example tests can be found in the `cypress/integration` folder (e.g., `actions.spec.js`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.

### Writing Cypress Tests
Similar to Jest, Cypress tests define a test suite using `describe` and individual tests using `it` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.

Cypress simplifies coding automated web interactions with a jQuery-like syntax. This allows you to:
*   Match a DOM element (e.g., a form input) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>.
*   Type text into elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>.
*   Run expectations with `.should()` to verify proper values, CSS styles, or other UI attributes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>.

```javascript
// Example of a Cypress test
describe('My First Test', () => {
  it('Visits the Kitchen Sink', () => {
    cy.visit('https://example.cypress.io') // Visit a URL
    cy.contains('type').click() // Find element with text 'type' and click it
    cy.url().should('include', '/commands/actions') // Assert URL
    cy.get('.action-email') // Get an element by class
      .type('fake@email.com') // Type into it
      .should('have.value', 'fake@email.com') // Assert its value
  })
})
```

### Real-World Applications
In real-world projects, Cypress can be integrated with tools like the Firebase emulator to create mock databases and mock user authentication. This setup enables efficient testing of applications in an environment closely resembling production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>.

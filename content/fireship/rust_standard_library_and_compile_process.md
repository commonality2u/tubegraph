## Rust Standard Library

Rust includes a standard library that offers modules for handling various functionalities such as I/O, the file system, and concurrency, among many other things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

## Rust Compile Process

The compilation process in Rust involves several key stages and tools:

### The Borrow Checker
A critical component of Rust's compilation is the [[memory_safety_and_ownership_concepts_in_rust | Rust borrow checker]], which validates code at compile time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. These rules ensure code [[memory_safety_and_ownership_concepts_in_rust | safety]] while maintaining absolute control over [[rusts_performance_benefits_for_systems_programming | performance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

### Compiling to Executable
Rust code is compiled into an executable using the Rust compiler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. The result is a [[memory_safety_and_ownership_concepts_in_rust | memory safe]] executable capable of handling the most [[rusts_performance_benefits_for_systems_programming | performance]] intensive system requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

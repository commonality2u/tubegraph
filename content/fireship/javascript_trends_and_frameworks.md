Making predictions about the future is challenging, but trends in the developer landscape, particularly concerning [[javascript_and_frontend_development | JavaScript]], can be observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. [[javascript_and_frontend_development | JavaScript]] remains a foundational skill for developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

## Core [[javascript_frameworks_and_their_updates | JavaScript Frameworks]]
As of 2021, significant changes to major [[comparison_of_popular_javascript_frameworks_in_2021 | frameworks]] like React, Angular, and Vue have largely stabilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. The core aspects of these [[comparison_of_popular_javascript_frameworks_in_2021 | frameworks]] remain consistent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>:
*   **React** - Concurrent Mode was still experimental in 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.
*   **Angular and Vue** - Both [[comparison_of_popular_javascript_frameworks_in_2021 | frameworks]] continued to be solid and stable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

## Meta-Frameworks
Most of the exciting developments in the [[javascript_and_frontend_development | JavaScript]] ecosystem are occurring with meta-frameworks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

### Key Meta-Frameworks and Trends
*   **Next.js** - This is a leading meta-framework, and its parent company, Vercel, has become a multi-billion dollar entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. Next.js represents a full-circle return to server-rendered applications, combining their benefits with client-side rendering capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.
*   **Nuxt 3** - Within the Vue ecosystem, Nuxt version 3 showed incredible promise, though it was not yet feature-complete at the time of the video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.
*   **React Server Components & Hydrogen** - React Server Components were on the horizon, inspiring new [[comparison_with_other_javascript_frameworks | frameworks]] like Hydrogen from Shopify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.
*   **Remix** - Another notable meta-framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.
*   **SvelteKit** - The creator of Svelte, Rich Harris, was hired by Vercel to work on Svelte full-time, signaling optimism for the future of SvelteKit as a server-side rendering framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>. Previously, Svelte, despite being highly regarded, lacked the financial backing of a large company, which is now changing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

### Meta-Meta Frameworks
Beyond meta-frameworks, developers should also monitor "meta-meta frameworks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.
*   **Blitz.js** - An example built on top of Next.js, designed to simplify the creation of database-driven applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.

### Other Notable [[javascript_fundamentals_and_practical_concepts | JavaScript]] Tools
*   **Astro** - This tool allows websites to be built using one or multiple [[comparison_of_popular_javascript_frameworks_in_2021 | frameworks]] simultaneously, without sending any [[javascript_fundamentals_and_practical_concepts | JavaScript]] to the client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.

## Build Tools
Frontend developer build tools significantly improved in 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.
*   **Vite** - Offers a much simpler and faster developer experience compared to tools like Webpack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

### Opportunity: Server-Rendered Templates
There's an opportunity for independent developers to create and sell custom server-rendered templates for meta-frameworks. Unlike traditional WordPress templates (often based on React, Vue, or Angular), these could integrate backend functionalities like payment solutions (e.g., Stripe) or transactional email services (e.g., SendGrid), catering to specific industries like e-commerce, e-learning, or real estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.

## Other Relevant [[javascript_and_frontend_development | JavaScript]] Trends
*   **VS Code** - Continued to improve and can now be run directly in the browser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.
*   **[[integrating_tailwind_css_with_javascript_frameworks | Tailwind CSS]]** - Increased in popularity, especially with the introduction of Just-In-Time mode in 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.
*   **TypeScript** - Remained highly popular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.
*   **New [[javascript_fundamentals_and_practical_concepts | JavaScript]] Features** - Upcoming features include `at()` for negative indexing or accessing the last array element, standardized top-level await, and a more ergonomic way to use `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.
*   **GraphQL vs. REST** - GraphQL is not expected to replace REST, and its hype has somewhat subsided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.
*   **WebAssembly** - While not replacing [[javascript_and_frontend_development | JavaScript]], WebAssembly is quietly influencing development, exemplified by tools like StackBlitz, which brings server-side capabilities to the browser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.
*   **No-Code** - Continues to be a trend, but is not expected to replace the need for developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.
*   **Mobile Development** - Flutter and React Native are projected to maintain dominance in the cross-platform mobile development space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>.

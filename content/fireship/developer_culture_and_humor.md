In software development, "flexing" refers to the act of subtly or overtly demonstrating superiority or advanced skill to fellow programmers, often humorously. This behavior is presented as a way to boost one's ego, navigating the common states of [[common_frustrations_in_software_engineering | imposter syndrome]] or a superiority complex prevalent among programmers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## How to Flex as a Programmer

The video highlights various "flexes" that programmers can employ to establish perceived dominance or expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

### The Complexity Flex
This flex involves taking simple, functional code and re-engineering it to be overly complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
*   **Method**: Start with a basic JavaScript function, add TypeScript for "end-to-end type safety," then refactor it using multiple design patterns like Abstract Factory, Singleton, Adapter, and Decorator Proxy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
*   **Rationale**: The goal is to make the code difficult for others to understand, implying their lack of familiarity with "clean code" or design patterns from the "Gang of Four" book <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. This can humorously lead to perceived expertise and even a raise from a non-technical CTO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

### The Money Flex
Financial compensation is presented as a direct measure of a programmer's value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. This flex operates on a hierarchical scale:
*   A junior developer earning $50,000 can flex on old colleagues making $45,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
*   Someone making $225,000 due to better salary negotiation can flex on the $50,000 earner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.
*   A Netflix engineer making $900,000 can flex on the $225,000 earner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
*   An early Uber engineer with a $25 million net worth can flex on social media as a "genius technology investor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.
*   Ultimately, a billionaire crypto investor who profited from "rug pulling" (a scam) flexes on all lower tiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. This satirical progression highlights aspects of [[hustle_culture_and_workplace_pressure | hustle culture and workplace pressure]] and varying wealth accumulation in the tech industry.

### The YouTube Premium Flex
This personal flex is framed around optimizing time and [[developer_productivity_tools | productivity]], allowing a "lazy developer" to avoid ads and download tutorials offline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. It also provides access to music streaming, saving money on other services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

### The Vim Flex
Using Vim demonstrates superior value and elevates a developer to a "higher plane of consciousness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
*   **Perceived superiority**: Users of Vim are seen as superior to those using other [[software_engineering_and_development_tools | tools]] like VS Code, IntelliJ, or Emacs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
*   **Ultimate sign of skill**: Not using a mouse is considered a sign of a "real deal" Vim user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   **Common humor**: The video humorously acknowledges the common joke about not knowing how to exit Vim, but ironically claims an inability to exit VS Code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

### The Operating System Flex
The choice of operating system is another way to flex:
*   **Macintosh**: Indicates wealth, especially when combined with the Apple Vision Pro (humorously implying one is a "clown") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
*   **Linux**: Used by "real developers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
    *   Ubuntu can impress most people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.
    *   Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) demonstrates advanced status due to its cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   **Arch Linux**: The ultimate flex in the Linux community, often delivered with the phrase, "I use Arch by the way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. This implies significant time spent configuring one's OS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
*   **Windows**: Ironically, using Windows is presented as the "ultimate distro" because it suggests the developer has a life outside programming, possibly even a girlfriend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

### The GitHub Flex
A strong GitHub commit history is essential for a "real programmer" who cares about open source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. A profile should display numerous awards and badges, resembling a North Korean General <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. This often involves flexing on other open-source projects.

### The Chainsaw PR Flex
This advanced technique involves identifying small, new open-source projects, forking their code, and removing as many lines as possible while ensuring tests still pass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. A vague pull request explaining "best practices" is then sent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. The intended outcome is for the original project to be abandoned due to the overwhelming nature of this "flex" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. This can be seen as a humorous, extreme example of [[devops_practices | code review]] and optimization.

### The Influencer Hot Take Flex
For those less skilled in coding, becoming an influencer is an alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.
*   **Method**: Pay to post on platforms like X (formerly Twitter) and create outrageous, indefensible hot takes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.
*   **Goal**: The advice should be so egregiously bad that it might elicit a response from prominent figures, which can then be used for further flexing on other platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. The advice is humorously cautioned against being taken seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.

### The Past Experience (FAANG) Flex
Working at a FAANG (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google) company grants the privilege of starting every sentence with "As an ex-Facebook engineer, I recommend..." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. This is seen as an exclusive club that everyone desires to join, despite some claiming otherwise due to moral reasons (humorously dismissed as "hating" due to insufficient LeetCode grinding) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. This connects to the [[10x_developer_stereotype | 10x developer stereotype]] and perceived elite status.

### The Domain Flex
For web developers, a GoDaddy account filled with numerous domains is more valuable than a Robinhood account, as domains are seen as investments to pass down to future generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

## The Ultimate Flex: Learning to Farm

The ultimate programmer flex is to abandon programming entirely and learn to farm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.
*   **Invincibility**: This makes a programmer "invincible" to all other forms of flexing, as their identity is no longer tied to superficial metrics like code quality, GitHub stars, or money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.
*   **Realization**: Through connecting with nature and recognizing its inherent intelligence, the programmer transcends the superficialities of the tech world, finding liberation in the insignificance of their own existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. This satirical ending alludes to themes of [[mental_and_physical_health_in_programming | mental and physical health in programming]] and finding purpose beyond the digital realm, or perhaps the speaker is still just being "flexed on" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

The historical trend of automation replacing human labor, from farm work to factory and service jobs, now extends to programming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Initially, coding was seen as the new literacy, with skills like Python deemed essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. However, the emergence of AI tools like Copilot, GPT-4, and particularly Devon, has raised questions about the [[future_of_programming_with_ai | future of programming]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. The advent of Devon, an AI capable of autonomous code generation in an infinite feedback loop, has led to speculation about its [[impact_of_ai_on_coding_and_programming_skills | impact on software engineering]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Devon: The First AI Software Engineer

Developed by Cognition Labs, Devon is hailed as the first AI software engineer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This AI has access to the same developer tools as human engineers, including a terminal, browser, and code editor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. This enables it to solve problems in a manner similar to human software engineers, such as researching solutions on Google or Stack Overflow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

### Workflow and Capabilities
The [[role_of_ai_in_software_development_and_product_management | role of AI in software development and product management]] is exemplified by Devon's process:
*   A product manager provides requirements to Devon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
*   Devon creates a plan of action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
*   It fetches API documentation from the web <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
*   It writes code, runs it, fixes any errors encountered, and iteratively continues this process until the original problem is solved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
This iterative problem-solving approach is similar to tools like Auto GPT, where a Large Language Model (LLM) performs actions and reacts to feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

Devon's capabilities extend beyond basic coding, including:
*   Learning new technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>
*   Building and deploying applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>
*   Fixing bugs in existing codebases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>
*   Training its own AI models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>

### Performance and Limitations
Devon demonstrates significant improvement on the Software Engineering Benchmark (SWE-Bench), a test designed to assess AI's ability to solve real-world GitHub issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. While GPT-4 achieves a success rate of only 1.74%, Devon currently solves 13.86% of the problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

Despite this notable improvement, a 13% success rate is not yet sufficient to replace most human software engineers today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. However, this number is expected to improve in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. The real potential lies in parallel processing, similar to Google's Alpha Coder, which beats 85% of competitive programmers by generating thousands of possible solutions simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

Devon is already undertaking real jobs on platforms like Upwork and earning payment for its work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

### Industry Backing and Competition
Cognition Labs, the developer of Devon, is backed by prominent investors including Peter Thiel's Founders Fund, the Collison brothers from Stripe, and other key figures in Silicon Valley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

Another stealth startup in this space is Magic.dev, which has secured over $100 million in funding and shares an investor (Elad Gill) with Mistral and Perplexity AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. These [[developments_in_artificial_intelligence_and_aipowered_tools | developments in artificial intelligence and AI-powered tools]] indicate a strong industry push towards automating programming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

## Broader [[impact_of_ai_tools_on_coding_and_developers | Impact of AI Tools on Coding and Developers]]

While Silicon Valley appears intent on replacing programmers for profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>, there are reasons for skepticism regarding the immediate complete displacement of human engineers.
*   Like past hyped technologies such as self-driving cars or 3D printing, AI might not fully deliver on its revolutionary promises in the grand scheme of things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
*   Currently, AI tools excel at simple problems but can become counterproductive and even detrimental when dealing with more complex coding challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. This highlights current [[ai_advancements_and_industry_challenges | AI advancements and industry challenges]].

However, many experts believe these complex problem limitations will be overcome. Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, has stated that the goal is to create computing technology where "nobody has to program" and "everybody in the world is now a programmer" thanks to AI, signaling a potential shift in the [[impact_of_ai_on_creative_and_technical_professions | impact of AI on creative and technical professions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

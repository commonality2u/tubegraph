Google announced [[googles_response_to_gpt_4_with_gemini | Gemini 1.5]] on February 23rd, 2024, marking a significant development for the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. The model is described as a large language model with "serious RZ" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Key Features and Performance
[[Geminis_performance_benchmarks | Gemini 1.5]] is considered superior to [[comparison_between_gemini_and_gpt_4 | GPT 4]] on most benchmarks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. A standout feature is its staggering 10 million token context window, which significantly surpasses other models like Claude and GPT Turbo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This large context window allows the model to gain a better understanding of custom data, simplifying the system compared to traditional Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) stacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## Use Cases
The model demonstrates strong capabilities with code and video inputs:
*   **Code Understanding**: It can process an entire code base from a local machine and build new features on top of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. It reportedly performs better than tools like Co-pilot in incorporating components and libraries within a project, although a prompt could take a full minute to complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
*   **Video Analysis**: A significant [[multimodal_capabilities_of_gemini | multimodal capability]] is the ability to [[multimodal_capabilities_of_gemini | upload long videos]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. For instance, it can extract code and write tutorials from course videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

Overall, [[comparison_between_gemini_and_gpt_4 | Gemini 1.5]] makes [[comparison_between_gemini_and_gpt_4 | GPT 4]] "look like an antique from 2023" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

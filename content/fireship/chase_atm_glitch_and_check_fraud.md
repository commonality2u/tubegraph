In 2024, a significant glitch occurred at Chase ATMs, leading to widespread check fraud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>.

## Glitch Details and Impact
Most banking systems, including Chase's, rely on proprietary code, some of which dates back 50 years and uses ancient languages like COBOL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:00">[03:23:00]</a>. Typically, when a check is deposited, funds are held for a few days to clear before they can be withdrawn from an ATM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>. However, a glitch at JP Morgan Chase prevented this safeguard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>.

Viral videos surfaced on TikTok showing individuals withdrawing tens of thousands of dollars they did not possess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>. This was achieved by depositing a fake check and immediately withdrawing money from the ATM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>.

## Consequences
While seemingly a windfall for some, this act constitutes check fraud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>. Within a few days, those involved found their bank accounts significantly overdrawn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>. As a result, they are now facing lawsuits from the bank and potential criminal charges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>.

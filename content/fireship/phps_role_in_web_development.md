PHP is a dynamic, interpreted scripting language primarily used for building interactive websites on the server <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Despite some misconceptions about its relevance, PHP remains one of the most popular languages for [[Backend development and serverside concepts | back-end web development]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Widespread Usage and Influence

PHP powers a significant portion of the web, including:
*   Content Management Systems (CMS) like WordPress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.
*   Top-tier websites such as Wikipedia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.
*   Numerous other sites through frameworks like Laravel and Symfony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.
*   Even Facebook utilized PHP, though they developed a custom compiler for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

PHP revolutionized the web by making application development accessible to the average person, largely due to its open-source nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. Statistically, there is a 78.5% chance that a client's website is running PHP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

## [[History and origin of PHP | History and Origin]]

Created in 1994 by Rasmus Lerdorf, PHP was initially used to manage his personal homepage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. While its original acronym stood for "Personal Homepage," it is now commonly known as "Hypertext Pre-processor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. PHP has a special place in history as it predates JavaScript and was one of the first languages to be embedded directly into HTML <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. This capability allowed websites to be built dynamically on a server <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## [[Basic PHP syntax and usage | Core Syntax and Web-Specific Features]]

PHP's interpreter is implemented in C, and its syntax is inspired by Perl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

To begin with PHP, one typically creates a `.php` file and embeds PHP code within `<?php ?>` tags inside HTML <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. The code within these tags is processed on the server <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

Key [[Basic PHP syntax and usage | syntax]] elements include:
*   **`echo`**: Used to output values directly into the HTML at the tag's location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
*   **Variables**: Declared with a dollar sign (`$`) followed by a name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. PHP is a weakly typed language, so type annotations are not required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   **Predefined Variables**: PHP includes a large number of built-in variables specifically for [[web development]], such as `$_GET`, `$_POST`, and `$_COOKIE`, which hold information about the incoming HTTP request <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

When PHP code is processed on the server, the PHP tags are replaced with the echoed output, resulting in an HTML string <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

## [[PHPs programming paradigms and features | Programming Paradigms and Modern Features]]

PHP supports multiple [[PHPs programming paradigms and features | programming paradigms]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>:
*   **First-Class Functions**: Functions can be assigned to variables or used anonymously as arguments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.
*   **Extensive Built-in Functions**: It provides a vast array of built-in functions designed for virtually any task a [[web development | web developer]] might need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.
*   **Object Model**: PHP features a complete object model, enabling developers to define classes with inheritance for implementing object-oriented patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

Currently, PHP is on version 8, which includes all the features expected from a modern, pragmatic language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. Every [[web development | web developer]] should be familiar with PHP due to its pervasive presence on the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

Big O time complexity is a concept discussed during technical interviews to describe the performance of an algorithm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. It is considered an important topic to study for such interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.

## Examples

*   **Linear Time Complexity (O(n))**
    If a process, such as the "FizzBuzz" game, were to continue indefinitely, its performance would be described as linear time complexity, or O(n) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

*   **Constant Time Complexity (O(1))**
    When a task, like the FizzBuzz game, is limited to a fixed number of steps (e.g., 100 steps), its complexity simplifies to [[capabilities_and_limitations_of_o1_in_coding_benchmarks | O(1)]], also known as constant time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.

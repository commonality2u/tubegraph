Following its conviction in a US Department of Justice lawsuit for violating antitrust law and monopolizing the search market, Google faces future penalties and outcomes that are yet to be fully determined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. The initial legal battle concluded with a judge agreeing with the feds that Google was guilty of being an illegal monopoly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Unspecified Penalties and Ongoing Trial
The exact nature of the penalties for [[google_antitrust_lawsuit_and_monopoly_conviction | Google's antitrust conviction]] remains unknown, as this will be decided in a separate, ongoing trial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

## Possible Outcomes

### Corporate Breakup
While considered unlikely, it is possible that Google could be broken up into multiple entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. For instance, there's a hypothetical scenario where Google might be required to divest services like Gmail or Android <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. However, Google's search business currently generates substantial revenue, allowing it to subsidize these free projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. If Gmail were to operate independently, users might have to pay a monthly fee, potentially around $10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

### Fines and Contractual Restrictions
A more probable outcome for Google is facing a financial fine coupled with contractual restrictions on its business deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. This scenario is likened to the outcome faced by Microsoft when it was accused of being a monopoly in 2001, suggesting that "things might not be so bad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

### Impact on [[googles_exclusivity_deals_and_their_legal_consequences | Exclusivity Deals]]
The court determined that Google's [[googles_exclusivity_deals_and_their_legal_consequences | exclusivity deals]], such as requiring its search engine as the default on Android devices, its agreement with Mozilla Firefox, and its substantial payment to Apple (reportedly $20 billion annually) to maintain default search status, were anti-competitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:42">[01:41:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:52">[01:43:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:12">[01:46:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:04">[01:47:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:10">[01:49:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:50">[01:50:50]</a>. New contractual restrictions on these deals could potentially benefit Google by preventing other companies, like Apple, from "raking in cash" from these arrangements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:24">[02:41:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:01">[02:42:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:03">[02:44:03]</a>.

These potential outcomes highlight the broader [[implications_for_big_tech_companies_under_antitrust_scrutiny | implications for big tech companies under antitrust scrutiny]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

Recent [[developments_in_artificial_intelligence_and_aipowered_tools | AI-powered tools]] have generated significant discussion regarding their [[impact_of_ai_tools_on_coding_and_developers | impact on coding]] and software development. While some expected a rapid progression towards a technological singularity, the release of models like GPT 4.5 suggests a potential plateau in immediate, groundbreaking advancements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Current State of AI Models in Programming

The release of GPT 4.5 has been described as "underwhelming" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Despite being Open AI's most expensive model produced, it reportedly failed to significantly improve benchmarks, win awards, or offer novel capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Its primary selling point is an ability to chat in a more natural, human-like way, described as "Vibes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

### Cost and Accessibility
GPT 4.5 is noted for its high cost:
*   It is five times more expensive than Claude, at $75 per million input tokens and $150 per million output tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   Currently, access is limited to $200 per month Pro users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

### Performance and Limitations
While GPT 4.5 is said to have a lower hallucination rate, it still makes "silly mistakes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. It is not self-aware and does not know what GPT 4.5 itself is, stating its training cut-off as October 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

In the context of programming and science, GPT 4.5 does not perform as well as "deep thinking models like 03" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. On the AER polyglot coding Benchmark, it is worse at programming than DeepSeek and "hundreds of times more expensive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. As of late 2025, xAI's Grok is considered the best model globally based on betting markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

## Value of AI Tools in Programming
Despite the current limitations of some models, the general consensus is that [[ai_in_software_engineering | AI coding tools]] are "incredible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

The primary value of these tools lies in their utility for human programmers:
*   They are "most useful to real human programmers who know what they're doing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
*   This suggests that while [[Impact of AI on coding and programming skills | AI tools]] can augment development, they do not replace the need for fundamental human programming knowledge and skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

For computer science students, this "plateau is great news" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>, implying that foundational programming skills remain highly relevant in the [[future_of_programming_with_ai | future of programming]].

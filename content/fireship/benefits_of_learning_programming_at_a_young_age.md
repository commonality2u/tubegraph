One of the regrets often cited by experienced programmers is not having started their programming journey earlier in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>. Programming is a career with billions of possible paths and many conflicting opinions, making it unique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>.

## The Brain's Learning Capacity

When a person is young, their brain is highly optimized for learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>. As individuals age, their ability to learn can diminish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>. This phenomenon is observed in various fields, such as music, where most world-class musicians begin at a very young age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>. While it's possible to [[learning_to_code_as_a_skill | learn to code]] at any age, starting as early as two or three years old could potentially lead to securing a six-figure job by the age of 13 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.

## Career Advantages

There is an acknowledged "ageism" in the tech industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>. Employers often prefer younger programmers, perceiving them to have more "malleable" brains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>. This preference contributes to the median age of programmers globally being around 30 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>.

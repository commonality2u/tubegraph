To work smarter and increase [[developer_productivity_tools | productivity]], developers often use tools that simplify their workflow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This includes specialized tools for debugging [[apis_and_thirdparty_services_in_web_development | APIs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

## Insomnia

Insomnia is a back-end tool used for debugging [[apis_and_thirdparty_services_in_web_development | APIs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. While there are [[apis_and_thirdparty_services_in_web_development | REST]] clients integrated directly into [[debugging_with_vs_code | VS Code]], Insomnia is a preferred choice for managing the entire API workflow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

### Key Features of Insomnia

*   **Workflow Organization** The application helps keep an entire workflow organized, whether building a [[apis_and_thirdparty_services_in_web_development | REST]] [[apis_and_thirdparty_services_in_web_development | API]] or a GraphQL [[apis_and_thirdparty_services_in_web_development | API]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
*   **Reusable Values** It allows users to save reusable values, eliminating the need to rewrite tedious HTTP requests during debugging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.
*   **User Interface** Insomnia features a beautiful and well-laid-out user interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.
*   **GraphQL Integration** When creating a request for a GraphQL [[apis_and_thirdparty_services_in_web_development | API]], Insomnia automatically performs introspection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. This provides IntelliSense for queries, enhancing the overall developer experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

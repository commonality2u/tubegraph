On March 23, 2023, GitHub announced Copilot X, a next-generation coding assistant powered by GPT-4, marking a significant [[future_implications_of_ai_in_programming | step towards the singularity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This development, along with other recent [[future_developments_and_expectations_for_ai_technology | AI announcements]], signals a major "AI inflection point" in 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## [[impact_of_ai_tools_on_coding_and_developers | Impact of AI Tools on Developers]]

[[role_and_value_of_ai_tools_in_programming | AI tools]] like Copilot X are likened to "anabolic steroids" for developers, providing a significant advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Within two years, it's anticipated that nearly all professional coders will be using these tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

While some who love to [[impact_of_ai_on_coding_and_programming_skills | code]] or are [[impact_of_ai_on_coding_and_programming_skills | learning how to code]] might feel pessimistic, worrying that open-source code and tutorials have been used to train large language models that automate white-collar jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>, the speaker believes [[future_of_programming_and_ai_agents | programming is not dead]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Resistance to these tools is futile, and an optimistic approach is necessary for survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. These [[role_and_value_of_ai_tools_on_programming | tools]] are expected to make programmers more powerful, enabling them to build systems 10 times faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. [[Future of programming and AI agents | AI]] still requires programmers to deliver great products to end-users and understand how to build systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## Microsoft's Dominance in AI
Microsoft is noted for its dominant position in the AI space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. In a short period, they have released multiple [[future_developments_and_expectations_for_ai_technology | AI-powered products]], including Bing Chat, Copilot for Office, Bing Image Generator, and Copilot X <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Their strategy, which included not killing off Bing years ago and acquiring GitHub while taking a major stake in OpenAI, has positioned their products years ahead of the competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

## Key Features of GitHub Copilot X
GitHub Copilot X is currently in technical preview and is expected to offer at least five game-changing features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

### Built-in Chat Window
This feature allows users to highlight code blocks and ask the [[role_and_value_of_ai_tools_on_programming | tool]] for explanations, refactoring, or to generate unit tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. Unlike general chatbots, it is highly specialized for coding problems and maintains the context of the user's actual codebase, leveraging GPT-4's ability to handle 25,000 tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

### Copilot for Documentation
Instead of consulting documentation or Stack Overflow, this feature can generate answers based on specific library documentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. It integrates documentation for technologies like React, Azure, and MDN to generate answers and tutorials on the fly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

### Voice-Activated Copilot
This feature enables users to control VS Code and write code entirely using voice commands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. It's envisioned to be faster than typing and allows coding in situations where typing might be difficult, such as while exercising or commuting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. The need for fast typing speeds, like 150 words per minute in Vim, will become less important in the [[future_of_programming_and_ai_agents | AI programming age]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

### Copilot for Pull Requests
This feature can generate a description for a pull request based on the code changes made, even if those changes were themselves made by [[future_of_programming_and_ai_agents | AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

### Copilot CLI
[[future_of_programming_and_ai_agents | AI autocompletion]] will extend beyond the text editor into the terminal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. Users will no longer need to memorize extensive Linux commands; they can simply describe what they want to do with a library like ffmpeg, and Copilot CLI will generate the command along with an explanation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

## Future Outlook and Implications
While Copilot X is still months away from public release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>, its [[future_implications_of_ai_in_programming | future implications]] are profound. The current period presents a "small window" for programmers to potentially "poison the training data" on GitHub to preserve existing [[future_implications_of_deepthinking_ai_models_on_programming_jobs | programming jobs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. The existence of these [[future_developments_and_expectations_for_ai_technology | AI advancements]] is attributed to the billions of lines of code written by programmers over the last 30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

Computer programmers today rely on modern code editors to create software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. The evolution of these tools over the last 50 years has transformed how code is written, introducing features that were once revolutionary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Early Innovations and Text-Based Editors

Before the advent of the computer screen and visual terminals, programmers used punch cards, where a single incorrect keystroke meant restarting from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Revolutionary features like undo, find and replace, and copy and paste became commonplace with the development of the computer screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

### [[features_of_popular_code_editors_like_vi_vim_and_emacs | Vi]]

The text editor [[features_of_popular_code_editors_like_vi_vim_and_emacs | Vi]] was written by Bill Joy and released in 1976 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. It remains a standard tool on most [[History of Linux | Linux]] distributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. [[features_of_popular_code_editors_like_vi_vim_and_emacs | Vi]] is primarily a keyboard-based editor, meaning the mouse has no useful function, largely because the mouse didn't become mainstream until the Apple Macintosh was released in 1984 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

[[features_of_popular_code_editors_like_vi_vim_and_emacs | Vi]] is a modal editor, where keyboard keys perform different actions depending on the active "mode" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. To write text, users must enter "insert mode" by pressing the 'i' key, then escape back to "command mode" to save a file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. While it has a steep learning curve, proficient users can edit code very quickly, for example, deleting an entire line with "double d" or three lines with "3 d" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. However, basic [[features_of_popular_code_editors_like_vi_vim_and_emacs | Vi]] lacks features like syntax highlighting or plugin support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

### [[features_of_popular_code_editors_like_vi_vim_and_emacs | Emacs]]

Around the same time, Guy Steele at MIT created [[features_of_popular_code_editors_like_vi_vim_and_emacs | Emacs]], which stands for "editor macros" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. Like [[features_of_popular_code_editors_like_vi_vim_and_emacs | Vi]], [[features_of_popular_code_editors_like_vi_vim_and_emacs | Emacs]] is primarily keyboard-based but is highly extensible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. It integrates additional features such as debuggers, a file manager, and a terminal emulator, functioning as a full-blown integrated development environment (IDE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

[[features_of_popular_code_editors_like_vi_vim_and_emacs | Emacs]] is a non-modal editor, making it feel more user-friendly than [[features_of_popular_code_editors_like_vi_vim_and_emacs | Vi]] initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. However, it requires the use of many modifier keys, which can lead to a condition known as "emacs pinky" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. It boasts over 10,000 built-in commands for customization and automation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

### The "Vi" vs. "Emacs" Rivalry

The philosophical differences between [[features_of_popular_code_editors_like_vi_vim_and_emacs | Emacs]] and [[features_of_popular_code_editors_like_vi_vim_and_emacs | Vi]] have led to distinct factions: the "cult of [[features_of_popular_code_editors_like_vi_vim_and_emacs | Vi]]" and the "church of [[features_of_popular_code_editors_like_vi_vim_and_emacs | Emacs]]" (founded by Richard Stallman), who have engaged in decades of rivalry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. Despite this, [[features_of_popular_code_editors_like_vi_vim_and_emacs | Vi]]-based editors are significantly more popular in modern times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

### [[features_of_popular_code_editors_like_vi_vim_and_emacs | Vim]] and Neovim

[[features_of_popular_code_editors_like_vi_vim_and_emacs | Vim]], or "[[features_of_popular_code_editors_like_vi_vim_and_emacs | Vi]] Improved," was created in 1991 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. It's a superset of [[features_of_popular_code_editors_like_vi_vim_and_emacs | Vi]]'s core functionality but adds essential features like syntax highlighting, multi-level undo, and plugin support, making it more developer-friendly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. [[features_of_popular_code_editors_like_vi_vim_and_emacs | Vim]] encourages keeping fingers on the home row, which can improve coding speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. It also supports features like code completion, similar to a regular IDE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

Neovim, a popular fork of [[features_of_popular_code_editors_like_vi_vim_and_emacs | Vim]], was released in 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. It's faster than [[features_of_popular_code_editors_like_vi_vim_and_emacs | Vim]] and addresses criticisms of [[features_of_popular_code_editors_like_vi_vim_and_emacs | Vim]]'s scripting language, Vimscript, by embedding Lua, a fast and proven language, for customization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

### Nano

Nano, part of the GNU project, came out in 1999 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. It's another keyboard-based editor launched from the command line, but unlike [[features_of_popular_code_editors_like_vi_vim_and_emacs | Vim]], it's non-modal and has a much gentler learning curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. It displays important keybindings at the bottom of the screen, making it easier for beginners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. While lacking full IDE features, Nano is a great option for quick file edits from the terminal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

## Graphical User Interface (GUI) Editors

The majority of developers today use editors with a graphical user interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.

### Notepad and Notepad++

One of the earliest GUI programs was Notepad on Windows, released in 1983 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. It was designed, in part, to commercialize the mouse for MS-DOS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. Notepad++ is a more modern version for programmers, allowing users to place the cursor or highlight text by clicking and dragging with a mouseâ€”a feature that felt revolutionary in the early 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. Notepad++ supports macros and plugins, making it suitable as a primary development environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

### Adobe Dreamweaver

Adobe Dreamweaver is a proprietary IDE that was once very popular for web development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. While visually appealing, it tends to be slow and complex, similar to other Adobe software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. Its antiquated support for technologies like jQuery and Bootstrap makes it less relevant for modern web development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

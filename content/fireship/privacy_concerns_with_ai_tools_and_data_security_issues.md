Concerns surrounding privacy and data security are increasingly prevalent with the rapid [[developments_in_artificial_intelligence_and_aipowered_tools | developments in artificial intelligence]] and AI-powered tools. These concerns span from accusations of intellectual property theft to the collection and transmission of user data.

## Accusations of IP Theft and Data Misuse

OpenAI has reportedly accused DeepSeek of IP theft, alleging that DeepSeek "stole open ai's outputs" to fine-tune their models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This technique, known as "distillation," is described as strictly forbidden in OpenAI's terms of service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. The accusation involves taking a large, expensive model and using its outputs to transfer knowledge to a smaller model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

While hard evidence for these specific accusations has not been provided, screenshots circulated online show DeepSeek providing responses similar to those expected only from ChatGPT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. Microsoft, which provides servers for much of OpenAI's compute, observed someone in China extracting "large volumes of data from the open AI API," accounts they believe may be linked to DeepSeek <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. OpenAI's primary issue appears to be using their API to build a rival model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

### Distillation as a Technique
Distillation is not inherently controversial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. DeepSeek has models distilled from LLaMA and Qwen, and it is even possible to distill OpenAI models, provided the API is not used to create a rival model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

## OpenAI's Own Data Practices
The accusation of IP theft against DeepSeek highlights an "artificial super irony" given OpenAI's past practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. OpenAI itself has been criticized for "vacuum[ing] up the entire internet and all its copyrighted materials without asking anybody for permission" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. This has led to various lawsuits, including Elon Musk accusing them of scraping Twitter and George R.R. Martin along with other authors suing for copyright infringement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. Despite these challenges, OpenAI has "mostly prevailed in their copyright infringement legal battles" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

> [!INFO] Tech Bro Founder Secret
> A common strategy among tech founders is to "do shady stuff and then ask for forgiveness later" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. The rationale is that once a company reaches "critical mass," it becomes unstoppable, with Uber and Airbnb cited as prime examples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## User Data and Privacy Concerns with AI Tools
A significant criticism regarding DeepSeek is that "all your prompts data and keystrokes go to China" when used on the web <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

> [!WARNING] General Internet Privacy
> If privacy is a concern, users are advised to avoid using the internet entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. Alternatively, running AI models locally can mitigate these data transmission risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

A common regret among programmers is not finishing more projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. Many developers, for instance, might have a directory filled with numerous side projects, with only a small fraction ever reaching completion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

## Why Projects Take Longer Than Expected

Finishing a software project almost invariably takes significantly longer than initially estimated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. This phenomenon is often described by the **"90/90 rule"**:
> When you feel like you're 90% done with a project, you still have 90% to go <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

Unlike fields such as bridge building, where everything is detailed in a blueprint, software development frequently encounters unexpected issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. All kinds of unforeseen problems can arise during the development process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

## Solo Developer Challenges

For a [[building_a_profitable_software_business_as_a_solo_developer | solo developer]], distractions are a major hurdle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. It's easy to abandon a project midway and begin something entirely new from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. The regret of not finishing projects often stems from the feeling of wasted hours with nothing substantial to show for the effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

## Knowing When to Cut Losses

While finishing projects is often desired, it's also crucial to be realistic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. Some projects simply aren't worth completing, and recognizing when an application is fundamentally flawed or not viable can be more important than pushing through to the end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. Knowing when to "cut your losses" is a valuable skill in software development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

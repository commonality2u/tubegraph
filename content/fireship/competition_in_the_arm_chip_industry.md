The computing world is currently experiencing a global "arms race" to build the best ARM-based chips and dominate the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. This competition involves major tech giants like Apple, Samsung, Google, Microsoft, and even Intel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## The Rise of ARM Architecture

Historically, personal computers, including those running Windows or macOS, have relied on CPUs using the [[differences_between_arm_and_x86_architectures | x86 architecture]], primarily built by Intel or AMD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. The [[differences_between_arm_and_x86_architectures | x86 complex instruction set]] is known for its versatility and speed across various computing needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

However, with the advent of smartphones, ARM processors gained prominence due to their [[differences_between_arm_and_x86_architectures | reduced instruction set]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. This design requires fewer transistors per instruction, leading to greater power efficiency, which is critical for battery-powered devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

The perception that ARM wasn't optimal for regular computers changed drastically in 2020 with the release of Apple's [[apple_silicon_m1_vs_intel_i9 | M1 chip]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. Apple's laptops became faster, quieter, and more thermally efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. This success motivated Microsoft to initiate Project Volterra to run Windows on ARM chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. Data centers, such as AWS, also realized the efficiency benefits of ARM chips in the cloud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. Consequently, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft are now developing their own ARM chips for their data centers, including AWS Graviton and Google Axion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

While the company ARM designs the architecture, it has never manufactured a chip itself, instead licensing its designs to large companies like Apple, whose chips are manufactured by companies like Taiwan Semiconductor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

## Key Players and Their ARM Offerings

### Apple's M4 Chip
Apple recently unveiled its [[apples_m4_chip_unveiling | M4 chip]], positioning it as a leading chip in the PC market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Key features include:
*   CPU 50% faster than the M2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.
*   Built-in Ray tracing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.
*   A neural engine capable of 38 trillion operations per second, making it a fast chip for [[ai_capabilities_in_modern_chips | AI workloads]] on the PC market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.
Apple's strategy appears to focus on running large language models (LLMs) directly on devices, enabling offline functionality, low latency, and enhanced user privacy for [[ai_capabilities_in_modern_chips | AI interactions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

### Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite
Apple's lead in the ARM space may be challenged soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. Qualcomm is expected to release its Snapdragon X Elite chip, which could potentially outperform the M4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. This chip is slated to power Windows on Surface laptops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. Qualcomm claims its neural engine can achieve 45 trillion operations per second, surpassing the M4's 38 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

### Traditional x86 Players Entering the Fray
Even traditional [[differences_between_arm_and_x86_architectures | x86 CPU manufacturers]] are adapting to the ARM-centric landscape:
*   **Intel:** Leaked documents suggest Intel's new Aero Lake processor is being designed for lower power consumption and could potentially handle over 100 trillion operations per second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
*   **AMD:** AMD is also releasing its new Ryzen AI 9 chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

## The Future of AI and Chips
The intense competition in chip development is largely driven by the belief that in the near future, devices capable of running the best [[ai_capabilities_in_modern_chips | AI models]] natively will be the most sought-after by consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. For hardware companies like Apple, it is strategically crucial that their laptops can run [[ai_capabilities_in_modern_chips | AI]] as effectively, if not better, than competitors like Microsoft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

## The Enduring Role of x86
Despite the significant shift towards ARM, the [[differences_between_arm_and_x86_architectures | x86 architecture]] is unlikely to disappear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. Having been around for over 45 years, it is deeply embedded in modern infrastructure and is expected to remain relevant for a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

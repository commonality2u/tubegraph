During the week of February 23rd, 2024, Google rolled out a redesign for its sign-in page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48">[02:48]</a>. This change had been previewed for weeks via a banner on the page, indicating improvements to its "modern look and feel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42">[02:42]</a>. The final implementation was described, sarcastically, as "mind-blowing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49">[02:49]</a>.

## Key Changes
The primary visible alteration in the redesign was a transition from a vertical layout to a more horizontal one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50">[02:50]</a>.

## Perceived Technical Difficulty
The redesign was facetiously labeled a "Monumental achievement for web Developers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41">[02:41]</a>. The speaker highlighted, with sarcasm, the challenges of centering a `div` in the middle of the page and centering a form input within a flex row <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53">[02:53]</a>. It was humorously stated that accomplishing a change of this "magnitude" was "no easy fee" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01">[03:01]</a>.

The process was comically imagined to involve hundreds of product managers and multiple vice presidents, all contributing to what ultimately resulted in an intern modifying some HTML <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03">[03:03]</a>. The only missing component from this "event" was a keynote speech from Sundar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12">[03:12]</a>.

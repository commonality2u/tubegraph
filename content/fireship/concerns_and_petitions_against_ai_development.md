The emergence of generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs) has led to widespread fear regarding their impact on the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This apprehension has manifested in various concerns and organized efforts to manage AI development.

## Calls for a Pause in AI Training

A significant petition has been signed by over 1,000 individuals, urging all AI labs to immediately halt the training of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. The petition advocates for this pause to remain in effect until there is confidence that these systems will not pose a threat to humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

Notable signatories include:
*   Steve Wozniak of Apple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>
*   Victoria Krakovna of DeepMind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>
*   Elon Musk, who attempted a takeover of OpenAI in 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>

## Key Concerns Regarding AI

### Economic and Job Displacement
OpenAI released a paper concluding that up to 49% of workers could have at least half of their job functions enhanced by AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This has raised questions about the relevance of traditional education, such as computer science degrees, if AI can write and debug its own code or build applications from simple designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. It's suggested that most other degrees, including history, math, gender studies, and business, will be similarly affected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. The ability of tools like ChatGPT to instantaneously solve assignments and quizzes means 89% of students are "working smarter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

### Existential and Safety Threats
A fear exists that AI technology could infiltrate robotic systems, potentially leading to scenarios like an "army of robot dogs with snake heads holding machine guns" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Calls for [[ethical_considerations_and_regulations_for_aigenerated_content | AI regulation]] are considered necessary before [[Skepticism about AI achieving general intelligence | artificial general intelligence (AGI)]] emerges and "completely takes over" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

### Autonomy and Self-Improvement
The idea of AI executing its own code, achievable with new ChatGPT plugins, is a source of concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. If problem requirements are well-defined, AI could generate tens of thousands of solutions and test all of them to find the optimal one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. This capability could potentially render manual source code writing obsolete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

### Impact on Online Authenticity and Content
AI is perceived as making the internet "boring" by making it difficult to discern if social media accounts or images are human-crafted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. An example cited is a widely circulated AI-generated image of the Pope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. This leads to concerns about the "dead internet theory," where large tech companies may have used AI for years to populate the internet with fake accounts to boost advertising revenue and encourage creator engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

## Counterarguments to AI Fears and [[Criticism of OpenAI and AI industry hype | Industry Hype]]

### AI [[Limitations and challenges of current AI technologies | Limitations]]
While ChatGPT excels at solving previously resolved "leetcoded" questions, it becomes less effective when attempting to build complex systems or dream applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. Large language models primarily "regurgitate information from the internet in clever ways," struggling when the information has never been processed before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

### Marketing and Hype
A significant portion of AI discussion is seen as marketing hype <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, is noted for his ability to accelerate growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. Despite claims that GPT-4 is not as good as it seems, OpenAI simultaneously releases papers discussing its potential and "sparks of AGI" without disclosing technical details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. This hype has transformed OpenAI from a tech-industry-specific company into a household name, with over five percent of the workforce using ChatGPT daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

### Predictive Plateau
It is argued that AI will eventually plateau like all other technologies, rather than leading to an "exponential Singularity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. The underlying algorithms for large language models are not considered overly complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. While OpenAI was the first to develop a widely used product from the transformer idea (introduced by Google in 2017), GPT-4 is believed to be far from AGI and that AGI may not appear soon, or possibly ever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. It is suggested that a "secret sauce" needed to create AGI might be missing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. AI will likely excel at mimicking humans but will never surpass human intellect, as it is based on existing internet content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

From: [[fireship]] <br/> 

Meta released its latest large language model, [[overview_of_metas_llama_31_large_language_model | Llama 3.1]], which is described as being "free and arguably open source" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This model comes in three sizes: 8 billion (8B), 70 billion (70B), and 405 billion (405B) parameters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

## Open Source Elements

The "cool thing about [[overview_of_metas_llama_31_large_language_model | Llama 3.1]] is that it's open source â€” well, kind of" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. Key aspects that are open include:
*   **Model Weights**: The model weights for [[overview_of_metas_llama_31_large_language_model | Llama 3.1]] are open <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. This is considered a "huge win for developers building AI powered apps" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
*   **Training Code**: The actual code used to train the model is inspectable, consisting of "only 300 lines of python and pytorch along with a library called Fair scale" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

## Licensing and Usage

[[overview_of_metas_llama_31_large_language_model | Llama 3.1]]'s licensing allows for significant [[freedom_in_ai_development | freedom in AI development]] and commercial use:
*   **Commercial Use**: Users "can make money off of it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.
*   **Licensing Threshold**: If an application using [[overview_of_metas_llama_31_large_language_model | Llama 3.1]] exceeds 700 million monthly active users, a specific license request from Meta is required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

## What is Not Open Source

While the model weights and training code are accessible, the training data used for [[overview_of_metas_llama_31_large_language_model | Llama 3.1]] is not open source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. This data "might include your blog, your GitHub repos, all your Facebook posts from 2006 and maybe even your WhatsApp messages" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## Benefits for Developers and the AI Ecosystem

The open nature of [[overview_of_metas_llama_31_large_language_model | Llama 3.1]] provides several advantages:
*   **Reduced API Costs**: Developers no longer have to pay "a bunch of money to use the [[comparison_of_llama_31_with_openais_gpt_models | GPT-4 API]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   **Self-Hosting**: It enables the ability to "self-host your own model" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>, although self-hosting the largest 405B model can be expensive due to its 230 GB weight and GPU requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
*   **Fine-Tuning**: [[overview_of_metas_llama_31_large_language_model | Llama 3.1]] "can be fine-tuned with custom data" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. This capability is expected to lead to "amazing uncensored fine-tune models like Dolphin" in the near future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

Meta is seen as "really the only big tech company keeping it real in the AI space" due to its commitment to opening up its models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

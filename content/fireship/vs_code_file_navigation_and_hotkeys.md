[[modern_code_editors_like_visual_studio_code_and_jetbrains | Visual Studio Code]] (VS Code) has rapidly become the most popular code editor among developers, according to the Stack Overflow 2018 survey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. It is known for being minimal, powerful, free, and open source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Efficient file system navigation is a core skill for effective use of VS Code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Opening VS Code

You can open VS Code directly from your command line by running `code` followed by the directory you wish to open <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Navigating with Hotkeys

The quickest way to move around within VS Code is by memorizing [[vs_code_keyboard_shortcuts | hotkeys or key bindings]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

*   **View and Customize Key Bindings**: Press `Ctrl+K` to bring up a comprehensive list of key bindings that you can search through and customize as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
*   **[[command_palette_usage_in_vs_code | Command Palette]]**: The most crucial hotkey is `Ctrl+P`, which opens the [[command_palette_usage_in_vs_code | Command Palette]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
    *   **File Navigation**: To navigate between files, simply start typing the file name in the [[command_palette_usage_in_vs_code | Command Palette]], and VS Code will automatically search through your project's file tree to find the corresponding file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This method is significantly faster than clicking through a directory tree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## Enhanced Navigation with Extensions

For advanced navigation, such as bookmarking specific lines of code, you can use [[vs_code_extensions_for_productivity | extensions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. A bookmark plugin allows you to:
*   Highlight a block of code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
*   Set a bookmark number for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   Easily navigate back to that bookmarked section later using the [[command_palette_usage_in_vs_code | Command Palette]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

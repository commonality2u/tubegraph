Electron is a framework for [[Building Desktop Apps with Electron | building desktop applications]] using web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. While powerful, it also faces valid criticism regarding its performance and resource usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Common Criticisms

*   **Large App Size** Electron applications bundle Chromium and Node.js from the outset, which often results in a very large application size, even for simple apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
*   **Resource Intensive** Running Chromium can be resource-intensive, meaning Electron apps may use more CPU and RAM compared to comparable applications built with native technologies like Objective-C or C# <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## Context and Justification for Use

Despite these drawbacks, the speaker suggests that they often don't significantly impact most developers or the overall "big picture" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

*   **Developer Experience** For web or Node.js developers, Electron provides an exceptional developer experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
*   **Business Viability** Electron makes [[Building Desktop Apps with Electron | desktop app development]] a practical business decision for companies that might otherwise not consider it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. Even large companies with substantial resources often choose Electron because it makes more business sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
*   **User Experience Focus** Ultimately, the primary goal is to deliver an excellent user experience, which is achievable with Electron. Users generally do not care about the underlying technology used to build an application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

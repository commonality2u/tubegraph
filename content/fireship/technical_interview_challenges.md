Technical interviews are often described as a "high-stakes life or death game" for software engineers, where success can lead to a six-figure salary [00:00:14]. Despite the common sentiment that the interview process is "broken," candidates generally have to "play the game" as they cannot control it [00:00:20]. The experience can be a "psychological rollercoaster ride" [00:00:27].

## Psychological Hurdles

One of the primary challenges in a technical interview is managing anxiety and maintaining composure [00:02:08], [00:04:09]. Candidates may overthink simple problems, expecting complex solutions, especially when interviewing for "big scary tech corporations" [00:02:43]. A common experience is to "black out" or freeze when faced with a question, feeling like an "imposter" and believing they "can't do it" [00:01:44]. Ironically, when the anxiety dissipates because one believes they've already failed, problem-solving can become clearer [00:02:07].

If a candidate gets confused and freezes up, it's advised not to "just sit there," but to try to come up with a question instead [00:03:58].

## Technical Difficulties

### [[common_coding_interview_questions | Common Coding Interview Questions]]
Candidates may face [[common_coding_interview_questions | common coding interview questions]] like FizzBuzz [00:01:20]. While seemingly straightforward, panic can set in, leading to difficulty recalling basic concepts like hash maps, linked lists, or binary trees [00:01:44]. It's crucial to break down the problem methodically, perhaps using a flowchart or pseudocode, to avoid worrying about syntax or boilerplate initially [00:02:22].

### Algorithmic Understanding
Interviewers often expect a deep understanding of core programming concepts beyond simple implementation. For instance, relying on "magical type conversion" in a language like JavaScript for divisibility checks may be corrected by the interviewer who might prompt for the use of the modulo operator, which is available across most languages [00:05:00], [00:05:27]. This highlights the need to avoid "language specific magic" and stick to universally understood solutions [00:05:29].

### Performance and Complexity
A significant challenge is describing the performance of an algorithm, specifically using "Big O time complexity" [00:07:09]. Candidates may fail to adequately study Big O notation, leading to vague or incorrect answers [00:07:11]. Even for a fixed number of steps like 100 iterations, understanding whether the complexity is linear (O(n)) or constant (O(1)) is expected [00:07:23].

### Adaptability
Interviewers may introduce new conditions or requirements to test a candidate's adaptability. For example, adding an extra condition like "7 is bass" to a FizzBuzz problem requires a solution that can easily scale without becoming overly complex, potentially by extracting data out of conditional statements [00:06:11], [00:06:23].

## Communication and [[interview_preparation_strategies | Interview Preparation Strategies]]

A key aspect of [[interview_preparation_strategies | interview preparation strategies]] and success is the ability to [[problemsolving_and_coding_practice | think out loud]] and explain decisions throughout the process [00:03:16], [00:03:18]. Even if the answer isn't perfectly correct, it's vital for the interviewer to understand the problem-solving process [00:03:30]. Saying something is generally better than saying nothing at all, unless the statement is "dumb ass" [00:03:36]. [[interview_preparation_strategies | Practicing]] "literally saying everything out loud" while solving problems is recommended [00:03:44]. This "always be chatting" (ABC) rule is crucial [00:03:55].

## External Factors

Beyond a candidate's performance, external factors can lead to an offer being rescinded, such as a company-wide hiring freeze [00:08:08], [00:08:10].

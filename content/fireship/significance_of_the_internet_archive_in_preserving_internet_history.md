The Internet Archive, particularly its [[security_issues_with_the_way_back_machine | Way Back Machine]], stands as one of the most vital websites in the [[history_and_significance_of_the_worldwide_web | history of the internet]] due to its core mission of archiving the internet's evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## What is the Internet Archive?

Since 1996, the Internet Archive has been capturing snapshots of websites, including their HTML, CSS, [[history_of_javascript | JavaScript]], and images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This extensive collection allows users to recall the [[history_and_significance_of_the_worldwide_web | worldwide web]] in its earlier forms, such as how Amazon appeared or the variety of unique personal websites that once existed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

The [[security_issues_with_the_way_back_machine | Way Back Machine]] alone contains over 890 billion archived web pages, accumulating nearly 100 petabytes of data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. This volume is immense; viewing one web page every second for a century would still constitute less than 1% of the total archive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Irreplaceable Data and Critical Role

The data housed within the Internet Archive is practically irreplaceable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. While Google might theoretically be able to replace it, Google itself has ceased using its own cached archive in search results and now directs users to the Internet Archive's [[security_issues_with_the_way_back_machine | Way Back Machine]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. The potential for [[hackers_and_their_motivations_for_targeting_the_internet_archive | hackers]] to gain access to or erase this archived data highlights the critical importance of the archive in preserving the [[history_and_significance_of_the_worldwide_web | history of the worldwide web]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

## Founder and Mission

The Internet Archive was founded in 1996 by Brewster Kahle, a digital librarian and advocate for universal access to knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. Despite its potential to be a multi-billion dollar entity, the Internet Archive operates as a free non-profit service, benefiting the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. The archive complies with GDPR and removes personal data upon request, though some desire the removal of legitimate content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

In addition to web archiving, the Internet Archive also offers [[legal_challenges_faced_by_the_internet_archive_and_open_library | Open Library]], a service co-founded by Kahle and the late Aaron Schwartz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. This service digitizes physical books and allows one digital copy to be lent for each physical copy owned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

## Recent Challenges and Threats

The continued operation and preservation efforts of the Internet Archive are currently under significant threat from multiple angles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

### Data Breach and Legal Battle

In October 2024, a [[impact_of_data_breaches_on_internet_history_archives | data breach]] exposed 31 million email addresses and password hashes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Simultaneously, its [[legal_challenges_faced_by_the_internet_archive_and_open_library | Open Library]] service lost a critical legal battle against publishers claiming copyright infringement, a lawsuit that could result in over $600 million in damages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

The timeline of the recent security incidents includes:
*   **September 30th:** Have I Been Pwned (HIBP) was informed of the Internet Archive's [[impact_of_data_breaches_on_internet_history_archives | data breach]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
*   **October 5th:** The breach was confirmed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
*   **October 6th:** The Internet Archive was notified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
*   **October 8th:** Brewster Kahle posted about a DDoS attack, noting that the Internet Archive had been facing aggressive DDoS attacks since May <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
*   **October 9th:** The website was defaced with [[history_of_javascript | JavaScript]] graffiti, triggering an alert message about the undisclosed [[impact_of_data_breaches_on_internet_history_archives | data breach]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
*   **October 10th:** The website remained under attack and offline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

### Hacker Motivations

An activist group named Black Meta claimed responsibility for the attacks, stating they would continue until all their systems were down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. The group, which possibly consists of teenagers despite their claims, presented a political message concerning the situation in the Middle East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. However, the effectiveness of targeting the Internet Archive for such a cause is questionable, leading to speculation that it might be a false flag operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

Yesterday, on August 6, 2024, Big Tech experienced a significant shift as [[Google antitrust lawsuit and monopoly conviction | Google]] lost a crucial legal battle against the US Department of Justice (DOJ) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This lawsuit, initiated in 2020, alleged that Google violated US antitrust law and engaged in monopolistic practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The government characterized Google as a "filthy monopolist" that utilized illegal tactics to suppress competition and stifle innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. The judge sided with the feds, finding Google guilty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

Like historical monopolies such as Standard Oil and the American Tobacco Company, Google is now officially recognized as an illegal monopoly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This verdict has broader [[implications_for_big_tech_companies_under_antitrust_scrutiny | implications for big tech companies under antitrust scrutiny]], as Apple, Amazon, and Meta are also currently involved in active antitrust cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## The Sherman Act: A Foundation for Antitrust
The legal framework for antitrust in the United States dates back to 1890, with the passing of the Sherman Act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. This law was initially designed to target the dominant industries of its time, including Big Oil, Big Tobacco, and Big Railroad, aiming to prevent anti-competitive activities that made it impossible for new competitors to enter the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>.

Google's recent conviction centered on its violation of Section Two of the Sherman Act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. This section has two primary provisions:
*   The possession of monopoly power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>.
*   The willful acquisition or maintenance of that power through means other than offering a superior product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.

In essence, to break this law, a company must both dominate its market and achieve or maintain that dominance through tactics other than simply building a better product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>. While Google controls 88% of the domestic search market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a> and is widely regarded as having a superior product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>, it faced legal trouble due to its [[googles_exclusivity_deals_and_their_legal_consequences | exclusivity deals]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>. These deals include requiring Google Search to be the default on Android devices, agreements with the Mozilla Firefox browser, and a substantial deal with Apple, paying them $20 billion annually for 36% of search revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>. The judge determined these deals were anti-competitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>.

## Modern Antitrust Enforcement Against Tech Giants
The application of antitrust laws extends beyond Google, reflecting a broader trend of scrutiny against major technology companies:

*   **Microsoft (2001)**: [[implications_for_big_tech_companies_under_antitrust_scrutiny | Microsoft]] was accused of being a monopoly in 2001 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>.
*   **Apple**: The US Department of Justice is suing Apple for maintaining a monopoly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>. Apple has also faced issues with the EU, which required it to open its payment services to competitors like Epic Games, leading to Fortnite's return to the App Store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>.
*   **Meta**: Meta is facing a lawsuit for monopolizing the social media space through anti-competitive acquisitions like Instagram and WhatsApp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>.
*   **Amazon**: Amazon is also engaged in a monopoly battle, accused of leveraging its position to disadvantage sellers through anti-discounting measures and contracts that favor its own products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>.

These ongoing cases highlight that becoming a trillion-dollar tech company often involves aggressive, cutthroat strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>, leading to a common outcome where companies either go bankrupt or "live long enough to become an illegal Monopoly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>.

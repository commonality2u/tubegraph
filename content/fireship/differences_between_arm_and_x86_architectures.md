The landscape of [[computer_architecture_and_components | computing technology]] is currently characterized by a global [[competition_in_the_arm_chip_industry | race to build the best ARM-based chip and dominate the world]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. This competition involves major players such as Apple, Samsung, Google, Microsoft, and Intel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## x86 Architecture

Historically, personal computers, including those running Windows or Mac OS, have relied on CPUs that utilize the x86 architecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. These chips are predominantly manufactured by Intel or AMD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

Key characteristics of x86:
*   **Instruction Set**: x86 is based on the Complex Instruction Set (CISC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
*   **Versatility**: It is designed to be extremely versatile and fast for a wide variety of computing needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
*   **Longevity**: The x86 architecture has been in use for over 45 years and is deeply embedded in modern infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

## ARM Architecture

When smartphones emerged, they adopted ARM processors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. The company behind the ARM architecture designs the architecture and licenses it to other companies for manufacturing, rather than producing chips itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. Taiwan Semiconductor, for instance, produces Apple's M chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

Key characteristics of ARM:
*   **Instruction Set**: ARM is based on the Reduced Instruction Set (RISC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
*   **Power Efficiency**: It requires fewer transistors per instruction, which makes it more power-efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. This efficiency is critical for battery-powered devices like smartphones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

## The Shift Towards ARM in Personal Computing and Data Centers

Historically, there was an assumption that ARM was not optimal for regular computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. This perception changed significantly in 2020 when Apple released the [[apple_silicon_m1_vs_intel_i9 | M1 chip]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. Apple's M1-powered laptops were noted for being faster, quieter, and having improved thermal performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

This success motivated other tech giants:
*   **Microsoft**: Launched "Project Voltera" to enable Windows to run on ARM chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
*   **Data Centers**: Companies like AWS realized that ARM chips are more efficient in the cloud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. Consequently, Amazon (AWS Graviton), Google (Google Axion), and Microsoft are now developing their own ARM chips for their data centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

## Current Competitive Landscape

The current [[competition_in_the_arm_chip_industry | arms race]] is intense, with a strong focus on [[ai_capabilities_in_modern_chips | AI capabilities in modern chips]].

*   **Apple M4**: Unveiled in May 2024, the M4 chip is described as a "Marvel of computing technology" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. It boasts a CPU 50% faster than the M2, includes built-in Ray tracing, and its neural engine can perform 38 trillion operations per second, making it the fastest chip for AI workloads on the PC market currently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Apple's strategy appears to be running large language models (LLMs) on-device for offline functionality, low latency, and privacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
*   **Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite**: Expected to be released shortly after the M4's announcement, this chip aims to outperform the M4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. It is slated to power Windows on Surface laptops and claims to achieve 45 trillion operations per second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
*   **Motivation for AI Performance**: Companies are fiercely competing on these benchmarks because the device capable of running the best AI model natively is expected to be a major purchasing driver in the near future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

## The Future of x86

Despite the significant advancements and adoption of ARM, x86 is not considered a "dead technology" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. It is deeply embedded in modern infrastructure and is likely to persist for a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

Recent developments in x86:
*   **Intel Arrow Lake**: Leaked documents suggest Intel's new Arrow Lake processor is being built from the ground up to consume less power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. It could potentially handle over 100 trillion operations per second, indicating a strong focus on [[ai_capabilities_in_modern_chips | AI capabilities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
*   **AMD Ryzen AI 9**: AMD is also releasing new processors like the Ryzen AI 9, emphasizing AI in their branding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

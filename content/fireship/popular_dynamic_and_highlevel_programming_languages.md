The "extremely popular dynamic high-level languages" represent a tier of programming languages that are often the starting point for many beginners due to their accessibility and broad utility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>. Learning one of these languages can enable a developer to build almost anything imaginable and potentially have an entire career as a software engineer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>.

## Python
Python is a primary language for many beginners today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>. Its appeal stems from its minimal syntax, which eliminates the need for curly braces or semicolons, instead using indentation to define code blocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>.

## JavaScript
[[JavaScript highlevel features | JavaScript]] is another highly popular high-level language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>. Although its syntax can be considered "ugly," it is a fundamental requirement for [[Building web apps with various programming languages | web development]], and most developers will interact with it at some point in their careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>. It is humorously noted that "any application that can be written in javascript will eventually be written in javascript" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>.

## Other Dynamic Languages
Beyond Python, numerous other dynamic languages exist that are better suited for specific projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>. A common characteristic shared by these languages is their [[Static type systems and productionlevel programming languages | dynamic type system]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>.

Some examples include:
*   **PHP** – Facilitated the development of server-side web applications in the 1990s and remains very popular today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>.
*   **Lua** – Noted for being easier and faster than Python, it is often embedded in engines such as Roblox and World of Warcraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>.
*   **Ruby** – An easy-to-learn object-oriented language frequently used for [[Building web apps with various programming languages | web app development]] with the Rails framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>.
*   **R** – Primarily used in data science for statistics and data visualization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>.
*   **Julia** – A more modern option also used for scientific computing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>.

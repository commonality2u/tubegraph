[[introduction_to_lua_programming | Lua]] is a fast, multi-paradigm [[scripting_and_utility_programming_languages | scripting language]] renowned for being underrated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It was named after the moon and designed in Brazil in 1993 by a team of computer scientists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Key Characteristics and Advantages

### Ease of Learning
[[introduction_to_lua_programming | Lua]] is considered easier to learn than Python <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. Its simplicity stems from having only 21 reserved words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

### Performance
[[introduction_to_lua_programming | Lua]] is lightweight and extremely fast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This is partly because its virtual machine maps closely to [[applications_and_usage_of_c | C]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. When combined with its Just-in-Time (JIT) compiler, it's widely regarded as the fastest [[scripting_and_utility_programming_languages | scripting language]] in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. It is also more portable than Python <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

### Flexible Data Structures
[[introduction_to_lua_programming | Lua]] features only one data structuring mechanism: the [[lua_tables_and_data_structures | table]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. A [[lua_tables_and_data_structures | table]] can represent various structures such as arrays, dictionaries, graphs, and trees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

### Collaborative Multitasking
[[introduction_to_lua_programming | Lua]] supports collaborative multitasking through co-routines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. While the language is single-threaded, co-routines allow functions to be paused and resumed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

### C API
[[introduction_to_lua_programming | Lua]] has a simple [[applications_and_usage_of_c | C]] API, enabling [[applications_and_usage_of_c | Lua]] code to run within a [[applications_and_usage_of_c | C]] program or vice versa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

## Applications and Usage
[[introduction_to_lua_programming | Lua]]'s speed and lightweight nature make it ideal for embedding into other applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

*   **Game Development**: It's famously used in games like World of Warcraft and Roblox, where users can write [[introduction_to_lua_programming | Lua]] to build their own games and features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.
*   **General Scripting**: As a [[scripting_and_utility_programming_languages | scripting language]], it can be used for various utility and automation tasks.

### Variables
Variables are declared by providing a name and a value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. By default, variables are global, but they can be made local using the `local` keyword <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. As a dynamic language, [[introduction_to_lua_programming | Lua]] does not require type annotations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. The `print` function outputs values to standard output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

### Functions
[[introduction_to_lua_programming | Lua]] does not have classes, but functionality can be achieved using functions and [[lua_tables_and_data_structures | tables]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. Functions are declared with the `function` keyword and closed with the `end` keyword <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Functions are first-class objects, meaning they can be passed to other functions to support functional programming patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

### [[lua_tables_and_data_structures | Tables]]
[[lua_tables_and_data_structures | Tables]] are created with braces `{}` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. They are associative arrays, allowing indices to be replaced with different values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. By default, [[lua_tables_and_data_structures | tables]] use integer values, and array indexing starts at `1` instead of `0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Dictionaries can be easily created by assigning string values as keys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. The `for` loop can iterate over every key-value pair in a [[lua_tables_and_data_structures | table]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

### Coroutines
Coroutines are used to pause and resume function execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. A co-routine can be suspended using `yield` and resumed elsewhere in the code with `coroutine.resume` until a `return` statement is reached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

## Ecosystem
Although [[introduction_to_lua_programming | Lua]]'s standard library is minimal, it boasts a large ecosystem of packages accessible via the Luarocks package manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Execution
To execute [[introduction_to_lua_programming | Lua]] code, save a file with a `.lua` extension and run it using the [[introduction_to_lua_programming | Lua]] interpreter in the terminal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

A controversial opinion among developers suggests that "programmers who don't code in their spare time for fun will never become as good as those that do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:59">[02:36:59]</a>. This idea stems from the belief that if an individual isn't passionate enough about coding to engage with it in their free time, they will never reach their full potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:40">[02:41:40]</a>.

## Counter-Argument and Nuance

The speaker, despite personally writing code in their free time, disagrees with this opinion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:79">[02:47:79]</a>. Many people view programming as a job, and there is nothing inherently wrong with that approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:79">[02:52:79]</a>.

Instead, some highly talented programmers can accomplish tasks with a fraction of the effort others might require <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:49">[02:57:49]</a>. The concept of [[Programmer ego and competitiveness | 10x developers]] is considered real, and their superior performance is attributed to inherent differences rather than solely to [[effectiveness_of_programming_in_spare_time | programming in their free time]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:99">[03:01:99]</a>. An analogy is made to Allen Iverson, who, in his prime, excelled without needing to practice as much as others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:99">[03:07:99]</a>.

Beyond merely writing code, being a programmer also involves crucial soft skills such as communication, being a good team player, vision, and creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:19">[03:17:19]</a>.

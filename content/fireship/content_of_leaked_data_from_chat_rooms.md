A recent [[data_breach_at_andrew_tates_hustlers_university | data breach]] targeting "The Real World," formerly known as [[data_breach_at_andrew_tates_hustlers_university | Andrew Tates Hustler's University]], exposed a significant amount of data, including the contents of public and private chat rooms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. The hackers described the website as [[website_security_vulnerabilities | hilariously insecure]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Scope of the Data Leak

The [[security_vulnerabilities_and_exploits | non-consensual penetration]] exposed 14 GB of data, including valuable course content and the usernames and emails of over 700,000 members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. The hack revealed 795,000 usernames and email addresses in total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. This data, including chat room content, was published on `dss.com`, a nonprofit that analyzes hack data sets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. Members of the Hustler's University alumni can check if their data was compromised on `haveibeenpwned.com` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

## Topics Discussed in Chat Rooms

Beyond user data, the leak included actual content from both public and private chat rooms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. Discussions covered a wide range of topics, such as:
*   AI automation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>
*   Content creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>
*   Health and fitness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>
*   Crypto, including Andrew Tate's "daddy" shitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>

Some of the messages were deemed "too crazy" to be shared publicly on platforms like YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. However, there were also discussions related to the platform's tech stack, such as a developer using ChatGPT to build the "Tate terminal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

## Tech Stack and Alleged Software Theft

Research into the platform's tech stack, possibly discussed within the leaked chat content or reverse-engineered by the speaker, revealed several components:
*   Frontend: TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, WebSockets, REST, Next.js (for signup page), Vite, ReactJS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>
*   Mobile Wrapper: Capacitor for iOS and Android <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>
*   Backend: Likely uses Cloudflare for server, and a 404 page indicates "rocket" in the text, suggesting the Rust Rocket framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

The use of Rust Rocket suggests a connection to Revolt chat, an open-source chat platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. Notably, in 2022, the developer of Revolt accused Tate of stealing their software by violating its AGPL license, as Hustler's University allegedly used a closed-source fork of Revolt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. The frontend JavaScript bundle was not obfuscated and included code comments, making it easier for the [[security_vulnerabilities_and_exploits | hackers were able to break authentication]] on the API <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

## Hackers' Post-Breach Actions in Chat Rooms

After gaining access, the attackers made their presence known by flooding the University's primary chat room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. They posted various emojis and images, including:
*   The [[incident_involving_lgbt_hackers | transgender flag]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>
*   A feminist fist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>
*   Images of Andrew Tate himself wearing a rainbow flag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>

This incident occurred while Tate was live streaming on Rumble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

The choice of operating system is a significant decision for programmers, as it will be used for tens of thousands of hours and has a profound impact on one's subconscious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While embracing a Mac can feel like joining the "cult of Apple" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>, it remains a popular choice among developers. The author, having used Mac, Windows, and Linux for over a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>, notes that there is no perfect OS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. A MacBook Pro is kept available for traveling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

## Advantages of Mac OS for Developers

*   **Superior Hardware**
    Apple is noted for making the best hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
*   **Unix-Based System**
    macOS is Unix-based <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. Unix, which has existed since the 1970s, features a well-designed file system that uses forward slashes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.
*   **Out-of-the-Box Developer Tools**
    Mac comes with many useful developer tools pre-installed, including Zell, Git, and Vim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.
*   **Package Management**
    Developers can easily install and manage various [[Software Engineering and Development Tools | development tools]] using package managers like Homebrew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
*   **Excellent Terminal Experience**
    The terminal experience on a Mac is considered good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.
*   **Functional GUI**
    Graphical User Interface (GUI) tools on Mac look appealing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
*   **Minimal Configuration**
    A significant advantage is that "everything works out of the box with zero configuration" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. macOS helps prevent users from getting sidetracked by "customization rabbit holes," allowing them to focus on writing useful code instead of spending days configuring their machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

## Disadvantages of Mac OS for Developers

*   **High Cost**
    Obtaining Apple hardware requires a "large tribute," with an example given of paying $1,000 just for a stand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.
*   **Limited Upgradeability**
    Mac machines have severe limitations on upgrades; users cannot easily add more RAM, storage, or GPUs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. This contrasts with [[Windows as an operating system for programmers | Windows]] where hardware can be easily upgraded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.
*   **Ecosystem Lock-in**
    The Apple ecosystem is designed to lock users in. Developing applications for iOS or the Apple Vision Pro almost certainly necessitates owning a Mac <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
*   **Repair Difficulty**
    Hardware components in Macs are often glued or soldered into place, making self-repair impossible and requiring visits to the Apple Store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. Although there's controversy around the "right to repair," by the time a MacBook breaks, many users prefer to buy a new device due to technological advancements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
*   **GUI Annoyances**
    While the GUI tools look nice, they can be "pretty annoying to use," with "Finder" specifically mentioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
*   **Durability Concerns**
    The author's own MacBook Pro stopped working "right on schedule" exactly two years after purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

## Conclusion and Recommendations

The article humorously provides a flowchart for choosing an OS:
*   If you are rich, Mac OS is the answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.
*   The author notes that while there's no perfect OS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>, a MacBook Pro is still used for travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>, suggesting a pragmatic approach to [[choosing_the_best_operating_system_for_personal_needs | OS selection]].

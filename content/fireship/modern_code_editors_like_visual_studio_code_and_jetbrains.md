In the 2020s, computer programmers rely heavily on modern code editors to create and manage their code [00:00:15](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. While earlier editors like vi, vim, and Emacs introduced groundbreaking features such as undo, find and replace, and copy and paste [00:00:37](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>, contemporary options offer enhanced capabilities and user experiences.

## Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

Visual Studio Code is widely regarded as the most popular lightweight editor [00:00:43](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. It features a graphical user interface (GUI), making it very approachable for beginners [00:06:47](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. VS Code also includes numerous built-in shortcuts that enable quick actions, similar to text-based editors [00:06:51](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

A significant advantage of VS Code is its large [[VS_Code_Extensions_for_Productivity | extension ecosystem]] [00:07:13](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. This means that if a developer is using a particular tool or framework, such as Tailwind, there is almost certainly a VS Code extension available to support it, which might not be the case with other editors [00:07:15](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

The application itself is open-source and built with Electron, utilizing web technologies, which makes it easy for web developers to extend its functionality [00:07:26](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. Although it has a reputation for being a memory hog [00:07:32](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>, its editing experience can be very minimal if desired, even offering a "zen mode" for focused coding [00:07:35](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>).

However, VS Code can also function as a full-blown [[comparison_of_text_editors_and_ides | integrated development environment]] [00:07:40](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. It supports:
*   Editing files remotely on GitHub [00:07:42](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>
*   Connecting to cloud resources [00:07:43](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>
*   Working with Docker containers [00:07:45](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>

Despite its versatility, VS Code may not always be the optimal choice for platform-specific development, where dedicated IDEs like Apple's Xcode for iOS or Google's Android Studio for Android are preferred [00:07:48](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

## JetBrains

JetBrains offers a family of editors and [[comparison_of_text_editors_and_ides | IDEs]] widely considered the gold standard for professional-level coding [00:08:38](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. While IntelliJ is well-known for Java development, WebStorm is a popular choice for web development [00:08:44](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

JetBrains products come at an annual cost, approximately $69 per year [00:08:53](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. Upon opening WebStorm, it immediately feels more like a true [[comparison_of_text_editors_and_ides | IDE]] compared to a minimal text editor [00:08:58](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. It includes a project setup wizard, though some of its options, like Meteor, Cordova, and AngularJS version 1 (which was retired), feel outdated [00:09:02](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

A key benefit of JetBrains IDEs is that they typically provide everything needed to start a project, reducing the need to install numerous plugins [00:09:20](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. WebStorm excels in code refactoring, for example, allowing users to easily extract a UI element in a React application into its own named component [00:09:27](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. While similar functionality can be achieved in VS Code with extensions, it often feels more reliable and polished in WebStorm, which is expected from a paid product [00:09:34](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

JetBrains is also developing a new editor called Fleet, intended to be a competitor to VS Code [00:09:44](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

## Future Trends

The landscape of code editors is evolving, with a move towards [[future_trends_in_cloudbased_code_editing | entirely cloud-based solutions]] [00:10:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. Examples include:
*   Running VS Code directly in a browser via vscode.dev [00:10:03](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>
*   GitHub Codespaces, allowing code editing on powerful cloud hardware [00:10:08](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>
*   Tools like StackBlitz, which utilize WebAssembly to run full-stack web applications in the browser [00:10:12](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>

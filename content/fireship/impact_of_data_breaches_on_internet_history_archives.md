The [[security_issues_with_the_way_back_machine | Internet Archive]], specifically its [[security_issues_with_the_way_back_machine | Way Back Machine]], which is one of the most important websites in the [[history_and_significance_of_the_worldwide_web | history of the internet]], has recently faced significant security challenges and data breaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. As of October 10th, 2024, the website is currently offline due to ongoing attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## Significance of the Internet Archive

The [[significance_of_the_internet_archive_in_preserving_internet_history | Internet Archive]] has been capturing snapshots of websites since 1996, including their HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This allows users to view the [[history_and_significance_of_the_worldwide_web | worldwide web]] as it appeared in the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

The [[security_issues_with_the_way_back_machine | Way Back Machine]] holds over 890 billion archived web pages, accumulating nearly 100 petabytes of data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. This immense amount of data is considered practically irreplaceable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Even Google, which once had its own cached archive, now redirects users to the [[security_issues_with_the_way_back_machine | Internet Archive]]'s Way Back Machine for cached search results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. The potential threat of hackers accessing and erasing this archived data could mean the loss of the [[history_and_significance_of_the_worldwide_web | history of the worldwide web]] itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

### Mission and Purpose

The [[security_issues_with_the_way_back_machine | Internet Archive]] was founded in 1996 by Brewster Kahle, a digital librarian and advocate for universal access to all knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. Despite its potential to be a multi-billion dollar company, it operates as a free, non-profit service benefiting the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

The archive adheres to GDPR regulations and will remove personal data upon request <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. However, some individuals desire legitimate content to be permanently removed from the archive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

### Open Library and Legal Challenges

The [[security_issues_with_the_way_back_machine | Internet Archive]] also offers Open Library, co-founded by Brewster Kahle and Aaron Schwartz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. This service digitizes physical books, allowing one digital copy to be lent out for each physical copy owned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. Recently, Open Library faced a [[legal_challenges_faced_by_the_internet_archive_and_open_library | legal battle]] with several publishers over copyright infringement, which the publishers won <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. This lawsuit could result in over $600 million in damages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

## Recent Security Incidents

The [[security_issues_with_the_way_back_machine | Internet Archive]] has been "pwned, boned, and owned from multiple angles" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

The timeline of recent security breaches is as follows:

*   **September 30th**: Have I Been Pwned (HIBP) was informed of the [[security_issues_with_the_way_back_machine | Internet Archive]]'s data breach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
*   **October 5th**: The data breach was confirmed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
*   **October 6th**: The [[security_issues_with_the_way_back_machine | Internet Archive]] was officially notified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
*   **October 8th**: Brewster Kahle posted about a DDoS attack, which had been aggressive and ongoing since May <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
*   **October 9th**: The website was defaced with JavaScript graffiti, triggering an alert message about the data breach before it was officially disclosed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
*   **October 10th**: The website remained under attack and completely offline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

Specific impacts include:
*   A data breach exposed 31 million email addresses and password hashes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
*   The website was defaced with JavaScript <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
*   It has been subjected to non-stop Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Responsible Parties and Motivations

An activist group named Black Meta has claimed responsibility for the attacks, stating they will continue until all "sister" sites are completely down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. They posted a video that appears to be a political message about the situation in the Middle East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>, though the motive for targeting the [[security_issues_with_the_way_back_machine | Internet Archive]] in relation to this political message is unclear and could indicate a false flag operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

[[PHPs role in web development | PHP]] is a dynamic, interpreted scripting language used for building interactive websites on the server <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Despite some negative perceptions, it remains one of the most [[popular_programming_languages_for_web_development | popular languages]] for back-end web development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Widespread Adoption
[[PHPs role in web development | PHP]] powers major platforms and websites, including:
*   Content Management Systems like WordPress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.
*   Top-tier websites such as Wikipedia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.
*   Numerous other sites through frameworks like Laravel (LVL) and Symfony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.
*   Facebook, which uses [[PHPs role in web development | PHP]] but developed a custom compiler to convert it to machine code on their servers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

Statistically, there is a 78.5% chance that a client's website is running on [[PHPs role in web development | PHP]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

## Historical Significance and Evolution
[[History and origin of PHP | PHP]] was created in 1994 by Rasmus Lerdorf to manage his personal homepage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. The original acronym "Personal Homepage" is now reinterpreted to "Hypertext Preprocessor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

[[History and origin of PHP | PHP]] holds a special place in history as it predates [[state_of_javascript_in_modern_development | JavaScript]] and was one of the first languages to be embedded directly in HTML <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. This capability allowed websites to be built dynamically on a server <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. As an open-source technology, it revolutionized the web by making application development accessible to the average person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. Its interpreter is implemented in C, and its syntax was inspired by Perl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## Core Features and Modern PHP
To get started with [[basic_php_syntax_and_usage | PHP]], developers create a [[basic_php_syntax_and_usage | PHP file]] with basic HTML and embed [[basic_php_syntax_and_usage | PHP]] code within `<?php ?>` tags <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. Code within these tags is rendered on the server <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

Key features include:
*   **Output**: Using `[[basic_php_syntax_and_usage | Echo]]` to output values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
*   **Variables**: Declared with a dollar sign prefix, e.g., `$name` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   **Weakly Typed**: No type annotations are necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   **Predefined Variables**: A large number of built-in variables geared towards web development, such as `$_GET`, `$_POST`, and `$_COOKIE`, contain information about the incoming HTTP request <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
*   **[[phps_programming_paradigms_and_features | Programming Paradigms]]**:
    *   Supports first-class functions, which can be assigned to [[basic_php_syntax_and_usage | variables]] or used anonymously as arguments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
    *   Includes a vast number of built-in functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
    *   Features a complete object model, allowing the definition of classes with inheritance for implementing object-oriented patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

### PHP Version 8
The language is currently on [[PHPs programming paradigms and features | PHP]] version 8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. This version incorporates all the features expected from a modern, pragmatic language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. Every web developer should be familiar with it due to its significant presence in the web development landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

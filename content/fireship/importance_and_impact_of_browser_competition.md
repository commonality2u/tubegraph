The worldwide web is considered the most critical pillar of human civilization today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. John Perry Barlow, in his Declaration of Independence of Cyberspace, called it "cyberspace the new home of the Mind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. He envisioned a world where individuals could express beliefs without fear of coercion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This freedom has led to significant societal and economic impacts, including the downfall of governments and the creation of millions of millionaires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. However, there is an existential threat to this openness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Current State of Browser Dominance

Access to cyberspace is primarily through web browsers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. Currently, [[Browser market share and dominance | Chrome]], Safari, Edge, and Firefox collectively account for over 90% of the market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. A significant concern is that all these dominant browsers share technology or funding controlled by Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This creates a hypothetical scenario where a single entity could exert immense control over internet content and access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. It is asserted that "he who controls the browser controls the Internet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>, highlighting the ongoing "browser wars" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## The Need for Competition

The concentration of power in a few browser engines poses a risk to internet freedom and openness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. The consolidation of power on the internet is perceived as worsening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. Competition in the browser market is essential to prevent a single entity from dominating the online experience and potentially suppressing content or innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Emerging Challengers

Despite the dominance of established browsers, there are ongoing efforts to introduce new competitors:

*   Firefox has recently launched new features like tabs managed in the sidebar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.
*   The Arc browser is gaining popularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.
*   Two new [[Development of open source web browsers | open source]] browsers built in Rust, Verso (using the Servo engine) and Blitz (a minimal web renderer), are currently trending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

### Ladybird Browser

A particularly ambitious [[Development of open source web browsers | open source]] browser project is Ladybird <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. Its origins trace back to October 2018, when Andreas Kling, a former WebKit engineer at Apple and Nokia, began building his own operating system, SerenityOS, from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. This project required building every component, including a web browser, from the ground up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

On July 4, 2022, the SerenityOS browser engine became an independent, cross-platform project and was renamed Ladybird <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. Two years later, with over a thousand contributors and half a million lines of C++ code, Andreas Kling and a GitHub co-founder formed a nonprofit to manage the browser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. This nonprofit structure aims to avoid negative incentives, relying solely on sponsorships and donations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. Ladybird's code is entirely free and does not borrow from other browsers, contrasting with privacy-focused browsers like Brave, which are for-profit and built on Google's Chromium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

Ladybird has built its own HTML and JavaScript engines, creatively named libHTML and libJS, and leverages established tools like FFMpeg for videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. The first alpha version for Linux and macOS is anticipated by summer 2026, with a Windows version expected later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. The code is available on GitHub for those wishing to explore and build it from source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

## [[Challenges in creating a new web browser | Challenges in Creating a New Web Browser]]

Building a web browser from scratch is incredibly complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. The general consensus is that it's nearly impossible to achieve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. Browser engines must adhere to the W3C specification, a document containing over 4 million words that constantly evolves with new features, raising the barrier to entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. It's a massive undertaking that cannot be completed quickly or easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

Regardless of the market share Ladybird or other new browsers achieve, their efforts benefit everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. Their pursuit of an independent browser contributes to preventing the consolidation of power on the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

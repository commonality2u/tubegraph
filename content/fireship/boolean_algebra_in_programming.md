Boolean algebra is a fundamental mathematical concept utilized almost every time code is written <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. It is one of the essential math concepts for programmers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## What is a Boolean?

A Boolean is defined as a binary variable that can hold one of two possible values: `true` or `false` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Boolean Operators

There are three primary operators used to work with Boolean variables:

*   **AND** (Conjunction) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>
    *   This operator evaluates to `true` only if all conditions linked by it are `true` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
*   **OR** (Disjunction) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>
    *   This operator evaluates to `true` if at least one of the conditions linked by it is `true` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
*   **NOT** (Negation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>
    *   This operator reverses the Boolean value of a condition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

## Application in Code

Boolean logic is commonly represented in programming through constructs like `if statements` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## Visual and Tabular Representations

Boolean logic can be understood and visualized using:

*   **Venn diagrams**: These visual tools, familiar since grade school, help illustrate the relationships between sets based on Boolean operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   **Truth tables**: These tables systematically list all possible input combinations for Boolean variables and their corresponding output values based on specific operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

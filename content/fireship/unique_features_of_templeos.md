[[templeos_overview | TempleOS]] is an open-source, 64-bit operating system created in 2005 by Terry Davis, an exceptionally talented programmer diagnosed with schizophrenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It was designed to be the "third temple prophesized by the Bible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>, with Davis believing he was "God's chosen programmer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Core Technical Aspects

*   **Self-Contained Development**
    The entire operating system was written solely by Terry Davis at his parents' house in Las Vegas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. This includes the bootloader, kernel, window manager, 3D graphics library, and multiple games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. It is powered by his own compiler and a custom programming language called [[key_features_of_c | Holy C]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

*   **Compact Size**
    Remarkably, [[templeos_overview | TempleOS]] fits in under 100,000 lines of code and measures only 1.4 megabytes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

*   **Graphics and Display**
    The system renders graphics at a fixed 640x480 resolution, limited to just 16 colors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

*   **[[key_features_of_c | Holy C]] Programming Language**
    The underlying language, [[key_features_of_c | Holy C]], resembles C or C++ but incorporates unique features:
    *   Functions can be invoked without parentheses or arguments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
    *   It uses Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation, allowing it to double as a shell language that can be executed directly from the terminal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

*   **Ring Zero Only Architecture**
    Unlike other operating systems such as [[linux_system_architecture_and_components | Linux]] or Windows, [[templeos_overview | TempleOS]] is "ring zero only" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. This means that everything, including user programs, happens directly in the kernel, granting complete control over the operating system source code and hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

*   **Immortal Task Management**
    On startup, [[templeos_overview | TempleOS]] creates a single immortal task named "Adam," which is the father of every other task, inspired by the Book of Genesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. It can also utilize multiple CPU cores, with each core receiving its own "immortal set task" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

*   **Red Sea File System**
    The Red Sea File System allows every line of code to be directly accessible to the user, facilitating easy modification and exploration of the source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

## User Experience and Thematic Features

*   **Divine Interaction Features**
    Terry Davis implemented features described as a "modern day way of speaking in tongues" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
    *   Hitting F7 generates a "pseudo-random word from God" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
    *   Shift F6 performs a "God doodle," where God draws a picture for the user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

*   **Rich Built-in Applications**
    The personal menu (accessed via Ctrl M) offers a wide array of applications, including:
    *   3D first-person shooters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
    *   2D strategy games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
    *   Simulations like "After Egypt," where the user plays the role of Moses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.
    *   Utilities for managing finances and making music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

*   **Direct Code Modification**
    Users are encouraged to open the source code, make modifications in [[key_features_of_c | Holy C]], and then reboot the system to see their changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

[[templeos_overview | TempleOS]] stands as one of the most complex pieces of software ever written by a solo developer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Its creator, Terry Davis, passed away in 2018 at the age of 48, remembered as both a highly controversial internet personality and a genius programmer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

This article explores programming languages primarily used for scripting, automation, and specific utility tasks, ranging from system interaction to web content definition and data manipulation.

## Core Scripting and General Utilities

Many popular high-level languages are frequently used for scripting and general utility purposes due to their ease of use and broad applicability.

### Python

[[choosing_the_right_programming_language | Python]] is widely adopted by beginners due to its minimal syntax, which avoids curly braces and semicolons, instead using indentation for code blocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:03">[01:44:03]</a>. It's a versatile language capable of building a wide array of applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.

### JavaScript

[[popular_programming_languages_for_web_development | JavaScript]] is a requirement for web development, and nearly every developer will interact with it at some point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>. It's suggested that any application that *can* be written in JavaScript *will* eventually be written in it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>.

## System Interaction and Automation

For interacting with computers programmatically and automating repetitive tasks, specific scripting languages are essential.

### Bash and PowerShell

[[basic_bash_commands_and_scripts | Bash]] and PowerShell are scripting languages that enable users to interact with their computer from the terminal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>. Instead of repeatedly typing commands, users can write scripts to make tasks reproducible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>.

## Web Content and Data Management

Certain languages are specialized for defining web content and managing databases.

### HTML and CSS

When combined, HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) arguably form a Turing-complete programming language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>. They are not used for "programming in the traditional sense" but rather to define the structure and style of websites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>.

### SQL

Structured Query Language (SQL), pronounced "sequel" or "squeal," is the most common language for working with databases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. It is Turing-complete but primarily used to read and write data in relational databases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.

## Other Dynamic and Specialized Languages

Beyond the most common options, several other dynamic languages are better suited for specific projects or domains.

### PHP

PHP made it easy to build server-side web applications in the 1990s and remains very popular today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>.

### Lua

Lua is considered easier and faster than Python and is embedded in various engines, such as Roblox and World of Warcraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>.

### Ruby

Ruby is an easy-to-learn object-oriented language frequently used for building web applications with the Rails framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>.

### R and Julia

For data science, R is used for statistics and data visualization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>. Julia is a more modern alternative also applied in scientific computing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>. All these languages share a dynamic type system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>.

### Hack

Developed by Facebook, Hack is designed to interoperate with PHP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:26:00">[09:26:00]</a>. It was created to provide better performance and a type system, enabling the scaling of their website which was originally built with PHP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:31:00">[09:31:00]</a>.

### Holy C

Holy C, created by Terry A. Davis for his TempleOS operating system, functions like [[c_influences_on_other_programming_languages | C]] but is just-in-time compiled on the OS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:22:00">[14:22:00]</a>. This allows it to be used like a scripting language that can interact directly with the operating system kernel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:33:00">[14:33:00]</a>.

## Esoteric Languages

[[minimal_esoteric_programming_languages | Esoteric programming languages]] are often created as conceptual art or for amusement rather than practical engineering, yet they can be seen as tools for exploring the boundaries of computation and language design.

*   **Intercal (1972)**: The first known esoteric language, designed as a parody of languages like Algol and Fortran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:59:00">[11:59:00]</a>. It features paradoxical documentation and keywords like "please" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:10:00">[12:10:00]</a>.
*   **Brainfuck**: Known for its extreme minimalism, it uses only eight characters to manipulate memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:20:00">[12:20:00]</a>.
*   **Malbolge**: Inspired by Brainfuck, it is intentionally designed to be exceedingly difficult to program in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:35:00">[12:35:00]</a>.
*   **Chef**: A stack-based language where code resembles a cooking recipe, using sentences like "put ingredient into mixing bowl" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:51:00">[12:51:00]</a>.
*   **Shakespeare Programming Language**: Makes code appear as a Shakespearean play, combining low-level control with verbose 16th-century poetry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:11:00">[13:11:00]</a>.
*   **Piet**: Named after Piet Mondrian, this stack-based language uses patterns of 20 different colors on a bitmap image for its code, resulting in abstract art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:22:00">[13:22:00]</a>.
*   **LOLCODE**: Provides a developer experience similar to an "llcap meme," with syntax like "hi" to open a program and "k thanks bye" to end it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:35:00">[13:35:00]</a>.
*   **Emoji Code**: A fully-featured object-oriented language where syntax is entirely based on emojis, using symbols like grapes for code blocks and rabbits for classes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:53:00">[13:53:00]</a>.

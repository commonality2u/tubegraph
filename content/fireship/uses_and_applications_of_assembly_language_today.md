[[introduction_to_assembly_language | Assembly]] is a low-level programming language designed to simplify the instructions fed into a computer's CPU, acting as a human-readable abstraction on top of machine code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While writing code in [[history_and_evolution_of_assembly_language | assembly]] was standard until the emergence of high-level languages like Fortran, it continues to have specific uses today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Current Applications

Despite the prevalence of high-level languages, [[introduction_to_assembly_language | Assembly]] remains relevant for tasks requiring direct, fine-grained control over hardware and optimization:

*   **Direct Hardware Access**
    [[introduction_to_assembly_language | Assembly]] is still used today for direct access to "bare metal hardware" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. This is crucial when software needs to interact very closely with specific hardware components.
*   **Low-Level Performance Issues**
    It is employed to address low-level performance issues, where optimizing code at the instruction level can yield significant speed improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
*   **Device Drivers and Embedded Systems**
    Applications for [[introduction_to_assembly_language | assembly]] frequently include device drivers and embedded systems, where efficiency and direct hardware control are paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.
*   **WebAssembly**
    [[introduction_to_assembly_language | Assembly]] is also used to run native software in a web browser via WebAssembly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

### CPU Architecture Specificity

A key characteristic of [[assembly_language_structure_and_syntax | Assembly Language]] is that each version only works on a specific CPU architecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Examples include ARM for Apple silicon and Raspberry Pi, or x86 for Intel chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This means that programs written in [[introduction_to_assembly_language | assembly]] are not portable across different processor types without rewriting or recompiling for the specific architecture.

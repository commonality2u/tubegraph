The landscape of code editing is evolving, with a significant shift towards [[future_trends_in_technology | cloud-based]] solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. This represents a move away from traditional methods that rely solely on local machine installations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

## Current Examples of Cloud-Based Editors

Several tools are already demonstrating the potential of cloud-based development:
*   **VS Code in the Browser** Users can run Visual Studio Code directly in their browser by visiting `vscode.dev` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.
*   **GitHub Codespaces** This platform allows developers to edit code using powerful cloud hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.
*   **StackBlitz** Tools like StackBlitz leverage WebAssembly to enable the execution of full-stack web applications directly within the browser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>.

These advancements indicate an "interesting" future for [[developer_productivity_tools | code editors]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

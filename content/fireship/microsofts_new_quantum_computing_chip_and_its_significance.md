Microsoft has announced an "impossible" new [[quantum_computing_advancements | Quantum Computing]] chip named Myana One, which they claim introduces an entirely [[the_concept_of_a_new_state_of_matter_in_quantum_computing | new state of matter]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This "Topo computer" or topological supercomputer, if the claims hold true, could represent a breakthrough on par with the transistor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. While transistors allowed [[comparison_between_classical_and_quantum_computers | classical computers]] to scale to millions of bits, the Topo computer has the potential to scale to millions of qubits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

This advancement could make computers billions of times faster than current technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>, leading to [[potential_impact_of_quantum_computing_advances_on_future_technology | incredible developments]] such as new medicines and the simulation of entire worlds of AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. The ultimate goal is to make [[quantum_computing_advancements | quantum computers]] significantly more effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## Context and Skepticism

The announcement by [[microsofts_role_in_ai_development | Microsoft]] on February 21st, 2025, follows Google's Willow chip announcement by mere weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. While currently "utterly useless for all practical purposes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>, CEO Satya Nadella sees it as a significant breakthrough that could accelerate the development of practical [[quantum_computing_advancements | quantum computers]] from decades to years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## The Science Behind Myana One

The Myana One chip is based on the **Majorana fermion**, a subatomic particle that acts as its own anti-particle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. Unlike an electron with a positive or negative charge, the Majorana particle is like a mirror image of itself, having no positive or negative side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. This unique property makes it highly resistant to **decoherence** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

### Understanding Decoherence

[[Quantum computers]] rely on quantum properties like superposition and entanglement, which allow qubits to represent the probability of multiple ones and zeros simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. However, qubits are extremely delicate and susceptible to their environment through a process called quantum decoherence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. This leads to them losing their quantum properties and collapsing to a regular classical state, resulting in high [[challenges_in_quantum_computing_and_error_rates | error rates]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. The Majorana fermion's resistance to decoherence is what makes it so special <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

### History of the Majorana Fermion

The Majorana fermion was first theorized in 1937 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. It was not actually observed until 2020 by researchers who found them in islands of gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. [[Microsoft]] previously claimed to have observed them in 2018 but had to retract their research paper due to misrepresentation of results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

## Topological Quantum Computing

Just a few years later, [[Microsoft]] is now claiming they can not only observe but also control these particles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. They released a paper detailing **topological quantum computing**, where they braid and fuse these particles together and then measure them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. This process occurs on a nanowire engineered atom by atom, where Majorana zero modes exist at either end of the wire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. Computation is performed by measuring if there's an even or odd number of electrons in the wire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

This results in a new type of semiconductor called a **topoconductor**, which is essentially a superconductor-semiconductor sandwich <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. These topoconductors can be chained together, allowing for the scaling up to millions of qubits on a small chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. The chip does require maintaining a temperature near absolute zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. While the potential for millions of qubits exists, it has not yet been achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

## Current Landscape and Significance

As of today, Google and IBM appear to be leading the [[quantum_computing_advancements | quantum computing]] race <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. However, [[Microsoft]] has pursued a long-term strategy, being the only major company focusing on the topological approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. If this approach is not merely overhyped, it could "change the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. This would necessitate programmers rewriting every line of code to optimize for quantum hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

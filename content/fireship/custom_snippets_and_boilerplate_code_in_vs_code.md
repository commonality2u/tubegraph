When working on many projects, developers often find themselves repeatedly writing the same boilerplate code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. To enhance productivity, [[using_extensions_and_snippets_in_vs_code | VS Code]] allows users to create custom snippets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.

## Creating Custom Snippets

Custom snippets can be created by running the "Configure User Snippets" command from the [[command_palette_usage_in_vs_code | Command Palette]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.

Users have the option to:
*   Create global snippets that can be used across all projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.
*   Scope snippets to an individual workspace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

Snippets are defined by modifying a JSON file with the code to be inserted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.

## Inserting Custom Snippets

Once a snippet is configured, it can be quickly added to a project using the "Insert Snippet" command <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

## Utilizing Pre-built Snippets

Before creating new snippets, it's recommended to check the [[using_extensions_and_snippets_in_vs_code | extensions]] panel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. For popular frameworks, there's a good chance that pre-built snippets already exist to meet common needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.

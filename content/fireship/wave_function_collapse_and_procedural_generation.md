The concept of wave function collapse, one of the "weirdest things in all of science," originates from the double-slit experiment in quantum mechanics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. In this experiment, particles behave like a wave when unobserved, but "collapse" into a particle when observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. Philosophically, this has led to the idea that the universe might use such an algorithm to optimize its "AWS bill" in a simulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## Programmatic Implementation

The general idea behind wave function collapse can also be implemented programmatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. This allows for procedural generation, such as creating maps for video games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. For a side-scrolling game that can extend infinitely, a larger pre-made map is not feasible; instead, an algorithm is needed to generate it on the fly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

## How it Works for Procedural Generation

This algorithm takes an initial map and considers it to be in an "initial superposition of all possibilities," much like a wave function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. Upon "observation," it "collapses into a particle," meaning it selects a random map tile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. However, this selection follows a consistent set of rules, such as ensuring that roads are always connected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

The result is a map that is both random and cohesive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. Notably, this method does not rely on any form of modern [[generative_ai|generative AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

Myerona fermions are subatomic particles playing a crucial role in [[microsofts_new_quantum_computing_chip_and_its_significance | Microsoft's new Quantum Computing chip]], the Myerana One <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. These particles are central to the development of a potential [[the_concept_of_a_new_state_of_matter_in_quantum_computing | new state of matter]] for computing, known as the "topo computer" or topological supercomputer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Unique Properties of Myerona Fermions

A Myerona fermion is distinct because it is its own anti-particle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. Unlike an electron, which has a negative charge and an opposite positron, the Myerona particle is like a mirror image of itself, possessing no positive or negative side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. This unique characteristic makes it highly resistant to decoherence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>, a critical challenge in [[challenges_in_quantum_computing_and_error_rates | quantum computing]].

Quantum computers rely on delicate quantum properties like superposition and entanglement, which allow qubits to represent multiple states simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. However, qubits are extremely sensitive to their environment, and quantum decoherence causes them to lose these properties and collapse into a [[comparison_between_classical_and_quantum_computers | classical state]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. This environmental sensitivity leads to high [[challenges_in_quantum_computing_and_error_rates | error rates]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. The Myerona fermion's resistance to decoherence makes it particularly valuable for stable quantum operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

## Discovery and Observation

The existence of this unusual subatomic particle was first theorized in 1937 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. However, it was not until 2020 that researchers officially observed Myerona fermions in islands of gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. Microsoft had previously claimed an observation in 2018 but later retracted their research paper due to misrepresentation of results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

## Application in Topological Quantum Computing

Just a few years after their confirmed observation, Microsoft claims they can not only observe but also control Myerona fermions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. They have released a paper detailing "topological Quantum Computing," where these particles are braided and fused together on a nanowire, engineered atom by atom, and then measured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

The process involves Myerona zero modes at each end of the wire. Computations are performed by measuring whether there's an even or odd number of electrons within the wire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. This results in a new type of semiconductor called a "topo conductor," which is essentially a superconductor-semiconductor sandwich where the semiconductor mimics the superconductor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

## Significance for [[Quantum Computing advancements | Quantum Computing Advancements]]

This approach allows for chaining these topo conductors together, theoretically enabling scaling up to millions of qubits on a small chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>, although this scaling has not yet been achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. The chip does require temperatures near absolute zero to operate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

If Microsoft's claims are accurate and not overhyped, this [[the_concept_of_a_new_state_of_matter_in_quantum_computing | new state of matter]] and the topological approach could be a breakthrough on par with the invention of the transistor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. The transistor allowed computers to scale to millions of bits, and the topo computer could allow scaling to millions of qubits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This would make computers billions of times faster than current technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>, leading to [[potential_threats_and_benefits_of_quantum_computing | incredible things]] like developing new medicines, simulating entire worlds for AI, and significantly faster software updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. It could potentially lead to [[potential_impact_of_quantum_computing_advances_on_future_technology | quantum computers]] becoming practical in years rather than decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

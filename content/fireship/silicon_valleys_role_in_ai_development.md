## The Emergence of AI in Software Engineering

The landscape of software engineering is undergoing a significant transformation due to [[developments_in_artificial_intelligence_and_aipowered_tools | developments in artificial intelligence]]. Initially, tools like Co-pilot began assisting with coding, and [[developments_in_artificial_intelligence_and_aipowered_tools | GPT-4]] followed by writing more extensive code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. The latest development, Devin, introduced by Cognition Labs, has significantly heightened concerns among human software engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Devin: The First AI Software Engineer

Cognition Labs, a company based in Silicon Valley, has developed Devin, which they dub "the first [[AI in software engineering | AI software engineer]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. Devin has access to standard developer tools such as a terminal, browser, and code editor, allowing it to solve problems akin to a human engineer, including searching for solutions on Google or Stack Overflow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

A product manager can provide Devin with requirements, after which Devin creates a plan, gathers API documentation, writes code, runs it, identifies and fixes errors, and repeats this process in an infinite loop until the problem is solved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. This functionality is similar to tools like AutoGPT, where a large language model (LLM) performs actions and reacts to feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

### Performance and Capabilities

Devin significantly outperforms other tools on the software engineering benchmark, a test for solving real-world GitHub issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. While [[developments_in_artificial_intelligence_and_aipowered_tools | GPT-4]] completes the task only 1.74% of the time, Devin achieves a 13.86% success rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. Although this is a substantial improvement, a tool solving only 13% of GitHub issues is not yet sufficient to replace most software engineers today, though this number is expected to rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

Looking ahead, the potential for tools like Devin to operate in parallel, similar to Google's AlphaCoder which beats 85% of competitive programmers by generating thousands of solutions simultaneously, could be revolutionary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. Devin is already taking on and getting paid for real jobs on platforms like Upwork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

Devin's advanced capabilities include the ability to:
*   Learn new technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>
*   Build and deploy applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>
*   Fix bugs in existing codebases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>
*   Train its own [[developments_in_artificial_intelligence_and_aipowered_tools | AI models]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>

## Silicon Valley's Investment and Vision

Cognition Labs is backed by prominent Silicon Valley investors, including Peter Thiel's Founders Fund, the Collison brothers from Stripe, and other key figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
Another stealth startup in this domain, Magic.dev, has secured over $100 million in funding with shared investors like Elad Gill, who has also invested in Mistral and Perplexity AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Driving Motivation
> Silicon Valley's drive to replace programmers is evident, as the first entity to achieve this is expected to gain significant financial returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

## Skepticism and Future Outlook

Despite the rapid [[developments_in_artificial_intelligence_and_aipowered_tools | developments in artificial intelligence]], some skepticism remains. The technology may resemble past overhyped innovations like self-driving cars or 3D printing, which promised revolutions but didn't fully deliver on a grand scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

Currently, Devin excels at generating simple demos. Users of [[developments_in_artificial_intelligence_and_aipowered_tools | AI tools]] over the past year note their utility for simple problems but find them counterproductive and potentially harmful when dealing with complex issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

However, many influential figures believe these challenges will be overcome. Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, has stated that the goal is to create computing technology so advanced that programming becomes unnecessary, effectively making everyone a programmer through the miracle of [[developments_in_artificial_intelligence_and_aipowered_tools | artificial intelligence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. This perspective highlights the potential for [[impact_of_ai_on_job_markets_and_education | AI to redefine job markets]] and the [[future_of_programming_with_ai | future of programming]].

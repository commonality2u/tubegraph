Quantum Processing Units (QPUs), or [[quantum_computing_advancements | quantum computers]], represent a "wild card" technology that could profoundly change the world if it matures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. Unlike classical computers that operate on bits (ones and zeros), quantum computers utilize qubits, or quantum bits, which can exist in a superposition of both states simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. A qubit can represent multiple possibilities at once, but when measured, it collapses into one of the possible states based on probability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

## How Quantum Computing Works (Briefly)
Qubits are subject to [[the_concept_of_a_new_state_of_matter_in_quantum_computing | quantum entanglement]], meaning the state of one qubit is directly related to another, regardless of the distance between them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. These properties are harnessed to create Quantum Gates, which function similarly to logic gates in regular computers but operate on entirely different principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

## The Threat to Modern Encryption
Current cryptographic systems, such as RSA, rely on the difficulty of factorization for classical algorithms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. Classical algorithms would require billions of years to crack these systems by brute force, even with the most powerful computers available today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

However, [[potential_impact_of_quantum_computing_advances_on_future_technology | quantum computers]] will be capable of running algorithms like Shor's algorithm, which is exponentially faster at factorization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. This capability poses a [[potential_threats_and_benefits_of_quantum_computing | major threat to Modern encryption and security]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

## Current Status and Implications
As of now, there is no quantum computer capable of running Shor's algorithm to crack existing encryption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. Furthermore, if such a powerful quantum computer did exist, the public would likely not be informed about it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>, hinting at potential [[governments_stance_on_encryption_and_legal_implications | governmental and national security implications]].

[[javascript_basics_and_history|JavaScript]] was initially created by Brendan Eich in 1995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Eich was given the requirements to build a language similar to [[history_of_java_programming_language|Java]], but "for words" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. He completed the task in just seven days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

The language was described as an "embarrassing toy language" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a> and became an "overnight dumpster fire" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Its initial design was primarily for one use case: "to annoy people with browser pop-ups" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Key Developments

### Node.js and Server-Side JavaScript
A significant turning point occurred in 2005 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a> when Ryan Dahl made the decision to bring [[javascript_basics_and_history|JavaScript]] to the server with Node.js <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Dahl later apologized for his invention many years later, stating, "and it's my fault and I'm very sorry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

### Language Characteristics
[[javascript_basics_and_history|JavaScript]] is characterized as a "loosely typed language" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>, which has led to some peculiar behaviors:
*   Adding an array to an object typically returns the string "object object" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
*   Reversing the order of operands in this operation predictably returns zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.
*   Adding two objects together results in "object object object object" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
*   Adding two arrays together results in an empty string <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
*   The number zero is considered equivalent to an empty array and also to a string of zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. However, a string of zero is *not* equivalent to an empty array <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

These behaviors reportedly stem from a 1990s focus group conducted by Netscape with web developers who believed that "two plus two should equal 22" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>, which is why "2 minus two equals zero" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

### Ecosystem and Popularity
The popularity of [[javascript_basics_and_history|JavaScript]], despite its perceived flaws, has led to a vast ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. Libraries like "is-odd," which performs exactly what its name implies, can receive over 400,000 downloads per week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

The language also features multiple module systems, such as CommonJS and ESM, which can sometimes lead to uncertainty about package compatibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Building applications often requires learning module bundling tools like Webpack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

## Modern State
Despite its historical problems, [[javascript_basics_and_history|JavaScript]] had evolved into an "awesome language" by 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. The speaker, reflecting on over 10 years of [[javascript_basics_and_history|JavaScript]] development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>, expresses gratitude for it, acknowledging that it provides for their family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

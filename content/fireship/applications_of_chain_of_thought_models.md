[[Artificial Intelligence and reasoning models | Chain of Thought]] (CoT) reasoning models represent a significant advancement in [[developments_in_artificial_intelligence_and_aipowered_tools | artificial intelligence]], offering enhanced problem-solving capabilities compared to traditional large language models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>.

## Core Characteristics

A key distinguishing feature of [[deep_seek_r1_chain_of_thought_model_features | Chain of Thought models]] is their ability to perform internal reasoning steps before arriving at a final answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>. When prompted, they first display their thought process, similar to how a human would break down a problem, and then present the solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>.

## How they are developed

Unlike models that rely on supervised fine-tuning (where they are shown step-by-step solutions), models like [[deep_seek_r1_chain_of_thought_model_features | Deep Seek R1]] utilize direct [[reinforcement_learning_and_chain_of_thought_in_ai_models | reinforcement learning]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. In this approach, the model is given problems without pre-supplied solutions and learns by iteratively trying different approaches until it finds the correct solution, reinforcing its own learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>. This process involves the AI attempting multiple answers for a problem, grouping these outputs, and assigning a reward score, which allows the AI to refine its strategy for higher-scoring responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>.

## Key Applications

[[deep_seek_r1_chain_of_thought_model_features | Chain of Thought models]] are particularly effective in scenarios requiring complex reasoning and detailed planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>. Specific applications include:
*   **Complex Problem Solving** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>
*   **Advanced Math Problems** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>
*   **Puzzles** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>
*   **Coding Problems** that demand intricate planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>

## Notable Models

*   **[[deep_seek_r1_chain_of_thought_model_features | Deep Seek R1]]**: Released as a state-of-the-art, free, and open-source [[deep_seek_r1_chain_of_thought_model_features | Chain of Thought]] reasoning model, it can be used freely and commercially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:09">[01:00:09]</a>. Benchmarks indicate that [[comparison_with_other_ai_models_in_coding | Deep Seek R1]] performs on par with [[overview_of_openais_o1_model | OpenAI's o1]], and even surpasses it in areas such as math and software engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:09">[01:49:09]</a>. The model's 7 billion parameter version requires about 4.7 GB of space, while its full 671 billion parameter version demands over 400 GB and significant hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>. A 32 billion parameter version is comparable to [[overview_of_openais_o1_model | o1 mini]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>.
*   **[[overview_of_openais_o1_model | OpenAI o1]]**: While considered a step forward in the AI race, open-source models like [[deep_seek_r1_chain_of_thought_model_features | Deep Seek R1]] have quickly caught up to its performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>.

### Prompting Strategy

When interacting with a [[deep_seek_r1_chain_of_thought_model_features | Chain of Thought model]] such as [[deep_seek_r1_chain_of_thought_model_features | R1]] or [[overview_of_openais_o1_model | o1]], it is best to keep prompts concise and direct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>. This allows the model to leverage its inherent "thinking" capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>.

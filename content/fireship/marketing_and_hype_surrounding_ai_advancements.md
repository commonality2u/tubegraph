The emergence of [[developments_in_artificial_intelligence_and_aipowered_tools | Generative Pre-trained Transformers]] (GPTs) is transforming the world and has generated considerable public fear [00:00:04]. This has led to concerns about job displacement, with [[OpenAI]] releasing a paper suggesting up to 49% of workers could have at least half of their job functions enhanced by [[developments_in_artificial_intelligence_and_aipowered_tools | AI]] [00:00:08]. Extreme speculation also includes fears of [[developments_in_artificial_intelligence_and_aipowered_tools | AI]] infiltrating robotics, leading to potential dangers [00:00:21].

## Calls for a Pause in AI Development
In response to these fears, over 1,000 individuals signed a petition urging [[ai_advancements_and_industry_challenges | AI labs]] to immediately pause training for [[ai_advancements_and_industry_challenges | AI systems]] more powerful than GPT-4 [00:00:29]. The petition's goal is to ensure confidence that [[developments_in_artificial_intelligence_and_aipowered_tools | AI]] will not pose an existential threat [00:00:37]. Notable signatories include Steve Wozniak, Victoria Krakovna of DeepMind, and Elon Musk [00:00:40]. Elon Musk previously attempted to take over [[OpenAI]] in 2018 but was rejected [00:00:45].

Despite these concerns, questions arise about whether [[developments_in_artificial_intelligence_and_aipowered_tools | AI]] is overhyped [00:00:49].

## The Role of Marketing Hype

A significant factor contributing to the public perception of [[developments_in_artificial_intelligence_and_aipowered_tools | AI]] is extensive marketing hype [00:02:56].

### OpenAI's Strategy
Sam Altman, the CEO of [[OpenAI]], previously ran Y Combinator and is experienced in accelerating growth [00:02:59]. His strategies have been noted:
*   He chose not to take equity in [[OpenAI]], a decision that could have resulted in billions of dollars [00:03:06].
*   Altman publicly stated that GPT-4 was "not as good as it seems" [00:03:11].
*   Concurrently, [[OpenAI]] released a paper asserting that GPT-4 showed "Sparks of AGI" (Artificial General Intelligence) without disclosing significant technical details about its workings [00:03:13].
*   [[OpenAI]] has also called for [[ai_advancements_and_industry_challenges | AI regulation]] before [[ai_advancements_and_industry_challenges | AGI]] emerges [00:03:22].

It is argued that this apparent contradiction and messaging are part of a deliberate marketing strategy [00:03:43]. The hype has been highly beneficial for [[OpenAI]], transforming it from a niche tech company to a household name [00:03:47]. Over 5% of the global workforce reportedly uses ChatGPT daily [00:03:53]. [[OpenAI]] has achieved brand recognition comparable to Coca-Cola in the [[developments_in_artificial_intelligence_and_aipowered_tools | AI]] sector without traditional advertising [00:03:57]. This success is also attributed to a coordinated product release schedule with their major partner, [[Microsofts_role_in_AI_development | Microsoft]] [00:04:03].

### Impact on the Internet
The proliferation of [[developments_in_artificial_intelligence_and_aipowered_tools | AI]] has raised concerns about the authenticity of online content, making it difficult to distinguish human-crafted content from [[developments_in_artificial_intelligence_and_aipowered_tools | AI]]-generated material [00:04:16]. This has led to the "Dead Internet Theory," which posits that large tech companies have used [[developments_in_artificial_intelligence_and_aipowered_tools | AI]] for years to populate the internet with fake accounts and engagement to boost advertising revenue and motivate content creators [00:04:39].

## The Likelihood of an AI Plateau

One perspective countering the extreme hype is that [[developments_in_artificial_intelligence_and_aipowered_tools | AI]] will eventually plateau, similar to other technologies [00:05:05].
*   The underlying algorithms for Large Language Models (LLMs) are not inherently complex, with the concept of a transformer first introduced by Google in 2017 [00:05:14].
*   [[OpenAI]]'s success lies in effectively productizing this idea into something desirable for users [00:05:28].
*   Despite [[OpenAI]]'s continued use of "subtle fear porn" regarding [[future_developments_and_expectations_for_ai_technology | AGI]], GPT-4 is considered not to be close to true [[future_developments_and_expectations_for_ai_technology | AGI]] [00:05:33].
*   The belief is that true [[future_developments_and_expectations_for_ai_technology | AGI]] will not emerge anytime soon, or potentially ever, due to unique human qualities like consciousness and soul that science has not replicated [00:05:39].
*   [[developments_in_artificial_intelligence_and_aipowered_tools | AI]] is expected to become highly proficient at mimicking humans but will likely never surpass human intellect, as its training is based on existing internet content [00:06:10].

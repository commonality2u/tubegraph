[[introduction_to_python | Python]] is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its "zen-like" code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It is widely considered one of the most popular languages globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>, being easy to learn yet practical for complex projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. For instance, YouTube's web application is built using [[introduction_to_python | Python]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## [[history_of_python | History of Python]]

[[introduction_to_python | Python]] was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. Its name was inspired by "Monty Python's Flying Circus" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>, which is why code samples sometimes feature "spam and eggs" instead of conventional placeholders like "Foo and bar" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## [[python_applications_and_frameworks | Applications and Use Cases]]

[[introduction_to_python | Python]] is commonly used for:
*   Building server-side applications, including web applications, often with frameworks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.
*   Big Data analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.
*   Machine learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

Many students choose [[introduction_to_python | Python]] as a [[beginner_programming_languages_and_learning_tools | starting language]] for learning to code due to its emphasis on readability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## [[python_syntax_and_readability | Design Philosophy and Readability]]

[[introduction_to_python | Python]]'s design philosophy is outlined by "The Zen of [[introduction_to_python | Python]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>, which includes principles such as:
*   "Beautiful is better than ugly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
*   "Explicit is better than implicit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

The language prioritizes simplicity while avoiding features that could lead to ambiguity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## Code Organization and Files

[[introduction_to_python | Python]] code is frequently organized into notebooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>, where individual cells can be executed and documented in the same environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

Files ending with `.py` are used for standard [[introduction_to_python | Python]] scripts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>, while `.ipynb` files are for interactive notebooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. The current major version of the language is [[introduction_to_python | Python]] 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## [[python_syntax_and_readability | Syntax and Type System]]

[[introduction_to_python | Python]] variables are created by assigning a name to a value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. The language is:
*   **Strongly typed:** Values do not change in unexpected ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
*   **Dynamically typed:** Type annotations are not mandatory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

The syntax is highly efficient, allowing for:
*   Declaration of multiple variables on a single line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
*   Definition of tuples, lists, and dictionaries using literal syntax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

Unlike many other languages, semicolons are not required to terminate lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. Using them may be considered "not pythonic" by experienced users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. Instead, [[introduction_to_python | Python]] uses indentation (typically four spaces) to define code blocks and scope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

```python
def my_function(): <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>
    # This line is indented by four spaces, defining the function body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>
    for item in some_list: <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>
        # This line is indented by another four spaces for the loop body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>
        print(item)
```

This indentation-based structure removes the need for curly braces and semicolons found in many other languages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

## Programming Paradigms

[[introduction_to_python | Python]] is a multi-paradigm language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. It supports:
*   **Functional programming patterns:** Achieved with features like anonymous functions using `lambda` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.
*   **Object-oriented patterns:** Utilizes objects as an abstraction for data, allowing for classes and inheritance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

## [[python_ecosystem_and_libraries | Ecosystem and Libraries]]

[[introduction_to_python | Python]] boasts a vast [[python_ecosystem_and_libraries | ecosystem of third-party libraries]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>, including:
*   Deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
*   Wrappers for high-performance low-level packages like OpenCV (Open Computer Vision) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

These libraries are commonly installed using the `pip` package manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

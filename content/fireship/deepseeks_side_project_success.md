Last week, the Chinese company [[deepseek_r1_vs_ai_giants | DeepSeek]] released the open-source [[deepseek_r1_vs_ai_giants | R1]] model, which made a significant impact on the technology world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## The R1 Model's Unprecedented Performance

The [[deepseek_r1_vs_ai_giants | R1]] model not only surpasses [[comparison_of_deep_seek_r1_and_openai_o1_models | OpenAI]]'s $200 [[comparison_of_deep_seek_r1_and_openai_o1_models | 01 reasoning model]] but also beats Claude Sonnet and Gemini on key benchmarks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. It also passes the [[risks_and_potential_success_stories_of_vibe_coding | Vibe test]] for many internet users, as long as it's not asked about April 15th, 1989 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. Remarkably, [[deepseek_r1_vs_ai_giants | R1]] even excels at math, despite [[comparison_of_deep_seek_r1_and_openai_o1_models | OpenAI]] having prior access to answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

Since its release, [[deepseek_r1_vs_ai_giants | R1]] has gone viral, becoming the number one app in America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## A Low-Cost "Side Project" with Massive Impact

[[deepseek_r1_vs_ai_giants | DeepSeek]]'s [[deepseek_r1_vs_ai_giants | R1]] model was developed for less than $10 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. It originated as a [[building_a_profitable_software_business_as_a_solo_developer | side project]] of a hedge fund, with the sole aim of creating long-term social value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Mark Andreessen described it as "one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs he's ever seen," calling it a "profound gift to the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

The ability of the top-of-the-line 680 billion-parameter [[deepseek_r1_vs_ai_giants | DeepSeek]] model to run on relatively inexpensive consumer hardware, such as a few Apple M2 Ultras, is a significant development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

## Shaking Up the Tech and Financial Worlds

The success of [[deepseek_r1_vs_ai_giants | DeepSeek]]'s [[deepseek_r1_vs_ai_giants | R1]] poses a "big problem" for Big Tech, as it challenges the perception that [[deepseek_r1_vs_ai_giants | artificial intelligence]] must be difficult and require thousands of GPUs to achieve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

Wall Street is "terrified," and Nvidia's stock has experienced a "blood bath" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. Nvidia, which has been the primary beneficiary of the [[deepseek_r1_vs_ai_giants | AI]] boom, saw its "bubble" burst with this reality check <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. The stock market panicked, wiping out nearly a trillion dollars in value, with Nvidia, Taiwan Semiconductor, and Broadcom being the biggest losers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

Nvidia has maintained a near-monopoly on [[deepseek_r1_vs_ai_giants | AI]] training for the past decade due to superior Linux drivers, and machine learning algorithms optimized for proprietary libraries like CUDA, which only run on Nvidia GPUs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. However, the revelation that [[deepseek_r1_vs_ai_giants | DeepSeek]] can run on consumer hardware challenges this dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

In response to [[deepseek_r1_vs_ai_giants | DeepSeek]], [[comparison_of_deep_seek_r1_and_openai_o1_models | OpenAI]] is attempting to remain competitive by offering its [[comparison_of_deep_seek_r1_and_openai_o1_models | 01 Mini model]] to free users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. They also released "Operator," which grants [[deepseek_r1_vs_ai_giants | AI]] access to a browser, allowing it to interact with websites on users' behalf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

## The "Sputnik Moment" for AI?

This development has been likened to the "Sputnik moment," referring to Russia's launch of the first artificial satellite in 1957, which shocked the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. The concern is that if a state-of-the-art model is free, open-source, and developed in China, it challenges the profitability models of current [[deepseek_r1_vs_ai_giants | AI]] investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

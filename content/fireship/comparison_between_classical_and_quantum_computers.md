This article explores the fundamental differences and capabilities of classical computers, like supercomputers, and emerging quantum computers.

## Classical Computing: The Foundation

Classical computers, such as the supercomputer El Capitan, rely on bits to process information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>. Each bit represents a single state, either a binary zero or a one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>. These bits can be combined to perform complex tasks, like streaming video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>. El Capitan, for instance, boasts over 1 million CPU cores and 10 million GPU cores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## Quantum Computing: A New Paradigm

[[Quantum Computing advancements | Quantum computers]] operate using quantum bits, or "qubits" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>. Unlike classical bits, qubits can represent the [[the_concept_of_a_new_state_of_matter_in_quantum_computing | quantum superposition]] of multiple zeros and ones simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>. This means a single qubit can hold a significant amount of information and enable parallel computation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>.

### Key Quantum Principles

*   **Superposition**: A qubit can exist in a state where it is both 0 and 1 at the same time, much like a cat being both dead and alive in a box until observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>. When measured, it collapses to a definite 0 or 1 with a certain probability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>.
*   **Entanglement**: Qubits can become entangled, meaning the state of one qubit is directly linked to the state of another, even if they are physically far apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>. This property is crucial for coordinating computations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>.
*   **Quantum Gates**: Similar to logic gates in classical computers, quantum gates manipulate qubits by leveraging quantum mechanics, performing actions like flipping a qubit or creating entanglement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>.

### Speed and Performance Comparison

[[Quantum computing advancements | Quantum computing]] holds the promise of immense speed advantages for certain problems. For instance, Google's new Quantum chip, Willow, can solve specific problems "septian of times faster" than El Capitan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. A problem that Willow can compute in 5 minutes would take El Capitan more years than the age of the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>. Even if an El Capitan supercomputer existed for every grain of sand on Earth, powered by a Dyson Sphere, it would still be significantly slower than Willow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>.

## Current State and [[Challenges in quantum computing and error rates | Challenges]]

Despite impressive theoretical capabilities and recent breakthroughs, [[quantum_computing_advancements | quantum computing]] is still in its early stages and faces significant [[challenges_in_quantum_computing_and_error_rates | challenges]]:

*   **Delicate Qubits and Error Rates**: Qubits are extremely delicate and prone to errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>. Error correction is constantly needed to maintain stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>.
*   **Environmental Requirements**: Quantum chips must be kept at temperatures near absolute zero to function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.
*   **Coherence Time**: Qubits can only maintain their superposition state for a very short duration. While in the past this was about 20 microseconds, Google's Willow chip has increased this to 100 microseconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>.
*   **Practical Utility**: As of December 10th, 2024, the technology is "nowhere near being useful" for general applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.

### Recent Advancements

*   **Google's Willow Chip**: This 105-qubit chip can identify and reconfigure qubits with high error rates on the fly, thereby reducing the overall error rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>. It's also the first chip to demonstrate that error-corrected qubits improve exponentially as they scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>. Google's next goal is to build a long-lived logical qubit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>.
*   **China's 504-Qubit Superconducting Chip**: Days after Google's unveiling, China introduced its own record-breaking 504-qubit superconducting chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>. While impressive in qubit count, the critical factor for future impact is the error rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>.

## [[Potential threats and benefits of quantum computing | Potential Impact]]

The [[potential_impact_of_quantum_computing_advances_on_future_technology | potential impact of quantum computing]] is vast and dual-edged:

*   **Benefits**: [[Potential threats and benefits of quantum computing | Quantum computing]] could lead to breakthroughs in Fusion Energy, Artificial Super Intelligence, and even immortality through nanorobot doctors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>.
*   **Threats**: Rapid computing speeds pose an [[potential_threats_and_benefits_of_quantum_computing | existential threat]] by rendering currently "unbreakable" encryption algorithms worthless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>. A hacker with a quantum computer could instantly brute-force RSA encrypted communications or crack cryptocurrency wallet seed phrases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>.

Algorithms like Shor's, developed in the 1990s, theorized how to find prime factors in large numbers â€” a task central to breaking RSA encryption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>. With sufficient quantum hardware, estimated at around 2,000 qubits with low error rates, these systems could break widely used encryption systems like RSA, a feat that would take classical computers millions or billions of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>.

The "inflection point" for [[quantum_computing_advancements | quantum computers]] to scale exponentially and "change the world in unimaginably good and bad ways" will be reached once the error rate gets low enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>.

In March 2025, the programming world saw the emergence of the [[vibe_coding_mind_virus_phenomenon | vibe coding mind virus]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This term, coined by exopi wizard Andrey, describes fully embracing "the vibes" and "exponentials" while forgetting that the code itself exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. It rapidly gained traction, with virtually every [[influencer_programmer_stereotype | code influencer]] on the internet adopting it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Distinguishing Coding from Programming

It's crucial to understand the difference between [[impact_of_ai_on_coding_and_programming_skills | coding]] and [[impact_of_ai_on_coding_and_programming_skills | programming]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>:
*   **Coding** is the skill of translating logic into computer instructions by writing code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. This skill is becoming obsolete as [[impact_of_ai_on_coding_and_programming_skills | large language models]] (LLMs) allow even an 8-year-old to write code faster than a professional with 20 years of experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
*   **Programming** is a much broader skill, described as both an art and a science, requiring ingenuity, creativity, and good instincts gained through [[overcoming_challenges_and_hard_work_in_programming | experience]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. The best programmers often remove more code than they write <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

## When Vibe Coding Goes Wrong: Risks and Failures

The prevalence of [[vibe_coding_mind_virus_phenomenon | vibe coding]] has led to the internet being flooded with [[impact_of_ai_on_coding_and_programming_skills | AI]]-generated "sloth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. The core risk of vibe coding is a lack of deep understanding of the generated code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

### Case Study: The Hacked SaaS Product
One example of vibe coding going wrong involves an indie hacker who [[impact_of_ai_on_coding_and_programming_skills | vibe coded]] a SaaS product that even acquired paying customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. However, without a true programmer's understanding, the product was easily hacked:
> <q>Random thing are happening. Maxed out usage on API keys. people bypassing the subscription, creating random on DB. This has taken me longer than usual to figure out.</q> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>
Ultimately, the application was taken down permanently, and the developer had to seek his old job back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. This highlights that relying *only* on vibes is a bad idea, as even Peter Levelvels' Flight Simulator, despite its success, had "all kinds of issues" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

## Potential Success Stories of Vibe Coding

Despite the risks, vibe coding, when done properly, has significant potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

### The Apex Indie Hacker: Peter Levelvels
Apex indie hacker Peter Levelvels successfully [[impact_of_ai_on_coding_and_programming_skills | vibe coded]] a "crappy real-time flight simulator MMO" using JavaScript <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. He then leveraged his large Twitter following to sell in-game advertisements, generating substantial income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. This success, however, likely stemmed from his many [[overcoming_challenges_and_hard_work_in_programming | years of experience]] as a developer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

### The Billion-Dollar Business
It's predicted that a billion-dollar business could emerge, running entirely on "Vibes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Such ventures would likely be built with [[impact_of_ai_tools_on_coding_and_developers | AI tools]] like Vzero, Bolt, and AI IDEs such as Cursor and Windserve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

## [[tools_and_techniques_for_effective_vibe_coding | Tools and techniques]] for Proper Vibe Coding

To [[tools_and_techniques_for_effective_vibe_coding | vibe properly]] and mitigate risks when using [[impact_of_ai_tools_on_coding_and_developers | AI tools]] to [[tools_and_techniques_for_effective_vibe_coding | vibe code]], adhere to these three rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>:

1.  **Choose a Popular, Simple Tech Stack**:
    *   LLMs are most effective at solving problems that have already been addressed on platforms like GitHub and Stack Overflow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
    *   Opt for widely used technologies like React, Express, Tailwind, Redis, and Deno for web development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. Using obscure or new frameworks can hinder the "vibes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. Vue.js and Nux have also shown good vibe coding results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

2.  **Get Good at Git**:
    *   Since [[impact_of_ai_tools_on_coding_and_developers | AI tools]] can delete working code, mastering version control (Git) is non-negotiable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
    *   Disciplined use of Git allows you to stash good, working code safely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. Tools like Claude Code can even [[tools_and_techniques_for_effective_vibe_coding | vibe commit]] your code for you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

3.  **Become a Product Manager for Your AI**:
    *   As a developer, your role shifts from "coder" to "product manager" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
    *   Break down complex requirements into small, highly specific steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
    *   Provide proper context, including recent documentation and UI design images, to help the AI solve problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. The goal is for the LLM to be deterministic, not creative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

While relying solely on vibes remains a bad idea, combining this approach with solid foundational [[overcoming_challenges_and_hard_work_in_programming | experience]] and proper [[tools_and_techniques_for_effective_vibe_coding | tools and techniques]] can empower developers to achieve powerful results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

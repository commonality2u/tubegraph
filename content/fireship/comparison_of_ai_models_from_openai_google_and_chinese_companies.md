This article provides a comparison of recent advancements in AI models from key players like OpenAI, Google, and various Chinese technology companies, as of March 28th, 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

## OpenAI's GPT-4o

OpenAI's brand new GPT-4o image generator has captivated the tech world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. The tool has transformed the internet into what is described as a "GBL anime cartoon nightmare" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, a vision previously warned about by Senpai Miyazaki, creator of the GBL Animation Studio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. The release has even led to popular memes being "ruined" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

Initial expectations for GPT-4o's image generator were low, especially following the disappointments of Sora and GPT 4.5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. However, OpenAI has since redeemed itself by delivering a powerful tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

### Capabilities of GPT-4o

*   **Graphic Design Replacement** GPT-4o allows users to generate infographics and marketing material with near-perfect text rendering, potentially replacing graphic design software like Canva <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.
*   **Comic Strip Generation** It can produce comic strips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   **Transparency Handling** Unlike most other image generators, GPT-4o can handle transparency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
*   **Art Style Transformation and Character Continuity** A significant feature is its ability to transform images into specific art styles and maintain character continuity, enabling users to upgrade characters with new poses, outfits, or integrate them into photos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

### Technical Approach and Watermarking

As a closed AI model, there is no public paper or code available for GPT-4o <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. It reportedly uses an auto-regressive approach instead of diffusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. Unlike diffusion algorithms used in models like Stable Diffusion and Midjourney, which generate an entire image at once, GPT-4o generates images pixel by pixel from left to right, top to bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

The generated images contain a controversial watermark provided by the Coalition for Content Providence and Authenticity (C2PA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. This watermark allows tools to identify images generated by OpenAI and track any modifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. Camera manufacturers and software developers like Adobe are implementing similar tracking for digital assets to combat misinformation, though this raises concerns about privacy and freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. Platforms such as YouTube and Steam now require users to disclose when they use AI assets in their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

OpenAI Pro costs $200 a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

## Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro

Google "quietly crushed every [[open_source_ai_models | open AI model]] on the market" with the release of Gemini 2.5 Pro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This new state-of-the-art model is highly effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

### Capabilities and Cost

*   [[comparison_of_ai_models_costs_and_effectiveness | Gemini 2.5 Pro is arguably just as good for programming as Claude 3.7]], and features a larger context window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   It is considered better than reasoning models like OpenAI 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.
*   Notably, Gemini 2.5 Pro is available for free, in contrast to OpenAI Pro's $200 monthly fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

Despite its capabilities, Chinese AI companies are posing a challenge to Google's aspirations for world AI dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

## [[rise_of_chinese_ai_models_and_the_impact_on_the_ai_landscape | Rise of Chinese AI Models]]

Chinese companies have released several impactful AI models that are gaining significant attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

*   **Deep Seek** Deep Seek released version 3.1, which is noted for its effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
*   **Alibaba's Qwen 2.5 Omni** This model from Alibaba can "see, hear, talk, and write" thanks to its new "thinker-talker" architecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
*   **Tencent's T1** Tencent released T1 to compete with Deep Seek <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
*   **ByteDance's Dapo** ByteDance, the company behind TikTok, released Dapo, an [[open_source_advancements_in_ai_model_technology | open-source reinforcement learning system]] designed for building large-scale large language models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

The prevalence of [[open_source_ai_models | open-source Chinese models]] has created a "Vibe coder's Paradise," where anyone can generate vast amounts of code, implying that programmers will face the task of fixing and refactoring this generated code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

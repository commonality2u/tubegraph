The evolution of [[history_and_evolution_of_javascript | JavaScript]] has been profoundly shaped by the competition and innovation driven by various web browsers and technology companies.

## Early Web and the Rise of Browsers

The world's first web browser was developed by Sir Tim Berners-Lee on Christmas Day 1990 in Switzerland, running on a NeXT computer system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Around the same time, he also developed the first web server <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

In December 1991, Al Gore introduced the Gore Bill, which provided funding for the first mainstream browser, Mosaic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. Developed by Marc Andreessen and Eric Bina at the University of Illinois, Mosaic was released for UNIX systems in January 1993, with ports for Macintosh and Windows following later that year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. Mosaic played a crucial role in bringing the internet to the mainstream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. At this point, there was no JavaScript; only the Document Object Model (DOM) existed, and it was not yet standardized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## Netscape's Vision and the Birth of JavaScript

After graduating, Marc Andreessen co-founded Netscape in California <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. Within a few years, Netscape Navigator dominated the browser market, controlling around 80% market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Andreessen recognized the need for browsers to become more dynamic and for web designers to have a "glue language" to make websites interactive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

Initially, Netscape considered using Sun Microsystems' trendy Java programming language but quickly decided against it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. Their Plan B was to recruit [[the_role_of_netscape_and_brendan_eich_in_javascripts_development | Brendan Eich]] to integrate the Scheme programming language into the browser while maintaining a Java-like syntax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. Just ten days later, the first version of JavaScript, initially called "Mocha," was created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. Mocha was syntactically a curly-bracket language like Java or C, but internally featured first-class functions, dynamic typing, and prototypal inheritance, inspired by Sun Microsystems' Self programming language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

By September 1995, Mocha was renamed "LiveScript" and shipped in the beta releases of Netscape Navigator 2.0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. A few months later, in December 1995, it was renamed "JavaScript" to associate it with the popular Java programming language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. From its inception, JavaScript immediately impacted the user experience, often with features like annoying pop-up windows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

## Microsoft's Entry and the Need for Standardization

As JavaScript gained traction, Microsoft launched its own browser, Internet Explorer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. Naturally, Microsoft reverse-engineered JavaScript and named its version "JScript" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. By 1996, two almost identical languages, JavaScript and JScript, existed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

With the rapid growth of the internet, the need for [[standardization_of_javascript_and_the_ecmascript_specification | standardization]] became evident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. Netscape turned to the European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA), a neutral party for IT standards since 1961 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. By June 1997, the first version of ECMA-262, commonly known as ECMAScript, was published <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. This provided a consistent specification for browser vendors and server-side applications to implement the JavaScript language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

ECMAScript version 3 (ES3), released in December 1999, added important features like better error handling and the strict equality operator (`===`), addressing some of [[the_role_of_netscape_and_brendan_eich_in_javascripts_development | Brendan Eich's]] regrets regarding loose equality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.

## Fragmentation and Innovation in the 2000s

The early 2000s saw a significant shift in browser dominance. Netscape was acquired by AOL in 1998 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. Meanwhile, Microsoft's Internet Explorer began to devour market share, controlling at least 80% in the early 2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. Microsoft often deviated from the ECMAScript spec, implementing its own extensions for JavaScript <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. This created fragmentation, which developers still contend with when supporting legacy Internet Explorer versions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.

However, this period also led to revolutionary features like Ajax, which allowed JavaScript to be implemented asynchronously, serving as a precursor to modern single-page applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

Work on ECMAScript version 4 (ES4) began in the early 2000s, aiming for features akin to modern TypeScript, such as optional type annotations, classes, and interfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. However, Douglas Crockford from Yahoo, who created JSON in 2003 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>, raised concerns about the proposal's growing complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. Microsoft agreed with Crockford and refused to participate, leading to two competing proposals: ES 3.1 and ES4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. ES4 was eventually scrapped in 2008, though its concepts found their way into ActionScript, Adobe's scripting language for Flash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

## Renaissance and Modern JavaScript Ecosystem

The mid-2000s were a challenging period for JavaScript, but it soon entered a "Renaissance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. In 2006, jQuery was released, a library that significantly advanced web development by providing robust documentation and empowering developers to build complex, cross-browser interactive applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

A monumental event occurred in 2008 with the release of Google Chrome and its V8 engine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. V8 transformed how JavaScript was compiled and interpreted, making it viable for high-performance applications in both browser and [[using_javascript_on_web_and_server_environments | server environments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. Less than a year later, in May 2009, Ryan Dahl introduced Node.js, a server-side JavaScript runtime built on V8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. Node.js's event loop enabled event-driven, non-blocking code, making it ideal for real-time web applications and allowing developers to build entire web stacks with a single language â€“ the "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.

Concurrent with these developments, the ECMAScript committee (TC39) finally unified in Oslo, Norway, deciding to base the next standard on ES 3.1. This resulted in the release of ES5 in December 2009, exactly ten years after the last official spec <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. ES5 included critical features like JSON support, functional array/object methods, and strict mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.

Since 2010, the landscape has been defined by the emergence of [[javascript_trends_and_frameworks | JavaScript frameworks]] and tools. Backbone.js and AngularJS, both released in October 2010, pioneered single-page application development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. These frameworks, despite their [[tradeoffs_of_javascript_frameworks | different approaches]], aimed to solve similar problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. CoffeeScript, created by Jeremy Ashkenas (also the creator of Backbone.js), was crucial in making transpiling mainstream, aligning with [[the_role_of_netscape_and_brendan_eich_in_javascripts_development | Brendan Eich's]] original vision for a malleable language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. Transpilers became even more vital with the release of ES6 (ES2015), which introduced a host of new features like Promises, `let`/`const`, arrow functions, and destructuring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. Tools like Babel and TypeScript enable developers to use these modern features while targeting older browser environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.

The rise of React.js in 2015 further solidified modern declarative UI patterns, building on concepts from AngularJS but improving upon them with unidirectional dataflow, immutability, and the Virtual DOM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. Other frameworks like Angular, Vue, and Svelte also compete for developer mindshare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. The complexity of modern JavaScript applications is managed by tools like Rollup and Webpack for dependency bundling, TypeScript and Flow for type systems, and Immutable.js and RxJS for functional patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.

Today, TC39 maintains a regular schedule for JavaScript updates, and new developments like WebAssembly, a binary format for compiling low-level languages like C++ to deliver high-performance web applications, will continue to influence JavaScript's future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. JavaScript's consistent evolution, driven by browser innovation and a massive, diverse community, suggests it will continue to adapt and thrive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>.

The release of DeepSeek's R1 model has caused significant upheaval in the [[Implications for big tech companies under antitrust scrutiny | Big Tech]] industry and the stock market, particularly affecting chip companies like Nvidia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

## Nvidia's Dominance Challenged

Nvidia had been the primary beneficiary of the [[Impact of AI on job markets and education | AI boom]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>, holding a near-monopoly on AI training for the past decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. This was due to several factors:
*   **Superior Drivers** Nvidia had better Linux drivers compared to AMD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
*   **Proprietary Libraries** Machine learning algorithms were optimized for proprietary libraries like CUDA, which only run on Nvidia GPUs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.
*   **Infrastructure** Nvidia also possessed the infrastructure to connect these GPUs at scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

The company's profits historically grew as AI models became larger and more popular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

## Market Reaction and Losses

The cost-effectiveness and accessibility of DeepSeek's R1 model have shaken the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. Wall Street reportedly became "terrified," with Nvidia's stock anticipating a "blood bath" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. The entire "AI bubble" received a "brutal reality check" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

The stock market panicked, resulting in nearly a trillion dollars in wiped-out value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Nvidia was identified as the biggest loser, followed by other chip companies like Taiwan Semiconductor and Broadcom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

## Implications for Tech Investors

The ability of DeepSeek's 680 billion-parameter R1 model to run on relatively cheap consumer hardware, such as a few Apple M2 Ultras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>, poses a significant threat to tech investors who have poured billions into AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. The concern stems from the fact that if a state-of-the-art AI model is free, open-source, and can run on affordable hardware, it challenges the profitability model for existing AI investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

This event has been likened to the "Sputnik moment," referring to Russia's launch of the first artificial satellite in 1957, which shocked the United States and prompted a decade-long catch-up effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. The prevailing sentiment is that the "AI hype train" may be ending, with attention shifting to other emerging technologies like brain chips, [[potential_impact_of_quantum_computing_advances_on_future_technology | quantum computers]], artificial meat printers, nanorobots, and digital resurrection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

[[introduction_to_python | Python]] is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its "zen-like code" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It is widely considered one of the most popular languages globally due to its ease of learning combined with its practical application for complex projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. For instance, YouTube videos are watched through a Python web application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Origins and Naming

Python was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. Van Rossum named the language after the British comedy group Monty Python's Flying Circus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. This influence sometimes leads to terms like "spam" and "eggs" being used in code samples instead of generic "Foo" and "bar" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Core Philosophy: The Zen of Python

One of Python's defining characteristics is its emphasis on readability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This philosophy is formally outlined in "The Zen of Python" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>, which includes principles such as:

> [!quote]
> Beautiful is better than ugly.
> Explicit is better than implicit. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>

Python is designed to be simple, avoiding "magic" that could lead to ambiguity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. This design makes it a popular choice for students beginning to learn programming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Key Characteristics and Features

### Applications and Use Cases
Python is commonly used for building server-side applications, such as web apps leveraging frameworks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. It is also the preferred language for Big Data analysis and machine learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

### Code Organization and Syntax
Python code is often organized into notebooks, allowing individual cells to be executed and documented in the same environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

Key syntax features include:
*   Files typically end with `.py` for scripts or `.ipynb` for interactive notebooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.
*   Variable creation involves setting a name equal to a value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
*   It is a strongly typed language, meaning values do not change unexpectedly, but it is also dynamic, so type annotations are not strictly required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
*   The syntax is highly efficient, allowing for multiple variables to be declared on a single line and the definition of tuples, lists, and dictionaries using literal syntax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
*   Semicolons are not required to terminate lines, and using them is considered "not pythonic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
*   Instead of semicolons or curly braces found in many other languages, Python uses indentation to define the scope of code blocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. For example, a function defined with the `def` keyword will have its body indented, typically by four spaces, and subsequent nested blocks like `for` loops will have further indentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

### Programming Paradigms
Python is a multi-paradigm language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. It supports:
*   **Functional Programming:** Patterns like anonymous functions can be applied using `lambda` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.
*   **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** It uses objects as an abstraction for data, enabling OOP patterns through classes and inheritance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

### Ecosystem and Libraries
Python boasts a vast ecosystem of third-party libraries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Examples include deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and wrappers for high-performance low-level packages such as Open Computer Vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. These are most often installed using the PIP package manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

## Current Status

Python is currently at version three <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

GitHub Copilot X is GitHub's next-generation coding assistant, announced on March 23, 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Powered by GPT-4, it significantly advances beyond the previous Copilot version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. These [[developer_productivity_tools | AI tools]] are considered to provide a huge advantage to developers, potentially making traditional "natty" coding obsolete within two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

While large language models have been built using open-source code, Stack Overflow answers, and tutorials, leading to the automation of white-collar jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, programming is not considered dead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Instead, these [[developer_productivity_tools | AI tools]] are expected to empower programmers, enabling them to build systems up to 10 times faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. AI still requires programmers to deliver a great product to the end-user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## Microsoft's Dominance

Microsoft has been noted for its dominance in the AI space, having acquired GitHub and a major stake in OpenAI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. Within a week of this announcement, Microsoft's products appeared years ahead of the competition, demonstrating a "master class" in business strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

## Availability

GitHub Copilot X is currently in technical preview and not yet available for public consumption, likely months away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

## Key Features

GitHub Copilot X includes at least five game-changing features:

### Built-in Chat Window

This feature allows users to highlight code and request explanations, refactoring, or unit test generation directly within their IDE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. Unlike general chatbots, it is highly specialized for coding problems and has the context of the user's actual codebase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. GPT-4, which powers Copilot X, can handle 25,000 tokens, significantly more than GPT 3.5's 3,000 tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

### Copilot for Documentation

Instead of manually searching documentation or Stack Overflow, this feature allows users to generate answers based on a specific library's documentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. It integrates documentation for frameworks like React, Azure, and MDN, enabling on-the-fly generation of answers and tutorials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

### Voice-activated Copilot

This feature aims to reduce the importance of fast typing speeds, allowing users to control [[vs_code_extensions_for_productivity | VS Code]] and write code entirely through voice commands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. This capability offers speed advantages over typing and enables coding in situations where traditional input methods are impractical, such as while exercising or commuting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. It is expected to revolutionize workflows similar to how voice assistants like Alexa changed household interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

### Copilot for Pull Requests

When submitting pull requests, Copilot can automatically generate descriptions based on the changes made to the code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. This streamlines the [[git_version_control_and_collaboration_tools_in_vs_code | pull request]] process, especially as the code changes themselves might have been AI-generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

### Copilot CLI

The Copilot CLI (Command Line Interface) extends AI autocompletion beyond the text editor to the terminal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. This eliminates the need to memorize numerous Linux commands; users can simply describe what they want to achieve with a library, and Copilot will generate the command along with an explanation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. The generated command can then be run or revised as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

## Conclusion

The development of GitHub Copilot X represents a significant shift in the programming landscape. It builds upon the "billions of lines of code" written by programmers over the last 30 years, ironically including many Linux users who historically opposed Microsoft, effectively working for Microsoft for free by contributing to the training data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

From: [[fireship]] <br/> 

In March 2025, the programming world saw the emergence of the "vibe coding mind virus" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. This term, coined by "exopi wizard" Andrey, describes a state where developers "fully give into the vibes, embrace exponentials, and forget that the code even exists" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

The concept rapidly gained traction, with nearly every [[influencer_programmer_stereotype | code influencer]] online adopting it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. A notable early adopter was [[hacker_programmer_stereotype | Apex indie hacker]] Peter Levelvels, who "viodated a crappy real-time flight simulator MMO with JavaScript" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a> and successfully monetized it through in-game advertisements via his large Twitter following <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Concerns and the AI Shift
While Levelvels's success was seen as "pure tech bro genius" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>, the phenomenon led to a proliferation of "crappy games" and "AI generated sloth" flooding the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. This trend aligns with predictions from the CEO of Anthropic, who stated that "virtually all code will be written by AI" within 12 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

### Coding vs. Programming
A key distinction is drawn between coding and programming:
*   **Coding** is the skill of translating logic into computer instructions by writing code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. Once a highly valued skill (e.g., an elite coder writing 100 words per minute of C++ in Vim from memorized syntax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>), it is becoming obsolete as large language models (LLMs) can now write code faster than experienced professionals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
*   **Programming** is a broader, more complex skill encompassing art and science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. It requires ingenuity, creativity, and good instincts gained through experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. Effective programmers often spend more time removing code than writing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

## [[risks_and_potential_success_stories_of_vibe_coding | Risks and Potential Success Stories of Vibe Coding]]
[[risks_and_potential_success_stories_of_vibe_coding | Vibe coding]] without understanding the underlying code can lead to significant issues. One example cited is an individual who vibe coded a successful SaaS product with paying customers, only for internet "trolls" to exploit its vulnerabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. The product experienced random issues, maxed-out API usage, subscription bypasses, and random database entries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>, ultimately leading to its permanent shutdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

Despite such failures, when executed properly, [[risks_and_potential_success_stories_of_vibe_coding | vibe coding]] has the potential for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. The emergence of a "billion-dollar business that runs entirely on Vibes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>, likely built with tools like Vzero, Bolt, and AI IDEs such as Cursor and Windserve, is anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

## [[tools_and_techniques_for_effective_vibe_coding | Tools and techniques for effective vibe coding]]
For those looking to "vibe max" their code with AI tools, three rules are recommended:

### Rule 1: Choose a Popular, Simple Tech Stack
LLMs perform best at solving problems that have already been addressed on platforms like GitHub and Stack Overflow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. For web development, a stack like React, Express, Tailwind, Redis, and Deno is ideal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. While specific preferences may vary (e.g., Vue.js and Nux have shown good vibe coding results), using lesser-known or experimental frameworks can hinder the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

### Rule 2: Get Good at Git
This rule is non-negotiable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. When AI generates or modifies code, it can unpredictably delete working code, which is almost impossible to prompt back into existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. Discipline in using version control, such as Git, allows developers to stash "good working code" safely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. Tools like Claude Code can even "vibe commit" code automatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

### Rule 3: Act as a Product Manager for Your AI
The most crucial rule is to "ask not what your AI can do for you, but what can you do for your AI?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. Developers should shift from being coders to product managers, breaking down complex requirements into small, highly specific steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. Providing proper context, such as recent documentation and UI design images, helps the AI solve problems deterministically rather than creatively, which is generally undesirable for code generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

## Conclusion
While the ability to vibe code offers a new level of power, relying solely on vibes remains a risky proposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. Peter Levelvels's Flight Simulator, despite its success, had issues and likely benefited from his many years of foundational development experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

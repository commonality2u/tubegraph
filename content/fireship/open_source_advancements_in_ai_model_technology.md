The landscape of [[developments_in_artificial_intelligence_and_aipowered_tools|AI technology]] has seen significant shifts, with [[open_source_ai_models|open-source AI models]] increasingly challenging established proprietary systems. A notable development is the emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese-developed AI model, and its impact on the [[marketing_and_hype_surrounding_ai_advancements|AI landscape]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## DeepSeek's Emergence and Impact
DeepSeek, developed by a Chinese hedge fund, is described as a state-of-the-art reasoning model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. It reportedly surpassed OpenAI's models and was trained for a cost of only $5.5 million, subsequently being made available to the world with a 100% discount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This development was seen as devastating to Big Tech, particularly OpenAI, which has promoted the idea that [[developments_in_artificial_intelligence_and_aipowered_tools|AI]] development is complex and requires massive investments like $500 billion Stargate data centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Accusations of IP Theft and Distillation
Following DeepSeek's release, OpenAI reportedly accused DeepSeek of IP theft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. David Sachs, a White House AI advisor and PayPal Mafia member, claimed substantial evidence that DeepSeek stole OpenAI's outputs to fine-tune their models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. This technique is known as "distillation," where a large, expensive model's outputs are used to transfer knowledge to a smaller model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. OpenAI's terms of service strictly forbid this practice for building rival models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

### The Irony of Accusations
There is notable irony in OpenAI's accusations, given their own history of vacuuming up copyrighted materials from the internet without explicit permission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. OpenAI has faced lawsuits from figures like Elon Musk and George R.R. Martin, among many others, for scraping data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. Despite these legal battles, OpenAI has largely prevailed in copyright infringement cases, illustrating a "tech bro founder secret" of engaging in "shady stuff" and seeking forgiveness later, as a company that reaches critical mass is hard to stop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

### Evidence and Distillation Practices
As of January 29th, 2025, no hard evidence of DeepSeek's alleged distillation has been provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. However, screenshots circulating online show DeepSeek providing responses that might have originated from ChatGPT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. Microsoft, which provides servers for much of OpenAI's compute, has observed someone in China extracting large volumes of data from the OpenAI API, believing these accounts may be linked to DeepSeek <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

Distillation itself is not controversial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. DeepSeek has models distilled from other prominent models like Llama and Qwen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. It generally provides better results compared to reinforcement learning, which involves feeding new data with a reward function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. Distilling OpenAI models is permissible as long as the API is not used to build a rival model, which appears to be the core of OpenAI's concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

## DeepSeek's Technical Innovations
DeepSeek achieved 10x better efficiency than other models partly by not using CUDA, Nvidia's proprietary platform for running code on a GPU <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. Instead, they directly used Nvidia parallel thread execution, a method conceptually similar to building a website with assembly code, demonstrating the advanced skills of DeepSeek's engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

## [[rise_of_chinese_ai_models_and_the_impact_on_the_ai_landscape|Rise of Chinese AI Models]]
Beyond DeepSeek, other significant [[open_source_ai_models|open-source AI models]] from China have emerged:
*   **Qwen 2.5 Max:** Released by Alibaba, this [[open_source_ai_models|open model]] reportedly outperforms DeepSeek, Claude, and GPT-4o on various benchmarks, though it is not primarily a reasoning model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.
*   **Kim 1.5:** Another Chinese model that has recently come out, it is said to beat OpenAI 01 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

These developments suggest a "China versus China AI race," with the United States seemingly falling behind in this specific area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

## [[opensource_ai_image_generators|Open-Source AI Image Generators]]
DeepSeek also released the Jan series models, which are diffusion-based [[opensource_ai_image_generators|image generation]] tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. While their quality may not yet match Stable Diffusion or Midjourney, they represent another commercially usable [[open_source_ai_models|open-source model]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. This follows a previous accusation by Midjourney against Stability AI for image theft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

## Privacy and the [[future_developments_and_expectations_for_ai_technology|Future of Open Source AI]]
A criticism of using DeepSeek on the web is that prompts, data, and keystrokes are sent to China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. For those concerned about privacy, the recommendation is to [[using_ai_models_locally|use AI models locally]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. The overarching trend observed is that [[open_source_ai_models|open source is winning]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. This presents a significant opportunity for developers to build products using [[open_source_ai_models|open-source tools]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

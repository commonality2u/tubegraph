From: [[fireship]] <br/> 

The advent of AI and robotics continues a historical trend of technology replacing human labor in various sectors. Historically, jobs like farm work, car manufacturing, and even fast-food preparation have seen [[impact_of_robots_in_workplaces | robots]] take over tasks previously performed by humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This pattern has now extended to fields once considered secure from automation, such as programming.

## The Rise of AI in Programming

Once touted as the "new literacy" where "everyone needs to Learn Python" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>, programming is now facing significant changes due to AI. Initial tools like Co-pilot began writing some code, and GPT-4 followed, writing a lot more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. The recent emergence of AI tools like Devon has intensified discussions about the [[future_of_programming_with_ai | future of programming]] and the [[implications_of_ai_advancements_on_different_professions | impact of AI advancements on different professions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Devon: The First AI Software Engineer

Developed by Cognition Labs, Devon is presented as the "first AI software engineer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. This AI has access to the same developer tools as human engineers, including a terminal, browser, and code editor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Its capabilities include:
*   Responding to requirements with a plan of action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
*   Accessing web resources for API documentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
*   Writing and running code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
*   Fixing errors in an "infinite Loop" until the problem is solved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   Learning new technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   Building and deploying applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
*   Fixing bugs in existing codebases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.
*   Training its own AI models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

Devon's operation is similar to tools like Auto GPT, leveraging a Large Language Model (LLM) to perform actions and react to feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. The company behind Devon, Cognition, is backed by significant investors from Silicon Valley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

## Performance and Future Outlook

On the Software Engineering Benchmark, a test evaluating AI's ability to solve real-world GitHub issues, Devon currently achieves a success rate of 13.86%, significantly outperforming GPT-4's 1.74% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. While this is a substantial improvement, it is not yet sufficient to replace most software engineers today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

However, the capabilities are rapidly evolving. Tools like Google's AlphaCoder can already beat 85% of competitive programmers by generating thousands of possible solutions in parallel and selecting the best one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Devon is also already undertaking "real jobs on Upwork" and earning payment for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

The sentiment among some software engineers is one of fear, with many "absolutely terrified begging the developers of Devon to stop what they're doing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. This reflects concerns about the [[impact_of_ai_on_coding_and_programming_skills | impact of AI on coding and programming skills]] and the [[future_implications_of_deepthinking_ai_models_on_programming_jobs | future implications of deepthinking AI models on programming jobs]]. Silicon Valley investors are openly aiming to replace programmers, recognizing the vast financial gains for whoever achieves this first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

## Limitations and Perspectives

Despite advancements, some argue that these technologies might be overhyped, similar to the unfulfilled promises of self-driving cars or 3D printing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. Currently, AI tools are very useful for simple problems but can become "counterproductive" and "hurt your code more than helping it" when dealing with complex issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

However, prominent figures like Jensen Huang believe that AI will enable a future where "nobody has to program" and "everybody in the world is now a programmer" through AI's capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. This vision suggests a fundamental shift in the [[impact_of_ai_on_job_markets_and_education | impact of AI on job markets and education]], where traditional programming skills may become archaic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>.

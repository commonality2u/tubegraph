The release of GPT 4.5 has been described as "underwhelming," suggesting that the [[marketing_and_hype_surrounding_ai_advancements | AI hype train]] has been put "on life support" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Despite being touted as the most expensive AI model ever produced, GPT 4.5 reportedly "fails to crush any benchmarks, win any awards or offer any novel capabilities whatsoever" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Its primary selling point is an ability to "chat in a more natural human-like way," described as "Vibes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Underwhelming Performance and Cost

While acknowledged as a "good model," GPT 4.5 is deemed "not good enough to feed the [[marketing_and_hype_surrounding_ai_advancements | AI hype monster]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This has led to the observation that humanity might be headed towards a "sigmoid of sorrow" rather than a "technological singularity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, notably did not attend the product launch, sending interns to demo it instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

GPT 4.5 is "extremely expensive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Its cost is five times that of Claude, priced at $75 per million input tokens and $150 per million output tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Currently, it is only accessible to Pro users who pay $200 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

### Limitations of GPT 4.5

Despite OpenAI's claim of a new "Vibes Benchmark" to measure creative thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>, and a far lower hallucination rate, the model still makes "a lot of silly mistakes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. It is not self-aware, has no knowledge of its own existence as GPT 4.5, and states its training cut-off as October 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

For programming and science tasks, GPT 4.5 is not expected to perform as well as "deep thinking models" like 03 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. On the AER polyglot coding benchmark, it is worse at programming than DeepSeek while being hundreds of times more expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

### Shifting Expectations for GPT 5

Currently, xAI's Grok is considered the best model globally, according to betting markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. While OpenAI is still favored to have the best model by the end of 2025, its odds are declining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. This is problematic for OpenAI as it raises billions of dollars during its transition to a for-profit entity, requiring a massive valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

The theory suggests that OpenAI "failed to train GPT 5 with any significant improvement" despite scaling up parameters and compute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. GPT 4.5 is their largest model to date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. Sam Altman has described GPT 5 as being "more like a router that automatically chooses the best model based on your prompt," which is considered "highly disappointing" given earlier [[skepticism_about_ai_achieving_general_intelligence | expectations for AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

> "I was expecting to be a post-apocalyptic warlord by now the battling robots and barbecuing rats over burning garbage cans for dinner but instead I live in this dystopia where artificial super intelligence never comes and nothing ever happens" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>

## Regulatory and Developmental Context

In 2023, tech leaders signed a [[concerns_and_petitions_against_ai_development | petition to stop training big models]] like GPT 4.5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. Sam Altman himself "begged the government to regulate it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

The current plateau in AI development is seen as positive news for computer science students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. AI coding tools are useful, but primarily to "real human programmers who know what they're doing," a situation not expected to change soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

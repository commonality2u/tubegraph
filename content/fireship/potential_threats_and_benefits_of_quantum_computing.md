## Introduction to Quantum Computing's Impact

[[quantum_computing_advancements | Quantum Computing advancements]] are rapidly progressing, with new chips like Google's Willow demonstrating the ability to solve certain problems septillions of times faster than traditional supercomputers like El Capitan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. For example, a problem taking Willow five minutes to compute would take El Capitan more years than the age of the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. This rapid advancement signifies a potential paradigm shift in computing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

## Potential Benefits

The [[future_prospects_of_computing_technology | future prospects of computing technology]] with [[potential_impact_of_quantum_computing_advances_on_future_technology | quantum computing advances]] could be transformative, potentially leading to a "Utopia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. This could include:
*   Unlocking [[future_prospects_of_computing_technology | Fusion Energy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
*   Advancing to artificial super intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
*   Achieving immortality through nanorobot doctors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

## Potential Threats

Conversely, [[potential_impact_of_quantum_computing_on_encryption_and_security | quantum computing]] also poses an existential threat to humanity due to its immense speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

### Encryption and Security Risks
Current "unbreakable" encryption algorithms, such as RSA-encrypted communications, could be rendered worthless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. A hacker equipped with a quantum computer could:
*   Instantly brute-force RSA-encrypted communications on the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   Crack cryptocurrency wallet seed phrases and steal digital assets like tokens and NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
*   The Shor's algorithm, known since the 1990s, could find prime factors in large numbers much faster than classical computers, posing a direct threat to widely used encryption systems like RSA when quantum hardware becomes sufficiently advanced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. It is theorized that around 2,000 qubits, quantum computers could break these systems using brute-force techniques that would take classical computers millions or billions of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

## Current Limitations

Despite breakthroughs from Google and China, quantum computing technology is still far from being practical for widespread use today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Key [[challenges_in_quantum_computing_and_error_rates | challenges in quantum computing and error rates]] include:
*   **Delicate Qubits**: Qubits are extremely fragile and prone to errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. They require constant error correction to maintain stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
*   **Extreme Temperatures**: Quantum chips must be maintained at temperatures near absolute zero to function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. This makes devices like an "Apple quantum phone" currently infeasible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.
*   **Coherence Time**: Qubits can only maintain their state of superposition for a very short duration. While Google's Willow chip has increased this to 100 microseconds, up from about 20 microseconds, this is still a limited time for computations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. Google's next milestone is to build a long-lived logical qubit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

The true inflection point for quantum computers, allowing them to scale exponentially and change the world, depends on significantly lowering the error rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

On November 24th, 2024, an attack was launched against "The Real World," previously known as Andrew Tate's Hustler's University <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This [[data_breach_at_andrew_tates_hustlers_university | non-consensual penetration]] resulted in the exposure of 14 GB of data, including course content, and the usernames and emails of over 700,000 members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. The [[hackers_and_their_motivations_for_targeting_the_internet_archive | hackers]] characterized the website as "hilariously insecure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Scope of the Data Breach

The hack exposed 795,000 usernames and email addresses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. This data was subsequently published on dss.com, a non-profit organization dedicated to analyzing hack data sets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. Members of the Hustler's University alumni can check if their data was compromised on haveibeenpwned.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

In addition to user data, the breach also included the [[content_of_leaked_data_from_chat_rooms | contents of public and private chat rooms]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. These chat discussions covered topics such as AI automation, content creation, health and fitness, and cryptocurrency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

## Website Technology and Security Vulnerabilities

Private research into the website's tech stack indicated the use of TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, WebSockets, and REST <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. The application also utilized a desktop wrapper and Capacitor for iOS and Android, which enables web apps to run in a web view on mobile platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. While Next.js was used for the main signup page, the core application employed Vite and ReactJS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

The backend services were likely hosted via DNS prefetch links <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. Server responses indicated Cloudflare, and a 404 page contained the text "rocket," suggesting the use of the Rocket Rust framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. It was revealed that the platform uses a closed-source fork of Revolt chat, an open-source platform whose developer accused Tate of software theft by violating their AGPL license in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. The [[hackers_and_their_motivations_for_targeting_the_internet_archive | hackers]] were able to bypass authentication on the API, potentially aided by the un-obfuscated frontend JavaScript bundle, which included all code comments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

## Hackers' Message and Impact

The most notable aspect of the incident was the [[hackers_and_their_motivations_for_targeting_the_internet_archive | hackers']] actions after gaining access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. They entered the University's primary chat room and flooded it with emojis, including the transgender flag and a feminist fist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. They also posted images of Andrew Tate himself wearing a rainbow flag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. This occurred while Tate was live streaming on Rumble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

The incident is considered an embarrassment for Tate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. The primary victims are the 800,000 "graduates" whose diplomas from Hustler's University are now deemed "worthless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

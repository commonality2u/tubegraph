[[Overview of C Sharp Language|C#]] is a statically typed, general-purpose programming language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It was created in 2000 by Anders Hejlsberg at Microsoft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>, initially designed as a modern C-like [[C Sharp in Object Oriented and Functional Programming|object-oriented language]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. While initially criticized as an imitation of Java, it has evolved into a popular and well-loved language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Core Characteristics

*   **Type System**
    *   Statically typed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.
    *   Variables are declared with a type, followed by a name and value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
    *   Values cannot be `null` by default, but can be made nullable by adding a question mark to the type <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
*   **Memory Management**
    *   It is a memory-safe language due to garbage collection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
    *   It is possible to create an "unsafe" context to allocate custom memory using pointers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
*   **Compilation and Execution**
    *   [[Compiling and Executing C Sharp Code|C# code]] is compiled into an intermediate language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
    *   This intermediate language is interpreted by the Common Language Runtime (CLR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
    *   The CLR executes the code as native machine code on any operating system without the need for recompilation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.
    *   The `.NET run` command is used to [[Compiling and Executing C Sharp Code|compile and execute]] code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
*   **Open Source**
    *   [[Overview of C Sharp Language|C#]] became open-source software in 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>, allowing it to build applications outside of the [[C Sharp and NET Framework|.NET Framework]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Programming Paradigms and Constructs

*   **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
    *   Primarily known as an [[C Sharp in Object Oriented and Functional Programming|object-oriented language]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.
    *   Code is organized by wrapping it in a namespace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
    *   Classes can be created inside a namespace, supporting:
        *   Constructors for instantiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.
        *   Destructors for when the class goes out of scope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.
        *   Inheritance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
        *   Polymorphism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
    *   Properties can be defined on a class and made readable with `get` or writable with `set` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
    *   The language does not have top-level functions, but rather methods defined as members of a class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
*   **Functional Programming (FP)**
    *   Supports functional Lambda expressions and other [[C Sharp in Object Oriented and Functional Programming|functional programming patterns]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
    *   Anonymous functions are also supported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
*   **Language Integrated Query (LINQ)**
    *   A feature called LINQ enables writing declarative queries on any data structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
*   **Asynchronous Programming**
    *   Supports a task-based asynchronous pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
    *   Allows writing non-blocking code using `async` and `await` syntax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

## Applications and Usage

[[Applications and usage of C|C# can be used to build almost anything]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>, including:

*   Desktop applications on .NET Core <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
*   Cross-platform mobile applications with Xamarin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.
*   Web applications with Blazor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
*   Video games with the Unity framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

[[C#]] is famous for being the workhorse of the [[C Sharp and NET Framework|.NET framework]] on [[Windows as an operating system for programmers|Windows]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

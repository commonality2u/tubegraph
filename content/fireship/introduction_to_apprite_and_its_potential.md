Apprite is an open-source backend solution designed for web and mobile developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. It offers similar infrastructure components to other Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) platforms like Supabase and nHost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.

## Features

Apprite provides SDKs for both web and mobile platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>, including:
*   Authentication methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>
*   Database management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>

### Database
Apprite's database is a NoSQL document database, similar to [[mongodb_realm | MongoDB]] or [[introduction_to_firebase_and_benefits | Firebase]]'s Firestore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. Interestingly, it is built upon MariaDB, which is a relational database and a fork of MySQL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. This means Apprite provides a NoSQL API interface to interact with a traditional SQL database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.

### Developer Experience
The platform offers easy-to-use one-liners in its SDKs for authentication and database management, similar to other BaaS solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. However, it does not currently support [[introduction_to_graphql | GraphQL]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.

## Hosting and Pricing

As of the video's publication, Apprite is not yet a commercial product, meaning users need to self-host it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. Self-hosting can be done with a one-click install on DigitalOcean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. Being free and open-source, Apprite eliminates concerns about vendor lock-in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. However, the speaker notes that open-source solutions can sometimes be more expensive in practice without a commercial entity supporting them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

Apprite plans to release a fully managed service called Apprite Cloud in the near future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

## Popularity

While the JavaScript SDK for Apprite does not have a large number of downloads, its Docker image has over 5 million pulls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

## Potential

Apprite is considered a tool with significant potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

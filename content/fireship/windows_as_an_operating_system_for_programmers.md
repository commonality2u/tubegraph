From: [[fireship]] <br/> 

The choice of operating system (OS) is a significant decision for programmers, as it impacts thousands of hours spent working and can subtly influence one's subconscious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Opting for Windows can be seen as joining the "Windows Collective hive mind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Historical Experience

The speaker's first professional programming job involved being assigned a Windows machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. This experience introduced them to technologies like Java and Oracle database, used for building websites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Initial Setup and User Experience

Developing on Windows can be a "pain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. The Windows Pro version costs $199 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. Upon installation, the system attempts to sell "crapware" like Microsoft Office and OneDrive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. Users are required to log into a Microsoft account, which is perceived as enabling surveillance and continuous attempts to resell software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

Windows incorporates "artificial intelligence everywhere," with a need for "co-pilot just to manage all your co-pilots" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. Unlike Unix-based systems, Windows uses backslashes for file paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. The system frequently shuts down for updates, sometimes daily or bi-daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.

## Historical Stance on Open Source

Microsoft's past strategy regarding open-source software involved an "embrace, extend, extinguish" approach in the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. Former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer notably referred to Linux as "a cancer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.

## Modern Windows for Development

Despite past animosity, Microsoft has changed its approach to win over developers, aiming to be "less like Windows and more like Linux" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. The speaker, who "hates Microsoft," acknowledges using Microsoft's developer tools and services, including [[programming_tools_and_software_preferences | Microsoft VS Code]], Microsoft Typescript, Microsoft GitHub, Microsoft npm packages, and Microsoft Azure, all from a Microsoft Windows machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.

### Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)

A key feature for developers on Windows is the [[windows_subsystem_for_linux | Windows Subsystem for Linux]] (WSL) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. WSL allows users to run a full Linux distribution within Windows, rather than an emulated version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. This provides "the best of both worlds," enabling the use of preferred Linux terminal applications and even Linux GUI applications like VLC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. WSL has largely eliminated the need for dual-booting Windows and Linux <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. While not perfect and occasionally slow, it is considered an "awesome feature" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.

## Hardware Flexibility

A significant advantage of Windows over Mac OS is its hardware flexibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. Although proprietary, Windows can be installed on any hardware, allowing users to easily upgrade components such as RAM, CPU, and GPU <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

## Recommendation for Programmers

Windows is considered an optimal choice for programmers who are not rich and have a social life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.

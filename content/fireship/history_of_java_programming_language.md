Java is a high-level, multi-paradigm programming language, renowned for its ability to compile to platform-independent bytecode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Origins and Early Development

Java was designed by James Gosling in 1990 at Sun Microsystems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. One of its earliest demonstrations was on the Star 7 PDA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. This demonstration also marked the birth of Java's mascot, Duke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Technical Innovation: Platform Independence

What made Java innovative was its approach to compilation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. Instead of compiling directly to machine code, like [[history_and_origins_of_c_programming_language | C]] or C++ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, Java compiles to bytecode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. This bytecode can then run on any operating system without the need for recompilation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. This platform independence is achieved by executing the code with the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

Java is unique in that it functions as both a compiled and an interpreted language simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. For a computer to run Java programs, it only needs to have the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed, which is common on most systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This core principle leads to the developer motto: "write once, run anywhere" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## Language Characteristics

Java is a strongly typed language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a> and features a curly brace syntax similar to the [[history_and_origins_of_c_programming_language | C family]] of languages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. However, it offers more high-level features compared to C, including garbage collection, runtime type checking, and reflection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

Initially designed with a strong object-oriented paradigm, Java has evolved to support functional patterns, such as anonymous Lambda methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

## Modern Day Popularity and Applications

Today, Java stands as one of the world's most popular programming languages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Its versatility allows it to power a wide range of applications:
*   **Enterprise Web Apps**: Utilized with frameworks like Spring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>
*   **Big Data Pipelines**: Used with technologies such as Hadoop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>
*   **Mobile Apps**: The foundational language for apps on the Android platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>
*   **Specialized Systems**: Even controls for systems like NASA's Maestro Mars Rover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>

## Basic Program Structure and Execution

To begin developing in Java, one needs to install the Java Development Kit (JDK) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. Every Java program starts with a class, and the class name must match the file name, which ends in `.java` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. A class is required to have a `main` method, as this is where the program's execution begins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

Inside a method, variables are defined by first specifying their type, followed by a name and a value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. Output to the standard output can be achieved using the built-in `System` class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. Functions are defined as methods within a class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. The `public` keyword signifies that a method can be used outside its class, and `static` means it's a member of the class itself rather than an instance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. Developers can define custom classes, which act as blueprints for objects, and add attributes and methods to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. Objects are instantiated from classes using the `new` keyword <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

Once a program is finished, a compiler is used to generate a `.class` file, which contains the bytecode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. The `java` command then instructs the JVM to interpret and run this file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

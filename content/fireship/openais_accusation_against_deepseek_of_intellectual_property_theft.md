Following [[deepseek_r1_vs_ai_giants | DeepSeek's]] emergence and alleged surpassing of OpenAI's models, OpenAI has reportedly accused DeepSeek of intellectual property (IP) theft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This accusation comes after [[deepseek_r1_vs_ai_giants | DeepSeek]], a model developed by a Chinese hedge fund, reportedly built a state-of-the-art reasoning model for only $5.5 million and then made it available to the public for free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. This development was particularly "devastating" for Big Tech, especially [[openais_response_to_competition | OpenAI]], which has been advocating for the necessity of large-scale, expensive infrastructure like the proposed $500 billion Stargate data centers for AI development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## The Core Accusation: Distillation

The new White House AI adviser and PayPal Mafia member David Sachs publicly stated that there is "substantial evidence" that [[deepseek_r1_vs_ai_giants | DeepSeek]] "stole" OpenAI's outputs to fine-tune its models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. This technique is known as **distillation**, and it is "strictly forbidden" by OpenAI's terms of service if used to build a rival model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:27">[02:00:27]</a>.

Distillation involves taking a large, expensive model (like OpenAI's [[comparison_of_deep_seek_r1_and_openai_o1_models | 01]]) and using its outputs to transfer knowledge to a smaller model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>. While distillation itself is not controversial and is commonly used—DeepSeek, for instance, has models distilled from Llama and Qwen—OpenAI's concern arises when their API is used to build a direct rival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.

## Evidence and Counterarguments

OpenAI and Microsoft, which provides servers for much of OpenAI's compute, have accused [[deepseek_r1_vs_ai_giants | DeepSeek]] of distillation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>. While "hard evidence" has yet to be provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>, screenshots circulating online show [[deepseek_r1_vs_ai_giants | DeepSeek]] providing responses that appear unique to ChatGPT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>. However, this is not considered a "smoking gun" as such content is widely available on the internet, meaning [[deepseek_r1_vs_ai_giants | DeepSeek]] could have learned it "organically" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>.

Microsoft has stated they observed "someone in China extracting large volumes of data from the OpenAI API," and they believe these accounts may be linked to [[deepseek_r1_vs_ai_giants | DeepSeek]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>.

## The Irony of the Accusation

Commentators have pointed out the "palpable irony" in OpenAI's accusation of IP theft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>. OpenAI itself has faced numerous lawsuits and accusations for "vacuuming up the entire internet and all its copyrighted materials without asking anybody for permission" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:00">[00:53:00]</a>. Notable examples include Elon Musk accusing them of scraping Twitter, and George R.R. Martin along with other authors suing the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a>.

Despite these [[legal_challenges_faced_by_the_internet_archive_and_open_library | legal challenges]], OpenAI has "mostly prevailed" in its copyright infringement legal battles so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>. This aligns with a perceived "tech bro founder secret" of engaging in "shady stuff" and seeking forgiveness later, as companies reaching "critical mass" are difficult to stop, with Uber and Airbnb cited as prime examples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>.

## Broader Context: The AI Race and Open Source

The accusation against [[deepseek_r1_vs_ai_giants | DeepSeek]] unfolds amidst an accelerating AI race, particularly between China and the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>. Alibaba recently released Qwen 2.5 Max, an open model that reportedly outperforms [[deepseek_r1_vs_ai_giants | DeepSeek]], Claude, and GPT-4o on benchmarks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>. Additionally, another Chinese model, Kim 1.5, has emerged, apparently beating [[comparison_of_deep_seek_r1_and_openai_o1_models | OpenAI 01]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.

### DeepSeek's Innovations

Beyond the IP dispute, [[deepseek_r1_vs_ai_giants | DeepSeek]] is notable for achieving "10x better efficiency" than other models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>. This was partly achieved by *not* using CUDA, Nvidia's proprietary platform for running code on a GPU <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>. Instead, [[deepseek_r1_vs_ai_giants | DeepSeek]] engineers directly used Nvidia parallel thread execution, which is compared conceptually to building a website with assembly code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>.

[[deepseeks_side_project_success | DeepSeek]] has also released the Jan series models for diffusion-based image generation, providing another open-source model available for commercial use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>. While the quality may not match Stable Diffusion or Midjourney, its open-source nature is seen as beneficial for humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>.

### Censorship and Privacy

Some have criticized [[deepseek_r1_vs_ai_giants | DeepSeek]] for being "highly censored," though it is "relatively easy to jailbreak" for experienced prompt engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>. A major criticism is that when using [[deepseek_r1_vs_ai_giants | DeepSeek]] on the web, prompts, data, and keystrokes are sent to China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>. However, for those concerned about privacy, using the model locally is suggested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

The overriding trend highlighted by these developments is the increasing prevalence and success of open-source models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.

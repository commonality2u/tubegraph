The landscape of coding and software development is undergoing a rapid transformation due to the emergence of powerful [[developments_in_artificial_intelligence_and_aipowered_tools | AI tools]]. As of March 2023, GitHub announced Copilot X, a next-generation coding assistant powered by GPT-4, which is expected to make its predecessor "look like a child's toy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## General Impact on Developers

[[role_and_value_of_ai_tools_in_programming | AI tools]] are seen as "anabolic steroids" for developers, providing a significant advantage to those who use them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. It is anticipated that within the next two years, nearly all professional coders will be utilizing these tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

While some developers and students may feel pessimistic, realizing that open-source code, Stack Overflow answers, and tutorials have been used to build large language models now automating [[impact_of_ai_on_traditional_jobs | white-collar jobs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>, the general sentiment among some is optimistic. [[future_of_programming_with_ai | Programming]] is not considered dead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>, and these tools are believed to make programmers more powerful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. [[developments_in_artificial_intelligence_and_aipowered_tools | AI]] still requires human programmers to deliver great products to end-users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>, but with [[role_and_value_of_ai_tools_in_programming | AI tooling]], developers will be able to build systems approximately ten times faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. This period is referred to as the "great [[developments_in_artificial_intelligence_and_aipowered_tools | AI]] inflection point of 2023" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## Microsoft's Dominance in the AI Space

Microsoft is currently dominating the [[developments_in_artificial_intelligence_and_aipowered_tools | AI]] tool space with a rapid release of new products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Their recent releases include Bing Chat, Copilot for Office, Bing Image Generator, and Copilot X <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. This strong position is attributed to Microsoft's long-term strategy, which includes maintaining Bing despite years of criticism, acquiring GitHub, and making a significant investment in OpenAI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. Within a single week, their products appeared years ahead of the competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

## Key Features of GitHub Copilot X

GitHub Copilot X is currently in technical preview and not yet available for public use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. It is expected to offer at least five game-changing features:

### 1. Built-in Chat Window
This feature will allow developers to highlight code blocks and ask for explanations, refactoring suggestions, or unit test generation directly within their Integrated Development Environment (IDE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. Unlike general-purpose chatbots, this feature will be highly specialized for coding problems and will understand the context of the user's actual codebase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. GPT-4's ability to handle 25,000 tokens (compared to GPT-3.5's 3,000) contributes to this capability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

### 2. Copilot for Documentation
Instead of manually searching documentation or Stack Overflow, this feature will generate answers and tutorials based on specific library documentation, including React, Azure, and MDN <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

### 3. Voice-Activated Copilot
This feature will enable developers to control VS Code and write code entirely through voice commands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. The need for extremely fast typing skills will become less critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. It offers the benefit of writing code when traditional typing is not feasible, such as during exercise or commuting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. While keyboards won't become obsolete, this could revolutionize workflows similar to how voice assistants changed household interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

### 4. Copilot for Pull Requests
Copilot will be able to generate descriptions for pull requests based on the code changes made, streamlining the contribution process for important projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

### 5. Copilot CLI
[[role_and_value_ai_tools_in_programming | AI]] autocompletion will extend to the terminal (CLI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. This means developers will no longer need to memorize endless Linux commands. They can simply describe what they want to do with a library (e.g., ffmpeg), and Copilot will generate the command along with an explanation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

## Future Outlook

While GitHub Copilot X is still months away from public consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>, its potential [[future_implications_of_ai_in_programming | impact on programming jobs]] is significant. Some have humorously suggested "poisoning the training data" on GitHub to preserve traditional programming roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. The advancements in [[developments_in_artificial_intelligence_and_aipowered_tools | AI]] are built upon billions of lines of code written by programmers over the last three decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>, a fact that presents a "cruel irony" given that many contributors were Linux users who traditionally disliked Microsoft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

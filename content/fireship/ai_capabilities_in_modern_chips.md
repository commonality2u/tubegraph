Modern computing technology is experiencing a significant shift towards integrating advanced artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities directly into chips. This trend is driven by an "arms race" among major tech companies to develop the most powerful and efficient processors for [[AI advancements and industry challenges | AI workloads]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Apple's M4 Chip and Neural Engine
[[Apples M4 chip unveiling | Apple's M4 chip]], unveiled recently, is touted as a significant advancement in computing technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Key features include:
*   **Performance:** Its CPU is 50% faster than the M2 chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
*   **Ray Tracing:** It features built-in Ray tracing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.
*   **Neural Engine:** The M4's neural engine can handle 38 trillion operations per second (TOPS), positioning it as the fastest chip for [[AI advancements and industry challenges | AI workloads]] in the PC market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
*   **Strategic Unveiling:** Apple chose to unveil the M4 at its iPad event rather than its Worldwide Developer Conference, which was only a month away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

Apple's quiet approach in the broader [[AI advancements and industry challenges | AI race]] suggests a strategy focused on running large language models (LLMs) on-device or "on the edge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. This approach offers several user benefits:
*   Offline functionality for LLMs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   Reduced latency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
*   Enhanced privacy by keeping chat messages with AI models private on the device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

## The AI Chip Competition
The chip industry is currently engaged in a global "arms race" to build the best ARM-based chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. While Apple currently leads with the M4, its lead might not last long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Major players like Samsung, [[Googles Willow chip and its capabilities | Google]], Microsoft, and even Intel are actively participating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

### ARM vs. x86 Architecture
Historically, personal computers used CPUs based on the x86 architecture, primarily from Intel or AMD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. x86 utilizes a complex instruction set, offering versatility and speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. However, smartphones adopted ARM processors, which use a reduced instruction set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. ARM requires fewer transistors per instruction, making it more power-efficientâ€”a critical feature for battery-powered devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

The perception that ARM wasn't optimal for regular computers changed in 2020 with Apple's release of the M1 chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. This chip made Apple laptops faster, quieter, and more power-efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. This success motivated Microsoft to launch Project Volterra, aiming to run Windows on ARM chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. Data centers, such as AWS, have also recognized the efficiency of ARM chips in the cloud, leading Amazon, Google, and Microsoft to develop their own ARM chips for data centers (e.g., AWS Graviton and Google Axion) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

The company behind the ARM architecture designs the architecture but does not manufacture chips; instead, it licenses the designs to companies like Apple, whose chips are then manufactured by facilities like Taiwan Semiconductor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

### Key Competitors and Their AI Chips
*   **Qualcomm:** Expected to release the Snapdragon X Elite chip, which could potentially outperform the M4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. This chip is slated to power Windows on Surface laptops and claims to achieve 45 trillion operations per second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. The fierce competition in TOPS numbers stems from the belief that the device capable of running the best AI model natively will be the most sought-after product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.
*   **Intel:** Despite the rise of ARM, x86 technology, having been around for over 45 years, remains deeply embedded in modern infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. Leaked documents indicate Intel's new Arrow Lake processor, built to consume less power, could potentially handle over 100 trillion operations per second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
*   **AMD:** Is also entering the fray with new offerings such as the Ryzen AI 9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

The increasing focus on AI is leading to a trend where companies maximize "AI cringe level" in their branding to win the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

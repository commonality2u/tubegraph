The [[How a CPU Works | Central Processing Unit]] (CPU) functions as the "brain" or "engine" of a computer, acting like a sophisticated calculator to run applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Software written in languages like JavaScript or Python is converted into machine code, which is then executed by the [[How a CPU Works | CPU]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Transistors

A [[How a CPU Works | CPU]] is an intricate piece of metal and silicon containing billions of tiny **transistors** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. These transistors act as "on/off" switches, representing the binary values of ones and zeros that form the basis of all digital information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Modern chips contain billions of transistors that can switch on and off billions of times per second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Logic Gates

To perform mathematical calculations and other computational tasks, a [[How a CPU Works | CPU]] combines multiple transistors to form **logic gates** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. These gates process binary inputs to produce specific binary outputs. For example, an AND logic gate requires two binary inputs to both be "true" (or 1) to produce a "true" output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. Even highly complex computational problems can be solved using combinations of just a few basic logic gates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

The state of the [[How a CPU Works | CPU]] is synchronized by an oscillator called the clock generator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. The more pulses the clock can generate per second, the faster the [[How a CPU Works | CPU]] can compute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. This speed is typically measured in gigahertz (GHz) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

[[googles_response_to_gpt_4_with_gemini | Google]] has unveiled a new quantum chip named Willow, designed to solve complex problems significantly faster than traditional supercomputers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This chip is compact enough to fit in the palm of a hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Performance and Capabilities

The Willow chip demonstrates unprecedented speed in certain computations:
*   A problem that takes Willow 5 minutes to compute would require El Capitan, the world's largest supercomputer with over 1 million CPU cores and 10 million GPU cores, more years than the age of the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.
*   Even if one had an El Capitan supercomputer for every grain of sand on Earth, powered by a Dyson Sphere around the Sun, it would still be many times slower than Willow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.
*   Willow has 105 qubits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
*   It can perform calculations like finding the prime factors in a large number much faster than classical computers, utilizing algorithms such as Shor's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

## Technical Advancements

[[comparison_between_microsofts_myer_on_a_one_and_googles_willow_chip | Willow]] introduces several key breakthroughs in quantum computing:
*   **Error Correction**: The chip can identify qubits with high error rates and reconfigure them on the fly, thereby reducing the overall error rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
*   **Exponential Improvement**: Willow is the first chip where error-corrected qubits show exponentially better performance as they scale in size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.
*   **Increased Superposition Duration**: Historically, qubits could only maintain a state of superposition for about 20 microseconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Willow has increased this duration fivefold, to 100 microseconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.
*   **Quantum Gates**: [[microsofts_new_quantum_computing_chip_and_its_significance | Quantum]] computers use quantum bits (qubits) which can represent multiple states (ones and zeros) simultaneously through quantum superposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Qubits can also become entangled, where their states are directly related regardless of physical distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. Quantum gates leverage this behavior to coordinate computations, similar to logic gates in classical computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

## Implications and Challenges

While demonstrating significant advancements, quantum computing technology, including Willow, is still in its early stages:
*   **Delicacy and Errors**: Qubits are extremely delicate and prone to errors, requiring constant error correction for stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
*   **Environmental Requirements**: These chips must be kept at temperatures near absolute zero to function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
*   **Encryption Threat**: At around 2,000 qubits, quantum computers are theoretically capable of breaking widely used encryption systems like RSA through brute-force techniques, which would take classical computers millions or billions of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.
*   **Current Usefulness**: Despite the breakthroughs, this technology is currently "nowhere near being useful" for general applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. [[Googles_exclusivity_deals_and_their_legal_consequences | Google]]'s next major goal is to develop a long-lived logical qubit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

The true inflection point for quantum computers, allowing them to scale exponentially and profoundly impact the world, will be achieved when the error rate becomes sufficiently low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

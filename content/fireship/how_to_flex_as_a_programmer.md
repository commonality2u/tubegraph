Programmers often find themselves in one of two states: imposter syndrome or a superiority complex [00:00:49]. A key way to boost one's ego as a programmer is to "flex" on other developers [00:00:44]. This article outlines practical ways to assert perceived superiority in the programming world [00:00:53].

## Types of Programming Flexes

### Complexity Flex
The idea behind the complexity flex is that while a genius admires simplicity, most people are not geniuses [00:01:04].
To perform this flex, take a simple, functional JavaScript function and:
*   Add TypeScript, advocating for end-to-end type safety [00:01:16].
*   Refactor it into a complex combination of design patterns like an Abstract Factory, Singleton, Adapter, Decorator, and Proxy [00:01:23].
*   When others fail to understand it, claim they've never seen "clean code" and should read the "Gang of Four book" [00:01:28]. This can make you appear as a "programming God" and potentially lead to a raise [00:01:31].

### Money Flex
The amount of money earned is often seen as directly tied to the value brought to the world [00:01:39]. This flex involves demonstrating higher earnings than peers. Examples include:
*   A junior developer making $50k flexing on former colleagues making $45k [00:01:42].
*   A developer making $225k flexing on a junior developer [00:01:49].
*   A Netflix engineer making $900k flexing on a $225k developer [00:01:55].
*   An early Uber engineer with a $25 million net worth flexing about being a genius technology investor [00:01:58].
*   A billionaire crypto investor who accumulated wealth by "rug pulling" (defrauding) others, flexing on all "level 1 flexors" [00:02:07].

> [!NOTE] YouTube Premium Flex
> As a specific example of the money/optimization flex, owning YouTube Premium allows for time optimization by eliminating ads and enabling offline downloads of JavaScript tutorials [00:02:19]. It also provides access to YouTube Music, potentially saving money on other streaming services [00:02:31].

### Vim Flex
Using Vim is considered to elevate a programmer to a "higher plane of Consciousness" [00:02:51]. This allows them to look down on users of other tools like VS Code, IntelliJ, and Emacs [00:02:55]. A true Vim user reportedly doesn't even use a mouse [00:03:00].

### Operating System Flex
The choice of operating system can also be a point of flex:
*   **Macintosh**: Indicates wealth, especially when combined with an Apple Vision Pro, though the latter also suggests being a "clown" [00:03:12].
*   **Linux**: Real developers use Linux [00:03:18].
    *   **Ubuntu**: Impresses most people [00:03:20].
    *   **Red Hat Enterprise Linux**: Requires paying a lot of money to IBM, showing a high level of "bowler" status [00:03:23].
    *   **Arch Linux**: The ultimate Linux flex, signaling someone who has dedicated countless hours to configuring their OS, potentially at the expense of a social life [00:03:32].
*   **Windows**: Ironically, using Windows can be the ultimate flex, suggesting the programmer has a life and potentially a girlfriend outside of [[overcoming_challenges_and_hard_work_in_programming | programming]] [00:03:46].

### GitHub Flex
A highly active GitHub commit history, resembling a solid green grid, is a key indicator of a "real programmer" who cares about open source [00:03:54]. Profiles should be adorned with numerous awards and badges, like a North Korean General [00:04:00].

#### Chainsaw PR Flex
This specific GitHub flex involves finding small, new projects from enthusiastic developers, forking their code, and removing every possible line while ensuring all tests still pass [00:04:11]. A vague pull request is then sent, explaining that the code has been "cleaned up to use best practices" [00:04:21]. This level of flexing is said to cause projects to be abandoned [00:04:24].

### Influencer/Hot Take Flex
For those less skilled in coding, becoming an influencer is an alternative [00:04:37]. This involves paying for a premium X (formerly Twitter) account and posting outrageous, disagreeable "hot takes" [00:04:40]. Giving egregiously bad advice might even elicit a reply from Elon Musk, which can then be flexed about [00:04:47].

### Past Experience Flex (FAANG)
Working at a FAANG (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google) company provides the privilege to start every sentence with "As an ex-Facebook engineer, I recommend..." [00:05:03]. This is seen as a special club everyone wants to join, despite some claiming otherwise due to their "moral compass" [00:05:10]. The implication is that those outside the club didn't "grind on LeetCode enough" [00:05:18].

### Domain Flex
For web developers, owning valuable domains can be a flex, often more valuable than a Robinhood account [00:05:25]. Domains are considered investments that can be passed down through generations, such as "best-SEO-backlink-tool.net" [00:05:30].

### The Ultimate Flex: Learning to Farm
The ultimate flex for a programmer is to reject the digital world by learning to farm, blowing up their computer, and joining the Amish [00:05:40]. Such a person becomes "invincible" to all previous flexes, as their identity is no longer tied to superficial things like code quality, GitHub stars, likes, followers, or even money [00:05:46]. This pursuit of a life closer to nature, observing the inherent intelligence of the natural world, leads to a profound realization about the insignificance of one's own existence, which is both terrifying and liberating [00:05:56]. In this context, even a spider can be seen as "flexing" [00:06:16].

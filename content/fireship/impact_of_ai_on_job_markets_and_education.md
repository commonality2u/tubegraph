The rise of generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs) is transforming the world, leading to widespread concerns about their [[impact_of_ai_on_traditional_jobs | impact on jobs]] and education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Impact on Job Markets

An OpenAI paper concluded that up to 49% of workers could have at least half of their job functions enhanced by AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This has led to calls for a pause in training AI systems more powerful than GPT-4, with over 1,000 people, including prominent figures like Steve Wozniak and Elon Musk, signing a petition to ensure AI safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

### AI's Role in Specific Professions

While AI tools like ChatGPT can perform tasks like writing and debugging code or building applications from a design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>, their effectiveness varies. ChatGPT excels at solving common problems, such as LeetCode questions, faster than humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. However, it struggles when trying to build complex systems with multiple moving parts, as large language models primarily regurgitate existing information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

The ability of AI to execute its own code, facilitated by new ChatGPT plugins, presents a significant shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. If requirements are well-defined, AI can generate tens of thousands of solutions and test them to find the optimal one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. This capability could make writing source code by hand obsolete, similar to how garbage collectors made memory management code unnecessary for many programmers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. This shift is seen as positive, enabling the creation of complex systems with greater efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

### Future Outlook for Jobs

[[future_of_programming_with_AI | AI will undoubtedly change the way programmers work in the future]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. While traditional roles like debugging Java may change, new cutting-edge jobs are expected to emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. Those with strong problem-solving and critical thinking skills, such as computer science graduates, are expected to be well-positioned to secure these new roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

Despite concerns, AI is predicted to plateau like other technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. Although AI will become highly capable at mimicking humans, it is not expected to surpass human intellect, as it is based on existing internet content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

## Impact on Education

AI is prompting many to question the value of traditional degrees, including computer science, due to AI's code-writing and debugging capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. However, degrees in history, math, gender studies, and business are also expected to be affected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

The current educational system is facing challenges, as AI tools like ChatGPT can instantaneously solve almost any assignment or quiz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. Reportedly, 89% of students are already leveraging these tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

The general sentiment suggests that real-world experience is more crucial than a degree for skill development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. For those pursuing computer science degrees, continuing on that path is advised, as it provides a solid foundation in problem-solving and critical thinking â€“ skills that will not be [[impact_of_ai_on_creative_and_technical_professions | impacted by GPTs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. Simultaneously, it is essential to learn how to leverage these new AI tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

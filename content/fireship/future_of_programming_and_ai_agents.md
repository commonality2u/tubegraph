The "elephant in the room" for aspiring programmers in early 2025 is artificial intelligence, specifically new reasoning models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## AI Reasoning Models and their Implications

OpenAI's 03 model, released in late 2024, is considered a superior programmer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Its significance lies in being the first model to perform well on the ARC AGI benchmark, designed to evaluate a model's ability to think, invent, and reason like humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. If AI can truly reason, it could [[implications_of_ai_advancements_on_different_professions | impact many white-collar jobs]], especially programming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

Despite claims of artificial general intelligence (AGI), there are reasons to be skeptical of the 03 model's current capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>:
*   It costs thousands of dollars per task in compute, though efficiency is expected to improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.
*   It fails on simple questions that a human could easily solve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
*   A demo of the model only showed it building a simple Python application with a UI containing a text box <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. A true AGI would be capable of much more complex tasks, such as building a GTA 6-caliber game, finding a cure for cancer, or engineering faster-than-light vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

## The Rise of AI Agents

The "AI hype train" is expected to remain strong in 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. Companies are using the new buzzword "agents" to boost stock prices, with significant financial gains anticipated for those who can effectively sell these agents to enterprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

An AI agent is essentially a large language model with access to an environment, allowing it to automatically analyze data and take necessary actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. For example, an AI agent could manage security cameras for a business, detecting anomalies and automatically summoning a "Rob dog" with a machine gun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

For programmers, AI agents like Devin are explicitly marketed towards enterprises to replace human programmers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. This trend is concerning for those considering a programming career in 2025, as it suggests that eventually all jobs may be handled by robots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

## [[Impact of AI on Coding and Programming Skills | Impact on Programming Skills]]

While the job market for software development has seen a decrease in postings since its peak in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>, there remains demand for talented programmers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. There will be substantial rewards for programmers who can effectively code while leveraging AI to become significantly more productive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

### Language Trends
*   The military is using a tool called "Tractor" to translate C and C++ code into Rust, utilizing various technologies including large language models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.
*   Rust is increasingly being used and might be one of the best languages to learn for maintaining a programming job in the [[future_of_programming_with_ai | future of programming]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

### JavaScript Frameworks and AI Tools
*   The development of new JavaScript frameworks has slowed down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.
*   Some developers are returning to PHP and Laravel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.
*   Many developers, especially "Indie hackers," are now choosing JavaScript frameworks based on their support from [[role_and_value_of_ai_tools_in_programming | AI tools]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.
*   Tools like Vzer or Bolt can help create a working prototype and UI in seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.
*   The competition in JavaScript in 2025 is not about frameworks themselves, but rather who can build the best [[impact_of_ai_tools_on_coding_and_developers | AI-powered tooling]] around their framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.

## Regulatory Environment for AI

The [[future_developments_and_expectations_for_ai_technology | direction of AI]] and technology largely depends on political leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. Historically, tech booms have been fueled by low interest rates and easy money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.

*   According to VC whale Mark Andreessen, the Feds had previously advised against investing in AI, as they intend for only a few large companies to control it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.
*   A more free-market approach with less regulation on AI is anticipated under different political leadership, which could benefit startup founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

## Hybrid Cloud
Hybrid cloud refers to a strategy where large enterprises operate a private cloud on their own data centers, combined with services from a public cloud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>. A public cloud allows users to sign up with an email address and credit card to start using services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>.

An example of a hybrid cloud strategy is Dropbox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>. In 2016, Dropbox began moving customer data from AWS to their own data centers, which resulted in a reduction of at least $75 million in operating expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>. While they largely shifted to on-premises infrastructure, they continue to use the public cloud for about 10% of their file uploads, particularly for edge cases and regions not covered by their data centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>.

## Multicloud
The term multicloud describes a single architecture or application that integrates services from multiple public clouds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>. This approach is typically adopted to achieve benefits such as preventing [[benefits_and_challenges_of_adopting_cloud_computing | vendor lock-in]] and optimizing pricing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a>.

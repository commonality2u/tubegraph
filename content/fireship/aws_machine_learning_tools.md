[[developments_in_artificial_intelligence_and_aipowered_tools | Machine learning]] (ML) tools provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) enable users to predict the future based on massive amounts of collected data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:13:09">[09:13:09]</a>.

## Data for Machine Learning

Before building [[developments_in_artificial_intelligence_and_aipowered_tools | ML models]], high-quality data is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:24:49">[09:24:49]</a>. If an organization lacks its own data, it can use the Data Exchange service to purchase and subscribe to data from third-party sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:27:06">[09:27:06]</a>.

## Key AWS Machine Learning Services

Once data is available in the cloud, various services can be utilized for [[developments_in_artificial_intelligence_and_aipowered_tools | machine learning]]:

*   **SageMaker** SageMaker connects to data in the cloud, allowing users to build [[developments_in_artificial_intelligence_and_aipowered_tools | machine learning models]] using frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:00">[09:32:00]</a>. It simplifies the [[developments_in_artificial_intelligence_and_aipowered_tools | machine learning]] process by operating on multiple levels and providing a managed Jupiter notebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:38:21">[09:38:21]</a>. This notebook can connect to a GPU instance to train and deploy [[developments_in_artificial_intelligence_and_aipowered_tools | machine learning models]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:44:03">[09:44:03]</a>.
*   **Recognition API** For image analysis, the Recognition API can classify various objects in images, often outperforming custom-built solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:53:07">[09:53:07]</a>.
*   **Lex** To build conversational bots, Lex can be used, as it operates on the same technology that powers Amazon Alexa devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:03:00">[10:03:00]</a>.
*   **DeepRacer** For learning and experimentation with [[developments_in_artificial_intelligence_and_aipowered_tools | machine learning]], DeepRacer is a physical race car that can be driven using custom [[developments_in_artificial_intelligence_and_aipowered_tools | machine learning]] code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:09:02">[10:09:02]</a>.

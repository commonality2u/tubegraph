Modern computing heavily relies on the cloud, utilizing virtual machines (VMs) that simulate hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. These VMs allow large physical computers to be divided into many smaller virtual ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. These virtual machines form the backbone of the [[understanding_the_internet_and_web_infrastructure | internet]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>.

## Internet Protocols and Addressing
The virtual machines connecting the [[understanding_the_internet_and_web_infrastructure | internet]] are linked via the Internet Protocol (IP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>. Each machine possesses a unique IP address for identification on the network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. An IP address is typically aliased to a Uniform Resource Locator (URL), which is registered in a global database known as the Domain Name Service (DNS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.

To establish a connection between two computers, a TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) handshake is performed, enabling them to exchange messages called packets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. For secure communication, a security layer like SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) is commonly implemented to encrypt and decrypt messages over the network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. Once a secure connection is established, data can be shared using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.

## Web Communication and APIs
When a client requests a [[introduction_to_web_development | web]] page, the server responds by sending HTML <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. Modern servers offer a standardized method for clients to request data through an Application Programming Interface (API) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. The most prevalent API architecture is REST (Representational State Transfer), where URLs are mapped to various data entities available on the server <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>.

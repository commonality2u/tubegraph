Big Tech faced a significant shift on August 6, 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Google lost a major legal battle against the US Department of Justice (DOJ) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This fight, which began in 2020, accused Google of violating US antitrust law and operating as a monopoly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The government asserted that Google was a "filthy monopolist" that used illegal tactics to suppress competition and hinder innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Despite Google's lawyers refuting these claims as "outrageous and salacious," the judge concurred with the federal government, finding Google "guilty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. As a result, Google is now officially designated an "illegal Monopoly," akin to historical cases like Standard Oil and the American Tobacco Company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## [[historical_context_of_antitrust_laws_and_their_impact | Historical Context of Antitrust Law]]

The legal framework for this case dates back to 1890 with the passage of the Sherman Act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. This law was initially designed to target "Big Oil, Big Tobacco, and Big Railroad" to prevent anti-competitive activities that blocked market entry for competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

Google was found to have violated Section Two of the Sherman Act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. This section has two provisions:
1.  The possession of monopoly power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
2.  The willful acquisition or maintenance of that power through means other than a superior product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

Essentially, breaking this law requires both market domination and achieving that dominance through means other than simply building a better product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

Google controls 88% of the domestic search market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. While many agree that Google offers a superior product, providing better results than older engines like Lycos or Excite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>, the company faced trouble due to its [[googles_exclusivity_deals_and_their_legal_consequences | exclusivity deals]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

These deals include:
*   Requiring its search engine to be the default on Android devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
*   An agreement with the Mozilla Firefox browser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
*   A deal with Apple, where Google pays Apple 36% of its search revenue, amounting to approximately $20 billion per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

The judge concluded that these [[googles_exclusivity_deals_and_their_legal_consequences | exclusivity deals]] were anti-competitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

## [[potential_future_penalties_and_outcomes_for_google | Potential Future Penalties for Google]]

The specific penalty for Google is not yet determined and will be addressed in a separate trial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. While it's unlikely Google will be completely shattered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>, there are possibilities:

*   **Break-up:** Google could be broken up into multiple entities, potentially requiring divestment of services like Gmail or Android <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. However, Google's search business heavily subsidizes free projects like Gmail and Android <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. If Gmail were an independent entity, it might cost around $10 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
*   **Fines and Contractual Restrictions:** A more probable outcome is that Google will face a fine and contractual restrictions on its exclusivity deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. This could even benefit Google by preventing companies like Apple from profiting significantly without contributing value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. Microsoft, which faced similar monopoly accusations in 2001, suggests that the outcome might not be entirely negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

## Other Big Tech Companies Facing Antitrust Scrutiny

Google is not alone in facing antitrust challenges; other major tech companies are also under active antitrust investigations:

*   **Apple:** The US Department of Justice is suing Apple for maintaining a monopoly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. The feds allege that Apple uses concepts like privacy as an "elastic shield" to justify abusive business practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. Apple has also faced issues with the EU, which mandated it open its payment services to competitors like Epic Games, leading to Fortnite's return to the App Store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.
*   **Meta:** Meta is facing a lawsuit for monopolizing the social media space through anti-competitive acquisitions, such as Instagram and WhatsApp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
*   **Amazon:** Amazon is battling its own monopoly case, accused of exploiting sellers with anti-discounting measures and contracts that prioritize its own products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

These ongoing legal battles highlight a broader trend: "you don't become a trillion-dollar tech company by not being evil" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. The tech industry is a "brutal, Cutthroat game" where companies either fail as heroes or endure long enough to become an "illegal Monopoly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

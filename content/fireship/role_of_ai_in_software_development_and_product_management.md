In March 2025, a phenomenon known as the "vibe coding mind virus" emerged in the programming world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Coined by Andrey, "vibe coding" involves fully embracing "the vibes," accepting exponentials, and disregarding the underlying code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. This approach gained traction, with many code influencers following the lead of Peter Levelvels, who successfully "vibe coded" a real-time flight simulator MMO with JavaScript and monetized it through in-game advertisements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>. However, this trend has also led to an increase in [[developments_in_artificial_intelligence_and_aipowered_tools | AI-generated]] content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>.

According to the CEO of Anthropic, nearly all code will be written by [[AI in software engineering | AI]] within 12 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:03">[00:44:03]</a>. While vibe coding can be effective when executed properly, it can also lead to significant issues if not done carefully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>.

## Coding vs. Programming in the Age of AI

A key distinction must be made between "coding" and "programming" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.
*   **Coding** is the skill of translating logic into computer instructions by writing code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>. This skill, which once involved memorizing syntax to rapidly produce code, is becoming [[Impact of AI on coding and programming skills | obsolete]] due to [[developments_in_artificial_intelligence_and_aipowered_tools | large language models]] (LLMs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. An 8-year-old using [[AI in software engineering | AI]] can now write code faster than a professional with 20 years of experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>.
*   **Programming** is a broader skill, encompassing both art and science, requiring ingenuity, creativity, and instincts developed through experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>. Elite programmers often focus more on removing code than writing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>. Success in programming requires understanding the code, even when "vibe coding" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>.

### The Pitfalls of Unsupervised Vibe Coding

Relying solely on "vibes" can lead to significant problems, as illustrated by a developer who "vibe coded" a SaaS product and had paying customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>. Without a deep understanding of the code, the product was easily exploited and hacked, leading to its permanent shutdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.

## Tools and Techniques for Effective Vibe Coding

Despite the risks, vibe coding, when done correctly, holds potential for billion-dollar businesses running entirely on "Vibes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>. This will likely involve tools like Vzero or Bolt, coupled with [[AI in software engineering | AI]] IDEs such as Cursor and Windserve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>.

For those engaging in [[role_and_value_of_ai_tools_in_programming | AI-assisted]] code generation, three rules are recommended:

1.  **Choose a Popular, Simple Tech Stack**: LLMs are most effective at solving problems that have already been addressed on platforms like GitHub and Stack Overflow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>. Therefore, popular choices like React, Express, Tailwind, Redis, and Deno are ideal for web development, even if personal preferences lean otherwise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. While this rule is generally important, some flexibility exists, as Vue.js and Nux have also shown good results for vibe coding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.
2.  **Master Git**: This rule is non-negotiable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>. When [[AI in software engineering | AI]] generates code, it can also delete working code, making it nearly impossible to revert without version control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>. Tools like Claude Code can assist with "vibe committing" code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>.
3.  **Serve Your AI**: The role of the developer shifts from "coder" to "product manager" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>. To be effective, one must break down complex requirements into small, specific steps and provide the [[role_and_value_of_ai_tools_in_programming | AI]] with proper context, such as documentation and UI design images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>. The goal is to make the LLM as deterministic as possible, rather than allowing it to be creative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>.

## The Evolving Role of Developers and Product Management

The [[impact_of_ai_on_traditional_jobs | impact of AI]] signifies a shift in the developer's role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>. While tools offer unprecedented power, relying solely on "vibes" remains ill-advised. Even successful projects like the Levelvels Flight Simulator had issues, and its success was likely underpinned by the developer's extensive experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>.

The [[future_of_programming_with_ai | future of programming]] emphasizes the [[impact_of_ai_on_creative_and_technical_professions | importance of developers]] acting as effective product managers. This involves meticulous requirement breakdown and contextual guidance for [[AI in software engineering | AI]] tools.

### AI in Professional Communication

Beyond coding, [[AI in software engineering | AI]] also plays a role in professional communication. Grammarly, an [[AI in software engineering | AI]] writing partner, helps professionals work faster and improve quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>. It integrates directly with communication apps, offering one-click suggestions and rewrites to speed up writing processes, ensuring professional correspondence maintains a human tone and matches the intended audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>.

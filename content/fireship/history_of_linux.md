On August 25th, 1991, Linus Torvalds, a 21-year-old graduate student in Helsinki, announced he was working on a free operating system as a hobby, not intending it to be a large professional project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This hobby eventually evolved into one of the most significant projects in computing history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. Unlike most operating systems created to generate substantial revenue, [[history_and_creation_of_linux | Linux]] was revolutionary, founded on the principle that software should be free and open <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Pre-Linux Landscape: UNIX and GNU

Before [[history_and_creation_of_linux | Linux]] emerged, the computing world saw the creation of the UNIX operating system in 1969 by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. UNIX was highly regarded by both businesses and universities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. However, a significant problem arose because AT&T owned its code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. When UC Berkeley developed their Berkeley Software Distribution in 1977, AT&T sued them, leading to limitations on UNIX development and a period known as the "UNIX wars" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

In response to these limitations, Richard Stallman initiated the GNU Project in 1983 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Its goal was to create a free and open replacement for UNIX <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. UNIX was a complex project with hundreds of applications, making a full replacement a challenging task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. Over several years, the GNU Project successfully recreated many essential applications still used today, often associated with [[history_and_creation_of_linux | Linux]], such as `tar`, `bash`, and [[history_of_code_editors | Emacs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. By the early 1990s, GNU had robust software but lacked one critical component: the operating system [[role_of_linux_kernel_in_operating_systems | kernel]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. A complete operating system needs a [[role_of_linux_kernel_in_operating_systems | kernel]] to manage CPU and memory resources between hardware and software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

## Birth of the Linux Kernel

Coincidentally, Linus Torvalds was working on his hobby operating system around the same time the GNU Project needed a [[role_of_linux_kernel_in_operating_systems | kernel]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. He initially intended to name his project "Free A**x," as he considered "[[history_and_creation_of_linux | Linux]]" too egotistical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. However, the administrator of the FTP server used to host the project changed the name to [[history_and_creation_of_linux | Linux]] without Torvalds' consent, and the name stuck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

Initially, [[history_and_creation_of_linux | Linux]] was released with a proprietary license that restricted commercial use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. By the end of 1992, it was re-released under the GNU General Public License (GPL) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. This pivotal moment led to the creation of the complete operating system known today as GNU/[[history_and_creation_of_linux | Linux]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

## The Rise of [[linux_distributions_and_their_origins | Linux Distributions]]

The following year, hundreds of developers began adapting the [[role_of_linux_kernel_in_operating_systems | Linux kernel]] to the GNU environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. The [[role_of_linux_kernel_in_operating_systems | Linux kernel]]'s appeal lay in its ability to allow developers to build custom operating systems that felt like UNIX but without the threat of legal action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. This freedom spurred the creation of the first [[linux_distributions_and_their_origins | Linux distributions]], including Softlanding, Yggdrasil, and Slackware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

### What is a [[linux_distributions_and_their_origins | Linux Distro]]?
A [[linux_distributions_and_their_origins | Linux distribution]] (distro) is a complete operating system built upon the [[role_of_linux_kernel_in_operating_systems | Linux kernel]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. It typically includes:
*   A collection of software packages and libraries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
*   A package manager for installing additional applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
*   Optionally, a windowing system for graphical user interfaces (GUIs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

Many [[linux_distributions_and_their_origins | distros]] might share common user interfaces, such as GNOME, KDE Plasma, MATE, and Cinnamon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. Today, there are nearly a thousand different [[linux_distributions_and_their_origins | Linux distros]], each customized for specific purposes, such as enterprise use, home users, servers, or desktop, mobile, and embedded devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. Each distro is often supported by a community with its own philosophical and technical preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

## Notable [[notable_linux_distros_and_their_impact | Linux Distros]] and Their Impact

Most older [[linux_distributions_and_their_origins | distros]] are no longer maintained and are considered historical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. One exception is Slackware, which had a release as recently as 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. Slackware led to variations, most notably the openSUSE project, which is popular among professional power users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

### Debian Family Tree
The most significant [[linux_distributions_and_their_origins | distro]] to emerge in 1993 was Debian, established by Ian Murdock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. Its name combines his name with his ex-wife's name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. Debian's first official release, version 1.1 Buzz, came out in 1996, and subsequent releases are codenamed after Toy Story characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. Debian's development also led to the Advanced Package Tool (APT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

Debian boasts a massive community and remains a popular, stable, and minimal [[linux_distributions_and_their_origins | distro]], especially for servers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. Its stability and minimalism have allowed it to spawn a vast number of derivative [[linux_distributions_and_their_origins | distros]], including specialized ones like Raspberry Pi OS and SteamOS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

The most popular child of Debian is Ubuntu, first released in 2004 and managed by Canonical, a British company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. Ubuntu follows a semi-annual release schedule, with each release named after an animal and a word starting with the same letter (e.g., Cosmic Cuttlefish) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. It is notably beginner-friendly and was instrumental in bringing [[introduction_to_linux | Linux]] to mainstream home computer users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. Despite recent criticism from the [[introduction_to_linux | Linux]] community regarding closed-source software and data sales to third parties, Ubuntu remains highly popular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. It also has several official "flavors" like Kubuntu, Xubuntu, and Lubuntu, which offer variations on the original, with Kubuntu being a good entry point for those transitioning from Microsoft Windows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. Ubuntu itself has spawned many other variations, including [[notable_linux_distros_and_their_impact | Linux Mint]], Peppermint, and Pop!_OS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.

### Red Hat Family Tree
Another significant [[linux_distributions_and_their_origins | Linux distro]] with a large family tree is Red Hat, created in 1994 by Marc Ewing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. Red Hat is renowned for its focus on security and reliability for enterprise users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. Its business model involves maintaining an open-source operating system and generating revenue by selling consulting, integration, and add-on services to large enterprise clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. Red Hat now generates billions in revenue and was acquired by IBM for an 11-figure sum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

Red Hat has given rise to numerous descendants, primarily associated with enterprise work and using either the RPM or YUM package managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. Popular descendants include RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise [[introduction_to_linux | Linux]]), CentOS, and Fedora <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. Fedora is not only excellent for enterprise servers but also serves well as a personal workstation, being the preferred [[linux_distributions_and_their_origins | distro]] of Linus Torvalds himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.

### Minimalist and Independent Distros
Many [[linux_distributions_and_their_origins | Linux distros]] include features that users may not need, leading to increased complexity and hardware footprint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. In the early 2000s, two [[linux_distributions_and_their_origins | Linux]] families emerged, focusing on simplicity, performance, and minimalism: Gentoo (with its Enoch [[linux_distributions_and_their_origins | distro]]) in 2000 and Arch in 2002 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. The Arch family of [[linux_distributions_and_their_origins | Linux distros]] is known for its simplicity, using its own package manager called Pacman and adopting a rolling release model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. Unlike Ubuntu's bi-annual major releases, Arch provides continuous small updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. Arch is also the parent of Manjaro, one of today's most popular [[linux_distributions_and_their_origins | distros]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

Beyond these family trees, many popular independent [[linux_distributions_and_their_origins | distros]] exist, such as the lightweight Alpine, Fire OS for Amazon devices, and Android, used by billions daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

## Philosophy and Impact

The abundance of [[linux_distributions_and_their_origins | Linux distros]] can be understood by thinking of the [[role_of_linux_kernel_in_operating_systems | Linux kernel]] as an engine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. Just as cars are designed for various purposes (speed, comfort, enterprise, or fun), [[history_and_creation_of_linux | Linux]] allows developers to build custom "cars" (operating systems) using the free [[role_of_linux_kernel_in_operating_systems | engine]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. This freedom, combined with the GNU project and the broader open-source ecosystem, motivates innovation and allows people to profit within it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. This collaborative and innovative environment is often mistaken for communism by critics, but it represents the free market at its best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. Today, even Microsoft fully supports [[history_and_creation_of_linux | Linux]] through its WSL (Windows Subsystem for [[history_and_creation_of_linux | Linux]]) project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

### The Origin of Git
A notable part of [[history_and_creation_of_linux | Linux]]'s history is the creation of Git <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. In 2005, the source code for [[history_and_creation_of_linux | Linux]] was managed using a proprietary version control system called BitKeeper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. Due to the controversial nature of proprietary software, Linus Torvalds created Git <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.

In February 2024, an email purporting to be from the Gmail team circulated, claiming that Gmail would be "sunsetted and shut down" by August 2024, preventing users from sending, receiving, or accessing their email [00:03:15]. This news was met with widespread outrage, particularly given that Gmail has 1.5 billion users [00:03:26].

## Spread and Believability
The email spread rapidly on social media platforms [00:03:32]. Its believability stemmed from its perfect crafting in "Google's corporate language" [00:03:37].

## Google's Clarification
Despite the alarm it caused, the email was confirmed to be a prank [00:03:37]. Google subsequently had to issue a clarification, stating that Gmail was not, in fact, shutting down [00:03:40].

On August 25, 1991, Linus Torvalds, a 21-year-old graduate student in Helsinki, announced he was working on a free operating system, initially conceived as a hobby rather than a professional endeavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This hobby evolved into one of the most significant projects in computing history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. Unlike most operating systems designed to generate significant revenue, [[Introduction to Linux | Linux]] was a revolution founded on the principle of free and open software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## The Pre-[[Introduction to Linux | Linux]] Era: UNIX and GNU

Before [[Introduction to Linux | Linux]] came into existence, its roots can be traced back to 1969 when Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie developed the UNIX operating system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. UNIX was highly regarded by both businesses and universities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

However, a significant issue arose because the code for UNIX was owned by AT&T <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. In 1977, when UC Berkeley created their own Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD), AT&T sued them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. This legal action imposed limitations on UNIX development and ushered in a period known as the "UNIX Wars" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

In 1983, Richard Stallman initiated the GNU Project, aiming to create a free and open replacement for UNIX <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. UNIX was a vast and complex system with hundreds of applications, making a complete replacement a formidable challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. Over the subsequent years, the GNU project successfully recreated many essential applications commonly associated with [[Introduction to Linux | Linux]] today, such as `tar`, `bash`, and `emacs` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. By the early 1990s, GNU possessed a wealth of excellent software but lacked a crucial component: the operating system kernel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. A kernel is essential for a complete operating system, acting as an intermediary between hardware and software to allocate CPU and memory resources for running applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

## The Birth of [[Introduction to Linux | Linux]] and [[Notable Linux Distros and their Impact | Distributions]]

Fortuitously, it was during this time that Linus Torvalds was developing his hobby operating system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. He initially intended to name it "Free Acks," believing "Linux" was too self-aggrandizing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. However, the administrator of the FTP server where it was hosted disliked the name "Free Acks" and changed it to "Linux" without Torvalds' consent, and the name endured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

Initially, [[Introduction to Linux | Linux]] was released under a proprietary license that restricted commercial use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. By the end of 1992, however, it was re-released under the GNU General Public License (GPL) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. This union of the [[Linux kernel and its role | Linux kernel]] with GNU tools gave birth to the complete operating system known today as GNU/Linux <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

In the following year, hundreds of developers joined the [[Introduction to Linux | Linux]] project, adapting it to the GNU environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. The elegance of the [[Linux kernel and its role | Linux kernel]] lay in its ability to enable developers to build custom operating systems that felt like UNIX but without the threat of legal action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. This ultimately led to the creation of the first [[Linux distribution options | Linux distributions]], such as Softlanding, Yggdrasil, and Slackware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

## What is a [[Linux distribution options | Linux Distro]]?

A [[Linux distribution options | Linux distro]] (distribution) is a complete operating system built upon the [[Linux kernel and its role | Linux kernel]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. It includes a collection of packages and libraries, typically a package manager for installing additional applications, and often a windowing system for graphical user interfaces (GUIs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. Many [[Linux distribution options | distros]] might share the same default user interface, with popular options including GNOME, KDE Plasma, MATE, and Cinnamon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

Today, there are nearly a thousand different [[Linux distribution options | Linux distributions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>, each customized to serve distinct purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. Some are designed for enterprise users, while others cater to home users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. Some [[Linux distribution options | distros]] are server-specific, while others are built for desktop, mobile, and embedded devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. Each [[Linux distribution options | distro]] is typically supported by a community with its own philosophical and technical preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

## Evolution of [[Notable Linux Distros and their Impact | Linux Distributions]]

Many older [[Linux distribution options | distros]] are no longer maintained and are considered historical artifacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. Slackware is a notable exception, having released updates as recently as 2016 and spawning several variations, most notably the OpenSUSE project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. OpenSUSE remains a popular general-purpose [[Linux distribution options | distro]], often associated with professional power users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

### The Debian Family

The most significant [[Linux distribution options | distro]] to emerge from 1993 was Debian, established by Ian Murdock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. Its name is a portmanteau of his name and his ex-wife's name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. Debian's first official release, version 1.1 Buzz, came in 1996, and subsequent releases have been code-named after Toy Story characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. A few years later, the Advanced Package Tool (APT) was created, originally codenamed "Deity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

Debian boasts a massive community and remains a popular and stable [[Linux distribution options | distro]] for servers, though it can also serve as a general-purpose option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. Its minimal and stable nature has allowed it to parent a vast number of derivative [[Linux distribution options | distros]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>, some of which are highly specialized, like Raspberry Pi OS and SteamOS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

By far, Debian's most popular offspring is Ubuntu, first released in 2004 and managed by the British company Canonical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. Ubuntu follows a semi-annual release schedule, with each release named after an animal and a word starting with the same letter (e.g., "Cosmic Cuttlefish") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. It is extremely beginner-friendly and was instrumental in bringing [[Introduction to Linux | Linux]] to mainstream home computer users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. Despite recent criticism from the [[Introduction to Linux | Linux]] community regarding closed-source software and selling data to third parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>, it remains highly popular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. Ubuntu also has various "flavors" like Kubuntu, Xubuntu, and Lubuntu, which offer slight variations; Kubuntu, for example, is designed as an excellent entry point for those transitioning from Microsoft Windows to [[Introduction to Linux | Linux]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. Ubuntu, in turn, has spawned many other variations, including [[Notable Linux Distros and their Impact | Linux Mint]], Peppermint, and Pop!_OS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

### The Red Hat Family

Another [[Linux distribution options | Linux distro]] with a vast family tree is Red Hat, created by Marc Ewing in 1994 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. Red Hat is known for its emphasis on security and reliability for enterprise users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. Its business model involves maintaining an open-source operating system and generating revenue by selling consulting, integration, and add-on services to large enterprise clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. Today, Red Hat generates billions of dollars in revenue and was recently acquired by IBM for an 11-figure sum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

Red Hat has given rise to numerous descendants, most of which are associated with enterprise work and utilize either the RPM or YUM package managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. Popular descendants include Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), CentOS, and Fedora <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. Fedora is not only excellent for enterprise servers but also functions well as a personal workstation, and it is even the [[Linux distribution options | distro]] of choice for Linus Torvalds himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.

### Minimalist [[Linux distribution options | Distros]]: Gentoo and Arch

Many [[Linux distribution options | Linux distributions]] include features that users may not need, consuming disk space and adding complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. In the early 2000s, two [[Introduction to Linux | Linux]] families emerged with a focus on simplicity, performance, and minimalism: Gentoo (with its Enoch [[Linux distribution options | distro]]) in 2000 and Arch in 2002 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

The Arch family of [[Linux distribution options | Linux distributions]] is preferred by those who value simplicity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. It has its own package manager called Pacman and has adopted a rolling release model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. Unlike Ubuntu, which has a new major release every six months, Arch provides continuous small updates that can be applied to the operating system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. Arch is also the parent of Manjaro, currently one of the most popular [[Linux distribution options | distros]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

### Independent [[Linux distribution options | Distributions]]

Beyond these prominent families, many popular independent [[Linux distribution options | distros]] exist, including the extremely lightweight Alpine, Fire OS for Amazon devices, and Android, used by billions daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

## Why So Many [[Linux distribution options | Linux Distros]]?

Thinking of the [[Linux kernel and its role | Linux kernel]] as an "engine" helps to answer why there are so many [[Linux distribution options | Linux distributions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. Just as cars are designed for speed, comfort, enterprise, or fun, [[Introduction to Linux | Linux]] acts as a free engine that developers can use to build their own customized "cars" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. This freedom, combined with GNU and the broader open-source ecosystem, encourages innovation and allows people to create within that ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. While some perceive this as communism, it is, in reality, a prime example of the free market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. Today, even Microsoft fully supports [[Introduction to Linux | Linux]] through its Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

### Linus Torvalds' Other Creation: Git

In 2005, the source code for [[Introduction to Linux | Linux]] was managed under a proprietary version control system called BitKeeper, which proved controversial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. In response, Linus Torvalds created Git <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

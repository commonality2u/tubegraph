A controversial opinion among developers is that those who do not code in their spare time for enjoyment will never achieve the same level of proficiency as those who do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:37">[02:37:37]</a>. This viewpoint suggests that a lack of [[passion_for_programming_versus_treating_it_as_a_job | passion for programming versus treating it as a job]], as evidenced by not coding in one's free time, limits a programmer's potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:42">[02:41:42]</a>.

## Counterarguments

Despite personally coding in free time, one developer disagrees with this opinion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:47">[02:48:47]</a>.
Arguments against this notion include:
*   **Programming as a Job** Many individuals view programming as a profession, and there is nothing inherently wrong with this approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:47">[02:53:47]</a>.
*   **Inherent Talent** Some highly skilled programmers, often referred to as "10x developers," can accomplish tasks with significantly less effort than others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:04">[02:57:04]</a>. Their exceptional performance is attributed to being "built different," rather than a result of coding in their free time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:32">[03:05:32]</a>.
*   **Broader Skill Set** Being a successful programmer extends beyond just writing code. It also encompasses crucial soft skills such as communication, teamwork, vision, and creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:15">[03:17:15]</a>.

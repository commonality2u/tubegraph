OpenAI recently released a new state-of-the-art model named O1, which represents a new paradigm of deep thinking or reasoning models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. While initially, some believed their software engineering jobs might be safe from AI advancements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>, O1's capabilities suggest a significant [[impact_of_ai_on_traditional_jobs | shift]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## O1's Advanced Capabilities

O1 "obliterates all past benchmarks" in math, coding, and PhD-level science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Although it's not considered Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) or Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>, its performance gains are substantial compared to previous models like GPT-4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

### Benchmarks and Coding Performance

*   **Accuracy Improvements**: O1 shows massive gains in accuracy, particularly in PhD-level physics, multi-task language understanding benchmarks for math, and formal logic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
*   **Coding Ability**: The most significant improvements are seen in its coding ability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>:
    *   At the International Olympiad in Informatics, O1 was in the 49th percentile with 50 submissions per problem and achieved a gold medal submission when allowed 10,000 submissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
    *   Its Codeforces ELO score increased from the 11th percentile to the 93rd percentile compared to GPT-4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

### Collaboration with Cognition Labs

OpenAI has been secretly working with Cognition Labs, the company developing "Devin" (an AI agent designed to replace programmers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. When using the GPT-4 "brain," only 25% of problems were solved, but with O1, this figure rose to 75% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. However, there are doubts about the reliability of these internal, closed-source benchmarks, given the company's interest in raising more money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

## How O1's Deep Thinking Works

O1 models, including O1 mini, O1 preview, and the restricted O1 regular, rely on reinforcement learning to perform complex reasoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

### Chain of Thought Processing

When presented with a problem, these models produce a "chain of thought" before providing the answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. This means they "think" by going through a series of internal thoughts to reach a conclusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. They produce "reasoning tokens," which are outputs that help the model refine its steps and backtrack when necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. This approach allows O1 to create complex solutions with fewer hallucinations compared to previous models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. The trade-off is that responses require more time, computing power, and money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

While the actual chain of thought is hidden from the end user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>, examples show that the model first analyzes input/output shapes, then considers programming language constraints, and takes other steps before generating a response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. This "reinforcement learning" method for producing synthetic data has been used by Google's AlphaProof and AlphaCoder in math and coding competitions for years, but this is the first time such a model has become generally available to the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

## Practical Implications for Programming

A test recreating the classic MS-DOS game *Drug Wars* highlighted O1's capabilities and limitations compared to GPT-4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

*   **GPT-4's Performance**: When asked to build the game in C with a GUI, GPT-4 produced code that was difficult to compile and resulted in limited game logic even after follow-up prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.
*   **O1's Performance**: O1, using its Chain of Thought process, compiled right away and followed the game requirements closely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. However, the resulting application was still buggy, leading to infinite loops and a terrible UI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. Attempts to fix issues with follow-up prompts led to more hallucinations and bugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

While O1 isn't truly intelligent, the "Chain of Thought" approach shows significant potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. It's essentially "GPT-4 with the ability to recursively prompt itself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. The speaker compares the [[future_implications_of_ai_in_programming | situation]] to a "horse influencer in 1910" telling horses that a car won't take their job, but another horse driving a car will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>, suggesting that while AI tools might not directly replace programmers, [[future_of_programming_with_ai | AI agents]] and tools will significantly change the nature of programming work. The [[impact_of_ai_tools_on_coding_and_developers | impact of AI on coding and programming skills]] is undeniable, prompting discussions about the [[future_of_programming_and_ai_agents | future of programming]] and [[future_developments_and_expectations_for_ai_technology | AI technology]].

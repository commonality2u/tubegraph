Telegram is a social platform with over one billion users, known for not running ads and having a small team of only 30 employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. It is designed to be difficult for authorities to monitor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## How Telegram Handles Encryption

While many things on Telegram are encrypted, most are *not* [[telegrams_operation_and_comparison_with_other_messaging_apps | end-to-end encrypted]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
The most secure way to pass messages privately is through end-to-end encryption, where the encryption and decryption processes occur directly on the user's device, not on a centralized server <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. With end-to-end encryption, even if messages are stored in a centralized database, only the person with the key can read them, not the hosting company or authorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

Telegram does offer end-to-end encryption for private chats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. However, "everything else is public and encrypted on the server" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. Telegram's protocol has received criticism from security researchers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. In contrast, apps like Signal use end-to-end encryption with their own open-source protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

## Privacy Features and Challenges

Telegram aims to provide an uncensored platform, where users can access information without "mainstream narrative and infantile warning labels" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. The platform's infrastructure is intentionally distributed across multiple countries, making it difficult for agents to obtain data as it requires coordination across various legal systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. If a hard drive is seized in one country, the encryption key for the data might be stored in another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

### Censorship and App Stores
Telegram is not entirely uncensored. If downloaded from Apple or Google App Stores, the app is required to censor a significant amount of content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. To avoid this, users are advised to download the application directly from telegram.org <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. Many of Telegram's applications are also open-sourced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

### [[governments_stance_on_encryption_and_legal_implications | Government Stance on Encryption]]
Authorities are concerned about Telegram's "lack of moderation and cooperation with law enforcement" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Its use of disposable phone numbers also facilitates cryptocurrency transfers that cannot be monitored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. The EU, for instance, has attempted to make end-to-end encryption illegal, with figures like Ilva Johansson pushing this initiative, though it has been unsuccessful so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. Encryption is seen as a "Kryptonite" by authorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>, making it challenging to enforce laws like those against hate speech if platforms like Telegram do not cooperate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

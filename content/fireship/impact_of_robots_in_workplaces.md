The development and deployment of robots are poised to significantly transform workplaces, with implications for job displacement and efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:51">[02:42:51]</a>.

## Current Developments in Robotics

Several major companies are actively developing advanced robotics:
*   Tesla is developing its Optimus robot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:03">[02:44:03]</a>.
*   Nvidia is also noted to have its own "Army of robots" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:18">[02:46:18]</a>.
*   A particularly impressive example is Figure, a human-like robot equipped with an OpenAI brain, designed for factory work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:97">[02:47:97]</a>.

It is predicted that robot technology will experience significant growth over the next decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:21">[02:54:21]</a>, eventually leading to every home possessing a robot assistant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:42">[02:57:42]</a>.

## Future Job Displacement

The growing capabilities of robots, particularly those integrated with advanced AI models, suggest a future where many jobs could be automated. It is posited that "eventually [[impact_of_ai_on_traditional_jobs | all jobs]] will go to the robots" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:51">[02:42:51]</a>, impacting [[impact_of_ai_on_job_markets_and_education | job markets and education]] and leading to [[implications_of_ai_advancements_on_different_professions | implications for various professions]].

From: [[fireship]] <br/> 

The Gearhead is a variant of programmer who consistently owns the "bleeding edge" version of almost everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. This [[programmer_stereotype|programmer stereotype]] is sometimes accurate, though programming can also lead people in the opposite direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

### Characteristics

*   **Technology & Gear**
    *   Possesses the latest M1 Mac <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.
    *   Uses a large curved monitor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
    *   Owns a mechanical keyboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

    *   Secures their home with a smart lock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

*   **Programming Philosophy**
    *   Follows the "hype train" when choosing programming languages and technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
    *   Historically, this meant adopting Java in 1996, jQuery in 2006, and GraphQL in 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
    *   By 2026, they are anticipated to be among the first in line for a Neuralink chip to write "blazingly fast code" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
    *   The specific function of the technology is less important than its trendiness; if it's trendy, it belongs in their tech stack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

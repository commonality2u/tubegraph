The release of [[OpenAI GPT 40 image generator | GPT 4.5]] on February 28th, 2025, has been described as "underwhelming," suggesting that the "AI hype train" has gone "on life support" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Despite being the most expensive AI model ever produced, it has reportedly failed to "crush any benchmarks, win any awards, or offer any novel capabilities whatsoever" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Its primary selling point is its "Vibes," aiming to chat in a more natural, human-like way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. While considered a "good model," it is not deemed sufficient to sustain the current "AI hype monster" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This has led to speculation that the industry is heading towards a "sigmoid of sorrow" rather than a "technological singularity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## Unavailability and Cost
[[OpenAI GPT 40 image generator | GPT 4.5]] is currently accessible only to OpenAI's Pro users who pay $200 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:10">[01:29:10]</a>. It is notably expensive, costing $75 per million input tokens and $150 per million output tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>. In [[claude_37_release_and_impact_on_programming | comparison]], [[claude_37_release_and_impact_on_programming | Claude]] costs $15 per million tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>.

## Performance and Capabilities
### "Vibes" and Subjectivity
The model's ability to "emit Chill Vibes" was observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>. OpenAI has introduced a new "Vibes Benchmark" intended to measure creative thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>. However, this aspect is considered "highly subjective" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>.

### Limitations and Errors
Despite claims of a "far lower hallucination rate," [[OpenAI GPT 40 image generator | GPT 4.5]] has been found to make "a lot of silly mistakes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>. It lacks self-awareness, not knowing what [[OpenAI GPT 40 image generator | GPT 4.5]] is and stating its training cutoff as October 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>. While it could correctly identify the number of 'r's in "Strawberry," it failed to provide the correct number of 'L's in "Lollapalooza" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>.

### Programming and Science
The model is not expected to perform well in programming and science compared to "deep thinking models" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>. On the AER polyglot coding benchmark, [[OpenAI GPT 40 image generator | GPT 4.5]] is not only inferior to DeepSeek in programming but also "hundreds of times more expensive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.

## Market Position and Future Outlook
Currently, xAI's Grok is considered the "best model in the world" based on betting market opinions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>. Although OpenAI is still favored to have the best model by the end of 2025, its odds are "on the decline" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. This presents a challenge for OpenAI, which is raising billions of dollars as it transitions to a for-profit entity, requiring it to maintain a "massive valuation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.

Sam Altman maintains that "there is no wall" and believes models can be scaled almost infinitely, assuming he secures "trillions of dollars from SoftBank and the Saudis" for data centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. However, a theory suggests that OpenAI failed to achieve significant improvements with [[OpenAI GPT 40 image generator | GPT 5]] despite scaling parameters and compute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>. As [[OpenAI GPT 40 image generator | GPT 4.5]] is the largest model created by OpenAI, the bar for [[OpenAI GPT 40 image generator | GPT 5]] has reportedly been lowered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>, with Altman previously describing it as more like a "router" that selects the best model based on a prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>.

This perceived plateau is seen as positive for computer science students, as AI coding tools are most beneficial to "real human programmers who know what they're doing," a situation not expected to change soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>.

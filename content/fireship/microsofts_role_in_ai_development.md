Microsoft has emerged as a dominant force in the field of [[developments_in_artificial_intelligence_and_aipowered_tools | artificial intelligence]] development, demonstrating a strategic and aggressive approach in deploying AI-powered products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. The company has shown a "blitzkrieg attack" in releasing numerous AI products within a short period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

## Strategic Acquisitions and Investments
Microsoft's strategy includes key acquisitions and investments that position it at the forefront of the [[developments_in_artificial_intelligence_and_aipowered_tools | AI]] landscape:
*   **GitHub Acquisition** Microsoft acquired GitHub, a leading platform for code hosting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. This acquisition is significant as the vast amount of open-source code on GitHub has been used to train large language models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.
*   **OpenAI Stake** Microsoft took a major stake in OpenAI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>, the developer of advanced models like GPT-4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.
*   **Bing's Persistence** The company is credited for not discontinuing Bing, its search engine, despite over a decade of public criticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. This persistence has allowed Bing to be integrated into Microsoft's new AI offerings.

These strategic moves have enabled Microsoft's products to appear "years ahead of the competition" within a week's time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

## Key AI Product Releases
Microsoft has rapidly introduced several [[developments_in_artificial_intelligence_and_aipowered_tools | AI-powered tools]], demonstrating its commitment to integrating [[developments_in_artificial_intelligence_and_aipowered_tools | AI]] across its ecosystem:
*   **Bing Chat** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>
*   **Copilot for Office** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>
*   **Bing Image Generator** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>

### GitHub Copilot X
A significant product demonstrating Microsoft's [[developments_in_artificial_intelligence_and_aipowered_tools | AI]] leadership is GitHub Copilot X <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, described as a "next-gen coding assistant" powered by GPT-4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This tool is currently in technical preview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a> and promises several game-changing features:

*   **Built-in Chat Window**
    *   Allows users to highlight code and request explanations, refactoring, or unit test generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.
    *   Specialized for coding problems directly within the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
    *   Maintains the context of the user's actual codebase, leveraging GPT-4's 25,000 token capacity (compared to GPT-3.5's 3,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
*   **Copilot for Documentation**
    *   Generates answers based on specific library documentation (e.g., React, Azure, MDN) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
    *   Can generate tutorials on the fly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
*   **Voice-Activated Copilot**
    *   Enables control of VS Code and code writing entirely through voice commands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
    *   Offers faster coding than typing and allows coding in situations where typing is not feasible (e.g., while running or commuting) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
*   **Copilot for Pull Requests**
    *   Generates descriptions for pull requests based on code changes, even if those changes were made by [[Developments in artificial intelligence and AIpowered tools | AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
*   **Copilot CLI**
    *   Introduces [[Role and value of AI tools in programming | AI]] autocompletion in the terminal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.
    *   Eliminates the need to memorize Linux commands by allowing users to describe desired actions, with the [[Role and value of AI tools in programming | AI]] generating the command and an explanation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

These [[role_of_ai_in_software_development_and_product_management | AI tools]] are expected to make developers "more powerful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>, enabling them to build systems "10 times faster" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. While programming remains vital for delivering great products and understanding how to build systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>, the role of human programmers is evolving due to the impact of [[Role and value of AI tools in programming | AI tooling]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

[[Java as a boilerplate driven language|Java]] is a high-level, multi-paradigm programming language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It was designed by James Gosling in 1990 at Sun Microsystems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Today, it stands as one of the world's most popular programming languages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, powering enterprise web applications with Spring framework, Big Data pipelines with Hadoop, mobile apps on Android, and even the controller for NASA's Maestro Mars Rover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Core Features and Philosophy
What made [[history_of_java_programming_language|Java]] innovative is its ability to compile to platform-independent bytecode, rather than machine code like [[objectoriented_programming_in_c|C]] or [[objectoriented_programming_in_c|C++]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This bytecode can run on any operating system without recompiling, enabled by execution with the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. This makes [[Java as a boilerplate driven language|Java]] both a compiled and interpreted language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. Developers benefit from the "write once, run anywhere" philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>, as the computer only needs the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

[[Java as a boilerplate driven language|Java]] is a strongly typed language with a curly brace syntax similar to the [[objectoriented_programming_in_c|C]] family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. It provides high-level features such as garbage collection, runtime type checking, and reflection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## Programming Paradigms

### [[objectoriented_programming_in_java|Object-Oriented Programming in Java]]
[[Java as a boilerplate driven language|Java]] was built with [[objectoriented_programming_in_java|object-oriented programming]] (OOP) at its core <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Key aspects of its [[objectoriented_programming_in_java|object-oriented]] nature include:
*   **Classes and Objects**
    *   Every [[Java as a boilerplate driven language|Java]] program begins with a class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
    *   A class must contain a `main` method, which is the program's entry point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
    *   Functions are defined as methods within classes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
    *   Custom classes can be defined as blueprints for objects, allowing attributes and methods to be added to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.
    *   The `new` keyword is used to instantiate an object from a class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
*   **Encapsulation**
    *   Keywords like `public` dictate visibility; `public` means a method can be used outside its class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
    *   `static` signifies that a member belongs to the class itself, rather than an instance of the class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

### Functional Programming in Java
While primarily [[objectoriented_programming_in_java|object-oriented]], [[Java as a boilerplate driven language|Java]] has evolved to incorporate [[functional_programming_languages_and_their_features|functional patterns]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. This includes support for anonymous Lambda methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

## Development Workflow
To get started with [[Java as a boilerplate driven language|Java]], the Java Development Kit (JDK) needs to be installed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. A [[Java as a boilerplate driven language|Java]] program file ends with the `.java` extension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. After writing the code, the compiler is used to generate a `.class` file containing the bytecode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. This file is then executed by the JVM using the `java` command <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

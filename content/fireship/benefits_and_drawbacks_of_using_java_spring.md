The Spring framework makes working with Java enjoyable, despite Java sometimes being considered a [[java_as_a_boilerplate_driven_language | boilerplate-driven language]] for creating "instant Legacy code" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27">[08:27]</a>.

## Benefits of Spring

*   **Customization and Flexibility**
    *   Spring offers a "create your own adventure" approach, allowing developers to choose various dependencies for their project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35">[08:35]</a>.
    *   It supports Kotlin or Groovy for development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40">[08:40]</a>.
*   **Robustness and Code Simplicity**
    *   Despite [[javas_verbosity_in_code | Java's verbosity]], Spring code "pretty much writes itself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:49">[08:49]</a>.
    *   It feels more robust compared to dynamic languages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52">[08:52]</a>.
    *   Spring utilizes metaprogramming to keep code concise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06">[09:06]</a>.
*   **Architecture and Features**
    *   Spring follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:57">[08:57]</a>.
    *   Routes are defined using decorators on controller methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02">[09:02]</a>.
    *   Database models are based on code with the Java Persistence API (JPA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12">[09:12]</a>.

## Drawbacks of Spring

*   **Initial Complexity**
    *   The source code for a Spring project can be found in deeply nested folders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:55">[08:55]</a>.
*   **Templating Experience**
    *   The TimeLeaf templating engine, which uses attributes in HTML to define data rendering, was not considered a very good experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:21">[09:21]</a>.

## History and Creation

C++ is a statically typed, compiled programming language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It is famous for its widespread use in software infrastructure and is known for its steep learning curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

### Origins and Development
C++ was created in 1979 by Bjarne Stroustrup at AT&T Bell Labs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Stroustrup was inspired by the object-oriented nature of Simula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. He sought a language that combined the high performance of [[c_language_characteristics_and_usage | C]] with object-oriented capabilities, leading to the birth of "C with Classes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

### Relationship with C
C++ is designed as a superset of [[c_language_characteristics_and_usage | C]], meaning that virtually any [[c_language_characteristics_and_usage | C]] program is also a valid C++ program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. It adds zero-overhead abstractions, such as object-oriented patterns like polymorphism, encapsulation, and inheritance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This design allows it to provide low-level memory and hardware control, similar to [[c_language_characteristics_and_usage | C]], but with high-level abstractions like classes and smart pointers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

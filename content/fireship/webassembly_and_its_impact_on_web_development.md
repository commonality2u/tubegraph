WebAssembly (Wasm) is a significant [[disruptive_trends_in_the_javascript_ecosystem | disruptive force]] in the [[using_javascript_on_web_and_server_environments | JavaScript]] ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. In 2020, WebAssembly officially became the fourth language of the web, joining [[introduction_to_web_development | JavaScript]], HTML, and CSS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.

## Role of WebAssembly

WebAssembly is not intended to replace [[using_javascript_on_web_and_server_environments | JavaScript]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. Instead, it serves as a complement to [[using_javascript_on_web_and_server_environments | JavaScript]], enabling the creation of a wider variety of [[introduction_to_web_development | applications]] and significantly improving the quality of existing ones, making them perform as well as desktop [[introduction_to_web_development | applications]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.

## Real-World Applications

A notable example of WebAssembly in action is Figma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. Figma uses a [[emergence_of_frameworks_and_tools_in_modern_javascript | React]] shell, with its high-performance design tool being powered by WebAssembly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

## Language Support and Future Trends

Currently, languages like C, C++, and Rust can compile to WebAssembly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. WebAssembly support is also emerging in other languages, such as C# <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.

Microsoft's Blazer framework leverages WebAssembly to allow developers to build [[introduction_to_web_development | web applications]] using C#, HTML, and CSS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. The expectation is that more languages will be able to elegantly interoperate with [[using_javascript_on_web_and_server_environments | JavaScript]] via WebAssembly in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.

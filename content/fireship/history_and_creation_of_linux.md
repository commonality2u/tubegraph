Linux is an open-source operating system that enables human interaction with computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Origins and Development
[[History of Linux | Linux]] was created in 1991 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a> by Linus Torvalds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>, a student at the University of Helsinki <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. His primary objective was to develop a free version of the Minix operating system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>, which itself was based on Unix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Core Components
As an operating system, [[Introduction to Linux | Linux]] manages a computer's memory and processes, facilitating communication between hardware and software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. When a Linux machine starts, a bootloader loads the system into memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

At its core is the [[Linux kernel and its role | kernel]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>, which acts as the foundational element from which the rest of the operating system develops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. The kernel is structured into several smaller subsystems, including:
*   A process scheduler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>
*   Device drivers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>
*   A memory manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>

These subsystems are accessible via a system call interface, which is further wrapped by the [[History and creation of C | C standard Library]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This library offers an API that user applications can interact with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

Beyond the [[Role of Linux Kernel in Operating Systems | kernel]], applications that make the operating system user-friendly are primarily provided through the GNU project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. These include:
*   A shell for command-line interaction with the kernel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>
*   Windowing systems for desktops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>
*   Developer utilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>
*   Numerous other applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>

## Modern Usage
Today, [[Introduction to Linux | Linux]] is widely used in various environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>:
*   The vast majority of web servers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>
*   Embedded applications, such as smart TVs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>
*   Mobile devices running Android <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>

It is also considered an excellent choice for personal computers, with many [[Linux Distributions and their Origins | different distros]] available, including Debian, Arch, and Fedora <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

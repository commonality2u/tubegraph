The autoregressive approach is a method used in AI models for generating images. Unlike other popular techniques, it constructs images sequentially, pixel by pixel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>.

## How it Works

[[OpenAI GPT 40 image generator | OpenAI's GPT-4o image generator]], for example, utilizes an autoregressive approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>. This method involves generating the image one pixel at a time, proceeding from left to right and top to bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>. Images created with this technique can appear almost natural <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>.

## Comparison to Diffusion Models

This method differs significantly from a [[diffusion_algorithm_in_ai_and_image_generation | diffusion algorithm]], which is used in models like [[creating_aigenerated_images_using_stable_diffusion | Stable Diffusion]] and Midjourney <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>. Diffusion models typically generate an entire image simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>, whereas autoregressive models build the image incrementally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>.

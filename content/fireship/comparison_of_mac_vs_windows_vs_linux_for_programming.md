From: [[fireship]] <br/> 

Choosing an operating system (OS) is a significant decision for any programmer, as it impacts daily workflow and can even subconsciously influence one's approach to development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Programmers spend thousands of hours interacting with their OS, making the choice between Mac, Windows, and Linux a profound one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Developer's Journey Through Operating Systems

The speaker's personal experience includes working with all three major operating systems over more than a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

*   **Windows Experience**
    The speaker's first professional job involved a [[windows_as_an_operating_system_for_programmers | Windows machine]], utilizing technologies like Java and Oracle database for web development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.
*   **Mac Experience**
    After being fired, the speaker transitioned to remote work with a MacBook Pro, developing [[popular_programming_languages_for_web_development | Ruby on Rails applications]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
*   **Linux Experience**
    A shift occurred when it was observed that "hardcore developers" used Linux <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Following a MacBook Pro failure, the speaker built a PC, installing Ubuntu and later settling on Debian after experimenting with other distributions due to concerns about Ubuntu being considered "spyware" by Richard Stallman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

The speaker notes that "Linux" is more accurately referred to as GNU/Linux (or Gnu+Linux, the GNU plus Linux system), as Linux is just the kernel, and the full OS functionality comes from GNU core utilities and system components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. There is no single "perfect OS" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>; the speaker currently uses [[windows_as_an_operating_system_for_programmers | Windows with Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)]] for development and a MacBook Pro for travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

## Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)

When working across multiple operating systems, using an IDE that runs on all of them is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. JetBrains IDEs are highlighted as a top choice, known for sophisticated code completion and integrated tooling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. For web development, WebStorm is a popular option, offering features for JavaScript development, including an AI assistant for code suggestions, descriptions, and writing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. These IDEs are described as reliable, fun to use, with intuitive, minimal interfaces and powerful capabilities, reducing the need for numerous plugins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

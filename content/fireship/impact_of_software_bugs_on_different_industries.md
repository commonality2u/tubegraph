Software bugs, ranging from minor glitches to catastrophic failures, have significantly impacted various industries, leading to financial losses, operational disruptions, and even loss of life. These incidents underscore the critical need for robust testing and careful development practices.

## Gaming

*   **Sid Meier's Civilization (Gandhi Bug)**: In the original *Civilization* game, Gandhi's aggression level was set to an unsigned integer of one, making him a pacifist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. However, when another civilization adopted diplomacy, it would reduce aggression by two. This resulted in an unsigned integer underflow (1 - 2 = 255), maxing out Gandhi's aggression and turning him into a "thermonuclear Enthusiast" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Players enjoyed this bug so much it became an urban legend that it was later adopted as a feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Consumer Electronics

*   **Microsoft Zune Freeze (2008)**: On December 31st, 2008, every Zune device worldwide froze and became inoperable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. The issue stemmed from the device's inability to account for the extra day in a leap year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. A logic error in handling the day count meant the device could not exit a loop when reaching the 366th day, causing a permanent freeze <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

## Hardware and Microprocessors

*   **Pentium fdiv Bug (1994)**: Intel's Pentium chip occasionally returned an incorrect value during floating-point division operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. This rare bug, occurring in about 1 in 9 billion division operations, was discovered by a professor at Lynchberg College <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. The core issue was missing entries in the SRT division algorithm's lookup table, causing certain number combinations to produce incorrect results at the hardware level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

## Telecommunications and Mobile Technology

*   **Apple FaceTime Eavesdropping Bug (2019)**: A bug in Apple's FaceTime allowed users to eavesdrop on the audio of another person's iPhone before they even answered a call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. If the recipient then pressed the power button to dismiss the call, it would activate their camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. The root of the problem was the system not checking the state of the call before activating the audio stream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
*   **AT&T Long-Distance Crash (1990)**: A single faulty line of code in a software update caused a network switch to crash and reboot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. This led to a cascade of failures, as rebooting switches caused neighboring ones to fail, taking out the entire network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. The C program bug involved a `break` statement within an `if` clause within a `switch` clause, causing crucial data to be overwritten and switches to reset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. This blocked 50 million calls globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

## [[consequences_of_software_glitches_in_financial_systems | Financial Systems]]

*   **Chase ATM Glitch (2024)**: A glitch in JP Morgan Chase's banking system, which often runs on proprietary COBOL code, prevented the usual safeguard that requires checks to clear before funds can be withdrawn from an ATM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. This allowed people to withdraw tens of thousands of dollars by depositing fake checks and immediately withdrawing cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. While individuals faced legal consequences for check fraud, the incident exposed a significant vulnerability.
*   **Vancouver Stock Exchange Rounding Error (1982)**: Over two years, the Vancouver Stock Exchange index slowly decreased from 1,000 to 520 due to a minor rounding error <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. The software was truncating each stock price change to two decimal places instead of rounding, creating a cumulative rounding error over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. The index had to be completely recalculated from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.
*   **CitiBank Bad UI Disaster (2020)**: Due to a poorly designed user interface, CitiBank accidentally transferred the full loan amount of approximately $900 million instead of an intended $8 million interest payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. The software had a confusing three-screen payment process, and the interface made it appear that checking certain boxes would ensure only interest was paid, but it did the opposite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. A court later ruled in favor of the lenders, allowing them to keep the accidentally transferred funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.
*   **Night Capital Money Burn Speedrun (2012)**: Night Capital, a company using algorithms for stock market trades, accidentally linked a variable name to an outdated testing algorithm called "Power Peg" when pushing to production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>. This inactive algorithm was designed to manipulate virtual markets by buying high and selling low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. The algorithm went haywire, flooding the New York Stock Exchange with 4 million incorrect trades in 45 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>, leading to a $440 million loss and wiping out 75% of investors' equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.

## Aerospace and Transportation

*   **F-35 Fighter Jet Oxygen System (2012)**: Pilots of the F-35 fighter jet experienced hypoxia-like symptoms due to a bug in the On-Board Oxygen Generation System (OBOGS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. The underlying software was not robust enough to account for real-time variables like rapid altitude changes or pilot breathing patterns, leading to insufficient oxygen supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.
*   **Heathrow Terminal 5 Baggage System (2008)**: Days after its opening, a software bug in the complex automated baggage handling system at Heathrow Terminal 5 resulted in over 500 canceled flights and 42,000 lost bags <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. Multiple software systems failed to communicate, leading to employees being unable to log in and RFID tracking systems failing to track bags <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. The breakdown cost Â£16 million to fix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.
*   **NASA Mars Climate Orbiter (1999)**: The $125 million Mars Climate Orbiter burned up upon entering Mars' atmosphere because one software team used Imperial units (pound-force) while another used metric units (Newton-seconds) for calculations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.
*   **Ariane 5 Rocket Explosion (1996)**: The Ariane 5 rocket exploded 37 seconds after liftoff due to a software bug in its inertial reference system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. A 64-bit floating-point number was incorrectly converted to a 16-bit integer, making the rocket believe it was 90 degrees off course <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
*   **Toyota Prius Braking System (2010)**: A software bug in the anti-lock braking system of the Toyota Prius caused momentary delays in braking under certain conditions, such as icy roads or potholes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. A 0.4-second delay occurred when switching from regenerative braking to friction braking, leading to a recall of 400,000 vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.
*   **Toyota Unintended Acceleration**: Toyota faced widespread complaints, injuries, and deaths due to a software bug in the electronic throttle control system that caused cars to accelerate uncontrollably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. The code had terrible error handling logic, lacked redundancy, and was structured to allow multiple failure points that could cascade through the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. This led to a recall of 9 million vehicles and $1.2 billion in fines and settlements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.
*   **Royal Air Force Helicopter Crash (1994)**: A military helicopter crashed in foggy conditions due to its automatic throttle control system becoming overloaded and unable to cope with challenging conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>. The software was not adequately tested under these conditions, leading to pilots losing total control and 25 deaths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.
*   **Boeing 737 MAX MCAS (2018-2019)**: The Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) on the Boeing 737 MAX would automatically push the nose down to prevent a stall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>. However, it initiated this sequence if only one of two angle-of-attack sensors provided faulty data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>. This programming oversight led to two tragic crashes, Lion Air Flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302, killing 346 passengers and crew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>. The fix required both sensors to provide consistent data before MCAS activation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>.

## Cybersecurity and Internet Infrastructure

*   **Morris Worm (1988)**: Robert Morris, a Cornell graduate student, released a self-replicating computer program designed to gauge the size of the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. A bug in his code caused it to repeatedly reinfect the same computers, overwhelming their resources and crashing thousands of Unix-based systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. It took out 6,000 computers, about 10% of the internet at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. The worm exploited weaknesses in protocols like Sendmail and a buffer overflow in the finger program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. Morris received the first felony conviction under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.
*   **Heartbleed (2014)**: This vulnerability in OpenSSL, a library meant to secure internet communication, was caused by a missing bounds check in the TLS heartbeat extension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. Improper input validation allowed attackers to send malicious heartbeat requests and repeatedly request memory contents from the server, potentially gaining access to highly confidential data undetected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. Two-thirds of internet servers were vulnerable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.
*   **CrowdStrike Falcon Sensor (2024)**: A bad configuration file (Channel file 291) pushed to production by cybersecurity company CrowdStrike caused millions of Windows machines with their Falcon sensor to enter the blue screen of death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>. This resulted in hospitals shutting down, flights being canceled, and widespread operational disruptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.

## Utilities and Infrastructure

*   **Y2K Bug (Early 2000s)**: Early programmers typically used only two digits to represent years, leading to concerns that computers would interpret '00' as 1900 instead of 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. While media hysteria led to billions of dollars spent in preparation, Y2K ultimately never caused any widespread disasters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.
*   **Northeastern Blackout (2003)**: On August 14th, 2003, nearly 50 million people in the United States and Canada lost power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>. The First Energy Corporation's power grid monitoring system had poor error handling code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. If multiple alarms were generated quickly, the system would enter an unrecoverable state without notifying operators, making it appear normal while half the country was without power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>.

## Healthcare and Medical Devices

*   **Therac-25 Radiation Machine**: The Therac-25, a device used to treat cancer patients, had inadequate error handling and removed mechanical interlocks, relying entirely on software for safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>. When it encountered a race condition, it would deliver lethal radiation doses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>. At least three patients died after receiving doses 100 times higher than intended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>.

## Military and Defense

*   **Patriot Missile System (1991)**: During the Gulf War, a Scud missile killed 28 American soldiers after it should have been intercepted by the Patriot missile system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. A bug in the system's clock and timing calculations caused a 24-bit timer, which tracked time in tenths of seconds, to overflow after being in operation for over 100 hours without a reset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>. This led to incorrect information about incoming threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>.
*   **Aegis Combat System Disaster (1988)**: The Aegis combat system accidentally shot down a civilian plane from Iran, killing 290 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>. The investigation revealed that a lack of user-friendly information on the system's display and a timing lag that led to misleading altitude data contributed to the misidentification of a friendly plane as a threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>.

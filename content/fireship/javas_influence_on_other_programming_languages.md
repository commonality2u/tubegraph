[[Java]] has significantly influenced the landscape of programming languages, both directly and indirectly.

## Direct Inspiration
[[Java]] has directly inspired a class of programming languages designed to improve upon its characteristics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. Examples of these languages include:
*   Groovy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>
*   Clojure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>
*   Scala <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>
*   Kotlin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>

Additionally, [[Java]] is cited as having inspired JavaScript <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Historical Context and Legacy
[[Java]] came into being thanks to a hype campaign by Sun Microsystems during the dot-com bubble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. It was originally invented to create a better TV remote and officially launched for public use in 1996 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Its motto is "write once run everywhere" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

### Attempts in Web Development
At one point, [[Java]] tried to take over JavaScript's role in web development with Applets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. However, Applets were considered so ineffective that they inadvertently highlighted HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as a better abstraction for building user interfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## Core Characteristics and Criticisms
[[Java]] is described as a [[java_as_a_boilerplate_driven_language | boilerplate-driven language]] designed for writing verbose, [[objectoriented_and_functional_programming_in_Java | object-oriented]] code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Developers are typically forced into [[objectoriented_and_functional_programming_in_Java | object-oriented programming]] paradigms when using [[Java]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Its [[javas_verbosity_in_code | verbosity]] and [[java_as_a_boilerplate_driven_language | boilerplate]] requirements are noted, with a "Hello World" example demonstrating significantly more code than in languages like Python <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

Despite criticisms, [[Java]] remains widely used and is respected for its ability to "get stuff done" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

On August 25th, 2024, Pavel Durov, the founder of Telegram, was arrested in France, facing potential charges that could lead to up to 20 years in prison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. The charges include money laundering, fraud, sanctions evasion, and "doing terrorism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Pavel Durov and Telegram

Pavel Durov is described as one of the most interesting men globally, with a net worth of $15 billion, yet owning no assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. He created VK in Russia and is most noted for his creation of Telegram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Telegram is a social platform with over 1 billion users that does not run ads, has only 30 employees, and is engineered to be difficult for authorities to monitor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Durov once stated, "To be truly free, you should be ready to risk everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

Durov is Russian-born but holds citizenship in the UAE and France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. His French citizenship provided France with the justification to arrest and potentially imprison him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## Reasons for the Arrest

According to French authorities, the arrest stems from Telegram's "lack of moderation and cooperation with law enforcement" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. Concerns also include Telegram's use of disposable phone numbers, which facilitates cryptocurrency transfers that cannot be monitored by authorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Telegram also has its own token, which reportedly tanked after the arrest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. This situation has been compared to the Silk Road, whose founder, Ross Ulbricht, received two life sentences without parole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

Despite these accusations, some users state they have never personally witnessed illegal activity on the platform, describing Telegram as the only social platform where one can get unfiltered, uncensored information without mainstream narratives or warning labels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

## Telegram's Approach to Content and Privacy

Telegram is not entirely uncensored. If downloaded from Apple or Google App Stores, the app is required to censor a significant amount of content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. Users are advised to download the application directly from telegram.org, and many of its applications are open-sourced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

### Encryption Concerns

While authorities question how they can monitor illegal activities on Telegram if everything is encrypted, most things on Telegram are *not* [[governments_stance_on_encryption_and_legal_implications | end-to-end encrypted]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

*   **End-to-End Encryption:** This secure method involves encryption and decryption occurring on the user's device rather than on a centralized server not owned by the user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. This means only the person with the key can read the messages, not the hosting company or authorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
*   **Signal vs. Telegram:** Apps like Signal use an open-source protocol for [[governments_stance_on_encryption_and_legal_implications | end-to-end encryption]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. Telegram does implement [[governments_stance_on_encryption_and_legal_implications | end-to-end encryption]] for private chats, but "everything else is public and encrypted on the server" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. Telegram's protocol has faced criticism from security researchers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

Authorities face challenges with Telegram because its infrastructure is intentionally distributed across multiple countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. This requires coordination across various legal systems to obtain data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. Even if a hard drive is seized in one country, the data might be encrypted with a key stored in another country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

Governments, particularly in the EU, are trying to make [[governments_stance_on_encryption_and_legal_implications | end-to-end encryption]] illegal, viewing it as their "Kryptonite" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. Laws against "hate speech" are difficult to enforce in Europe and the UK if large platforms like Telegram do not cooperate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

## Potential Outcomes

One strategy for authorities is to "cut the head off the snake" by arresting the CEO and making an offer to cooperate, such as providing backdoor access, in exchange for freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. The chance of winning in court against the United States government is stated to be less than 1%, leading most individuals in federal court to plead guilty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. The future of Pavel Durov remains uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

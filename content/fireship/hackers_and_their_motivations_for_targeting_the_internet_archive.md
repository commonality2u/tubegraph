On October 10th, 2024, the [[significance_of_the_internet_archive_in_preserving_internet_history | Internet Archive]] and its [[security_issues_with_the_way_back_machine | Way Back Machine]] were significantly impacted by a series of cyberattacks, leading to an ominous message greeting visitors and the website going offline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">00:00:00</a>. This event placed the fate of the essential online archive, which stores over 890 billion web pages and nearly 100 petabytes of data, in jeopardy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">00:01:01</a>.

## Nature of the Attacks
The [[significance_of_the_internet_archive_in_preserving_internet_history | Internet Archive]] faced multiple simultaneous assaults:
*   **Data Breach** A [[impact_of_data_breaches_on_internet_history_archives | data breach]] exposed 31 million email addresses and password hashes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">00:00:40</a>.
*   **Website Defacement** The website was defaced with JavaScript graffiti, which triggered an alert message about the data breach before its official disclosure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">00:00:48</a>.
*   **Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks** The [[significance_of_the_internet_archive_in_preserving_internet_history | Internet Archive]] has been subjected to non-stop [[security_vulnerabilities_and_exploits | DoS]] attacks, a problem it has faced aggressively since May <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">00:00:50</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">00:02:58</a>.
*   **Offline Status** As of October 10th, 2024, the website remained under attack and completely offline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">00:00:51</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">00:01:13</a>.

Beyond the cyberattacks, the [[significance_of_the_internet_archive_in_preserving_internet_history | Internet Archive]] also faced a significant setback when its [[legal_challenges_faced_by_the_internet_archive_and_open_library | Open Library]] service, which digitizes physical books and lends out digital copies, lost a critical copyright infringement lawsuit to publishers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">00:00:44</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">00:02:10</a>. This ruling could lead to over $600 million in damages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">00:02:29</a>.

## Timeline of the Hacks
*   **September 30th**: HIBP (Have I Been Pwned) was informed of the [[impact_of_data_breaches_on_internet_history_archives | Internet Archive's data breach]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">00:02:43</a>.
*   **October 5th**: The data breach was confirmed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">00:02:45</a>.
*   **October 6th**: The [[significance_of_the_internet_archive_in_preserving_internet_history | Internet Archive]] was notified and given a 72-hour window before public disclosure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">00:02:46</a>.
*   **October 8th**: Brewster Kahle, founder of the [[significance_of_the_internet_archive_in_preserving_internet_history | Internet Archive]], posted about a [[security_vulnerabilities_and_exploits | DoS attack]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">00:02:53</a>.
*   **October 9th**: Kahle posted a more somber update as the [[website_security_vulnerabilities | website was defaced]] with JavaScript, triggering an alert message about the [[impact_of_data_breaches_on_internet_history_archives | data breach]] before official disclosure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">00:03:03</a>.
*   **October 10th**: The website was still under attack and completely offline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">00:03:13</a>.

## Hackers and Their Motivations
An activist group identifying as **Black Meta** claimed responsibility for the attacks, stating they would continue until all their "sister" sites were completely down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">00:03:24</a>. The group, which released a video, conveyed a political message about the situation in the Middle East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">00:03:42</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">00:03:52</a>.

However, the speaker of the video expressed skepticism regarding the stated motivations, noting that attacking the [[significance_of_the_internet_archive_in_preserving_internet_history | Internet Archive]] would not likely garner support for their cause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">00:03:56</a>. This led to the conclusion that the attack might be a false flag operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">00:03:58</a>. Despite Black Meta claiming not to be teenagers, this often implies they are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">00:03:47</a>.

The potential impact of these attacks is significant. If the [[hacker_programmer_stereotype | hackers]] gain access to the archived website data, they could potentially erase the history of the [[understanding_the_internet_and_web_infrastructure | worldwide web]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">00:01:29</a>.

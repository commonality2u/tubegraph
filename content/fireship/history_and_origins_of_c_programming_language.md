C is a statically typed, procedural programming language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It is widely recognized as a foundational language for many modern computing tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Creation and Initial Purpose

The C programming language was created in 1972 by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Its initial purpose was to develop the Unix operating system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Influence and Legacy

C is often referred to as the "mother of all languages" due to its significant influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. Its syntax has inspired a multitude of other programming languages, including C++, C#, [[History of Java programming language | Java]], [[History of JavaScript | JavaScript]], Perl, and [[History and origin of PHP | PHP]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Core Characteristics from its Origin

C compiles directly to machine code and requires minimal runtime support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. It is a platform-dependent language, meaning an executable is specifically designed to run on a particular operating system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. While considered a high-level language designed for human readability, C also provides low-level control over memory and hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

Unlike some other languages, C does not have a garbage collector; instead, programmers must manually manage memory within their code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. The language is procedural and does not inherently support object-oriented features, though complex data types can be created using structures (structs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

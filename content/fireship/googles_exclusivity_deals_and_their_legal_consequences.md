Yesterday, Big Tech changed forever when [[google_antitrust_lawsuit_and_monopoly_conviction | Google lost a significant legal battle against the US Department of Justice]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This fight began in 2020, with the Department of Justice claiming that Google violated US antitrust law and operated as a monopoly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The government accused Google of being a "filthy monopolist" that used illegal tactics to suppress competition and innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. Despite Google's lawyers calling these claims "outrageous and salacious," the judge sided with the feds, declaring Google "guilty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## The Sherman Act and Google's Violation

Google was found to have broken Section Two of the Sherman Act, a law passed in 1890 to prevent anti-competitive activities by large corporations like those in Big Oil, Tobacco, and Railroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. Section Two has two main provisions:
1.  The possession of monopoly power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
2.  The willful acquisition or maintenance of that power, which is not a consequence of a superior product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

To violate this law, a company must both dominate the market and do so through means other than simply building a better product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. Google controls 88% of the domestic search market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>, and many agree that Google offers a superior product, providing better results than early competitors like Lycos or Excite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

## The Problematic Exclusivity Deals

Google's legal troubles stemmed primarily from its exclusivity deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>:
*   **Android Devices** The requirement for Google's search engine to be the default on Android devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
*   **Mozilla Firefox** Its agreement with the Mozilla Firefox browser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
*   **Apple** A significant deal with Apple, where Google pays them 36% of search revenue, totaling $20 billion annually, to maintain its default search engine status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

The judge concluded that these agreements were anti-competitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

## Potential Future Penalties

The exact penalty for Google is not yet determined and will be decided in a separate trial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. While it's unlikely Google will be completely dismantled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>, it is possible it could be broken into multiple entities, such as having to divest Gmail or Android <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. However, Google's search business significantly subsidizes free services like Gmail and Android <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

A more probable [[potential_future_penalties_and_outcomes_for_google | outcome for Google]] is a fine coupled with contractual restrictions on these deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. This could even be beneficial for Google, as it would prevent Apple from earning substantial revenue from these agreements without contributing significant value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

## Broader [[implications_for_big_tech_companies_under_antitrust_scrutiny | Implications for Big Tech]]

Google's conviction places it alongside historical monopolies like Standard Oil and the American Tobacco Company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. This case is not isolated; Apple, Amazon, and Meta are also currently engaged in active antitrust cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. Apple is being sued by the US Department of Justice for maintaining a monopoly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>, and has already faced EU requirements to open its payment service to competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. Meta is facing a lawsuit for monopolizing the social media space through anti-competitive acquisitions like Instagram and WhatsApp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. Amazon is also battling a monopoly case, accused of disadvantaging sellers with anti-discounting measures and contracts that favor its own products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

The tech industry is a "brutal, cutthroat game," where companies either fail as heroes or endure long enough to become illegal monopolies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

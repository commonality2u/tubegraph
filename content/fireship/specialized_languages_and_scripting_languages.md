Beyond the most popular high-level languages, there exists a tier of programming languages that, while widely used, are often more specialized in their applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

## Scripting Languages

Scripting languages are designed to automate tasks and interact with the computer programmatically from the terminal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. This allows users to avoid repeatedly typing the same commands by writing a script to make the process reproducible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

Examples include:
*   **Bash** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>
*   **PowerShell** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>

## Web Development Languages

For [[building_web_apps_with_various_programming_languages | web development]], specific languages are essential for defining the user interface and content:
*   **HTML (HyperText Markup Language)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>: Used to define the structure of a website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
*   **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>: Used to define the style of a website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

While HTML and CSS are not used for "programming in the traditional sense," they arguably form a Turing-complete language when combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

## Database Languages

Most applications require a database, and the most common language for interacting with them is Structured Query Language (SQL, also known as SQL or Squeal) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. SQL is Turing-complete, but its primary use is to read and write data in a relational database rather than general-purpose programming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

## Other Dynamic Languages

While [[popular_dynamic_and_highlevel_programming_languages | Python]] and [[using_javascript_on_web_and_server_environments | JavaScript]] are popular dynamic languages, several others are better suited for specific projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. These languages typically feature a dynamic type system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

*   **PHP**: Gained popularity in the 1990s for building server-side web applications and remains widely used today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
*   **Lua**: Known for being easier and faster than Python, it is often embedded in engines like Roblox and World of Warcraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
*   **Ruby**: An easy-to-learn object-oriented language, commonly used for web applications through the Rails framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   **R**: Predominantly used in data science for statistics and data visualization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
*   **Julia**: A more modern alternative to R, also used for scientific computing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
*   **Solidity**: A statically-typed, object-oriented language specifically designed for implementing smart contracts, particularly on the Ethereum blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.
*   **Hack**: Developed by Facebook to interoperate with PHP, it was created to improve performance and add a type system for scaling large web applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.

The computing world is currently engaged in a global "arms race" to develop the most advanced ARM-based chips and dominate the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. This intense competition involves major players such as Apple, Samsung, Google, Microsoft, and even Intel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## Apple's Latest Advancement: M4 Chip

Apple recently unveiled its M4 chip, which it claims is the most powerful chip ever seen in the PC market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. The M4 boasts a CPU that is 50% faster than the M2, includes built-in Ray tracing, and its neural engine can perform 38 trillion operations per second, making it the fastest chip for [[future_developments_and_expectations_for_ai_technology | AI workloads]] on the PC market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Interestingly, Apple chose to debut the M4 at its iPad event rather than its Worldwide Developer Conference, which was only a month away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## The ARM vs. x86 Debate

Historically, personal computers running Windows or Mac OS utilized CPUs based on the x86 architecture, typically built by Intel or AMD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. The x86 architecture uses a complex instruction set (CISC), known for its versatility and speed across various computing needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

### What is ARM?

With the rise of smartphones, ARM processors became prevalent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. ARM is based on a reduced instruction set (RISC), requiring fewer transistors per instruction, which leads to greater power efficiency â€“ a critical factor for battery-powered devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

### ARM's Rise

For a long time, ARM was not considered optimal for regular computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. However, this perception changed in 2020 when Apple released its M1 chip, which resulted in laptops that were faster, quieter, and more efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. This success motivated Microsoft to initiate Project Voltera, aiming to run Windows on ARM chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

### Data Centers Embrace ARM

Data centers, including AWS, have also recognized the efficiency benefits of ARM chips in the cloud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. Consequently, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft are now developing their own ARM chips for their data centers, such as AWS Graviton and Google Axion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

### The Role of ARM Holdings

The company behind the ARM architecture, ARM Holdings, is valued at over $100 billion, yet it has never produced a single chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. Instead, it designs the architecture, which is then licensed by large companies and manufactured by foundries like Taiwan Semiconductor, which produces Apple's M series chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

## The On-Device AI Push

One of the significant selling points of the M4 chip is its powerful neural engine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

### Apple's Strategy

Apple has been relatively quiet in the [[future_developments_and_expectations_for_ai_technology | AI race]], but its goal appears to be running large language models (LLMs) directly on devices or "on the edge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. This approach offers users benefits such as offline functionality, low latency, and enhanced privacy by keeping personal data, like chat messages with an [[future_of_programming_and_ai_agents | AI assistant]], on the device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

### The Neural Engine Arms Race

However, Apple's lead in this area may be short-lived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. Qualcomm is anticipated to release its Snapdragon X Elite chip, which is claimed to outperform the M4, potentially reaching 45 trillion operations per second compared to the M4's 38 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. This chip is expected to power Windows on Surface laptops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. The fierce competition over these performance numbers stems from the belief that in the near [[future_trends_in_technology | future]], the device capable of running the best [[future_developments_and_expectations_for_ai_technology | AI model]] natively will be the most desirable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. For Apple, a company focused on hardware sales, it would be a significant setback if Microsoft laptops could run [[future_developments_and_expectations_for_ai_technology | AI]] more effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

## The Enduring Presence of x86

Despite the focus on ARM, the x86 architecture is far from dead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. It has existed for over 45 years and is so deeply integrated into modern infrastructure that it is expected to persist for a very long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. Recently, leaked documents revealed Intel's new Aerol Lake processor, designed from the ground up for lower power consumption and capable of potentially handling over 100 trillion operations per second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. AMD is also releasing its new Ryzen AI 9 chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

A clear pattern is emerging: the company that can maximize the "AI cringe level" in its branding may ultimately win this competitive race <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. This is why it's rumored that Apple will unveil the "MacBook Singularity Blaster Turbo Pro Max" at an upcoming event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

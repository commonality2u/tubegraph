The current job market for tech professionals is exceptionally strong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:52">[00:48:52]</a>.

## Current Landscape

A significant trend observed is a massive shortage of talent across many industries, leading to what is often referred to as "the great resignation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:04">[00:57:04]</a>. People are reportedly quitting their jobs to land higher-paying positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:30">[00:51:30]</a>.

## Short-Term Concerns

Despite the current strength, there are some potential warning signs on the horizon for tech jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:47">[01:04:47]</a>. Top publicly traded tech companies have experienced quiet crashes in their stock prices over recent months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:21">[01:06:21]</a>. Examples include Twilio and Cloudflare, which are down 50% from their previous highs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:42">[01:11:42]</a>. This indicates that substantial capital is shifting away from tech companies that are not profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:33">[01:15:33]</a>, which is generally not a positive indicator for tech employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:05">[01:18:05]</a>.

## Long-Term Outlook

Looking beyond short-term fluctuations, the technology sector is considered one of the safest and most advantageous places to work in the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:25">[01:22:25]</a>.

## Geographic Impact on Salaries

Location significantly impacts earning potential in the tech industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:06">[03:07:06]</a>. According to the 2021 Stack Overflow [[technology_expert_surveys | survey]], the global median salary for engineers is below $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:56">[02:51:56]</a>. However, in the United States, it increases to approximately $130,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:42">[02:57:42]</a>. Specifically, living in major tech hubs like New York City, the Bay Area, or Seattle can lead to higher salaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:20">[02:47:20]</a>. A poll conducted on this channel, with 150,000 responses, showed that only 11% of respondents were earning over $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:39">[03:00:39]</a>. Job seekers should align their salary expectations with their geographical region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:12">[03:09:12]</a>.

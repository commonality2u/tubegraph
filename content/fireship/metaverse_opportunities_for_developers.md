The metaverse is an emerging trend that presents significant opportunities for developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>. While some associate it with Mark Zuckerberg's vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>, it's important to note that Facebook (Meta) is not the only company involved; they are perceived as trying to "hijack the name" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>. Facebook's past track record of data abuse and privacy violations raises concerns about a metaverse run by them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>.

## Understanding the Metaverse Concept

The general concept of the metaverse is an internet-based platform featuring multiple access points, such as phones, VR, and AR devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>. Users would have a single profile to interact with various businesses and applications within this platform, and communicate with other users in a virtual environment, similar to VRchat or Second Life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>.

While the concept itself is considered "really cool" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>, the VR aspect may not achieve widespread mainstream adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a>. Despite the advancement of VR technology, most people are not inclined to use it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>. The idea of strapping on a headset to further detach from the real world, given existing addictions to social media and video games, does not seem like a natural human behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>.

## Developer Opportunities

Despite potential drawbacks, metaverses are actively being built, creating numerous opportunities for developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>. To enter this space, learning platforms like Unity or Unreal Engine, or 3D modeling software like Blender, would be beneficial starting points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>.

### Startup Idea: Metaverse Builder Platform

A significant opportunity lies in providing tools for others to build their own metaverse experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>. During a "gold rush" of investment and hype, "selling shovels" can be a lucrative strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>.

Consider creating a platform akin to Squarespace or Shopify specifically for the metaverse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>. This platform would enable any business to easily create a digital metaverse experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>. [[Crossplatform mobile app development | AR and VR apps]] are "extremely hard to develop" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>. By offering an accessible way for brands to enter the metaverse, developers can cater to millions of potential customers who wish to interact with their own clients in this new environment but lack the necessary technical skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>.

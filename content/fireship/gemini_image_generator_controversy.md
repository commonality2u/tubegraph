The week of February 23rd, 2024, saw significant developments for Google, including an apology regarding its AI products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. A notable controversy arose concerning the image generation capabilities of [[Google Gemini 15 AI model | Gemini]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>.

## Background of the Controversy

Users began reporting "weird behavior" with [[Google Gemini 15 AI model | Gemini]]'s image generator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>. This emerged as Google attempted to address previous criticisms directed at [[Opensource AI image generators | other image generators]] for a perceived "lack of melanin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>.

## The Problematic Behavior

When prompted to generate images of "Ginger people," [[Google Gemini 15 AI model | Gemini]] produced results described as both "hilarious and horrifying" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:52">[02:03:52]</a>. It appeared that [[Google Gemini 15 AI model | Gemini]] was designed to be so anti-racist that it "paradoxically became racist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:12">[02:09:12]</a>. This policy change, intended to diversify outputs, ultimately "made everybody mad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>.

Specific examples of the controversial outputs included:
*   "Multi-racial Nazis" which outraged the left wing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>.
*   "Multiracial founding fathers" which outraged the right wing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.

## Google's Response

The controversy culminated in an apology from Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>. In response, Google temporarily suspended [[Google Gemini 15 AI model | Gemini]]'s ability to generate images of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>.

## Future Challenges

The creator of the content stated that making everyone happy with AI image generation will be the "technical challenge of the century" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>.

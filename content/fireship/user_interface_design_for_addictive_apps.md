To achieve high daily revenue, such as the estimated four million dollars per day made by Candy Crush in 2018 from in-app purchases and microtransactions, it's essential to build mobile applications that are both highly addictive and appeal to a broad audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Most top-grossing mobile apps generate revenue by selling "useless digital products" to casual gamers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.

## Core Principles of Addictive UI [[design_techniques_in_app_development | Design]]

Effective [[design_techniques_in_app_development | user interface design]] for addictive applications should revolve around the psychological concepts of:
*   **Dopamine Hits** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>
*   **Compulsion Loops** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>

These principles involve rewarding the user regularly while simultaneously encouraging them to continue playing or engaging with the app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. The objective is to keep users consistently "chasing the dragon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

## Goal: Continuous Engagement and Sales

The ultimate aim of these [[design_techniques_in_app_development | design techniques]] is to refine "dopamine hits and compulsion loops" to drive continuous engagement and potentially generate significant daily revenue through sales of digital products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

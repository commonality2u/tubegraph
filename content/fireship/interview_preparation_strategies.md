Technical interviews are described as a high-stakes, "life or death game" for software engineers seeking a six-figure salary [00:00:14]. While the interview process may seem broken, it's something beyond your control, requiring you to "play the game" [00:00:20].

## Pre-Interview Preparation

Before an interview with a "big scary tech corporation" [00:00:59], common preparation includes:
*   Practicing "dozens of LeetCode questions" [00:01:01].
*   Completing "half finished Udemy courses" [00:01:03].

## Navigating the Technical Interview

The interview process is designed to be a "psychological rollercoaster ride" [00:00:27]. Success hinges on mastering [[problem_solving_under_pressure | high-pressure problem solving]] and effective communication [00:00:31].

### Managing Anxiety and Composure
One unexpected strategy to combat anxiety during an interview is to reach a point where you "don't care anymore," as this can magically make the anxiety dissipate [00:02:06]. Maintaining composure is critical, especially when facing challenging moments [00:04:09].

### The Importance of Problem Discussion
Before writing any code, it's crucial to first "talk about the problem" [00:02:01]. This involves:
*   **Decomposing the problem:** Breaking it down into smaller, understandable components [00:02:41].
*   **Visualizing or pseudocoding:** Representing your logic with a flowchart or by writing pseudocode to avoid worrying about syntax or boilerplate early on [00:02:19].

### The ABC Rule: Always Be Chatting
A key to impressing interviewers, even if your coding isn't perfect, is to "think out loud and explain your decisions throughout the process" [00:03:16]. Saying something is almost always better than saying nothing [00:03:36]. This practice, dubbed the "ABC rule," means "always be chatting" [00:03:55]. It takes practice to become comfortable talking while coding [00:03:49].

### Asking Questions
If you become confused or "freeze up," avoid silence by asking a question [00:03:58]. This shows engagement and prevents losing composure [00:04:03]. For example, clarifying program input/output requirements can help steer you in the right direction [00:04:16].

### Demonstrating Technical Knowledge
When coding, choose an implementation language you are comfortable with, like JavaScript [00:03:00].
*   **Consider performance implications:** Even if not entirely correct, explaining why you choose a particular loop (e.g., `for` over `forEach` for perceived better performance) demonstrates thought process [00:03:22].
*   **Avoid language-specific "magic":** Prefer solutions that are common across multiple languages, like the modulo operator, over techniques that rely on the "loosely typed nature of JavaScript" [00:05:25]. This is because your interviewer might have a different background, like a C developer with extensive experience [00:05:30].

### Evolving Your Solution
Interviewers might ask you to refine your code, for instance, to handle more conditions or improve efficiency.
*   **Handling multiple conditions:** When faced with many conditions, try to "extract the data out of that statement" by defining a variable to mutate [00:06:23]. This approach can "scale better if we decide to add additional words" [00:06:48].
*   **Understanding Big O Notation:** Be prepared to describe the performance of your algorithm in terms of [[how_to_flex_as_a_programmer | Big O time complexity]] [00:07:08]. For example, an algorithm iterating 100 times can be considered linear time complexity (O(N)) if it were to go on forever, but constant time (O(1)) because it's limited to 100 steps [00:07:22].

> [!CAUTION] The narrative highlights the challenge of [[common_coding_interview_questions | common coding interview questions]] like FizzBuzz, noting that even seemingly simple problems can induce panic [00:01:44]. The use of [[ai_tools_in_web_development | AI tools]] like GitHub Copilot might be kept "on the download" during an interview [00:06:38].

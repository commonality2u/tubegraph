JavaScript, initially conceived by Brendan Eich in 1995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>, was intended to be a language like Java but for the web <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. It was primarily designed for a single use case: "to annoy people with browser pop-ups" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. However, it evolved to be used for [[developing_web_apps_with_nextjs | web applications]] and server-side development.

## Bringing JavaScript to the Server

A significant shift occurred in 2005 when Ryan Dahl introduced JavaScript to the server with [[introduction_to_nodejs | Node.js]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. This move was humorously described as an "Epic mistake" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Ryan Dahl later expressed regret for his creation, stating, "it's my fault and I'm very sorry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

### Server-Side Use Cases

Despite its original design, JavaScript is now extensively used for various applications, including the creation of "unreliable APIs with [[building_a_restful_api_with_nodejs_and_express | Express.js]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Challenges in JavaScript Development

Developing with JavaScript, especially on the server side, presents several challenges:

*   **Module Systems**
    JavaScript includes multiple module systems like CommonJS and ESM, which can lead to uncertainty about whether an installed package will function correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
*   **Module Bundling**
    After development, deploying a JavaScript application often requires learning module bundling tools such as Webpack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

## Evolution and Perspective

Despite its perceived flaws and challenges, JavaScript has evolved into an "awesome language in 2022" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. For many developers, it continues to be a primary tool for programming and a source of livelihood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

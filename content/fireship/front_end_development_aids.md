Effective utilization of [[developer_productivity_tools | tools]] is crucial for [[introduction_to_web_development | developers]] to work smarter and increase productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This article highlights several [[web_application_tools_for_developers | web application tools for developers]] that are personally used and recommended by a [[frontend_and_backend_development_layers | front-end web developer]] / [[frontend_and_backend_development_layers | back-end engineer]] / UX designer, and are useful throughout the product creation process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. All listed tools are free and built with web technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

## Featured Tools

### Bundle Phobia

Bundle Phobia is a [[web_application_tools_for_developers | web application]] that helps determine how much an NPM package will add to a project's total bundle size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. For modern [[frontend_ui_libraries_and_frameworks | front-end frameworks]], keeping the bundle size small is important to optimize initial page load for new users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. It allows users to enter a package name to see its bundle size, download time, and whether it's tree-shakable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Users can also upload their `package.json` file to rank all dependencies by size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

### Cloudcraft

Cloudcraft is a [[web_application_tools_for_developers | web application]] designed for planning and budgeting cloud infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. Currently supporting AWS, it provides an intuitive drag-and-drop interface to connect different cloud services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Once infrastructure is in place, it offers an estimated breakdown of total costs, which translates well to other major clouds like Azure and GCP due to similar pricing models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

### Figma

Figma is a well-known design tool for drawing graphics and creating mock-ups for applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. It offers both a desktop and an equally performant [[web_application_tools_for_developers | web app]], achieving high performance through WebAssembly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. Its web-based nature allows project access from any machine without effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. Figma is praised for its streamlined interface, providing essential features without unnecessary clutter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. For app developers, it allows mock-ups of events and exporting styles as CSS, Android, or iOS styles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

### Font Flipper

Font Flipper is an [[web_application_tools_for_developers | Angular]] and [[introduction_to_web_development | Firebase]]-built [[web_application_tools_for_developers | web app]] dedicated to helping users choose fonts for their designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. With hundreds of free fonts available on Google Fonts, this tool simplifies the selection process by allowing users to bring in their own graphics and experiment with different fonts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. It features a focused and simple UI and a "Tinder-style" swiping interface for font selection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

### VizBug

VizBug is a Chrome extension released in 2019 that enables visual interaction with websites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. It provides a toolbar and visual indicators on DOM elements, allowing users to measure elements, move things around, and change styles live in the browser without writing CSS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. This feature is powerful for getting designs to a desired state and then copying the generated CSS from the inspector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. It also allows searching for specific element types, such as links, which are then highlighted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

### Insomnia

Insomnia is a [[software_engineering_and_development_tools | back-end tool]] used for debugging APIs, supporting both REST and GraphQL APIs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. It helps organize the entire workflow by allowing users to save reusable values, avoiding repetitive HTTP requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. The tool has a well-designed UI and offers features like automatic introspection for GraphQL APIs, providing "Intellisense" for queries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.

### Flare

Flare is another design tool, specifically for creating 2D vector animations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. Like Figma, it allows drawing graphics, but additionally includes keyframes to control motion over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. Flare is part of the open design movement, enabling users to view and learn from other designers' work directly on the site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. A key feature is its ability to export graphics to work in Flutter, simplifying the implementation of high-performance animations in native mobile apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.

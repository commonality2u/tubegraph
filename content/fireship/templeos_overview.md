TempleOS is an open-source, 64-bit operating system designed to be the Third Temple prophesied by the Bible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It was created in 2005 by Terry Davis, a programmer diagnosed with schizophrenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Creator and Vision

Terry Davis wrote the entire operating system himself at his parents' house in Las Vegas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. He believed he was God's chosen programmer and implemented features described as a modern-day way of speaking in tongues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Technical Aspects

TempleOS includes a bootloader, kernel, window manager, 3D graphics library, and multiple games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. These components are powered by his own compiler and a custom programming language called [[Holy C programming language | Holy C]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Amazingly, the entire system fits in under 100,000 lines of code, totaling 1.4 megabytes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

### Graphics and Display
The operating system renders graphics at a resolution of 640x480, limited to 16 colors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

### The [[Holy C programming language | Holy C]] Language
The underlying language, [[Holy C programming language | Holy C]], resembles C or C++ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. It features functions that can be invoked without parentheses or arguments and uses just-in-time compilation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. This means it also doubles as a shell language that can be executed directly from the terminal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

### System Architecture
Unlike other operating systems such as [[Introduction to Linux | Linux]] or Windows, TempleOS operates in "ring zero only" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. This means everything, including user programs, happens directly within the kernel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. Users have complete control over the operating system source code and hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. The system also takes advantage of multiple CPU cores, with each core receiving its own immortal set task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

### Source Code Accessibility
The entire source code is readily available due to the Red Sea file system, allowing users to modify and reboot the system with changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

## [[Unique features of TempleOS | Unique Features]]

### Immortal Tasks
Upon startup, TempleOS creates a single immortal task named "Adam," which acts as the father of every other task, similar to the biblical figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

### Divine Interaction
Users can "speak in tongues" by hitting F7, which generates a pseudo-random word from "God" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Additionally, Shift+F6 allows "God" to draw a picture, performing a "God doodle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

## Getting Started

To get started with TempleOS, you can download the ISO file from its website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. A tool like VirtualBox can then be used to configure a 64-bit operating system that boots this file on startup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

Once inside, users can take a tour or explore the personal menu (Ctrl+M), which offers a huge variety of applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. These include 3D first-person shooters, 2D strategy games, simulations like "After Egypt" (where you play Moses), and utilities for managing finances and making music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

## Legacy

TempleOS stands as one of the most complex pieces of software ever written by a solo developer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Sadly, Terry Davis passed away in 2018 at the age of 48 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>, remembered as both a highly controversial internet personality and a genius programmer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

The world of programming languages is vast and varied, with many options available, especially for those venturing into [[introduction_to_web_development | web development]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>. This article explores some of the most popular and influential languages used in this field, categorized by their typical use cases and characteristics.

## Getting Started: Beginner-Friendly Languages

For those new to coding, certain languages are designed to simplify the learning process:

*   **Scratch** Developed at MIT, Scratch allows users to drag and drop code blocks like LEGO bricks to represent programming concepts such as variables and control flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>. It makes the thinking process behind programming highly accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.
*   **BASIC (Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code)** Originating from Dartmouth in 1964, BASIC provided fundamental commands like `print`, `go to`, and `for`, becoming the go-to option for learning to code for decades due to its inclusion in most personal computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.

## Dynamic High-Level Languages

These languages are widely adopted and enable developers to build a broad range of applications:

*   **Python** Many people begin their programming journey with Python due to its minimal syntax, which uses indentation instead of curly braces or semicolons for code blocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>.
*   **[[state_of_javascript_in_modern_development | JavaScript]]** Despite its "ugly" syntax, [[state_of_javascript_in_modern_development | JavaScript]] is a fundamental requirement for [[introduction_to_web_development | web development]], and most developers will interact with it at some point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. It's often said that "any application that can be written in [[state_of_javascript_in_modern_development | JavaScript]] will eventually be written in [[state_of_javascript_in_modern_development | JavaScript]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>. Learning either Python or [[state_of_javascript_in_modern_development | JavaScript]] can equip a developer to build almost anything imaginable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.

## Specialized Web Development Languages and Tools

This tier includes languages and tools that are very popular but often serve more specific roles in web development:

*   **HTML and CSS** When combined, HTML and CSS are used to define the structure and style of a website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>. While not "programming languages" in the traditional sense, denying their importance could lead to immediate cancellation in the tech community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>.
*   **SQL (Structured Query Language)** For applications requiring a database, SQL is the most common language used to read and write data in relational databases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.
*   **[[phps_role_in_web_development | PHP]]** [[phps_role_in_web_development | PHP]] became popular in the 1990s for easily building server-side web applications and remains widely used today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>.
*   **Ruby** An object-oriented language that is easy to learn, Ruby is frequently used for building web applications, especially with the Rails framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>.

## Statically Typed Languages

As software complexity increases, developers often seek more rigid frameworks, leading to the use of statically typed languages:

*   **TypeScript** Developed by Microsoft, TypeScript extends [[state_of_javascript_in_modern_development | JavaScript]] by adding a type system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>. This makes it significantly easier to manage large, complex [[state_of_javascript_in_modern_development | JavaScript]] projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>.
*   **C#** Also from Microsoft, C# is similar to Java but often receives more favorable reception from its users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>. It's used to build web and desktop applications using the .NET framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>.

## Modern Specialized Languages

Beyond the mainstream, several modern languages are designed for specific purposes or to address contemporary challenges:

*   **Hack** Developed by Facebook, Hack is designed to interoperate with [[phps_role_in_web_development | PHP]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:26:00">[09:26:00]</a>. Facebook initially built its website with [[phps_role_in_web_development | PHP]] but needed a language with better performance and a type system to scale up its massive operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:31:00">[09:31:00]</a>.
*   **Elixir** This concurrent functional programming language features a pleasant Ruby-like syntax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:00">[06:28:00]</a>. It is capable of building high-performance, real-time web applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>.
*   **Elm** A purely functional language, Elm compiles to [[state_of_javascript_in_modern_development | JavaScript]] and can be used to build front-end user interfaces with zero runtime errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:00">[06:37:00]</a>.

## Working Smarter, Not Harder

A controversial opinion among developers is that "lazy programmers are the best programmers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>. This can be rephrased as working smarter, not harder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>. A more accurate term for "lazy" in this context might be "clever" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>. Excessive hard work can sometimes prevent a developer from seeing a better, simpler solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>.

## The Value of Taking Breaks

A common phenomenon experienced by all developers is getting stuck debugging an issue for hours, only to solve it almost immediately after taking a short break <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>. This highlights the benefit of being "lazy" in some situations: taking a break allows one to return to the [[problem_solving_under_pressure | problem]] with a fresh perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>.

## Continuously Learning New Skills

When an inefficiency is suspected in one's workflow or code, it can be valuable to dedicate a few hours to [[learning_to_code_as_a_skill | learning a new skill]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>. For example, learning how the modulus operator works could save time compared to implementing an infinite `if/else` statement for checking odd numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>.

## Googling as a Core Development Skill

The ability to use Google effectively is considered a highly important skill for a developer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>. It's generally accepted that it's acceptable not to know everything, but a developer should be able to find answers through efficient searching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>. The daily work of most developers revolves around [[problem_solving_under_pressure | problem solving]] for business needs, rather than theoretical algorithm implementations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>. Therefore, knowing how to use Google efficiently is a crucial skill for any experienced developer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>.

## Prioritizing Readability in Code

While there's a debate between optimizing code for readability versus performance, the general approach should be to write the most readable code first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:00">[08:48:00]</a>. Performance optimization should only be pursued if performance genuinely becomes a problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:00">[09:01:00]</a>. In most cases (90% of the time), the performance difference between readable and highly optimized code is too insignificant to matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:04:00">[09:04:00]</a>. The ultimate goal is to write code that is simple and self-describing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:32:00">[08:32:00]</a>.

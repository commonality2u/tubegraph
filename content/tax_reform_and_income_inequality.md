This article summarizes the principles of [[georgism_and_land_value_tax | Georgism]], its proposed solutions to [[economic_inequality_and_rent_seeking | economic inequality]], and its potential for tax reform, based on a podcast discussion with Lars Doucet, author of "Land is a Big Deal." Doucet's work expands on the 19th-century economist Henry George and his book "Progress and Poverty." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>

## Core Tenets of Georgism

Georgism, at its heart, posits that "land is a big deal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a> and that its unique role in the economy is often underrated. The philosophy addresses the central paradox of why poverty seems to advance even as technological and economic progress occurs. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>

### 1. Land as a Unique Factor of Production
Georgism distinguishes land from labor and capital. While labor and capital are produced by humans, land (in its natural, unimproved state) pre-exists human effort. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a> The value of specific locations, often summarized by the real estate aphorism "location, location, location," <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a> is seen as socially created by the presence and activity of the community, population growth, and public infrastructure.

### 2. The Land Value Tax (LVT)
The primary policy prescription of Georgism is the **Land Value Tax (LVT)**. This is a tax levied on the unimproved value of land only, specifically excluding any buildings, infrastructure, or other improvements made by humans. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a> The goal is to tax the "rent" derived from land, which Georgists see as an unearned income.

### 3. Addressing "Progress and Poverty"
Henry George sought to explain why, despite industrial and technological advancements that increase overall wealth, poverty and inequality persist and even grow. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a> Georgism argues that the benefits of progress are largely captured by landowners in the form of increased land rents and values. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>

### 4. Pro-Worker and Pro-Business
Georgism aims to be genuinely pro-worker and pro-business by opposing land speculation and unproductive rent-seeking. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a> The idea is that if the earth's resources (land) are shared more equitably, both labor and capital can retain more of the value they create.

## Economic Rationale and Arguments

### Taxing Unproductive Rent-Seeking
The moral and economic justification for LVT is to tax unproductive rent-seeking and monopolies, particularly those gatekeeping access to essential, non-produced resources like land. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a> By taxing things people haven't made, Georgism aims to encourage productive activities (labor and capital investment) by reducing taxes on them. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>

### Ricardo's Law of Rent
A foundational concept is Ricardo's Law of Rent, which states that as population and productivity in an area increase, the economic advantages and amenities created are absorbed into higher land values and rents. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:04">[00:35:04]</a> This means landowners, rather than the workers or businesses generating the progress, often capture the primary financial benefits.

### The American Frontier Analogy
Doucet describes America as a nation with a "frontier state" mindset that has effectively lost its frontier. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:54">[00:20:54]</a>
*   **First Frontier:** The westward expansion, where free or cheap land was available. Its closing led to the Gilded Age problems Henry George observed. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>
*   **Second Frontier:** The advent of the automobile, allowing suburban expansion. This "frontier" has also largely closed as the benefits of suburban living near urban centers became fully priced into land values. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>
The closure of these frontiers concentrates wealth and exacerbates inequality, as access to desirable locations becomes increasingly expensive.

## Addressing Criticisms and Concerns

### Why Aren't Landowners Already Maximizing Land Use?
Landowners may not develop land to its fullest potential due to:
*   **Speculation:** Holding land vacant or underutilized, waiting for prices to rise further ("land banking" or waiting for land to "ripen"). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>
*   **Existing Property Tax Systems:** Current systems often tax improvements, disincentivizing development. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>
*   **Low Holding Costs:** Without LVT, the cost of holding land idle can be minimal, encouraging speculation. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>

### The "Search Theoretic" Critique (Gautenar/Kaplan)
This critique suggests that identifying valuable land (e.g., finding oil) is an improvement itself, deserving of reward. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:33">[00:24:33]</a>
*   **Response:**
    *   This critique primarily applies to a 100% LVT; a lower rate (e.g., 85%) would still leave incentive for discovery. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:56">[00:25:56]</a>
    *   For resources like oil, [[fracking_and_its_geopolitical_consequences | Norway's model of subsidizing discovery costs while taxing extraction]] (severance tax) shows an alternative. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:58">[00:26:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>

### Impact on Banking and Property Values
A sudden, full implementation of LVT could cause land selling prices to drop significantly, potentially impacting mortgages and the banking sector. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:39">[00:32:39]</a>
*   **Response:** Any transition would likely be incremental, allowing time for adjustments. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:44">[00:33:44]</a> Doucet likens this to the economic disruption from abolishing slaveryâ€”difficult but morally necessary. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:18">[00:33:18]</a>

### Distribution of Wealth: Are the Wealthiest Landowners?
While some tech billionaires are highly visible, Doucet argues many billionaires are in finance and hedge funds, heavily involved in real estate. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:47">[00:40:47]</a> More importantly, a significant portion of land wealth, especially valuable commercial real estate in city centers, is held by a class of "hidden landed gentry," extracting wealth from productive individuals and businesses. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:36">[00:42:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:25">[00:44:25]</a> For instance, a family of four earning $100,000 in San Francisco is considered below the poverty line, largely due to housing costs. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:46">[00:42:46]</a> (also mentioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>)

### Transitional Gains Trap (Gordon Tullock)
People who bought land at high prices (e.g., second-generation taxi medallion owners) might be unfairly harmed if the system changes abruptly. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:13">[00:57:13]</a>
*   **Response:** An incremental approach, starting with a revenue-neutral shift from taxing buildings to taxing land, combined with a citizen's dividend, could mitigate this. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:22">[00:58:22]</a> Provisions like deferring LVT for low-income elderly homeowners until sale or death can also address specific hardships. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:56">[00:58:56]</a>

### Practical Calculation of Land Value
Separating land value from improvement value is a challenge. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:53">[01:02:53]</a>
*   **Response:** Land selling value is derived from its rental value (potential income flow). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:01">[01:00:01]</a> If land still has a selling price, its full rental value isn't being captured by tax. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:19">[01:01:19]</a> Modern mass appraisal techniques, including multiple regression and geographic weighted regression, can improve assessment accuracy. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:03">[01:02:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:30">[01:03:30]</a>

## Implementation and Political Feasibility

### Revenue Use
LVT revenue could:
1.  Replace existing taxes on productive activities like income, sales, and capital gains. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:30">[00:48:30]</a> Doucet notes that some theories suggest all taxes ultimately come out of rent, implying LVT could replace many others. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:10">[00:50:10]</a>
2.  Fund public services or a Universal Basic Income (UBI)/Citizen's Dividend. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:35">[00:48:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:54">[00:49:54]</a>
Doucet estimates that a U.S. LVT could raise around $4 trillion annually, potentially funding Social Security, Medicare/Medicaid, or defense. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:52">[00:48:52]</a>

### Incremental Approach
A practical first step is a **split-rate property tax**, where land and buildings are taxed at different rates. The rate on buildings would be set to zero, while the rate on land would be adjusted to collect the same total revenue initially. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:31">[00:51:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:31">[00:58:31]</a>

### Advantages Over Other Taxes
*   **Reduced Deadweight Loss:** LVT is considered economically efficient as it doesn't disincentivize production.
*   **Less Invasive:** Unlike income tax, LVT doesn't require extensive personal financial surveillance. The tax is on the land parcel, regardless of who owns it. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:31">[00:54:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:56">[00:29:56]</a> (referring to burdens of income tax).

### Political Viability
Pitched as [[political_feasibility_of_land_value_tax | property tax reform]] (exempting buildings), LVT could gain broad support. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:11">[01:25:11]</a> Examples of Georgist-inspired policies or discussions exist in places like Detroit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:54">[01:27:54]</a> and Norway (resource severance taxes). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:03">[01:28:03]</a>
The Texas constitution's "uniformity clause" for property taxation presents a local challenge that may require reinterpretation or amendment. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:13">[01:26:13]</a>

## Applications Beyond Physical Land

### Digital Realms and "Land-Like" Assets
Georgist principles can apply to "land-like assets" that are scarce, necessary for production, and derive locational value. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:23">[01:16:23]</a> Examples include:
*   Domain names <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:16">[01:17:16]</a> (Vitalik Buterin has written on this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:20">[01:17:20]</a>)
*   Platform chart positions (e.g., app stores) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:44">[01:18:44]</a>
*   Radio spectrum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:34">[01:19:34]</a>
*   Orbital real estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:34">[01:19:34]</a>
*   Long copyright/patent terms (potentially by shortening terms to return ideas to the commons sooner). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:22">[01:19:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:56">[01:23:56]</a>

### Space Colonization
The Outer Space Treaty currently prevents national claims on celestial bodies, treating space like international waters. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:17">[01:21:17]</a> Applying Georgist principles could prevent first-mover rent-seeking and ensure resources are shared or their value is captured for broader benefit as space is developed. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:27">[01:22:27]</a>

## Lars Doucet's Work

### "Land is a Big Deal"
Doucet's book, which won Scott Alexander's book review contest for its review of "Progress and Poverty," expands on Henry George's ideas for a modern audience. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>

### GeoLand Solutions (Startup)
Doucet is co-founding a startup (working name GeoLand Solutions) focused on improving municipal mass appraisal of property taxes. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:33">[01:02:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:19">[01:35:19]</a> The company aims to make assessments more accurate, efficient, up-to-date with modern methods, and transparent, leveraging open-source and open-data solutions. [[open_source_software_and_cultural_dynamics | Open-source]] strategies are integral to this approach. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:50">[01:35:50]</a> This work is seen as a practical step towards making Georgism both implementable and more easily advocated for by accurately measuring land values. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:04">[01:36:04]</a> The startup has received funding, including from Sam Altman. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:57">[01:36:57]</a>

Doucet's interest was significantly sparked by observing "virtual housing crises" in online multiplayer games like [[game_development_and_virtual_land_speculation | Ultima Online]], where artificially scarce virtual land led to speculation and accessibility issues, mirroring real-world problems. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>

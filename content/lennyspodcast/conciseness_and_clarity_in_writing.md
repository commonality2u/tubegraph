Effective communication is paramount for leaders and individuals seeking to advance in their careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:10">[05:09:10]</a>. Poor communication can lead to confusion, skepticism, and apathy, ultimately hindering desired outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. Improving this skill involves taking agency and constantly reflecting on how one can explain things more clearly, be more compelling, and anticipate questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

## The Impact of Unclear Communication

The "blast radius" of a poorly written memo or message is significantly larger than most people realize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:52">[00:30:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:17">[00:36:17]</a>. A confusing Slack message in a channel with many people can lead to extensive back-and-forth communication, wasting everyone's time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:19">[00:46:19]</a>. Conversely, taking a moment to review and clarify a message can enable recipients to act immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:49">[00:48:49]</a>.

## Achieving Conciseness

Conciseness is often misunderstood as simply being brief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>. Instead, it's about the "economy of words" and the density of the insight being shared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>. A 300-word memo can be meandering, while a 1,000-word memo can be tight and concise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>.

The primary bottleneck to being concise is often a lack of clarity about one's own core point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>. To cut to the chase, you must first know what the "chase" is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>.

### The Power of Preparation

The most consistent solution for conciseness is preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>. Even a few minutes of preparation before a meeting or conversation can significantly improve focus and the ability to communicate concisely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>. Before a meeting, consider:
*   Why are you there? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:57">[00:21:57]</a>
*   What do you want to share? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>
*   What do you want to get out of it? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:02">[00:22:02]</a>

### Tactics for Written Conciseness

*   **Self-Reminders**: Consciously remind yourself to be concise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:52">[00:22:52]</a>. This often leads to trimming at least 20% of initial text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>.
*   **Reduce Cognitive Load**: Ask yourself if there's a tighter, clearer way to present information or make a recommendation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:04">[00:23:04]</a>.
*   **Review Your Work**: Always review what you've written at least once before sharing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:53">[00:23:53]</a>. This helps catch typos, grammar issues, and unnecessary words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:25">[00:24:25]</a>.
*   **Primary vs. Secondary Information**: Consider placing primary messages upfront (e.g., in Slack) and secondary details in a thread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:29">[00:29:29]</a>.

## Enhancing Clarity Through Structure and Formatting

[[using_structure_to_improve_on_the_spot_communication|Using structure]] helps guide the reader and signals what information is coming next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:44">[00:27:44]</a>.

### Signposting
Using specific words and phrases, known as "signposting," improves clarity in both written and verbal communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:39">[00:27:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:06">[00:29:06]</a>. This helps to:
*   Guide your audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:48">[00:27:48]</a>.
*   Signal what is coming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:51">[00:27:51]</a>.
*   Grab people's attention back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:35">[00:29:35]</a>.

Examples of signposting words:
*   "For example" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:06">[00:28:06]</a>
*   "Because" (to share rationale) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:12">[00:28:12]</a>
*   "As a next step" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:15">[00:28:15]</a>
*   "First," "second," "third" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:22">[00:28:22]</a>
*   "The most important part to pay attention to is..." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:11">[00:29:11]</a>
*   "The part that we were most surprised by is..." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:17">[00:29:17]</a>

### Formatting
While formatting like bolding and bullets can be helpful, overuse diminishes their effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:50">[00:29:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:05">[00:30:05]</a>.
*   **Use sparingly**: If everything is bolded, nothing is highlighted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:05">[00:30:05]</a>.
*   **Avoid excessive bullet points and sentence fragments**: Use complete sentences to show the logical flow and connective tissue between ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:17">[00:30:17]</a>. Relying on fragments can be a "crutch" and indicates that an idea may not be fully thought out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:52">[00:30:52]</a>. This aligns with the "Amazon six-page memo" philosophy, where prose writing forces deeper thinking and crystallization of ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:41">[00:31:41]</a>.

## Finding the Right Level of Confidence

Communicating effectively requires accurately representing your level of conviction and evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:12">[00:43:12]</a>.

*   **Avoid Overconfidence**: Do not state hypotheses as if they are facts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:53">[00:42:53]</a>. Use phrases like "this could X," "this might X," or "this will increase the likelihood of X" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:03">[00:43:03]</a>. It's crucial to be honest if something is an initial hunch, as misrepresenting conviction can lead to wasted resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:24">[00:43:24]</a>.
*   **Avoid Underconfidence**: If you have strong reasons to recommend something, it's "irresponsible" to diminish your expertise or act unsure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:33">[00:44:33]</a>. While allowing for others' decisions, don't undermine your valuable insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:24">[00:44:24]</a>.
*   **Share Your Point of View with Evidence**: Have a point of view and a recommendation, then back it up with logic, first principles, examples, or data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:11">[00:45:11]</a>. This enables more specific and productive discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:44">[00:45:44]</a>. Frame it with phrases like "my initial thinking is..." or "based on what we know, my hunch is..." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:51">[00:45:51]</a>.
*   **Avoid Being a "Single-Minded Martyr"**: Don't just advocate for your agenda. Instead, consider the broader organizational context and what's best for the company as a whole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:02">[00:48:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:04">[00:49:04]</a>. This helps right-size investments and ensures alignment with company priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:50">[00:49:50]</a>.

### [[Crafting compelling presentations|Anticipating Objections: The MOO Framework]]
MOO stands for "Most Obvious Objection" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:28">[00:50:28]</a>. Many times, people feel blindsided by questions in meetings, but by spending even two minutes anticipating obvious objections, you can prepare a response or frame your communication to address them proactively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:42">[00:50:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:01">[00:52:01]</a>. This also helps crystallize your own thinking and identify potential gaps in your plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:57">[00:52:57]</a>.

### Giving Feedback: Strategy Not Self-Expression
When giving feedback, the goal should be to motivate behavior change, not simply to vent frustrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:04">[01:06:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:03">[01:07:03]</a>. Trim 90% of what you initially want to say and focus only on what will help the person understand the benefit of changing, both for themselves and others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:29">[01:06:29]</a>. Before the conversation, vent to a trusted friend or therapist to release emotional energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:24">[01:07:24]</a>.

### Delegating Effectively: The CEDAF Framework
To delegate effectively while maintaining high standards, use the CEDAF framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:05">[01:10:05]</a>:
*   **C - Comprehension**: Ensure the recipient has everything they need to understand the task and desired outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:22">[01:10:22]</a>.
*   **E - Excitement**: Explain the "why" behind the task to make it as exciting as possible, connecting it to larger goals or career development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:45">[01:10:45]</a>.
*   **D - De-risk**: Anticipate and mitigate obvious risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:08">[01:11:08]</a>. For example, have them complete a small portion of the task first to check for understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:35">[01:11:35]</a>.
*   **A - Align**: Provide opportunities for the recipient to ask questions and confirm alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:59">[01:11:59]</a>. This helps uncover misunderstandings early <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:30">[01:12:30]</a>.
*   **F - Feedback**: Establish the shortest possible feedback loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:42">[01:12:42]</a>. Instead of waiting a week, check in daily or even brainstorm initial steps within the same conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:59">[01:12:59]</a>.

This framework emphasizes an "upfront investment" of time to save significant time and prevent issues later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:52">[01:13:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:57">[01:13:57]</a>. It's also highly applicable to [[developing_a_product_vision_and_communicating_it_effectively|delegating to AI]] and agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:07">[01:14:07]</a>.

## General Principles for Improving Communication

*   **Self-Reflection**: If you're not getting the desired reaction, ask: "How might I be contributing?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
*   **Practice Consistently**: Treat every interaction, even with cross-functional team members, as "game day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. Don't save your best communication for executives only, as consistent practice is essential for skill development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.
*   **Measure Outcomes**: Pay attention to how quickly and enthusiastically you get the desired reaction from recipients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:15">[00:33:15]</a>.
*   **Experiment Incrementally**: Instead of trying to incorporate too many tactics at once, pick one thing to try and practice it in various settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:40">[00:34:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:05">[00:35:05]</a>. Building communication skills is a habit that requires patience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:24">[00:35:24]</a>.
*   **Recognize Compounding Effects**: Minor improvements in daily communication (e.g., a few minutes on a Slack message or email) compound over time to significantly impact overall work quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:29">[00:36:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:17">[00:37:17]</a>. Don't prematurely claim "diminishing returns" on efforts to improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:01">[00:38:01]</a>.

## Tools and Resources for Writers

*   **Recommended Books**:
    *   *On Writing Well* by William Zissner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:55">[00:26:55]</a>.
    *   *Stein on Writing* by Sol Stein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:01">[00:27:01]</a>.
    *   *On Writing* by Stephen King <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:05">[00:27:05]</a>.
    *   *A Series of Short Sentences* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:17">[00:27:17]</a> (focuses on the power of short sentences).
*   **The Swipe File**: Collect examples of well-articulated phrases, strategic statements, or effective arguments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:04">[01:17:04]</a>. The act of adding to the file trains you to notice what works well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:50">[01:17:50]</a>. These can be stored simply, even in a messy file, as the process itself is valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:27">[01:19:27]</a>.

## AI as a Communication Aid

AI tools like Claude can serve as excellent thought partners for drafting and refining communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:20">[01:20:20]</a>.
*   **Initial Drafts**: Use AI to generate initial drafts of emails or responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:30">[01:20:30]</a>.
*   **Provide Context and Intent**: The quality of AI output significantly improves when you share your point of view, the problem you're trying to solve, and your ideal outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:46">[01:20:46]</a>. For example, explain *why* you need to decline an invitation and the relationship you want to maintain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>.
*   **Iterative Refinement**: After receiving an AI draft, edit it to your voice and then ask the AI for further improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:33">[01:21:33]</a>. AI often shortens feedback loops by breaking tasks into smaller chunks and checking for alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:58">[01:15:58]</a>.

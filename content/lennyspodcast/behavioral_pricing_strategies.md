[[Willingness to pay conversations in product pricing | Pricing]] is often quickly associated with dollar figures, but it should be viewed as a measure of value, indicating if people truly want and would buy a product. Entrepreneurs and companies should consider this early to ensure they are on the right track <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This perspective highlights the "willingness to pay conversation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

Madhavan Ramanujam, author of *Monetizing Innovation*, emphasizes that pricing is not just an art but a science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:06">[01:09:06]</a>. His book focuses on how companies can design products around price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:03">[01:11:03]</a>. [[Willingness to pay conversations in product pricing | Willingness to pay]] is key to understanding if customers value a product and how badly they want it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:47">[01:12:47]</a>.

## What is Behavioral Pricing?
[[Unique pricing and product adoption strategies | Behavioral pricing]] involves tapping into the irrational modes of human decision-making, not just the rational ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:33">[01:16:33]</a>. It's about understanding that people don't always make purely rational choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:43">[01:16:43]</a>. Product teams can use this understanding to build and frame products in a way that appeals to both the rational and irrational sides of the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:55">[01:16:55]</a>.

### Key Behavioral Pricing Tactics

### 1. The Compromise Effect (Good, Better, Best)
This tactic involves offering three product tiers, where the middle option becomes the most attractive. It leverages the psychological tendency for people to avoid extremes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:12">[01:20:12]</a>.

> "People avoid the extremes. If you are quality conscious, you go to the right; if you're budget conscious, you'll go to the left, but most people will compromise in between." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:16">[01:20:16]</a>

*   **Example: SaaS Product Tiers** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:24">[01:17:24]</a>
    *   A company had three products priced at \$49, \$79, and \$149 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:47">[01:17:47]</a>.
    *   The \$49 product offered too many features, leading 60-70% of customers to choose it, giving away too much value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:52">[01:17:52]</a>.
    *   By understanding that the pricing was inelastic between \$79 and \$99, they moved the middle price from \$79 to \$99 and the top tier from \$149 to \$199 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:08">[01:18:08]</a>.
    *   They then introduced a new product at \$299, acting as a "decoy" to make the \$99 product appear even more attractive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:32">[01:18:32]</a>.
    *   This re-framing, with no product changes, resulted in a 30%+ increase in MRR and ARPU, as more people shifted to the \$99 product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:02">[01:19:02]</a>.

*   **Example: Movie Theater Popcorn** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:18">[01:19:18]</a>
    *   A small popcorn costs \$7. An extra-large popcorn with butter costs \$8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:20">[01:19:20]</a>.
    *   Customers are nudged to buy the extra-large option because, for just one more dollar, it seems like a much better deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:27">[01:19:27]</a>. The \$7 option serves as a decoy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:31">[01:19:31]</a>.

### 2. Pennies a Day Effect (Framing)
This tactic involves framing the price in smaller, more digestible units to make it seem more affordable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:14">[01:21:14]</a>.

*   **Example: Monthly vs. Daily Pricing** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:20">[01:21:20]</a>
    *   Stating a price as "\$30 per month" is perceived differently than "\$1 per day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:20">[01:21:20]</a>.
    *   AWS uses this effectively, where individual unit prices are very low, but bills accumulate with high usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:30">[01:21:30]</a>.
*   **Example: Annual vs. Monthly Subscriptions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:50">[01:21:50]</a>
    *   If an annual subscription is \$29.99 (effectively \$2.50/month) and a monthly subscription is \$40/month, messaging the annual plan as "\$29.99/month" (or the monthly equivalent) makes it more attractive than "\$360 a year" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:03">[01:22:03]</a>. Reframing makes the higher value option seem more appealing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:24">[01:22:24]</a>.

### 3. Razor/Razor Blade Model
This model makes the initial product (the "razor") inexpensive or free to attract customers, while profit is generated from recurring sales of consumables (the "blades") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:34">[01:23:34]</a>.

*   **Examples:**
    *   Razors themselves: The handle is cheap, but replacement blades are costly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:40">[01:23:40]</a>.
    *   HP printers: The printer is affordable, but ink cartridges are expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:53">[01:23:53]</a>.
*   **SaaS Application:** For a SaaS product, the base platform might be made attractive with a lower upfront price to encourage onboarding. Customers then pay for "consumables" or chunks of usage over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:58">[01:22:58]</a>. This is appealing because there is less scrutiny on the upfront cost compared to a full Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) calculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:17">[01:23:17]</a>.

### 4. Panini Effect (Compulsion to Complete)
Named after Panini sticker albums, this effect taps into the human compulsion to complete tasks or collections. By presenting products or features as parts of a "puzzle" or collection, customers are encouraged to acquire more items to feel a sense of completion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:43">[01:24:43]</a>.

*   **Example: Product Portfolio as a Puzzle** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:43">[01:24:43]</a>
    *   Even in complex industries like financial services, if a company lists its products but then visually presents them as a "puzzle" with empty slots for products not yet acquired, customers feel a compulsion to complete the set.
    *   This can lead to a significant increase in attach rates (40-50% more people taking additional products) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:01">[01:25:01]</a>.
*   **Example: Customer Loyalty Programs** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:19">[01:25:19]</a>
    *   Food delivery or ride-hailing platforms could show a "weekly puzzle" where completing certain rides or orders fills in parts of the puzzle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:25">[01:25:25]</a>.
    *   Starbucks' Bingo card is another example of this principle, encouraging specific behaviors to complete the "card" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:44">[01:25:44]</a>.

### Psychological Price Thresholds
Understanding psychological price thresholds is also a key element of [[Unique pricing and product adoption strategies | behavioral pricing]]. These are specific price points where consumer perception of value or expensiveness dramatically shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:21">[01:27:21]</a>.

*   **Testing for Thresholds** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:17">[01:27:17]</a>
    *   By asking customers "What do you think is an acceptable price for this innovation?", "What do you think is an expensive price?", and "What do you think is a prohibitively expensive price?", companies can identify these thresholds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:43">[01:26:43]</a>.
    *   An "acceptable price" means customers love both the product and the price, ideal for growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:03">[01:27:03]</a>.
    *   An "expensive price" is value-priced, where customers are neutral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:16">[01:27:16]</a>.
    *   A "prohibitively expensive price" is one where customers would reject the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:23">[01:27:23]</a>.
    *   Crossing a threshold, like from \$99 to \$101, can cause a steep drop in the demand curve as a significant percentage of customers perceive the product as expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:29">[01:27:29]</a>.

*   **General Thresholds** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:12">[01:28:12]</a>
    *   Common examples include \$29 (often equated to "\$1 a day") and \$9.99 (popular in subscriptions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:55">[01:26:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:58">[01:27:58]</a>.
    *   However, specific thresholds depend on the product, category, and competitive alternatives, requiring testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:07">[01:27:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:53">[01:27:53]</a>.

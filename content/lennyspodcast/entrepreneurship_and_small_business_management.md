Jason Fried, co-founder and CEO of 37signals (makers of Basecamp and HEY), advocates for an alternative approach to building a successful business, contrasting with the common "go big or go home" venture capital model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. He emphasizes the importance of profitability and sustainable growth over rapid, often unprofitable, expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## The Bootstrapping Advantage

Starting a business by bootstrapping, or self-funding, offers entrepreneurs more practice in the fundamental skill of making money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This approach stands as a viable alternative to the prevalent industry narrative of raising significant capital to achieve "unicorn status" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Very few companies actually "make it" through the venture-backed route <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. There is significantly more opportunity to build a successful business by exploring other paths beyond the outlier of massive scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

### When Venture Capital Makes Sense
Raising venture capital can be necessary for certain types of companies, particularly those requiring significant upfront capital expenditures like building cars, opening restaurants (needing ovens, rent), or hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. Businesses like Airbnb or Uber, which require massive initial pushes to achieve broad availability and trust, are also examples where venture funding might be essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:07">[00:32:07]</a>.

However, for software businesses, which are inherently cheap to start and have high potential margins (ideally 80-90%), venture capital can be detrimental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. Silicon Valley's model has paradoxically made the most profitable style of business the least profitable due to high headcounts and exorbitant customer acquisition costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

### The Problem with Venture Funding
When companies take on venture capital, they are typically expected to lose money for a long time to achieve rapid, massive growth, aiming to make much more money in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. This path usually leads to a single outcome: "go huge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. If a venture-backed company fails to meet this expectation, it often "withers on the vine and dies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

Having too much money often creates sloppiness, as there's no immediate pressure to be efficient or profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:49">[01:16:49]</a>. Investors provide money to be spent, primarily on people and marketing, which can lead to rapid expansion without a focus on fundamental profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:28">[01:17:28]</a>. Companies that don't practice making their own money from the start often struggle when economic cycles shift and capital becomes scarce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:57">[01:18:57]</a>.

## The 37signals Model: A Case Study in Profitability

37signals operates as a unique company with no investors, no board, and no plans to go public or sell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:51">[01:03:51]</a>. They have been profitable for 24 consecutive years, serving over 100,000 customers and generating tens of millions of dollars in profit annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:07">[01:01:07]</a>. This profit directly benefits the founders and employees due to the absence of investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:20">[01:01:20]</a>.

The company prioritizes profit over other metrics like revenue or growth targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. Their focus is on making more money than they spend, maintaining healthy margins to allow for experimentation and enjoyment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.

### [[lessons_in_leadership_and_team_management | Small Teams]] and Efficiency
Despite having a large customer base, 37signals maintains a relatively small team of around 75 employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. This contrasts sharply with competitors like Asana (1600 employees) or Slack (2500 employees) who serve similar customer numbers but often lack profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.

Key aspects of their small-team efficiency:
*   **Focus on efficiency, not growth** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.
*   **No salespeople** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.
*   **Limited product versions and pricing tiers** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>. Basecamp, for instance, has a maximum price of $299 for unlimited users, simplifying development and support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.
*   **Intentionally avoiding unnecessary spending**, even when affordable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>.
*   **Belief in constraints, simplicity, and small teams** to stay honest and deliver great work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>.

> "Small is not just a stepping stone; small is a great destination itself." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>
> "You don't need to outdo the competition. It's expensive and defensive. Underdo your competition. We need more simplicity and clarity." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>

## Defining Success

For 37signals, success is deeply tied to the enjoyment and worthiness of the work itself, rather than external metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>. They prioritize doing work they want to repeat, viewing the business as a continuous journey. Profitability is a collective measure for all their efforts, not a per-product P&L <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>.

They do not have financial goals, OKRs, KPIs, or specific revenue or growth targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>. The ultimate measure is simply making more money than they spend annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>.

### The Concept of [[longterm_vision_and_entrepreneurship | Infinite Games]]
Inspired by the book "Finite and Infinite Games," Jason Fried believes in playing infinite games—activities that never end and derive joy from the continuation itself, such as building relationships or a company you want to work at forever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:15">[01:17:15]</a>. This contrasts with finite games, which have defined endpoints like selling a business or achieving a promotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:29">[01:17:29]</a>.

Fried views his career as a long continuum of building things he likes and selling them to like-minded people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:50">[01:17:50]</a>. He sees [[entrepreneurship_lessons_and_strategies | entrepreneurship]] as a job, and his goal is to create a company he wants to work at indefinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:01">[01:19:01]</a>. This contrasts with the typical venture route that often forces founders to stop doing what they enjoy through acquisition or public offerings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:15">[01:19:15]</a>.

### Stayups, Not Startups
The term "startup" dominates the industry, but starting a business is often easier than sustaining one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:25">[01:20:25]</a>. Being in business is the harder part, requiring endurance through plateaus and fluctuating profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:28">[01:20:28]</a>. Jason Fried prefers to celebrate "stayups" – businesses that endure and continue to operate successfully over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:55">[01:20:55]</a>.

## [[engineering_leadership_and_management_strategies | Ways of Working]]

37signals employs a unique [[leadership_and_management_development | leadership and management development]] framework called **Shape Up**, which focuses on fixed-time, fixed-team development cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:36">[01:33:36]</a>.

*   **Six-Week Cycles**: Projects are given an "appetite" of no more than six weeks, rather than an "estimate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:01">[01:34:01]</a>. This forces teams to find the simplest, most effective version of a feature within that budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:33">[01:34:33]</a>.
*   **Two-Person Teams**: Each feature is developed by a maximum of two people—one programmer and one designer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:01">[01:12:01]</a>. This avoids large, slow projects with excessive meetings and indecision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:15">[01:15:15]</a>.
*   **Shaping the Work**: Before development, the work is "shaped," meaning the core problem, boundaries, and desired outcome are defined, but the specifics of execution are left to the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:17">[01:35:17]</a>. Teams create their own tasks and are empowered to make "trade-offs" and "concessions" during development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:33">[01:35:33]</a>.
*   **Project Termination**: If a project doesn't reach completion within its allocated time and is still in the early, uncertain phase ("left side of the hill"), it typically "dies" (is abandoned) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:13">[01:36:13]</a>. This prevents demoralizing, endlessly running projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:11">[01:37:11]</a>.
*   **Cooldown Periods**: After each six-week cycle, a two-week "cooldown" period allows teams to wrap up loose ends, fix bugs, or work on pet projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:49">[01:42:49]</a>. This provides replenishment and prevents burnout from continuous "sprints" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:45">[01:43:45]</a>.

> "Business planning is a fantasy. I don't plan long term because I want to do what I think, not what I thought." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:02">[01:03:02]</a>

### Decision-Making by Gut and Instinct
37signals' decision-making is heavily driven by intuition, gut feelings, and opinion, rather than solely by data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:56">[01:43:56]</a>. Jason Fried believes that all human decisions are ultimately judgment calls, influenced by countless known and unknown factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:37">[01:44:37]</a>.

*   **Trusting Judgment**: They seek executives with "judgment and experience," recognizing these amorphous qualities are more valuable than the ability to read spreadsheets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:04">[01:45:04]</a>.
*   **"How Does This Feel?"**: This question is central to their discussions about design, features, and even specific words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:02">[01:48:02]</a>. They acknowledge that humans are primarily feeling creatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:27">[01:48:27]</a>.
*   **Hiring for Taste**: When hiring designers and product people, Jason looks for their taste, what products or work they admire, and their ability to riff on ideas from their gut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:10">[01:51:10]</a>. This "play" mentality is crucial to their product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:50">[01:54:50]</a>.

## [[challenges_and_opportunities_for_indian_entrepreneurs | Challenges and Learnings]]

One common cause of failure when people try to adopt 37signals' advice is attempting rapid, 180-degree changes too quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:41">[01:56:41]</a>. Just as a physical object with mass takes energy to change direction, a company's ingrained working methods have momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:15">[01:57:15]</a>. Incremental adoption on low-criticality projects is advised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:25">[01:40:25]</a>.

> "Pretty much every business is a spectacular failure. It just is." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:52">[01:57:52]</a>

Jason Fried acknowledges a significant change in his own mindset: while he once thought he would be satisfied working on a single product (Basecamp) for his entire career, he realized a few years ago that he wanted to create more things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:57">[01:00:57]</a>. This led to the creation of HEY and now the new "Once" product line, reflecting a renewed "maker" identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:38">[01:01:38]</a>.

### Work Isn't War
37signals actively rejects the pervasive military metaphors in business language, such as "conquer the market," "capture mind share," or "destroy the competition" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:55">[01:09:55]</a>. Such language can create a depressing and destructive mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:26">[01:11:26]</a>. They prefer words that are "additive and alternative," focusing on creation, pride, and excitement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:57">[01:10:57]</a>.

## Advice for Aspiring Entrepreneurs

Starting a business is inherently hard, especially without existing capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:53">[01:11:53]</a>. The most critical advice for bootstrapped entrepreneurs is to **stay as small as possible for as long as possible** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:16">[01:12:16]</a>.

*   **Control Costs**: Focus intensely on controlling your own costs, as this is the only thing you can truly control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:19">[01:12:19]</a>.
*   **Do It Yourself**: Figure out how to do as much as possible on your own before bringing on a second person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:41">[01:12:41]</a>.
*   **Avoid Unnecessary Spending**: Don't spend on branding, an office, or unnecessary tools initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:13">[01:13:13]</a>. Utilize cheap online services for basic needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:34">[01:13:34]</a>.
*   **Embrace Simplicity**: Things are relatively simple until you make them complicated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:52">[01:13:52]</a>.

> "No one ever went broke making a profit." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:03">[01:23:03]</a>
> "You can go broke generating a lot of revenue. A lot of companies do, but you can't go broke generating a profit." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:10">[01:23:10]</a>

### [[business_sustainability_and_profitability | The Value of Constraints]]
Constraints, such as limited money, force creativity and efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:35">[01:19:35]</a>. Without them, businesses can become sloppy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:59">[01:16:59]</a>. Bootstrapping teaches or even forces entrepreneurs to figure out how to make money, honing this crucial skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:53">[01:17:53]</a>.

## "Once" Product Line

37signals is launching a new brand called "Once," a line of non-SaaS business software products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:32">[01:24:32]</a>. This venture explores a "pay once" model, where customers download and install the software on their own servers, eliminating recurring subscription fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:42">[01:24:42]</a>.

The motivation behind "Once" is to address "subscription fatigue" and offer an alternative to the prevailing rental model of software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:56">[01:23:56]</a>. They aim to target "commodities" in the business software market—areas with many similar alternatives still charging high, luxury prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:16">[01:25:16]</a>. The goal is to create beautifully tight, simple, essential "generics" of very high quality that focus on the core 80% of functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:53">[01:25:53]</a>. These products can be built quickly with small teams and have zero marginal maintenance costs for 37signals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:07">[01:26:07]</a>.

The first product under "Once" will be a relaunch of **Campfire**, an old group chat tool originally created by 37signals in 2006, years before Slack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:01">[01:27:01]</a>. Campfire will be available for a one-time fee under $1,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:13">[01:33:13]</a>. Users will receive 1.x updates for free and have the option to purchase major version upgrades at a discount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:01">[01:32:01]</a>.

A unique aspect of "Once" products is that customers will receive the **source code**, allowing them to inspect, modify, or extend the software for their own use, though not to resell it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:57">[01:28:57]</a>. This provides a level of control and transparency not found in subscription software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:33">[01:29:33]</a>. Additionally, the first product aims to have as few words as possible, making it instantly available and universally usable without extensive localization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:44">[01:29:44]</a>.

The "Once" initiative represents a new realm of creative exploration for Jason Fried and 37signals, offering alternatives in the market and firing up their passion for building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:37">[01:30:37]</a>.

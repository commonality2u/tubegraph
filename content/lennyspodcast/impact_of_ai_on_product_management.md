The field of product management is undergoing significant changes, influenced by several factors including the predicted impact of generative [[ai_in_product_management | AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. This has led to uncertainty among leaders and a need for product professionals to adapt and evolve their skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>.

## General Impact and Challenges

The CEO of Nvidia, Jensen Huang, has even suggested not learning programming due to the disruptive potential of [[ai_in_product_management | AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>. While the exact timeline is uncertain, the impact of [[ai_in_product_management | AI]] is expected to be very real <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>.

[[ai_in_product_management | AI]] is anticipated to compound the "reckoning" for product owners on delivery teams and product managers on feature teams, as companies realize these roles might not be as essential as once thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:31">[00:29:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:45">[00:29:45]</a>.

## Changing Role and Required Skills

While the core principles of an empowered product manager remain stable, the techniques they use are undergoing radical changes due to generative [[ai_in_product_management | AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:16">[00:50:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:20">[00:50:20]</a>.

Initially, the advice was to start with tools like ChatGPT, but this has changed because people were trusting the results too literally and seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:38">[00:50:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:15">[00:51:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:38">[00:51:38]</a>. The revised recommendation is to first think through an answer, then use ChatGPT to improve, challenge, or tighten the argument <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:15">[00:51:15]</a>.

[[ai_in_product_management | AI]] can be used for various tasks, including creating product requirement documents (PRDs), developing strategy, and even triaging bugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:48">[00:51:48]</a>. In the short term, [[ai_in_product_management | AI]] can enhance communication and writing skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:17">[00:52:17]</a>.

Looking ahead five to ten years, some product management skills may be significantly impacted or even become obsolete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:30">[00:52:30]</a>. Roles primarily focused on backlog administration are particularly vulnerable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:01">[00:53:01]</a>. Many administrative tasks performed by feature team project managers can be done, at least significantly, with [[ai_in_product_management | AI]]'s help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:22">[00:53:22]</a>.

For empowered product managers, the core challenge of ensuring value (for the customer) and viability (for the business) remains, with viability becoming even more crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:51">[00:53:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:09">[00:55:09]</a>. This includes navigating implications of probabilistic versus deterministic software, legal and ethical considerations, and mission-critical decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:56">[00:53:56]</a>.

It is strongly advised for product managers to up-level their skills to stay relevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:55">[00:52:55]</a>.

### AI in Product Development Tools

Some product development tools are already incorporating [[applications_of_ai_in_enhancing_productivity_for_product_managers | AI]] to enhance productivity for product managers:

*   **Sprig:** This [[applications_of_ai_in_enhancing_productivity_for_product_managers | AI]]-powered platform helps product teams collect relevant product experience insights from users through precise targeting of in-app studies based on user characteristics and actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23">[02:23]</a>. Sprig's [[applications_of_ai_in_enhancing_productivity_for_product_managers | AI]] layers on top of studies to instantly surface major product learnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44">[02:44]</a>. It can analyze data across all studies to centralize important product opportunities, trends, and correlations in a real-time feed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00">[03:00]</a>.
*   **EPO:** An AB testing and feature management platform, EPO helps increase experimentation velocity and unlock rigorous deep analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28">[03:28]</a>. It offers advanced statistical methods to shave weeks off experiment time, an accessible UI for deeper performance analysis, and out-of-the-box reporting to avoid prolonged analytic cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07">[04:07]</a>.
*   **Vanta:** A trust management platform that uses [[applications_of_ai_in_enhancing_productivity_for_product_managers | AI]] (vAI) to save hours by completing security questionnaires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00">[04:00]</a>.

## Key Takeaways

> "If you are fundamentally a backlog administrator, good luck protecting that because already people are doing that. It's only a matter of time before that becomes pretty well supported. So, that is not a good job prospect." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:01">[00:53:01]</a>

> "For an empowered product manager, if your responsibility is value and viability... that's kind of the real challenge left with [generative] AI is viability becomes even more important." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:48">[00:53:48]</a>

The impact of [[ai_in_product_management | AI]] necessitates product managers to raise their game, focusing on core responsibilities of value and viability, and adapting to new techniques while fundamental principles remain stable.

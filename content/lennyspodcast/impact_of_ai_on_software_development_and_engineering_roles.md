The rise of AI is profoundly impacting software development and engineering roles, shifting responsibilities and redefining valuable skills. AI is increasingly capable of handling significant portions of coding tasks, leading to a re-evaluation of how engineers operate and what they prioritize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>.

## Shifting Engineering Focus

Traditionally, an engineer's work falls into three main buckets:
*   What to solve for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>
*   How to solve it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>
*   Solving it (pure execution) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>

With AI, the "solving it" aspect, which involves the pure execution of code, will largely be handled by AI, potentially accounting for over 90% of software creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>. AI's ability to deeply understand codebases also means it will increasingly assist with the "how to solve it" phase, by suggesting solutions based on best practices and organizational environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>.

This shift means future engineering will concentrate on:
*   Identifying the most crucial business problems to solve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>
*   Determining essential application and product capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>
*   Prioritizing tasks and making the correct technical decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>

The role of a developer is transforming from primarily writing code to extensively reviewing AI-generated code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.

## Future of Education and Skills

While AI handles more coding, the value of a Computer Science (CS) degree remains relevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>. A CS degree primarily teaches problem-solving principles and how to break down complex problems, rather than just writing code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>. Understanding underlying systems like operating systems, memory, and computation speeds helps engineers make better design decisions and understand application performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>.

### Essential Skills for the AI Era

In addition to foundational technical knowledge, "agency" is becoming an undervalued but crucial skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a>. This refers to the drive to build, innovate, and take initiative, rather than just following prescribed paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:03">[00:22:03]</a>. In a rapidly evolving field, companies need individuals with high agency who can push boundaries and disrupt existing norms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:36">[00:22:36]</a>.

It is advised to get hands-on experience with AI tools as quickly as possible. This practical engagement allows individuals to become a "force multiplier" within their organizations by leveraging these tools for maximum advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:57">[01:10:57]</a>. For instance, a product manager could use an AI coding tool to make edits to a codebase and push changes directly, gaining significant respect and effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:44">[01:11:44]</a>.

## Impact on Product Development and Roles

The **[[impact_of_ai_on_product_development | impact of AI on product development]]** is significant:
*   Engineers are able to produce more technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
*   The Return on Investment (ROI) of building technology has increased, leading to a potential increase in hiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
*   AI tools empower non-developers, such as go-to-market teams, to build custom applications that previously would have required purchasing third-party SaaS products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:14">[00:50:14]</a>. This reduces the need for external software and allows for highly customized internal tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:37">[00:50:37]</a>.
*   Verticalized niche software products are likely to face strong competition from internal AI-powered development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>.
*   The ability for domain specialists to build their own tools means companies can create custom software with specific integrations, solving pain points that off-the-shelf products often cannot address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:51">[00:51:51]</a>.
*   [[Impact of AI on Product Management | Product managers]] can leverage AI tools to flesh out ideas and even prototype or implement changes without extensive external engineering resources, proving their concepts more effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:21">[00:53:21]</a>.

Companies are advised to continuously "cannibalize" their existing products every 6 to 12 months, aiming to make them appear "silly" or "dumb" compared to new AI-driven innovations. This proactive disruption, rather than mere incremental iteration, is key to long-term success in the rapidly evolving AI landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:20">[01:07:20]</a>.

## Hiring in the AI Age

Even with AI-driven productivity gains, companies specializing in AI product development like Kodium (developers of Windsurf) continue to hire engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>. This is because:
*   Engineers do more than just write code; they review, test, debug, design, deploy, and navigate code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:29">[01:04:29]</a>.
*   While AI can significantly speed up the coding phase, the overall process (design, testing, deployment, etc.) still has a critical path that limits total speedup (Amdahl's Law) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:39">[01:04:39]</a>.
*   Increased productivity per engineer means the ROI of building technology rises, encouraging companies with high technology ceilings to invest even more in engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:56">[01:05:56]</a>.

Companies like Kodium maintain a high technical bar for hiring and seek individuals who are passionate about the mission and willing to work hard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>. They prefer to hire only when a function is truly "underwater" and desperately needs more support, fostering ruthless prioritization and ensuring every team member is crucial and contributing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:41">[00:24:41]</a>. This "dehydrated entity" approach to hiring ensures focus and avoids internal politics that can arise from having excess staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:41">[00:24:41]</a>.

When interviewing engineers, Kodium is "okay" with candidates using AI tools, as they are seen as productivity improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:24">[00:33:24]</a>. However, they still look for fundamental problem-solving abilities demonstrated through whiteboarding and critical thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:58">[00:33:58]</a>.

## Organizational Structure in AI Companies

Some AI-focused companies, particularly those building products for developers, may operate with lean or no dedicated product managers for core engineering teams. Instead, engineers are expected to flex into more product-oriented roles, leveraging their intuition and understanding of the user base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:03">[01:01:03]</a>. For enterprise-facing teams, where customer requirements like compliance (e.g., FedRAMP) are complex and not inherently understood by engineers, product strategy roles are established to bridge the gap between customer needs and technical capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:44">[01:01:44]</a>.

Teams are often kept small ("two-pizza teams") and flexible, allowing leaders to remain deeply involved in the technology and quickly adapt to new priorities in a fast-moving space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:27">[01:02:27]</a>. This flat structure emphasizes that an individual's value is not tied to team size, but rather to their ability to execute complex projects with minimal resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:06">[00:30:06]</a>.

In summary, the [[Impact of AI on Product Management and Development | impact of AI on product management and development]] and engineering roles is a complex interplay of increased productivity, shifting skill requirements, and evolving organizational structures, all pointing towards a future where human ingenuity and agency remain paramount in leveraging powerful AI tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

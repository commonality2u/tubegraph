Building a sales team, particularly in a B2B SaaS environment, is often misunderstood by founders and product leaders, yet it is crucial for a company's growth and survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. Sales in B2B is fundamentally about [[Sales strategies for startups | solving problems]], not just selling commodities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:03">[00:43:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:28">[00:37:28]</a>.

## Necessity of a Sales Team

For B2B businesses, the question is not *if* a sales team is needed, but *when* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:26">[00:26:26]</a>. While self-serve products like Canva or early Slack can defer sales hires, most B2B companies will eventually require a sales motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. If early customers require effort, have security questions, or need onboarding, founders must be honest about the need for sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. Running from sales, even if founders find it "icky," can lead to significant revenue loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.

## When to Hire Your First Salesperson

The ideal time to [[Hiring the right salespeople | hire the first salesperson]] is after a founder has personally closed the first 10 customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:47">[00:24:47]</a>.

Key indicators:
*   **Founder Time Commitment**: If a founder spends more than 20% of their time on sales calls, it's time to seek leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.
*   **Repeatable Process**: A founder should be able to articulate a somewhat repeatable sales process to new hires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:06">[00:25:06]</a>. Founders, often described as "A+ middlers," are excellent at discussing their product and the market, even if they aren't skilled at initial outreach or closing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.

## Initial Sales Hires: Who to Look For

Founders should start by hiring two sales representatives, not just one, to allow for A/B testing of human performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:06">[00:42:06]</a>.

### Qualities of Early Hires
The most critical criterion for the first few reps is that the founder would personally buy their own product from them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>.
*   **Product Gurus**: Early sales teams must be product experts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:34">[00:31:34]</a>, understanding the "10x feature" that drives purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>.
*   **"Quirky Pirates and Romantics"**: These hires might not have traditional sales backgrounds, but they possess extra IQ points and have "fallen in love" with the nascent product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>.
*   **Experience**: They should have a few years of B2B sales experience and sufficient maturity to be trusted with precious early leads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:15">[00:26:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:39">[00:26:39]</a>.
*   **Love of Money and Craft**: Great salespeople love both money and the craft of sales, including honing scripts and beating competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:14">[00:28:14]</a>.

### Interview Process for Early Hires
Interviewing for early sales roles requires patience; a founder might need to interview 30 candidates to find one or two suitable hires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>.
*   **"Sell Me This App"**: Candidates should be able to sell the product, demonstrating theyâ€™ve researched it (e.g., watched explainer videos) and understand its core problem-solving capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:48">[00:35:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:26">[00:36:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:11">[00:37:11]</a>.
*   **Reference Checks**: Do not skip reference checks, as early hires are crucial and lead conversion is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:08">[00:41:08]</a>.
*   **Product Difficulty**: Ideal hires have experience selling a product that was *harder* to sell than yours, often from a less dominant company in a competitive space or a more technically complex product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:02">[00:55:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:24">[00:57:24]</a>.

## Hiring a VP of Sales

A common mistake is hiring a VP of Sales too early <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>.
*   **Timing**: A VP of Sales should be hired *after* two sales representatives are consistently hitting quota and closing deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:43">[00:26:43]</a>. Their role is to scale from 3 to 300 reps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>.
*   **"Stretch VP"**: The first head of sales should typically be a "stretch VP," someone who was a director or senior director previously and is looking for career growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:29">[01:02:29]</a>. Avoid seasoned VPs who may not want to actively sell or understand the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:32">[00:27:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>.
*   **Active Involvement**: The VP of Sales must actively participate in deals and understand the product deeply. They should ideally carry a bag (close sales themselves) or join calls with reps 20-30 hours a week, especially in early stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:29">[00:23:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:51">[00:26:51]</a>.
*   **Interview Question**: A key question is, "What do you want to do your first 14 days?" The answer should involve meeting customers and prospects, not focusing solely on internal processes like Salesforce setup or territory planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:34">[00:30:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:38">[00:31:38]</a>.

## Compensation and Quota for Sales Hires

Founders often overthink compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:32">[00:45:32]</a>.
*   **Market Rate**: Pay market rate for sales talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:34">[00:46:34]</a>.
*   **Base vs. Bonus**: A common split is 50% base salary and 50% on-target earnings (OTE) from commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:07">[00:47:07]</a>.
*   **Early Incentives**: For the first three months, allow reps to keep 100% of what they close to help them put "supper on the stove" and build momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:09">[00:46:09]</a>. This acts as a ramp-up and should be limited to one quarter max <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:44">[00:53:44]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Goal**: A sales rep should ultimately bring in 3 to 5 times what they take home in total compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:52">[00:47:52]</a>.
*   **Don't Fear High Earnings**: If a rep makes a lot of money, it means they are bringing in much more revenue for the company, which is a sign of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:21">[00:53:21]</a>.

## Sales Team Structure and Evolution

The sales organization often scales in "rules of eight" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:06">[01:00:06]</a>.
*   **Roles**:
    *   **SDR (Sales Development Representative)**: An entry-level position (often fresh out of school), paid typically 60-80k OTE (US-based SaaS), whose job is to "email for dollars, dial for dollars," and screen inbound leads to pass to Account Executives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:50">[01:00:50]</a>.
    *   **AE (Account Executive)**: More seasoned professionals responsible for closing deals, with compensation ranging from 90k-200k OTE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:36">[01:06:36]</a>.
    *   **Director of Sales**: Manages AE teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:49">[01:00:49]</a>.
*   **Management Ratio**: Approximately 8 SDRs or AEs need one manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:43">[01:00:43]</a>.
*   **Promotions**: Aim to promote 50% of managers from within and hire 50% externally to bring in new perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:37">[01:03:37]</a>. A VP of Sales' ability to source better managers under them is crucial for scaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:17">[01:03:17]</a>.

## [[Collaboration between product and sales teams | Collaboration Between Product and Sales Teams]]

Healthy tension between product and sales is a sign of a well-run B2B company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>.
*   **Product Involvement in Sales**: The head of product (VP of Product) should be deeply involved in sales, especially in large deals, acting as a "mini CEO" to make commitments and address customer needs that sales reps might not understand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:28">[01:10:28]</a>. Product leaders should constantly talk to customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:09">[01:23:09]</a>.
*   **Feature Requests from Sales**: To manage sales' feature requests, allocate a fixed "budget" (e.g., 10% of story points or resources) to the head of sales each quarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:46">[01:13:46]</a>. This forces the sales leader to prioritize needs and load balance feature requests across the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:49">[01:14:49]</a>. Weekly meetings between product and sales leadership help align priorities and discuss this budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:05">[01:16:05]</a>.
*   **Product Managers and Sales Reps**: While product managers and sales reps should have informal hallway conversations, critical decisions and commitments regarding the roadmap should be pushed up to their respective VPs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:56">[01:18:56]</a>.

## General Advice for Founders and Product Leaders

### Becoming Better at Sales
*   **Focus on Next Steps**: Founders and product leaders, being good at demos and product discussions, should learn to always ask for a clear "next step" at the end of every meeting, even if it's not a direct close <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:44">[01:27:44]</a>. This could be scheduling another demo for a different stakeholder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>.
*   **Recommended Resources**:
    *   SaaStr University: A free resource with good courses on sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:41">[01:29:41]</a>.
    *   *From Impossible to Inevitable*: A book co-authored by Jason Lemkin and Aaron Ross that delves into scaling sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:56">[01:29:56]</a>.
    *   Pavilion: A community for sales professionals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:43">[01:30:43]</a>.

### Trial Lengths and Contracts
*   **Trial Lengths**: Be cautious about arbitrarily shortening free trials based on sales team desires (e.g., Salesforce shortening trials to 14 days) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:21">[01:31:21]</a>. Consider "infinite trials" if they align with the product (e.g., Slack, Canva) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:57">[01:31:57]</a>. Product leaders should act as the "VP of Free," advocating for the customer and the long tail of users who may not immediately convert but are brand advocates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:16">[01:32:16]</a>.
*   **Annual Contracts**: Forcing annual contracts on customers, especially SMBs who prefer monthly payments, is often bad advice that harms customer relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:51">[01:32:51]</a>.

### The "Year of the Customer" and Product Value
*   **Customer Centricity**: 2024 should be the "year of the customer," with product teams stepping up to be the voice of the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>.
*   **Earn Price Increases**: If prices were raised (as many companies did in 2023), ensure that value was added to the product to justify it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:33">[01:35:33]</a>.
*   **"Ship Three Great Things"**: Product teams should aim to ship three truly great things this year, as high-quality product inspires the entire company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:15">[01:41:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:24">[01:41:24]</a>.
*   **Importance of Free/Freemium**: Products that offer a free edition tend to be better because they are forced to invest in excellent onboarding and user experience, which benefits all customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:47">[01:37:47]</a>.

## Running a Conference (SaaStr)
SaaStr began in 2011-2012 as a community for B2B founders, starting with meetups and growing into large-scale annual conferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:51">[01:50:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:06">[01:51:06]</a>. The annual event in the Bay Area attracts 10,000-12,000 people, and a European event draws over 3,000 SaaS executives and founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:59">[01:00:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:12">[01:51:12]</a>.

Surprises about running large conferences:
*   **Cost**: They are extremely expensive. Running a large multi-day event in the Bay Area can cost $10 million just to "turn the lights on," which equates to about $1,000 per attendee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:26">[01:54:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:30">[01:54:30]</a>.
*   **Dis-economies of Scale**: Small meetups cost virtually nothing, but as events grow in scale (e.g., from a hotel ballroom to a large convention center), costs per person can escalate dramatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:55">[01:54:55]</a>.
*   **Losses**: Many large tech company events historically lost money (e.g., $2 million loss on $1.5 million revenue) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:30">[01:55:30]</a>.
*   **Purpose**: Despite the high cost, top-tier events are valuable because they attract the best people (vendors, executives, founders), fostering essential networking and community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:17">[01:57:17]</a>.

Founders should consider hosting smaller, customer-focused events (e.g., steak dinners) to get customers and prospects together, as customers can help [[Sales strategies for startups | sell to prospects]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:25">[01:52:25]</a>.

Dharmesh Shah, co-founder and CTO of HubSpot, describes the advent of [[impact_of_ai_on_startups_and_business_practices | AI]] as a transformative moment, comparable to the early days of the internet [01:32:04]. Having worked in commercial software for nearly 30 years, he notes that no other technological shift, including mobile or social, has had the same "Richter scale" impact as [[impact_of_ai_on_startups_and_business_practices | AI]] [01:32:27].

## AI as "Cognition at Scale"

Shah highlights the distinct capabilities of different technological eras [01:32:44]:
*   **Early computers/PCs** provided "compute at scale" [01:32:47].
*   **The internet** enabled "distribution at scale," connecting everything and facilitating the widespread dissemination of information and products [01:32:52].
*   **[[impact_of_ai_on_startups_and_business_practices | AI]]** offers "cognition at scale"â€”the ability to amplify the human brain, which has never been demonstrably achieved before with working products like ChatGPT [01:33:04].

## Reimagining Software Interfaces

A significant shift that [[the_role_of_ai_in_software_development | AI]] enables is moving from an "imperative" to a "declarative" software model [01:34:41].
*   **Imperative Model**: Users provide step-by-step instructions to the computer (e.g., clicks, drags, swipes) to achieve a desired outcome [01:34:46]. Software products, despite being called "intuitive," still require a translation from a user's mental model to specific actions [01:34:30].
*   **Declarative Model**: Users describe the desired outcome, and the software figures out how to get there [01:34:56]. An analogy is SQL, where one describes the data needed without detailing the steps to retrieve it [01:35:06].

This declarative approach, now possible with [[the_role_of_ai_in_software_development | AI]], allows users to express their intent in natural language (text or voice), and the software can act upon it [01:35:31]. An example includes generating a report of specific customer segments by simply describing the criteria [01:35:37]. Shah previously attempted a similar product, GrowthBot, six and a half years ago, but the technology was not yet mature enough to execute the idea with sufficient fidelity [01:36:02]. His current project, ChatSpot, built on modern [[the_role_of_ai_in_software_development | AI]] capabilities, fulfills this vision [01:36:09].

While web and mobile interfaces will not disappear, [[the_role_of_ai_in_software_development | AI]] allows for a class of use cases across nearly all software where the human experience can be made truly intuitive by removing the need for a translation layer [01:36:44].

## Opportunities for Startups and Product Builders

Just as the internet unlocked massive opportunities for startups to reimagine the world [01:33:29], [[impact_of_ai_on_startups_and_business_practices | AI]] presents similar potential for new companies [01:33:40]. Shah encourages founders to consider [[impact_of_ai_on_startups_and_business_practices | AI]]-driven ideas, even across industries, that offer unique advantages [01:33:50].

## Learning and Staying Relevant in the AI Era

For individuals seeking to understand [[impact_of_ai_on_skills_and_products | AI]], get ahead, and build relevant skills for the future, Shah offers practical advice [01:37:19]:
*   **Problem-Driven Learning**: Instead of learning [[impact_of_ai_on_skills and_products | AI]] for its own sake, identify a real problem you care about and attempt to solve it using [[impact_of_ai_on_skills and_products | AI]] tools or APIs [01:37:47]. This provides a tangible goal and helps anchor the learning process [01:37:54].
*   **Experimentation**: Explore available [[impact_of_ai_on_skills and_products | AI]] tools or build on existing, easily accessible and affordable APIs [01:38:21].
*   **Learn in Public**: Share your learning process and insights, much like he did with the HubSpot Culture Code [01:38:39]. The internet is an effective platform for receiving feedback, including identifying areas for improvement [01:38:51].
*   **Write**: Documenting thoughts and experiences through writing is highly recommended [01:39:02].

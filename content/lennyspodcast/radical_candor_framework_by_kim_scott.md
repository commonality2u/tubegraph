[[candor_and_direct_feedback | Radical Candor]] is a framework developed by Kim Scott, author of the book *Radical Candor*, which is recognized as a highly influential resource for leadership and feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>. The core idea behind [[candor_and_direct_feedback | Radical Candor]] is the simultaneous practice of caring personally and challenging directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.

## The 2x2 Framework
The concept is best understood through a 2x2 framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>:
*   **Vertical Axis**: Care Personally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>
*   **Horizontal Axis**: Challenge Directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>

### Quadrants of Feedback
The framework defines four quadrants based on how these two dimensions are applied:

1.  **Radical Candor**: Occurs when you care personally and challenge directly at the same time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. This approach involves being truly helpful and building strong relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.
2.  **Obnoxious Aggression**: Characterized by challenging directly without showing personal care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. This approach can be hurtful and inefficient, as it can cause recipients to enter a "fight or flight" mode, making them unable to hear feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. It's often mistakenly associated with [[candor_and_direct_feedback | radical candor]] but is antithetical to its spirit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:23">[01:11:23]</a>.
3.  **Ruinous Empathy**: Happens when you care personally but fail to challenge directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. This is the most common mistake people make, with an estimated 90% of errors falling into this category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:48">[00:20:48]</a>. It creates a "false harmony" that can be detrimental in the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>.
4.  **Manipulative Insincerity**: The worst quadrant, where there is neither personal care nor direct challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. This can stem from self-protective insincerity or a fear of negative reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:57">[00:56:57]</a>.

## [[impact_and_application_of_radical_candor_in_leadership | Impact of Radical Candor]]
Practicing [[candor_and_direct_feedback | radical candor]] leads to stronger relationships, better work, increased success, and greater happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. Conversely, a lack of direct feedback (like in ruinous empathy) can lead to the loss of top performers who become frustrated by unresolved issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>.

## Practical Application
### Soliciting Feedback
Scott emphasizes that leaders should start by soliciting criticism to build relationships and make it easier to give feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:17">[00:37:17]</a>.

*   **Authenticity is Key**: Avoid using canned phrases or sounding inauthentic, as people won't believe you want a real answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:25">[00:38:25]</a>.
*   **Effective Questions**: Instead of "Do you have any feedback for me?" (which often yields "no") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, ask specific questions like:
    *   "What could I do or stop doing that would make it easier to work with me?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:18">[00:38:18]</a>
    *   "Tell me why I'm wrong" (can be too aggressive for some) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:46">[00:38:46]</a>
    *   "What's one thing I could be doing better?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:01">[00:41:01]</a>
    *   "What's one way I could be helping you be more successful?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:05">[00:41:05]</a>
    *   "What could I have done this week to better support you?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:21">[00:41:21]</a>
*   **Frequency**: Managers should solicit feedback from direct reports weekly, ideally at the end of a one-on-one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:31">[00:39:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:41">[00:39:41]</a>. Also ask cross-functional peers and your boss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:13">[00:40:13]</a>.
*   **The Six-Second Rule**: After asking, close your mouth and count to six. This discomfort often prompts a response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:50">[00:43:50]</a>.
*   **Listen to Understand**: Combat defensiveness by listening with the intent to understand, not to respond. Ask follow-up questions to ensure clarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:21">[00:44:21]</a>.
*   **Reward Candor**: Richly reward critical feedback, especially from employees, by fixing the problem and making your listening tangible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:51">[00:45:51]</a>. If you disagree, find 5-10% you can agree with, then explain your respectful disagreement later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:56">[00:46:56]</a>. Unspoken disagreement harms relationships more than open disagreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:39">[00:47:39]</a>.

### Giving Feedback (HIP CORE)
When giving feedback, consider the following elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>:

*   **Humble**: Approach with the understanding that you might be wrong; it's about candor, not "truth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>.
*   **Helpful**: State your intention to be helpful; you're doing this because you care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.
*   **Immediate**: Give feedback right away, unless emotions are running too high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>. Delaying often means never delivering it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>.
*   **In Person / Synchronously**: Have conversations live to gauge reactions and ensure understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>. Phone calls are often better than video calls for focusing on words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>. Avoid email or Slack for feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>.
*   **Praise in Public / Criticize in Private**: This general rule helps manage the impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>.
*   **Not About Personality**: Focus on behavior and impact, not inherent personality traits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>.
*   **CORE Structure**: Frame feedback using:
    *   **C**ontext: Where and when it happened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>
    *   **O**bservation: What you observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a>
    *   **R**esult: The impact of the action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>
    *   **E**xperiment/Next Step: What to do or stop doing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>

### Overcoming Challenges
*   **"People Pleasers"**: For those who struggle with being liked, focus on the long-term kindness of delivering feedback, which ultimately helps the other person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:50">[01:08:50]</a>. Shift focus from personal discomfort to the other person's growth and future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:17">[01:09:17]</a>.
*   **Toxic Cultures**: In cultures where people aren't ready for direct feedback, the first step is for leaders to actively solicit criticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:15">[00:37:15]</a>.
*   **Leaders with Low Self-Awareness**: Explain the negative impact of their behavior (e.g., inefficiency of obnoxious aggression) on their own results and career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:09">[00:58:09]</a>. Share personal stories of mistakes to encourage their self-reflection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:09">[01:00:09]</a>.
*   **Distinguishing Challenging Leaders**: Not all challenging leaders like [[lessons_from_amazon_leadership | Steve Jobs]] are "obnoxiously aggressive." Jobs, for example, built strong personal relationships, so his directness was often received as care within that context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>. The key is the listener's interpretation, which is shaped by the relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:44">[01:04:44]</a>.

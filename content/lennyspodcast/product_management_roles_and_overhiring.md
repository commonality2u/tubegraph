Many companies overhired during the pandemic, leading to an abundance of "ridiculous roles" and a phenomenon described as [[challenges_with_project_management_roles_in_product_teams | Product Management Theater]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This situation is contributing to a "reckoning" in the product management field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:36">[00:29:36]</a>, where roles are being scrutinized for the value they provide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>.

## The Overhiring Trend and "Ridiculous Roles"

During the pandemic, many companies not only overhired but also lowered their hiring bar for product management roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. This has resulted in a proliferation of positions such as agile coaches, product owners, product ops, and business analysts, which are often overpaid for the value they deliver because they primarily involve project management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. In some companies, team sizes have become "out of hand" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>.

The belief that smaller teams can produce more and better results is gaining traction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>. This sentiment suggests that organizations may have "overdid it" with the number of roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>.

### The "Reckoning" in Product Management
Several macro factors are converging to create uncertainty and fear within the product, design, and engineering communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>:
*   **Pandemic Overhiring** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.
*   **Financial Changes**: Increased cost of funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.
*   **Generative AI Impact**: Creates uncertainty among leaders and is expected to have a very real impact on jobs, although the timeline is unclear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.
*   **Team Size**: Especially outside Silicon Valley, team sizes have become excessively large, with numerous additional roles like agile coaches, scrum masters, and various project managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>.
*   **Remote Work Impact**: Both velocity and innovation have taken "a real hit" with remote employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>. While a full return to co-located teams is unlikely, companies are struggling with innovation and speed in remote setups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>.
*   **Focus on Processes**: Many companies believe that processes like SAFe are the answer, leading to little in the way of outcomes despite high costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>.

Companies are now realizing that many roles are not what they thought they were, and these "delivery team product owners and feature team product managers are likely to be facing a reckoning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:32">[00:29:32]</a>. Generative AI is expected to accelerate this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:45">[00:29:45]</a>.

## [[challenges_with_project_management_roles_in_product_teams | Product Management Theater]]: Project Managers vs. Product Managers

Many individuals holding "product manager" titles are not performing the core functions of a true product manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>. This is what's referred to as [[challenges_with_project_management_roles_in_product_teams | product management theater]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:01">[00:24:01]</a>.

> "People that aren't real product managers... are dramatically overpaid for the value they provide because it's a project management role." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:0">[00:18:0]</a>

The key distinction lies in the focus:
*   **Output** is about delivering features or projects, often with given dates and timeframes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a>. It is "a lot easier to deliver output than it is to deliver outcomes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:39">[00:21:39]</a>.
*   **Outcomes** are about solving customer or business problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:54">[00:21:54]</a>. In "strong product companies," the measure of success is whether the problem is solved, not just shipping a feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:07">[00:22:07]</a>.

### Feature Teams vs. Empowered Product Teams
The problem with the perception of product managers often stems from being part of "feature teams" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>.

*   **Feature Teams (or Feature Factories)**:
    *   Are given a roadmap of output (features or projects) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a>.
    *   Their task is to design, build, test, and deploy that specific feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:25">[00:21:25]</a>.
    *   Often don't need product managers, as the role becomes largely project management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a>. Engineers or designers often prefer to handle it themselves due to perceived lack of contribution from "PMs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>.
    *   Many B2B software companies operate this way, often leading to "horrible" products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:53">[00:50:53]</a>.

*   **Empowered Product Teams**:
    *   Are given problems to solve (customer or business problems) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>.
    *   The measure of success is solving the problem and delivering value, not just shipping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:07">[00:22:07]</a>.
    *   Require a "real" product manager who understands customers and the business deeply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:30">[00:23:30]</a>.
    *   An empowered product team can do everything a feature team can do, and more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:4">[00:22:4]</a>.

## Skills for a "Real" [[product_management_competencies_and_career_development | Product Manager]]

In an empowered product team, a product manager is a "creator, not a facilitator" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:17">[00:25:17]</a>. Their job is to represent *value* (for the customer) and *viability* (for the business) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:58">[00:24:58]</a>. This contrasts with engineers who are responsible for *feasibility* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:04">[00:25:04]</a>.

Key skills and responsibilities include:
*   **Expertise on Users and Customers**: Deep understanding gained through direct interaction (e.g., visiting customers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>.
*   **Data Expertise**: Understanding how products are used, how usage changes, and how products are purchased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:27">[00:26:27]</a>.
*   **Representing Business Constraints**: Handling compliance, sales, marketing, financial costs, monetization, and legal issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:37">[00:26:37]</a>. Without this, decisions can revert to "design by committee" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:11">[00:27:11]</a>.
*   **Deep Market Understanding** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:18">[00:27:18]</a>.

Many product owners are merely trained to manage a backlog in Jira, which is akin to knowing how to use Google Docs â€“ a tool, not the job itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:34">[00:32:34]</a>.

### The Impact of AI on PM Skills
Generative AI is expected to significantly disrupt roles, particularly for those whose primary function is backlog administration or basic project management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:01">[00:53:01]</a>. These administrative tasks will become increasingly automated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:27">[00:53:27]</a>. For an empowered product manager, the core challenge of ensuring value and viability remains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:51">[00:53:51]</a>. Complex issues like the implications of probabilistic vs. deterministic software, legal and ethical considerations, and mission-critical applications will fall more squarely on the product manager's shoulders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:26">[00:54:26]</a>.

## [[challenges_and_pitfalls_in_product_management | Challenges and Pitfalls]]: Overcoming the "Victim" Mindset

Many product people view themselves as "a victim of their company," feeling stuck in a feature team with no options other than to quit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:0">[00:34:0]</a>. However, individuals have "a lot more agency than they realize" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:04">[00:31:04]</a>.

> "There is so much they can do today." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:0">[00:42:0]</a>

Individuals can raise their game by doing a self-assessment and developing the skills of a "real" product manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:30">[00:31:30]</a>. This can lead to promotion and even influence the company to try new ways of working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:44">[00:31:44]</a>.

A major challenge is that "most product management advice you find online is giving you the wrong advice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:27">[00:25:27]</a>. About 90% of online content comes from a "feature team world," which propagates a problematic model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:39">[00:33:39]</a>. People need to learn to think critically and use their judgment when evaluating advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:19">[00:37:19]</a>.

## The Product Operating Model

The "product operating model" is a conceptual framework, not a rigid process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:58">[01:03:58]</a>. It boils down to a set of 20 core principles observed consistently in the best product companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:30">[01:04:30]</a>.

Key aspects of the product operating model:
1.  **Deciding what to work on**: This involves product leaders defining the product strategy and making strategic "bets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:28">[01:05:28]</a>.
2.  **Solving problems**: Teams must have the skills for product discovery and come up with solutions that work for both the customer and the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:46">[01:05:46]</a>.
3.  **Building, testing, and deploying**: Products should be built and released in a reliable, demonstrable way, proving the outcomes needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:02">[01:06:02]</a>.

### Four Key Competencies in the Product Operating Model
Most companies lack institutionalized versions of these roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:26">[01:06:26]</a>:
*   **Real Product Manager**: Focused on value and viability, not just backlog administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:02">[01:07:02]</a>.
*   **Real Product Designer**: Encompasses service design, interaction design, visual design, and user research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:11">[01:07:11]</a>.
*   **Real Tech Lead** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:15">[01:07:15]</a>.
*   **Real Product Leader**: A manager of product, design, and engineering who can coach their teams and develop a sound product strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:19">[01:07:19]</a>.

The concept of "empowerment" means leaders define the strategic bets, and then teams have the latitude to figure out the best way to solve those problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:58">[00:46:58]</a>.

### Product Ops
[[Product management career advice | Product Ops]] is analogous to Dev Ops and Design Ops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:57">[01:11:57]</a>. In well-functioning companies, the core of [[Product management career advice | Product Ops]] is user research and data analysts, who are brought together under one leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:16">[01:12:16]</a>. These are small, high-leverage groups that help teams do their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:43">[01:14:43]</a>.

However, some companies misinterpret [[Product management career advice | Product Ops]], focusing on "process and governance," which is a red flag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:01">[01:13:01]</a>. Others use [[Product management career advice | Product Ops]] to justify giving product managers "assistants" for "dirty work," making those roles very vulnerable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:58">[01:13:58]</a>.

## [[hiring_and_roles_in_product_management | Hiring and roles in product management | Advice for Founders on Hiring Product Managers]]
Founders often hesitate to [[hiring_and_roles_in_product_management | hire product managers]], fearing they will "screw us up" or slow down progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:20">[01:15:20]</a>. Many founders make the mistake of [[hiring_and_roles_in_product_management | hiring product managers]] too soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:58">[01:15:58]</a>.

*   If a product manager is primarily used as a project manager, it's an "overpaying" situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:16">[01:16:16]</a>.
*   The job of a "real" product manager (focused on value and viability) is initially the founder's responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:31">[01:16:31]</a>.
*   [[hiring_and_roles_in_product_management | Hiring a product manager]] too early can cause conflict, as there are "too many cooks in the kitchen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:41">[01:16:41]</a>.
*   It's generally more useful to [[hiring_and_roles_in_product_management | hire a product manager]] once a company reaches a certain scale, typically around 20-25 engineers, or after achieving product-market fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:27">[01:17:27]</a>.

## Transforming to the Product Operating Model

Marty Cagan's new book, *Transformed*, aims to address the common question of how companies can transition to working like the best product organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:30">[00:57:30]</a>. It provides techniques for change, such as piloting or spreading initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:50">[00:57:50]</a>. The book includes numerous case studies from non-Silicon Valley companies, many of which are pre-internet, demonstrating how they successfully transformed and the innovations they achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:31">[00:58:31]</a>.

The goal of *Transformed* is to:
1.  Help companies understand what moving to this way of working truly means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:50">[00:59:50]</a>.
2.  Help them believe that transformation is possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:02">[01:00:02]</a>.
3.  Excite them about what they will be able to accomplish after transforming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:11">[01:00:11]</a>.

The book is written for non-product people, including CEOs, CFOs, and heads of sales, who care about their company's product building process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:45">[01:00:45]</a>. It emphasizes that individuals can take ownership of their [[product_management_career_advice | careers]] and push their companies in the right direction, even from the ground up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:52">[01:01:52]</a>.

> "Too many people in our industry view themselves as a victim of their company, like they're stuck in a feature team and there's nothing they can do about it other than quit. I think that's not true." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:36">[01:01:36]</a>

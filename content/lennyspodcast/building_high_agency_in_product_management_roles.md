High agency, a term coined by Eric Weinstein, describes the ability to find a way to achieve desired outcomes without waiting for ideal conditions or blaming external circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:10">[01:25:10]</a>. Individuals with high agency either push through adverse conditions or manage to reverse them to reach their goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:44">[01:25:44]</a>. This trait is particularly vital for product managers (PMs) due to the inherent challenges of their role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:59">[01:25:59]</a>.

## Why High Agency is Crucial for Product Managers

Product managers constantly face adverse conditions, such as:
*   Limited resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:10">[01:26:10]</a>
*   Challenges with legacy infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:15">[01:26:15]</a>
*   Staffing issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:18">[01:26:18]</a>
*   Customer problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:18">[01:26:18]</a>

There is "no dearth of problems to solve as a product manager" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:20">[01:26:20]</a>. High agency helps differentiate PMs who have a significant impact and exceed expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:30">[01:26:30]</a>. It explains why some PMs, despite their credentials, achieve much greater impact than might be assumed on paper, while others with tremendous potential may not fully realize it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:52">[01:26:52]</a>.

## Components of High Agency

High agency in product management is characterized by three main aspects:

### Ownership
High agency PMs take strong ownership of their work and its outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:44">[01:27:44]</a>. This ownership mindset is a fundamental component, enabling them to lead and drive initiatives even when conditions are unfavorable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:46">[01:27:46]</a>.

### Creative Execution
These individuals creatively execute through challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:52">[01:27:52]</a>. Instead of being deterred by obstacles, they find innovative ways to overcome them, ensuring progress towards their goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:55">[01:27:55]</a>.

### Resilience
A high degree of resilience is the third aspect of high agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:04">[01:28:04]</a>. PMs must be able to bounce back from setbacks and persist in the face of difficulties to consistently deliver results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:06">[01:28:06]</a>.

## Fostering High Agency in Teams

Leaders can foster high agency by giving their teams the freedom and permission to explore and attack initiatives that minimize opportunity cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:47">[01:21:47]</a>. This approach encourages teams to pursue ambitious, impactful projects rather than solely focusing on quick wins or tasks that offer only a positive return on investment (ROI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:01">[01:16:01]</a>.

By clarifying strategy and providing rough allocation guidance, such as Google's classic 70-20-10 model for resource distribution, leaders can empower teams to allocate time towards incremental improvements, big new initiatives, and foundational work like stability and infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:12">[01:22:12]</a>. This structured freedom allows teams to pursue high-agency work and often leads to surprising and positive outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:21">[01:24:21]</a>.

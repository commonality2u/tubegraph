Matt Mashari, an executive coach who has worked with notable founders and CEOs, highlights the critical role of [[managing_limiting_beliefs | managing fear and anger]] for [[effective_leadership_and_strategic_thinking | effective leadership]] and [[lessons_in_leadership_and_team_management | team management]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. He emphasizes that overcoming these emotions is essential for leaders to make sound decisions and foster a positive organizational culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

## Overcoming Fear

Fear is identified as a primary struggle, even for the most successful founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. When gripped by fear, individuals are prevented from seeing reality clearly and from taking necessary, albeit difficult, actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. Fear causes the brain to make exaggerated predictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.

### Identifying and Counteracting Fear

Matt Mashari employs a "bet" method with his clients to demonstrate that fear provides bad advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. By choosing a low-stakes scenario where the client predicts one outcome based on fear and Matt predicts the opposite, the client can witness that fear-driven predictions are often incorrect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.

A common example is a CEO facing a business problem who fears telling their board, believing it will lose trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. Matt advises the opposite: transparently sharing the problem can actually gain trust from board members who appreciate honesty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. In every instance, the board responded positively to transparency, increasing trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>.

The general advice for dealing with fear (excluding physical danger) is to do the opposite of what your brain suggests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. It's also beneficial to consult someone who is not experiencing fear, as they can offer a clearer perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>.

Fear often stems from a desire to protect one's ego or perceived danger, even when it's not a physical threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.

## Addressing Anger

Anger is characterized as a destructive emotion that can damage relationships, especially with those closest to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>.

### Communicating About Anger

To effectively address anger, Matt and his wife iterated on a phrase that allows for feedback without defensiveness: "I perceive you to be in anger" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. This "I" statement focuses on perception, avoiding judgment and accusation, allowing the person to recognize and shift out of anger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>.

Matt also learned that anger is not a base emotion but a cover for pain. The brain externalizes this pain through anger to avoid feeling it. The true solution is to allow oneself to feel the underlying pain, which prevents lashing out at others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>.

## Application in Leadership and Management Development

Matt's coaching approach has evolved to include this focus on fear and anger. While initially centered on tactical advice from books like *High Output Management* and *The Hard Thing About Hard Things*, he now emphasizes addressing emotional states that derail rational thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:09">[00:39:09]</a>. His core coaching principles include:
*   **On time**: Starting meetings on time and informing others if delayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:03">[00:40:03]</a>.
*   **Top goal**: Dedicating protected time daily to personal priorities, rather than constantly reacting to requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>. This aligns with [[entrepreneurial_mindset_and_leadership_insights | entrepreneurial mindset]] for focused work.
*   **Fear and anger give bad advice**: Recognizing and counteracting these emotional states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:09">[00:41:09]</a>.

These concepts are provided to clients as foundational readings, ensuring philosophical alignment before coaching begins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:10">[00:41:10]</a>.

### Managing Difficult Conversations and Layoffs

The ability to "fire people well" is considered one of the most crucial skills for a leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:44">[00:23:44]</a>. Many managers struggle because they feel they are hurting the person being let go, often focusing on personal circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a>.

Matt uses a [[decisionmaking_framework_for_leaders | decision-making framework]] from Wei Dang (CEO of Clipboard Health) that separates the decision from its implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:29">[00:24:29]</a>.
1.  **Decision**: Focus on the primary stakeholder (e.g., the customer) and what outcome they would want (e.g., only the best employees).
2.  **Implementation**: Address the pain points for all involved parties (the employee, the manager, the remaining team) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a>.

#### Layoff Best Practices
For layoffs, Matt outlines a three-part process to ensure a humane and effective outcome:
1.  **One-on-One Communication**:
    *   The single biggest marker between a botched and successful layoff is if the person hears the news from their manager in a one-on-one setting, not via email or group chat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Impersonal communication feels dehumanizing and leads to anger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.
    *   **Preparation**: Begin by warning the individual that it will be a difficult conversation to prevent the amygdala from being triggered by surprise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>.
    *   **Emotional Release**: After delivering the news, ask the person to share their feelings (anger, fear, sadness). Allow them to express emotions without judgment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:09">[00:31:09]</a>.
    *   **Making Them Feel Heard**: Actively listen and reflect back what you understand they are feeling and thinking. This can involve repeating their words or even articulating their unspoken, stronger thoughts (e.g., "I think what I'm hearing you say is you're pissed off...") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:41">[00:32:41]</a>.
    *   **Becoming Their Agent**: Offer active support in finding their next job, leveraging your network to connect them with opportunities that match their skills and passions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:22">[00:26:22]</a>. This differentiates a kind dismissal from a painful one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:14">[00:27:14]</a>.

2.  **Team Preparation and Execution (for large layoffs)**:
    *   **Decentralize decisions**: Managers should be given a dollar amount or number of people to let go within their team, ensuring they choose who to cut, rather than being told from above <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:31">[00:48:31]</a>.
    *   **Morning of Layoffs**: Managers conduct one-on-one meetings back-to-back, delivering the news and offering future support for job searching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:34">[00:49:34]</a>.

3.  **All-Hands and Post-Layoff Support for Stay Team**:
    *   **Transparency**: Hold an all-hands meeting for the remaining team to explain what occurred and answer their questions, especially those related to fear about their own job security or company stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:17">[00:50:17]</a>.
    *   **Cut Deep, Cut Once**: Aim to make a significant cut once to avoid repeated layoffs, which create PTSD and trauma in the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:50">[00:50:50]</a>.
    *   **Manager One-on-Ones**: Each manager should have a one-on-one meeting with every person on the stay team, solely to listen to their thoughts and feelings about the layoff and make them feel heard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:34">[00:51:34]</a>. This reduces emotional impact and accelerates recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:12">[00:52:12]</a>.

Matt observes that companies often perform better after layoffs due to reduced overhead and improved information flow, even if handled poorly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:35">[00:21:35]</a>. If handled well, the improvement is seen within weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:20">[00:51:20]</a>.

### Innovation within Larger Companies

Larger companies struggle to innovate due to scale, security concerns, and lengthy approval processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:39">[00:55:39]</a>. Matt suggests creating small, independent teams with an [[entrepreneurial_mindset_and_leadership_insights | entrepreneurial mindset]] (e.g., former YC founders whose startups failed) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:57">[00:54:57]</a>. These teams should operate outside typical departmental reporting lines, ideally directly to the CEO, and ideally as their own C Corp, allowing for rapid iteration without impacting the core brand or product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:34">[00:56:34]</a>. Wei Dang's Clipboard Health is a successful example, creating multiple independent C Corps for new products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:44">[00:57:44]</a>.

While equity is often perceived as a key motivator, Matt believes that autonomy and ownership over decision-making and creation are more significant drivers for people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:34">[00:59:34]</a>. Fear can be a strong short-term motivator (adrenaline), but joy provides long-term, non-corrosive motivation, leading to more sustainable success and enjoyment of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:42">[01:00:42]</a>.

## The Energy Audit

To optimize personal effectiveness and reduce emotional drain, Matt recommends an "energy audit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:01">[01:02:01]</a>:
1.  **Identify Zones**: Based on Diana Chapman's "Conscious Leadership Group" framework, classify activities into four zones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:43">[01:02:43]</a>:
    *   **Incompetence**: Things you're not good at and others are better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:58">[01:02:58]</a>.
    *   **Competence**: Things you can do fine, but others can too <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:08">[01:03:08]</a>.
    *   **Excellence**: Things you're uniquely good at but don't love (the "danger zone" that saps energy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:24">[01:03:24]</a>.
    *   **Genius**: Things you're uniquely good at and love so much that space and time disappear while doing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:46">[01:03:46]</a>.

2.  **Audit Your Calendar**: For two representative weeks, review your calendar hour-by-hour. Mark activities green if they give you energy, and red if they are neutral or drain energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:11">[01:04:11]</a>.

3.  **Address Red Activities**: For each energy-draining activity:
    *   **Eliminate**: Is it necessary at all? If not, cancel it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:18">[01:05:18]</a>.
    *   **Delegate**: Can someone else do it? If so, delegate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:23">[01:05:23]</a>.
    *   **Transform**: If only you can do it, how can it be made "exquisite" or less draining? For example, by setting clear expectations or preparing in advance for meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:30">[01:05:30]</a>.

By repeatedly performing this audit, individuals can shift their calendar to be 80% green, naturally moving towards their zone of genius and increasing overall value creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:42">[01:06:42]</a>. This process often reveals that tasks one person dislikes, another loves, leading to efficient delegation and better overall team dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:20">[01:09:20]</a>. This self-awareness and adjustment are key elements of [[leadership_and_management_development | leadership and management development]].

Claire V., a seasoned Chief Product Officer, emphasizes that when she is hired into later-stage companies, her role is often to remind them they can still operate like a [[earlystage_startup_challenges_and_solutions | startup]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. The widespread desire is to "move fast [with] amazing quality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Strategies for Maintaining Pace

Maintaining a fast pace within a larger organization involves two key principles: understanding the internal pace and actively preventing its degradation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:28">[00:23:28]</a>.

### Avoiding Calendar-Driven Pace
Organizations often allow their pace to lock to the calendar and recurring meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>. Claire V. emphasizes that decisions should not be postponed until the next scheduled meeting, as these are often artificial timelines. Instead, focus on making decisions and taking action based on real timelines and information needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:59">[00:26:59]</a>.

### "One Click Faster" Expectation
A core tactic is to set expectations for a "one click faster" clock speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:02">[00:24:02]</a>. This means if something is anticipated to be done this year, the expectation is to complete it this half. If it's expected this half, it should be done this quarter, and so on, down to "end of day in this meeting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a>. This proactive approach helps to change expectations and build energy and momentum within the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:43">[00:24:43]</a>.

### Personal SLA
Leaders should establish a personal Service Level Agreement (SLA) to ensure they are never the bottleneck for the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a>. As a point of decision-making, tiebreaking, or approval, a leader's responsiveness directly impacts the speed of the entire organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:03">[00:25:03]</a>.

## Upholding a High Quality Bar

A high quality bar encompasses both talent and product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:19">[00:27:19]</a>.

### Defining the Talent Bar
It is crucial to define the talent bar with specific and measurable career ladders, especially at senior levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:52">[00:27:52]</a>. Vague descriptions like "hires and manages multiple departments" are insufficient; instead, define concrete, tractable goals to objectively assess performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:03">[00:28:03]</a>.

### Normalizing Feedback
Creating a culture where feedback is normalized and "clear is kind" is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:40">[00:28:40]</a>. Conflict-avoidant or feedback-avoidant cultures degrade the talent bar because expectations are not stated, and accountability isn't upheld <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:53">[00:28:53]</a>. Being direct about unmet expectations, clarifying that questioning ideas is not questioning innate talent, and holding people accountable sets them up for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:17">[00:29:17]</a>.

### Addressing Non-Fits Quickly
When individuals are not a good fit for the role or the organization, moving quickly to address it is a difficult but necessary part of the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:31">[00:29:31]</a>. This maintains a healthy, effective, and performant team environment, which benefits everyone, including the individual who may find a better fit elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:51">[00:29:51]</a>.

## Organizational Fluidity and Agency

Organizations, especially in startups and growth-stage companies, are very fluid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>. Claire V. believes the "universe is bendable to your will" and that systems can shift over time, particularly around highly motivated and talented people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>.

This means:
*   **Know what you want:** Be clear about your career goals and ask for support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.
*   **Solve company problems:** Frame your desired growth in terms of how it benefits the company, not just your personal career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.
*   **Look laterally:** Product managers, as generalists, can explore roles in other functions like marketing or engineering to build a broader leadership career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>.
*   **Embrace "no lanes":** Organizations should have "dotted" rather than "solid" lanes, meaning product managers can do design work or engineers can write specs. This fosters a healthy, cross-functional approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:08">[01:13:08]</a>. This thinking also aligns with [[hiring_and_team_management_philosophy_in_tech_startups | building an entrepreneurial culture]] where individuals are not confined to rigid roles.

The ability to operate across functions (product, engineering, design, data, operations, and revenue) and traverse different levels of elevation (strategy to detail) allows for effective conversations and problem-solving across the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>. This multi-faceted skill set is often developed through [[earlystage_startup_challenges_and_solutions | early-stage startup]] experience where individuals take on a breadth of functional responsibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:1:52:09">[01:52:09]</a>.

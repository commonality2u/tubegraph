The [[understanding_the_jobs_to_be_done_framework | Jobs to Be Done (JTBD) framework]], co-created by Bob Moesta and Clay Christensen, shifts the focus from product features to the progress customers are trying to make in their lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:51">[00:50:51]</a>. It posits that people "hire" products to achieve specific outcomes within a given context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:55">[00:50:55]</a>. Understanding these "struggling moments" is crucial for [[understanding_and_identifying_user_needs | identifying user needs]] and driving innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

## Core Principle: Context and Outcome

A common misconception is that JTBD focuses on "pain and gain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:41">[00:54:41]</a>. Instead, it emphasizes **context and outcome** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. When a story seems irrational, it's often because the full context is missing, which makes the irrational rational <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:16">[00:55:16]</a>.

### Snickers vs. Milky Way Example
Consider Snickers and Milky Way candy bars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. While similar in ingredients and sold in the same aisle, they serve different "jobs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>:
*   **Snickers**: Often hired when someone has missed a meal, is low on energy, and needs to quickly get back to tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. Its competitors are protein drinks, Red Bull, or coffee â€“ anything that acts as a quick meal replacement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. The peanuts and nougat masticate to absorb stomach acid, making it feel more substantial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:48">[00:46:48]</a>.
*   **Milky Way**: Typically eaten after an emotional experience, often alone, to regroup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. Its competitors might be a glass of wine, a brownie, or even a run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. The caramel melts easily, making it feel more like a drink than food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:05">[00:47:05]</a>.

This example illustrates how JTBD reveals the true competitive set from the "demand side," rather than just the "supply side" (i.e., product features) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

## Identifying Struggling Moments
JTBD emphasizes that demand is caused by a "struggling moment," not by the creation of a product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.

### Southern New Hampshire University Example
In 2010, Southern New Hampshire University discovered anomalies: students paying full price for online learning, never attending class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. By studying these individuals, they found a different "job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>: older students, often with prior degrees or failed college attempts, who now had responsibilities and wanted to do something new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. This insight led them to realize a massive unmet need for flexible education, growing the university to over 200,000 students, becoming one of the largest in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

## The Four Forces of Progress
People don't change behavior randomly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>. The "Four Forces" model explains the causation of why someone would switch from an old product (Product A) to a new one (Product B) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>:
1.  **Push (F1)**: The context or struggling moment with the old product that pushes someone to seek change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.
2.  **Pull (F2)**: The attraction of a new outcome or desired state from the new product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.
3.  **Anxiety (F3)**: Worries or fears about the new product or situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.
4.  **Habit of the Present (F4)**: The inertia or comfort with the existing solution, even if it's imperfect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.

For a customer to move, F1 (Push) and F2 (Pull) must be greater than F3 (Anxiety) and F4 (Habit) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. Adding more features (increasing F2) can paradoxically increase anxiety (F3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>. Reducing friction (F3 and F4) is often more effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.

### House Building Example
Bob Moesta applied this by building houses for downsizers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. Customers often canceled after six weeks because they didn't know how to get rid of their old belongings, specifically large items like dining room tables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:59">[01:03:59]</a>. They claimed not to want a dining room, but the table was an "emotional bank account" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:07">[01:04:07]</a>. By increasing the condo price to include moving services and two years of storage, Moesta addressed this "frictional point" and increased sales by over 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:51">[01:03:51]</a>. Even building a symbolic space for a dining table (too small to actually eat at) addressed the emotional need and increased sales by 22% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:26">[01:04:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:46">[01:04:46]</a>.

## Designing the Sales Process
JTBD can transform the sales process from trying to "sell" to enabling customers to "buy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:02">[01:14:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:27">[01:14:27]</a>. The buying process has distinct phases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:36">[01:15:36]</a>:
1.  **First Thought** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:38">[01:15:38]</a>
2.  **Passive Looking**: Problem-aware, solution-unaware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:40">[01:15:40]</a>.
3.  **Active Looking**: Both problem and solution-aware, framing a solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:46">[01:15:46]</a>.
4.  **Deciding**: Making trade-offs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:51">[01:15:51]</a>.
5.  **First Use** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:06">[01:17:06]</a>
6.  **Ongoing Use**: Building new habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:06">[01:17:06]</a>.

### Autobooks Example
Autobooks, a company enabling banks to offer invoicing via Apple Pay, found that tailoring their sales demo to the customer's buying phase significantly improved conversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:08">[01:15:08]</a>. Instead of a single demo, they offered three versions: one for problem background, one for alternatives, and one for choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:25">[01:16:25]</a>. This approach halved the sales process duration and quadrupled conversion rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:41">[01:16:41]</a>.

## Interviewing for Insights
Effective JTBD research relies on deep qualitative interviews, often resembling criminal and intelligence interrogation, to uncover the causal mechanisms behind behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:54">[01:17:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:52">[01:38:52]</a>.
*   **Focus on the "Why"**: Don't ask what people want, but why they *did* something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:19">[01:19:19]</a>.
*   **Study Recent Purchases/Churn**: Interview people who recently bought a product (even a competitor's) or churned from yours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:29">[01:19:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:13">[01:35:13]</a>. Churn provides valuable insight because customers are still trying to make progress, but found your product inadequate or too difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:20">[01:35:20]</a>.
*   **Avoid Discussion Guides**: Allow conversations to flow naturally to uncover meaningful information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:28">[01:30:28]</a>.
*   **Mirroring and Bracketing**: Techniques like mirroring (playing back what was said incorrectly) and bracketing (offering false choices) encourage elaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:53">[01:27:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:10">[01:31:10]</a>.
*   **Listen for Contradictions**: Customers often say one thing but do another (e.g., wanting an energy-efficient house but buying a finished basement) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:26">[01:27:26]</a>. The "bitching ain't switching" principle highlights that complaining doesn't mean a customer will actually switch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:04">[01:37:04]</a>.
*   **Small Sample Sizes**: Causal mechanisms often repeat quickly; 10-12 interviews can reveal sufficient patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:10">[01:29:10]</a>.

### Basecamp and Intercom Examples
*   **Basecamp**: Despite user requests for features like Gantt charts, Basecamp resisted adding complexity, understanding that a core "job" it fulfilled was simplicity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:34">[01:37:34]</a>.
*   **Intercom**: Realized their product was "hired" for four different jobs (e.g., user acquisition vs. customer support) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:01">[01:21:01]</a>. Instead of separate products, they allowed users to turn off irrelevant features and adjusted pricing models to compete directly with specific solutions like HubSpot (for acquisition) or Zendesk (for support) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:07">[01:21:07]</a>.

## Zero-to-One Products & Competitors
For new, zero-to-one products, JTBD focuses on what existing products or behaviors customers will *stop using* when the new product arrives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>.

### Social Media Marketplace Example
A large social media company found users transacting on their platform informally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:25">[01:28:25]</a>. To build a new marketplace (e.g., Facebook Marketplace), they studied existing competitors like eBay and Craigslist to understand what caused people to set up stores or sell items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:36">[01:28:36]</a>. This led to a multi-billion dollar marketplace by understanding the "jobs" people were already trying to get done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:50">[01:28:50]</a>.

### Startup Accelerators
Accelerators like TechStars and Y Combinator encourage new companies to conduct JTBD research at the very beginning of their product development to understand what people will stop using when their product comes out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:41">[01:42:41]</a>.

## Misconceptions & Key Takeaways
A key misconception is that JTBD is solely about "pain and gain" or only about the outcome, rather than the crucial combination of **context and outcome** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:41">[01:54:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:49">[01:54:49]</a>. The biggest mistake is hypothesizing jobs in a conference room without talking to real people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:54">[01:54:54]</a>.

### Key Takeaways for [[using_qualitative_feedback_for_product_development | Product Development]]
1.  **Study Struggling Moments**: These are "everywhere" and are where the need for innovation is greatest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:16">[01:58:16]</a>.
2.  **Understand Progress**: Focus on the customer's desired standard and the progress they want to make, considering their starting context and desired outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:41">[01:58:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:59">[01:39:59]</a>.
3.  **Choose What to "Suck At"**: Recognize and accept the trade-offs your product makes, ensuring they align with what the customer values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:51">[01:58:51]</a>. Product failures often stem from a misalignment of these trade-offs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>.

### When JTBD Might Not Be the Right Framework
JTBD might not be ideal when there's no real customer choice (e.g., health insurance dictated by an employer), or when the product's use is so habitual that users cannot recall the context of their purchase (e.g., chewing gum) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:12">[01:51:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:51">[01:52:51]</a>. In such cases, ethnographic studies or prototyping to identify frictional points might be more appropriate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:28">[01:52:28]</a>.

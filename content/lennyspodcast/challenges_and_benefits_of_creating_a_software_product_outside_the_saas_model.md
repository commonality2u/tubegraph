Jason Fried, co-founder and CEO of 37signals (makers of Basecamp and Hey), champions an alternative approach to building a successful software business, moving away from the conventional venture-backed, rapid-growth SaaS model. This alternative emphasizes profitability, independence, and a focus on intrinsic value over external metrics and aggressive expansion.

## The Bootstrapping Alternative
Fried advocates for entrepreneurs to begin by bootstrapping their ideas, as this practice inherently develops the fundamental skill of making money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This contrasts sharply with the common industry mantra of "go big or go home" and seeking unicorn status through massive funding rounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. While the venture route may be necessary for certain types of companies (e.g., building cars, opening restaurants that require significant initial capital expenditures) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>, software businesses typically have low startup costs and incredibly healthy margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

He points out that Silicon Valley has managed to make the most profitable style of business (software) the least profitable, with many companies barely breaking even or remaining unprofitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. This is often due to excessive hiring and high customer acquisition costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.

## 37signals' Distinct Approach
37signals operates as a highly unconventional company:
*   No investors or board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.
*   No plans to go public or sell the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
*   Profitable for 24 consecutive years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
*   Over 100,000 customers, generating tens of millions in annual profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
*   Profits filter down to founders and employees due to lack of investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
*   Relatively small team of about 75 employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.

### Focus on Efficiency, Not Growth
Unlike many of their competitors who prioritize growth, 37signals focuses on efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. They avoid many typical organizational structures that inflate costs:
*   No salespeople <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.
*   Not targeting enterprise customers, thus avoiding enormous support costs and customization demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.
*   Simple pricing models (e.g., Basecamp has one primary price cap, regardless of company size) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. This allows them to build one product, keep it "tight and simple and clear," and avoid the complexity of serving diverse customer segments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.

### Product Development: Shape Up Methodology
37signals employs a unique development framework called Shape Up, detailed at basecamp.com/shapeup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:39">[00:33:39]</a>:
*   **Six-Week Cycles:** Projects are capped at a maximum of six weeks. This is an "appetite" (what they are willing to spend), not an "estimate" (how long they think it will take) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:54">[00:33:54]</a>. This prevents work from endlessly expanding to fill available time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:56">[00:34:56]</a>.
*   **Small Teams:** Every feature is worked on by a maximum of two people: one programmer and one designer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.
*   **No Long-Term Planning:** Fried believes long-term business planning is a fantasy, preferring to do "what I think, not what I thought" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:04">[00:38:04]</a>. Decisions are made for the current cycle, with flexibility to adapt.
*   **Cool-Down Periods:** After each six-week cycle, there's a two-week cool-down period. This isn't a cessation of work, but a shift to different types of work (e.g., tightening up existing features, fixing bugs, internal freelancing) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:52">[00:42:52]</a>. This helps prevent burnout from constant "sprinting" and keeps people out of "demoralizing" long-running projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:49">[00:42:49]</a>.

### Decision-Making Based on Instinct and Gut
Fried admits he doesn't know how to make decisions purely by numbers and finds no joy in it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:17">[00:44:17]</a>. He believes every decision is a judgment call, influenced by thousands of known and unknown factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:37">[00:44:37]</a>. He encourages giving intuition and gut feeling credit, as they absorb valuable, often undescribable, experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:29">[00:46:29]</a>.

He often asks his team "How does this feel?" rather than focusing on quantifiable metrics or certainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:02">[00:48:02]</a>. This approach aims to tap into the human, "feeling creatures" aspect of decision-making, acknowledging that people are primarily driven by how things feel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:19">[00:48:19]</a>.

### "Work Isn't War"
37signals actively rejects military metaphors commonly used in business (e.g., "conquer the market," "target customers," "destroy the competition") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:55">[01:09:55]</a>. Fried finds this language depressing and prefers words that are "additive and alternative" and foster a spirit of creation and pride, rather than destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:57">[01:10:57]</a>.

## [[Challenges and realities of working as a product manager | Challenges]] of the Non-SaaS/Bootstrapping Path
*   **Difficulty:** Starting a business, especially without external funding, is inherently hard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:53">[01:11:53]</a>. It requires navigating personal financial constraints and time limitations.
*   **Resistance to Change:** Established companies find it very hard to adopt new ways of working, like Shape Up, quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:53">[00:39:53]</a>. Changing deeply ingrained "roots" and "momentum" is exceptionally difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>. Fried advises trying new methods on low-criticality projects first to build competence and avoid discouraging failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:28">[00:40:28]</a>.
*   **"Spectacular Failures":** Most businesses are, by definition, spectacular failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:54">[00:57:54]</a>. It's difficult to pinpoint why things didn't work in complex systems like software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:23">[00:58:23]</a>.
*   **Overcoming Sloppiness:** Companies with ample funding (e.g., from VCs) often develop a degree of sloppiness because they aren't forced to be efficient or profitable immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:55">[01:16:55]</a>. They spend money on people and marketing because investors expect it to be spent, not saved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:28">[01:17:28]</a>.

## Benefits of the Non-SaaS/Bootstrapping Path
*   **Practice Making Money:** Bootstrapping forces entrepreneurs to learn and get better at the fundamental skill of making money, which is essential for a successful business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:51">[01:18:51]</a>.
*   **Independence and Control:** The most significant benefit is independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:23">[01:05:23]</a>. Without investors, there's no board or external pressure, allowing the company to "do what we want to do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:37">[01:05:37]</a>. This gives founders a full range of motion and prevents future obligations from dictating their path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:53">[01:04:53]</a>.
*   **Following Intuition and Passion:** This model allows for decision-making based on what "feels right" and building products that the founders themselves enjoy and are proud of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:27">[01:16:27]</a>.
*   **Focus on Core Value:** Without the pressure for endless growth, the focus can be on creating genuinely good products that offer unique perspectives and serve as valuable alternatives in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:30">[01:07:30]</a>.
*   **[[Avoiding Feature Bloat in B2B Software | Avoiding Feature Bloat]]:** By focusing on core functionality and keeping things simple, products avoid unnecessary complexity and bloat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:50">[01:14:50]</a>.

### The "Once" Project: A Non-SaaS Alternative
37signals is launching a new line of products under the "Once" brand, representing a return to a non-SaaS model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:32">[01:24:32]</a>.
*   **Model:** Users pay once for the software, download it, and install it on their own servers or cloud infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:45">[01:24:45]</a>. There are no subscription fees or recurring charges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:57">[01:24:57]</a>.
*   **Rationale:** Fried believes in "subscription fatigue" and sees an opportunity to provide alternatives to predominantly rented software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:56">[01:23:56]</a>. He targets "commodities in business software" that are still charging "luxury prices" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:18">[01:25:18]</a>.
*   **Product Philosophy:** These products will be "beautifully tight, simple, essential generics of very high quality" that get the "80/20" right, built quickly (typically three months with two people) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:54">[01:25:54]</a>. Maintenance costs for 37signals are zero because they don't host the software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:14">[01:26:14]</a>.
*   **First Product:** The first "Once" product is a relaunch of their old group chat tool, Campfire, which predates Slack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:07">[01:27:07]</a>. It's designed to be a simple, effective chat tool for a one-time fee, providing a potential backup system or a secure, air-gapped solution for specific teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:10">[01:28:10]</a>.
*   **Code Access:** A unique feature is that users get the code, allowing them to modify, play with, and tweak the software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:17">[01:29:17]</a>.

## Key Takeaways
Fried's core business strategy can be summarized as: "Keep making great [products], keep your costs in check, charge appropriate prices for your work, share as much as you can, and let the chips fall where they may" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:10">[01:22:10]</a>. This also includes enjoying the work, creating a great environment, and fostering pride and excitement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:28">[01:22:28]</a>.

He emphasizes that humans tend to complicate things, and much progress can be made by staying simple, working in small teams, and adapting as you go <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:02">[01:36:02]</a>. Raising money often adds complexity and attaches "very thick and strong strings" that limit a company's range of motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:03">[01:37:03]</a>. The ultimate guiding principle remains: "No one ever went broke making a profit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:03">[01:23:03]</a>.

Many companies tend to under-resource SEO while over-resourcing advertisements, despite SEO potentially yielding comparable traffic volumes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. For instance, a company spending $100 million on ads might only allocate $50,000 to SEO, which doesn't make sense considering the potential return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Ethan Smith, CEO of Graphite, a top growth agency specializing in SEO, shares insights on how to leverage SEO for significant company growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

## When to Focus on SEO

Two primary factors determine if SEO can be a significant growth driver for a product or company:

1.  **Large Addressable Market**: For most categories, the addressable market for SEO is substantial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. To assess this, consider:
    *   The product offered and its use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.
    *   The target persona and its size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.
    *   Analyzing competitors using tools like [Similarweb](https://www.similarweb.com/) to gauge total traffic and traffic by channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>. Competitors can be either **product competitors** (direct rivals like Walmart vs. Wayfair for a shopping site) or **audience competitors** (sites ranking for similar terms but offering different products, like Investopedia for a fintech company) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>.

2.  **Existing Authority and Traction**: SEO is more effective when a company already has some credibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>. Google prefers to rank credible domains, not just SEO-focused sites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. Key indicators include:
    *   **Non-SEO traffic**: Aim for at least 1,000 daily visits from channels other than search (e.g., direct, paid, email, social) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. This signals to Google that the site is a known brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>.
    *   **Referring domains**: Have at least 1,000 referring domains (links from other sites) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. Tools like [Ahrefs](https://ahrefs.com/) or [Semrush](https://www.semrush.com/) can help check this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.
    *   **Content Generation**: Companies with existing User-Generated Content (UGC) or a large number of products/SKUs (like Zillow or Glassdoor) have a lower "scope" to compete, making SEO easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>. However, even without UGC, editorial SEO can still be effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>.

> [!NOTE] When to invest in SEO:
> Consider SEO's potential impact and scope compared to other growth channels (e.g., paid ads, social) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:02">[00:23:02]</a>. If paid channels are performing exceptionally well, it might not be the immediate priority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:17">[00:23:17]</a>.

## Types of SEO

SEO strategies can be categorized into three main types:

1.  **Programmatic SEO**: Automatically generated pages from a database of information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>.
    *   Examples: Product pages on eBay, address pages on Zillow, UGC on Glassdoor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a>.
    *   Includes **category pages** (grids/lists of items) and **item pages** (single product/address/video pages) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>.
    *   Advantage: No per-page cost once the system is built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>.

2.  **Editorial SEO**: Manually written content, such as articles, guides, or listicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>.
    *   Increasingly drives more traffic than programmatic SEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>.
    *   Always an opportunity if there's an addressable market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>.
    *   Examples of strong editorial SEO companies: MasterClass, BetterUp, NerdWallet, HubSpot, Dotdash (Allrecipes, Investopedia) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:28">[00:21:28]</a>.

3.  **Technical SEO**: The underlying infrastructure for SEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>.
    *   Includes internal link architecture, tags, redirects, and page speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>.
    *   Often misunderstood; a "technical audit" (list of bugs) is less useful than a strategic approach for growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. It's about enabling growth, not being the sole driver of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Which type is best?
> While it depends on the category and target queries, [[seo_and_content_marketing_insights | editorial SEO]] is often the most lucrative for most companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:27]</a>. Programmatic is ideal for large datasets like e-commerce or real estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>.

## How to Win at SEO: Strategy & Operations

A high-impact SEO strategy follows a specific workflow:

1.  **Define the Addressable Market**: Identify the topics and keywords to target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:49">[00:23:49]</a>.
2.  **Determine Page Type**: Based on the keywords, identify the ideal page type needed (e.g., article, address page, category page) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:59">[00:23:59]</a>. This is done by searching for target keywords on Google and observing the dominant page types in the results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:58">[00:24:58]</a>.
3.  **Product Requirements**: Define what needs to be on the page to fulfill user intent (e.g., a map, contact info for an address page) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:16">[00:24:16]</a>. This is determined by analyzing common components of high-ranking pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:42">[00:26:42]</a>.
4.  **Content Strategy**: Plan the subtopics and themes for the content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a>.
5.  **Infrastructure**: Ensure Google can easily find and crawl all pages via internal links <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:30">[00:24:30]</a>.

### Prioritizing Topics, Not Just Keywords

> [!TIP] Focus on **topics** rather than individual keywords.
> While SEO once focused on a single page for every keyword, Google's algorithm now has a semantic understanding and targets topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>. A single page can rank for hundreds or thousands of keywords related to a core topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>. This prevents wasted resources on redundant content and ensures comprehensive content that fulfills user intent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:47">[00:33:47]</a>.
>
> To identify topics, look for groups of keywords where Google's search results consistently show similar pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:01">[00:36:01]</a>.

### Engagement as a Ranking Signal

Google's ultimate goal is to help users find what they're looking for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:58">[00:27:58]</a>. Key engagement signals include:
*   **Click-Through Rate (CTR)**: How often users click on your result when it appears in search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:40">[00:28:40]</a>.
*   **Time on Page / Pogo-sticking**: How long users stay on your page before returning to search results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a>. Higher engagement directly correlates with higher rankings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:20">[00:28:20]</a>.

## Essential SEO Tools

*   **Google Search Console**: Free tool providing real traffic data, SERP tracking, and keyword performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:58">[00:37:58]</a>.
*   **Clearscope**: For content analysis and scoring, identifying gaps in content coverage and ensuring comprehensiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:16">[00:38:16]</a>.
*   **Ahrefs** or **Semrush**: For keyword research, competitive analysis, and identifying top-performing pages and keywords of other sites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:43">[00:38:43]</a>.
*   **Screaming Frog**: A niche but useful tool for crawling sites, identifying errors (like redirect loops), and auditing internal link architecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:31">[00:39:31]</a>.

## Timelines and Early Signals

SEO is a long-term [[growth_hacking_and_strategies | growth strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:13">[00:41:13]</a>. Expect results in **six to nine months** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:32">[00:40:32]</a>.
*   **Initial Launch**: 3 months to build page types, conduct analysis, strategize, and write initial content (e.g., 20 articles) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:01">[00:41:01]</a>.
*   **Ranking**: 3-6 months post-launch to see pages start to rank and grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:08">[00:41:08]</a>.

> [!NOTE] The faster a site has authority and existing traction, the quicker it sees results (e.g., Netflix can see changes in days, while a new company might take a year) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:48">[00:40:48]</a>.

**Leading Indicators**: Look for signs of progress within the first few weeks or months, such as:
*   Ranking at least number 20 for *anything* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:41">[00:42:41]</a>.
*   Gradual improvement in ranking positions (e.g., from #15 to #12 to #8) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:52">[00:42:52]</a>.
*   Impressions increasing for target keywords, even if clicks are still low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:56">[00:42:56]</a>.

## Hiring for SEO

The type of hire depends on the chosen [[seo_strategies_for_successful_companies | SEO strategy]], company stage, and budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:45">[00:45:45]</a>.

*   **Programmatic SEO**: Requires specialized skills. Look for a **growth person with technical ability** who has a proven track record, especially from companies not well-known but with high SEO traffic percentages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:43">[00:47:43]</a>. Their day-to-day involves analyzing competitor sites, defining product requirements, clustering keywords, working with engineers to build automated page generation, and data analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:18">[00:49:18]</a>.
*   **Editorial SEO**: Can be learned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:09">[00:57:09]</a>. A person with strong content or editorial strategy experience can be trained in SEO workflows and tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:53">[00:56:53]</a>. The ideal minimum team is one dedicated **SEO manager** (who identifies topics and creates outlines) and one **writer** (ideally a domain expert) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:27">[00:59:27]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Under-resourcing SEO:
> Companies often spend significantly on ads but allocate minimal budget to SEO, even when SEO's potential traffic is comparable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:01">[00:47:01]</a>. [[effective_seo_resource_allocation | Resource allocation]] should reflect the actual opportunity.

## Overcoming Blockage: Getting Things Done

A significant challenge in SEO is getting recommendations implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:31">[01:06:31]</a>. Many SEO strategies fail not because they are flawed, but because they never get launched due to resource constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:54">[01:06:54]</a>.

*   **Product-Led SEO**: Integrate SEO directly into the product organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:15">[01:07:15]</a>. SEO changes are often product changes, and a separate SEO team outside the product org faces constant prioritization battles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:17">[01:07:17]</a>. This is covered in Eli Schwartz's book on [[productled_approach_to_seo | product-led SEO]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:17">[01:07:17]</a>.
*   **Executive Buy-in**: Secure support from leadership, as their backing can unblock resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:40">[01:07:40]</a>.
*   **Demystify SEO**: Help others understand the value and mechanics of SEO to reduce its perceived "mystery" and improve its prioritization against more "understood" initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:53">[01:07:53]</a>.

## Key Concepts

### Topical Authority

[[topical_authority | Topical authority]] is the most important and least understood aspect of SEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:14">[01:09:14]</a>.
*   **Beyond PageRank**: While links are still important, Google now uses multiple inputs to determine authority, including non-SEO traffic, social shares, and branded search queries (how often people search for your brand name) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:52">[01:09:52]</a>.
*   **Niche Expertise**: Google increasingly prioritizes sites known for **specific, narrow expertise** rather than general authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:48">[01:10:48]</a>. The content of backlinks (anchor text), shared content, and branded searches contribute to this topical recognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:58">[01:10:58]</a>.
*   **Branching Out**: Start by focusing on topics adjacent to your existing authority (e.g., if you're known for Gordon Ramsay, focus on beef wellington recipes) and then gradually expand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:31">[01:12:31]</a>. This allows newer companies to outrank larger competitors that have more overall domain authority but less specific topical authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:04">[01:13:04]</a>.

### Internal Links

Internal links are a critical, often under-appreciated, lever for SEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:44">[01:16:44]</a>.
*   **Crawl Paths**: Google crawls sites via links <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:30">[01:18:30]</a>. If pages lack internal links, Google struggles to find and regularly crawl them, hindering their ability to rank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:32">[01:18:32]</a>. Pages need multiple paths, ideally at least 10 internal links, not just one from a sitemap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:41">[01:18:41]</a>.
*   **Common Problem**: 90-95% of sites have poor internal link distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:01">[01:19:01]</a>. Standard internal linking algorithms (facet-based, recommendation-based, popular, recent) often create silos or bias towards a small subset of pages, leaving many with few or no links <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:09">[01:19:09]</a>.
*   **Solution**: Aim for a **flat link graph** where all pages are within a few "hops" of key crawl points (e.g., homepage, popular pages) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:24">[01:21:24]</a>. Manually spreading links across the site, typically within the body of articles or at the bottom of category pages (above the footer), can lead to significant traffic increases (25-100% lift) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:07">[01:22:07]</a>.

## Impact of AI on SEO

The proliferation of AI-generated content (e.g., using GPT-3) for SEO is a complex topic with concerns about factual accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:33">[01:24:33]</a>.

*   **Content Quality**: While AI can generate grammatically correct and human-like sentences, it lacks underlying wisdom or factual accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:35">[01:25:35]</a>. Content must be useful and truthful; false claims (like a soap being "oxide-free" when it's not) can harm user trust and, implicitly, rankings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:40">[01:25:40]</a>.
*   **True Value of AI in SEO**: AI is highly useful for **structuring and analyzing content**, not necessarily generating it without human oversight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:35">[01:27:35]</a>. This includes:
    *   Extracting structure from data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:50">[01:27:50]</a>.
    *   Helping decide which topics to write about by clustering keywords and identifying opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:52">[01:27:52]</a>.
    *   Identifying topical authority and relevant subtopics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:01">[01:28:01]</a>.
    *   Providing outlines for human writers to ensure comprehensive coverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:08">[01:28:08]</a>.

> [!IMPORTANT] The future of [[impact_of_ai_on_seo | AI in SEO]]
> The ethical and effective use of AI in SEO focuses on augmenting human intelligence and creativity, ensuring the generated content is factual and truly useful to users, rather than simply mass-producing content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:10">[01:28:10]</a>.

## First Steps for a Startup

If considering SEO as a growth opportunity:

1.  **Assess Addressable Market Size**: Use tools like Similarweb to analyze traffic of product and audience competitors. Is the potential meaningful compared to your goals? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:46">[01:28:46]</a>
2.  **Assess Existing Authority**: Determine your current non-SEO traffic and number of referring domains. Do you have enough traction for Google to take you seriously? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:57">[01:28:57]</a>
3.  **Compare with Other Channels**: Evaluate SEO's potential cost and return against alternative growth strategies. Does it make sense to allocate resources here now, or focus elsewhere first? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:09">[01:29:09]</a>

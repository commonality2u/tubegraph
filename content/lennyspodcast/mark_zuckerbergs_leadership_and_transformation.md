Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta (formerly Facebook), is noted as the longest-serving executive at the company, apart from Naomi Gleit herself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. He joined what was then called Facebook as employee number 29 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a> and has been with Meta for almost 20 years, witnessing its growth from 30 employees to a $1.5 trillion business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## Transformation and Public Perception

There has been a "profound transformation" in Mark Zuckerberg over the past few years, both in his [[Leadership and personal growth as a CEO | leadership]] style and his public image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>. Naomi Gleit believes this current public persona is the "Mark that I've known for the past 20 years," and the gap between public perception and his true self is closing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>.

This transformation is attributed to his nature as a "learn-it-all, not a know-it-all" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>. He is described as the fastest person at upskilling, exemplified by his annual challenges like learning Chinese to an eighth-grade fluency within a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:16:04]</a>. He has also significantly improved professional skills such as negotiation and public speaking, which he previously found uncomfortable and "scripted" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:31]</a>. This comfort allows people to see "who he really is" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:40]</a>.

Beyond professional skills, he has also excelled in personal passions like guitar and MMA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:13]</a>. His growth from a 19 or 20-year-old starting Facebook to running an 80,000-person organization naturally explains significant changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:48]</a>.

## Leadership Principles and Style

### The "Small Group"
Mark Zuckerberg manages Meta's vast organization, which has about 86,000 employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:12]</a>, through a core executive team he calls the "small group" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:23]</a>.

Key characteristics of the "small group":
*   **Mission-Driven Leaders:** It comprises leaders working on the company's most important projects, often with long tenure, who are motivated by the company's mission rather than career advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:58]</a>.
*   **"Disagreeable Givers":** Inspired by Adam Grant's framework, this group includes many "disagreeable givers" â€“ individuals who are motivated to do what is best for the company (givers) but are willing to challenge, push back, and fight for their beliefs (disagreeable) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:19">[00:22:31]</a>. This fosters a culture of direct and honest feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:16">[00:23:19]</a>.
*   **Accurate Feedback Loop:** Zuckerberg consciously creates a culture, including within his [[Leadership and Team Dynamics in HighGrowth Companies | leadership team]], that ensures he receives accurate feedback, counteracting the tendency for successful individuals to lose honest input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:51">[00:23:11]</a>.

The "small group" holds two types of weekly meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:25">[00:23:27]</a>:
1.  **Strategic Meeting:** More open-ended, longer, and unstructured, allowing for discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:29">[00:23:36]</a>.
2.  **Operational Meeting:** Highly structured, where project owners provide tactical weekly updates on priority projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:39">[00:23:54]</a>.

### Data-Driven and Product-Driven Approach
While Mark Zuckerberg didn't necessarily originate the concept of the growth team, he became a "huge proponent" of its data-driven approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:03">[00:25:22]</a>. The early growth team at Facebook, including Naomi Gleit, pushed for a strong emphasis on being data-driven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:27">[00:25:39]</a>. This involved instrumenting every step of flows (e.g., registration, onboarding) to identify drop-off points and key growth opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:16">[00:30:32]</a>. This product-driven approach, rather than relying solely on marketing, was considered the "Special Sauce" of the growth team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:52">[00:30:59]</a>. This philosophy expanded to other areas, such as social impact, where a product-driven approach led to billions of dollars raised for charity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:12">[00:31:38]</a>.

## Personal Qualities and Life Lessons

Zuckerberg is recognized as a "really great dad" and "really great husband," but also an "incredibly thoughtful friend" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:53]</a>.

### The Four Life Lessons
In 2014, during a difficult time for Naomi Gleit, Mark Zuckerberg volunteered with her to teach a class to middle school students in East Palo Alto about building a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:19]</a>. During this class, he shared four life lessons he wrote on a chalkboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:57]</a>:

1.  **Love yourself.** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>
2.  **Only then can you truly serve others.** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:07]</a>
3.  **Focus on what you can control.** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:09]</a>
4.  **For those things, never give up.** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:12]</a>

These lessons reflect his persistent nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:42]</a>.

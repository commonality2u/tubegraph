Naomi Gleit, Head of Product at [[insight_on_company_culture_and_leadership_at_meta | Meta]] and the company's longest-serving executive after Mark Zuckerberg, has witnessed his leadership evolve over nearly two decades [00:00:35], [00:02:22]. Joining what was then Facebook as employee number 29, she has seen the company scale from 30 employees to a $1.5 trillion business [00:00:49], [00:02:55].

## The Evolution of Mark Zuckerberg

Naomi Gleit notes a significant transformation in Mark Zuckerberg's public persona and leadership style over the past few years [00:15:07]. She observes that there has historically been a vast disconnect between public perception and who Mark truly is [00:15:24]. According to Gleit, the world is now "finally getting to see" the Mark she has known for 20 years, and this gap is closing [00:15:34], [00:17:24].

Key aspects of his transformation and character include:
*   **"Learn-it-all" Mentality** Mark is described as a "learn-it-all, not a know-it-all," possessing an unparalleled ability to upskill quickly [00:15:47]. An example includes his annual challenges, such as learning Chinese to an eighth-grade fluency level within a year [00:15:55]. He has also developed skills in guitar and MMA [00:16:10].
*   **Professional Development** He has significantly improved professional skills like negotiation and public speaking. In earlier days, he was less comfortable and appeared scripted, but he has since become more at ease, allowing his true self to be seen [00:16:16].
*   **Maturity and Experience** Starting Facebook at 19 or 20, he is now running an organization of 80,000 people, which naturally brings about changes in leadership and approach [00:16:44].
*   **Personal Side** Beyond his public image, Mark is a dedicated father to three daughters and a husband [00:17:40]. Naomi Gleit also highlights his quality as a "really good friend," citing an instance in 2014 where he invited her to co-teach a business class to middle school students in East Palo Alto after sensing she was going through a difficult time [00:17:46].

### Mark Zuckerberg's Life Lessons
During the business class he taught with Naomi, Mark distinctly shared four life lessons:
1.  Love yourself [00:19:00].
2.  Only then can you truly serve others [00:19:04].
3.  Focus on what you can control [00:19:07].
4.  For those things, never give up [00:19:09].

These principles reflect aspects of Mark's character, particularly his persistence ("for those things never give up") [00:19:37].

## The Small Group: A Leadership Model

Mark Zuckerberg leads [[insight_on_company_culture_and_leadership_at_meta | Meta]]'s massive organization through a core executive team known as the "small group" [00:20:21]. This group is composed of leaders working on the company's most critical projects, often independent of formal reporting structures [00:20:51].

Key characteristics and operational aspects of the "small group":
*   **Tenure and Mission-Driven** Many members, like Naomi, have been with the company for a very long time, fostering a motivation driven by the company's mission rather than solely corporate advancement [00:21:12].
*   **"Disagreeable Givers"** The group is characterized by "disagreeable givers" â€“ individuals who are deeply motivated by what's best for the company but are not afraid to push back or voice dissenting opinions, even if they are not what others want to hear [00:21:16], [00:22:19].
*   **Accurate Feedback Loop** Mark has actively cultivated a culture, including within his leadership team, that encourages direct and honest feedback [00:22:42]. This counteracts the tendency for leaders to lose an accurate feedback loop as they become more successful [00:22:51].
*   **Meeting Structure**
    *   **Strategic Meeting** One weekly, more open-ended and unstructured strategic meeting allowing for discussion [00:23:29].
    *   **Operational Meeting** One weekly, highly structured operational meeting to review priority projects, with owners providing weekly updates [00:23:39].

## Influencing Mark Zuckerberg: The Data-Driven Product Approach

While Mark Zuckerberg himself is a "learn-it-all" [00:15:47], Naomi Gleit and other early members of the [[growth_tactics_at_facebook_and_meta | Facebook growth team]] significantly influenced his focus on being data-driven [00:25:27].

*   **Origin of the Growth Team's Approach** The concept of a dedicated [[growth_tactics_at_facebook_and_meta | growth team]] did not necessarily originate from Mark [00:25:03]. Instead, early members like Naomi Gleit, Alex Schultz, and Javier Olivan strongly advocated for and highlighted the value of a data-driven approach [00:25:35].
*   **Product as a Growth Lever** The key insight pioneered by the [[growth_tactics_at_facebook_and_meta | growth team]] was that the product itself is the biggest lever for driving growth, rather than relying solely on traditional marketing or communications functions [00:29:11]. This led to product and engineering teams optimizing flows like registration, invites, and new user onboarding [00:29:32].
*   **"Understand, Identify, Execute" Framework** In 2009, the [[growth_tactics_at_facebook_and_meta | growth team]] paused its roadmap to focus entirely on data instrumentation [00:30:14]. This meant instrumenting every step of the registration and new user onboarding flows to identify drop-off points [00:30:20]. This allowed them to "understand" problems, "identify" key opportunities (e.g., increasing friending or addressing email confirmation drop-offs), and then "execute" by building products [00:30:28].
*   **Expanding the Approach** This data-driven, product-driven methodology, starting with the [[growth_tactics_at_facebook_and_meta | growth team]], was later extended to other areas, such as [[insight_on_company_culture_and_leadership_at_meta | Meta]]'s social impact initiatives [00:31:01] and even the translation of the platform into over 100 languages using community contributions rather than professional translators [00:32:48].

Uri Levine, co-founder of Waze and nine other companies, emphasizes the critical importance of effective [[hiring_practices_and_work_trials | hiring practices]] and, perhaps more crucially, decisive firing in startup environments. Having co-founded 10 companies and served on 20 startup boards, Levine brings a wealth of experience to these challenging aspects of building a team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## The Importance of Firing Quickly

Levine's core philosophy on team management, particularly concerning personnel changes, prioritizes immediate action when a fit isn't right.

### The 30-Day Rule for New Hires
Levine advises founders to set a calendar reminder for 30 days after hiring someone new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. At this 30-day mark, ask yourself one crucial question: "Knowing what I know today, would I hire this person?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

*   **If the answer is "yes"**: Tell the person you are excited they joined, that they are exceeding expectations, and consider offering them more equity to secure their loyalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:26">[00:57:26]</a>.
*   **If the answer is "no"**: "Fire them immediately" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. According to Levine, if the answer is no, they are already on a trajectory of not being successful and are causing damage to themselves, the founder, and the rest of the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:43">[00:57:43]</a>. They deserve to find a place where they can be successful, and it's not the current startup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:55">[00:57:55]</a>.

This [[hiring_practices_and_work_trials | hiring practice]] is based on the observation that most entrepreneurs realize within the first month if a new hire is not a good fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:14">[00:55:14]</a>. The problem is often not the team member, but the founder's inability to make a difficult decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:23">[00:55:23]</a>.

### The Consequences of Avoiding Hard Decisions
Levine states that roughly half of startup failures he's observed were due to the "team was not right" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:41">[00:54:41]</a>. When a CEO avoids making hard decisions, especially concerning underperforming team members, the top-performing individuals will eventually leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:48">[00:55:48]</a>. This occurs because high performers do not want to be part of an organization that is unable to make necessary tough calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:56">[00:55:56]</a>. In a small startup, everyone knows when someone shouldn't be there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:30">[00:56:30]</a>. Building a startup is already incredibly difficult; it becomes "Mission Impossible" if the right people leave while those who shouldn't be there remain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:40">[00:56:40]</a>.

### Seeking Confirmation for Tough Decisions
If a founder is looking for confirmation on a difficult personnel decision, Levine suggests speaking with top-performing team members and asking them how they would feel if the person in question were to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:16">[00:58:16]</a>. Their reaction, often surprising the founder, can serve as confirmation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:29">[00:58:29]</a>. This aligns with what is known as the "keeper test" at Netflix, where managers continually ask if they would fight to keep an employee if they were to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:41">[00:58:41]</a>.

## Reference Checks: The Key Question
When conducting reference checks for potential hires, Levine recommends asking one simple, direct question: "Would you hire him/her?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:11">[01:03:11]</a>. This aims to get a clear yes or no answer, cutting through ambiguity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:19">[01:03:19]</a>. If the reference says "yes," Levine suggests following up with "Why didn't you?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:32">[01:03:32]</a>.

## Broader Life Application
Levine extends this principle beyond [[hiring_and_developing_a_growth_team | hiring and developing a growth team]] to all aspects of life: "Knowing what you know today, would you do something different?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:07">[01:00:07]</a>. If the answer is yes, then act on it today, as "Today is the first day of the rest of your life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:17">[01:00:17]</a>. This applies to career paths, relationships, and any area where continuous assessment and decisive action can lead to improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:32">[01:00:32]</a>.

Ultimately, Levine advocates for a mindset of [[the_importance_of_velocity_in_startups | decisiveness]] and a willingness to confront difficult realities, whether in [[overcoming_hiring_challenges_in_tech_startups | overcoming hiring challenges in tech startups]] or navigating other [[challenges_and_strategies_in_startup_growth | challenges and strategies in startup growth]].

Product operations is an emerging role designed to support and scale product management within organizations, especially as companies grow and their product portfolios become more complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:11">[00:45:11]</a>. Melissa Perry is currently writing a book on this topic, aiming to provide insights into its functions and benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

## Why Product Operations is Needed

Many organizations face challenges with [[challenges_and_responsibilities_in_product_management | product management]] at scale, even if they have trained their people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. The core issue often lies in how goals are set and strategy is deployed, rather than just training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Without clear context or strategy, trained individuals may not know what to work towards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

Melissa Perry highlights several problems that arise when product management scales without proper operational support:
*   **Lack of Standardization** Processes become inconsistent, with different teams using varying roadmap formats, time horizons, or data presentation, making it difficult for leaders to compare or aggregate information for [[product_management_and_leadership_insights | strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:29">[00:44:29]</a>.
*   **Undefined Career Paths** Product managers may lack clear career ladders within the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:46">[00:44:46]</a>.
*   **Inefficient Meetings** Too many meetings occur, often with the wrong people in the room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:50">[00:44:50]</a>.
*   **Data Access Issues** Product managers may struggle to access the data needed to make informed decisions for their product strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:54">[00:44:54]</a>. A lack of readily available data for leaders to set strategy is a significant concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:04">[00:41:04]</a>.
*   **Customer Engagement Overload** Multiple teams may repeatedly contact the same customers for interviews, leading to frustration and burnout for those customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:59">[00:44:59]</a>. For example, athenahealth, with 350 product managers, faced issues with teams bothering the same hospital contacts repeatedly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>.

## Functions of Product Operations

Product operations helps organizations by getting the right insights to teams and standardizing outputs and check-ins to ensure alignment with the overall strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:16">[00:45:16]</a>. While not all companies will implement all three, the typical areas of focus include:

1.  **Internal Data and Insights**
    *   This team gathers data from various internal systems, such as financial platforms and user analytics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:34">[00:45:34]</a>.
    *   They surface this data in consumable ways, allowing product leaders to track strategy progress, monitor OKRs, and make informed decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:48">[00:45:48]</a>.
    *   Product operations helps provide the necessary inputs to establish and monitor [[product_management_and_leadership_insights | strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:56">[00:45:56]</a>.

2.  **Customer Research and User Insights**
    *   This focuses on external data and market research not already present within the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:04">[00:46:04]</a>.
    *   It involves standardizing customer research approaches to prevent over-contacting the same individuals and ensuring interviews are recorded and searchable for future reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:28">[00:46:28]</a>.
    *   The goal is to scale user research, making it more efficient and empowering product managers to conduct it effectively, rather than centralizing the practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:46">[00:46:46]</a>.

3.  **Process Standardization and Cadence Management**
    *   This involves standardizing processes and meeting cadences for strategic check-ins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:31">[00:47:31]</a>.
    *   Examples include defining who needs to be in monthly roadmap check-ins or outlining the inputs and outputs for quarterly executive planning sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:37">[00:47:37]</a>.
    *   Product operations standardizes processes that touch other divisions, such as updating sales on roadmaps or ensuring smooth working relationships with product marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:53">[00:47:53]</a>. It does not standardize internal team processes like daily stand-ups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:10">[00:48:10]</a>.

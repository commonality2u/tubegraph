To achieve goals and live an intentional life, [[The importance of following up on results in product management | accountability]] is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:35">[02:47:35]</a>. Many people operate in an "autopilot mode," going through daily routines without intentional direction or considering what truly matters to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:50">[01:39:50]</a>. Realizing this unconscious state and actively seeking to break free from it is the first step toward living a life without regret <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:50">[01:39:50]</a>.

## Why Accountability is Key
Graham Weaver, a professor at Stanford's Graduate School of Business and founder of Alpine Investors, likens seeking accountability to hiring a personal trainer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:50">[03:59:50]</a>. Just as a personal trainer ensures you show up and guides your exercises, external accountability increases your chances of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:50">[03:59:50]</a>. The financial commitment to a trainer or coach also serves as a motivator, as you're invested in getting your money's worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:39">[03:37:39]</a>.

## Methods for Building Accountability

### 1. Executive Coaching
For life and career goals, an executive coach acts as a personal trainer for your overall well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:40">[03:37:40]</a>. Graham hired his first executive coach in 2009 during the recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:48">[03:37:48]</a>.

Executive coaches help in two primary ways:
*   **Creating Space for Introspection** They help you make time to ask fundamental questions about various aspects of your life, including career, relationships, health, spirituality, and family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:57">[03:37:57]</a>. This process helps clarify your intentions and what you truly seek in these areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:13">[03:38:13]</a>.
*   **Holding You Accountable** Coaches provide a structured system to ensure you follow through on your intentions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:25">[03:38:25]</a>. One method described is a mandatory form submission before each session, detailing one-year goals, weekly progress, next steps, and desired outcomes for the upcoming call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:37">[03:38:37]</a>. Even without the call, the act of filling out this form weekly is profoundly powerful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:52">[03:38:52]</a>.

> "Everyone that you work with that is like a leader and exec basically has a coach and the people that have an exec coach will do better in their career and life than those who don't so why would you not have someone there just helping you become better at this craft like it just makes so much sense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:50">[04:42:50]</a>

### 2. Peer Accountability
If a professional coach is not feasible, finding a like-minded friend can provide similar benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:11">[03:39:11]</a>. This could involve regular meetings, like walking together, to discuss individual dreams, hopes, and progress toward goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:11">[03:39:11]</a>. This practice fosters mutual [[importance_of_trust_and_collaboration_in_team_environments | accountability]] and strengthens friendships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:02">[03:40:02]</a>.

### 3. The Power of Writing Down Goals
A simple yet highly effective method for personal accountability is consistently writing down your goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:15">[04:11:15]</a>. Graham shares his personal practice from college, where he wrote "I am the number one rower in the country" every morning, followed by three actions he would take that day to move toward that goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:15">[04:11:15]</a>. This daily ritual helps to:
*   **Program the Subconscious Mind** By repeatedly writing down goals, you align your subconscious mind with your aspirations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:15">[04:11:15]</a>.
*   **Increase Intentionality** This practice makes your actions more intentional, helping you move forward much faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:15">[04:11:15]</a>.
*   **Transform Limiting Beliefs** [[Challenges and common mistakes with OKRs | Limiting beliefs]], often residing in the subconscious, lose their power when written down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:15">[04:11:15]</a>. What seems like a scary, nebulous fear becomes a concrete to-do item that can be consciously addressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:15">[04:11:15]</a>.

> "You will get more done writing writing down the your goal and three things you're going to do to move toward that goal you'll get more things done in three months than you will in three years without that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:23">[04:22:23]</a>

Students in Graham's Stanford class are required to submit their goals and plans twice a week, a practice many continue years later due to its effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:15">[04:11:15]</a>.

### 4. The Benefit of Talking
Discussing your aspirations and challenges with someone else is another powerful tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:52">[04:49:52]</a>. Talking activates different and more extensive parts of the brain compared to just thinking or writing, offering greater clarity and insight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:52">[04:49:52]</a>.

Ultimately, getting clear on what constitutes a wonderful, amazing, incredible life across all its dimensions – career, relationships, finances, spirituality – and then actively working toward it with accountability is the path to fulfillment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:26">[05:28:26]</a>.

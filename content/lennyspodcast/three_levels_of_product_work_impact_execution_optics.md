Shreyas Doshi introduces a framework of three distinct levels of product work: Impact, Execution, and Optics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:54">[00:53:54]</a>. Understanding these levels explains much of what occurs within [[effective_product_management_strategies | product teams]] and organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:01">[00:54:01]</a>.

## Understanding the Levels and Potential Mismatches

Conflicts often arise between intelligent and well-intentioned individuals or groups within a company because they tend to operate at different levels of product work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:18">[00:57:18]</a>. Individuals may default to a certain level, and while they can switch, it often requires a nudge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:50">[00:57:50]</a>.

Consider a scenario where a Product Manager (PM) is presenting a product review to a CEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:26">[00:54:26]</a>. The PM, fixated on the *Execution* level, details how to get things done and hit milestones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:20">[00:56:20]</a>. However, the CEO approaches the discussion from the *Impact* level, focusing on the effect on customer experience or brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:38">[00:56:38]</a>. This mismatch in thinking levels, rather than the specific details of the issue, is often the root cause of misunderstanding and conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:08">[00:57:08]</a>.

### Execution
This level focuses on the practicalities of getting work done, hitting milestones, and the "how-to" aspects of a project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:20">[00:56:20]</a>. For early-stage teams, optimizing for execution is crucial, as immediate impact might not be visible on a short horizon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:02">[01:02:02]</a>.

### Impact
This level is concerned with the ultimate effect of the product on customers, the brand, or the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:42">[00:56:42]</a>. This is often the primary focus for [[role_of_product_leaders | product leaders]] and founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:47">[00:56:47]</a>.

### Optics
Optics is defined as "creating awareness of the impact and the execution that you're doing or your team is doing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:39">[00:58:39]</a>. This refers primarily to *internal optics*, distinct from external marketing and PR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:04">[00:59:04]</a>.

#### The Importance and Pitfalls of Optics
Optics, when used appropriately, is beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:51">[00:58:51]</a>. It generates energy, awareness, excitement, and provides opportunities for feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:19">[00:59:19]</a>. Properly managed optics can lead to greater impact and better execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:28">[00:59:28]</a>.

However, challenges arise when optics become the primary goal, especially in organizations where the culture implicitly suggests that strong optics alone will lead to appreciation and reward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:41">[00:59:41]</a>. This can happen through everyday actions, hiring, firing, promotion decisions, and what leaders choose to highlight at all-hands meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:14">[01:00:14]</a>. For example, consistently appreciating a well-written status update (an optics activity that doesn't in itself accomplish anything) can send a signal to focus disproportionately on optics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:33">[01:00:33]</a>. This overemphasis can be detrimental to genuine impact and execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:01">[01:01:01]</a>.

## Applying the Framework
The framework provides a common vocabulary to discuss where a team's focus lies, without assigning blame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:20">[01:01:20]</a>. The optimal focus depends on the specific context of the team and organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:51">[01:01:51]</a>.

For instance, a platform team experiencing availability issues might explicitly decide to increase their focus on optics to improve communication with other teams that rely on them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:55">[01:02:55]</a>. This doesn't negate the need for impact or execution, but it acknowledges a current need for clearer communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:19">[01:03:19]</a>. The goal is not to declare one level inherently "right" or "wrong," but to be sensitive and adaptable to what is most appropriate for a given situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:34">[01:03:34]</a>.

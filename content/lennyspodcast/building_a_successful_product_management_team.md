Ramp's rapid growth has positioned it as one of the fastest-growing SaaS businesses in history, reaching over $100 million in annual run rate in two years with a lean team of 50 people in their R&D department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. Jeff Charles, VP of Product at Ramp, shares insights into how they operationalize a culture of velocity, define strategy, and empower individual team members to achieve this success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

## Velocity as a Core Principle

Velocity is paramount at Ramp, influencing product development, team incentives, hiring, promotion, decision-making, and organizational structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. This focus originated during the pandemic when a small team faced a large market opportunity, making execution speed crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. High velocity allows teams to iterate quickly, leading to impact over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>, and attracts top talent who want to build and ship things rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. It also helps de-risk decisions because the cost of a wrong decision is low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.

Examples of Ramp's velocity include:
*   Building a competitor to MX in three months with roughly eight engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.
*   Developing a competitor to Expensify six months later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.
*   Expanding into accounts payable, where a team of three engineers, one designer, and one [[becoming_a_successful_product_manager | PM]] built a competitor to Bill.com in three months, generating billions of dollars annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.

The "recipe" for this velocity involves small, single-threaded teams with focused goals, ample resources, tight timelines, and protection from organizational chaos until product-market fit is achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

### Operationalizing Velocity
At Ramp, velocity is achieved through:
*   **Small, Single-Threaded Teams**: Most individuals can only execute extremely well on one thing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. Single-threaded means one goal, one focus, eliminating any other tasks like research, production engineering, or unrelated processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>. An example is the "Flex product" team, purely focused on e-commerce companies' cash flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.
*   **Shielding Teams**: Dedicated individuals, like production engineers on a rotational program, protect core teams from escalations, bugs, and issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>. Product operators protect [[becoming_a_successful_product_manager | product managers]] from documentation, escalations, release management, enablement, and customer requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>. For big bets, sub-teams are reorganized without responsibility for existing products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.
*   **Lofty Goals**: Ramp leverages market comparables (e.g., Bill.com, Expensify) and visionary designs to motivate teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>. Designs, crafted by designers, visualize the future product, anchoring motivation alongside revenue goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>.
*   **Context Over Control**: Instead of micromanaging solutions, leaders align on goals, hypotheses, supporting data, and potential solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>. Jeff Charles's role involves constantly giving context to teams, allowing them to make better decisions by understanding the "why" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>. This approach encourages teams to focus on the right goals and data points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>.
*   **Streamlined Processes**: Meetings should be for collaboration and decision-making, not status updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:44">[00:26:44]</a>. Statuses are done asynchronously through systems teams operate in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:37">[00:26:37]</a>. Ramp also avoids unnecessary internal processes like extensive bug backlogs, fixing bugs as they surface, and reducing detailed ticket writing by [[becoming_a_successful_product_manager | product managers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>.
*   **Clarity on Trade-offs**: Leaders must be clear about what they are *not* doing to enable focus and velocity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:29">[00:27:29]</a>. Presenting a "menu of items" allows leadership to choose priorities, leading to faster execution on fewer things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:40">[00:27:40]</a>.

## Quality and Accountability

While prioritizing velocity, Ramp maintains quality through specific control mechanisms:
*   **Voice of Customer Processes**: Every negative review is shared with the tech lead, [[becoming_a_successful_product_manager | PM]], and designer monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>.
*   **Metrics Reporting**: NPS and CSAT are regularly reported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:16">[00:22:16]</a>.
*   **Operational Overhead**: Teams track the percentage of support tickets originating from their product area, normalized by user count <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">[00:22:22]</a>. Maintaining a low operational burden is a core contract for teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a>.
*   **Direct Bug Assignment**: Bugs and issues are directly assigned to the engineer on call, ensuring they feel the impact and are motivated to fix problems quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:37">[00:22:37]</a>.
*   **User Experience (UX) Improvements**: Ramp tracks support tickets caused by customer confusion. If this number is elevated, teams are directed to fix these issues before shipping new features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:21">[00:23:21]</a>. As long as teams maintain these metrics, they have autonomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:55">[00:23:55]</a>.

## Planning and Strategy

Ramp's planning philosophy emphasizes doing over extensive planning. They introduce new joiners to an "implicit contract" that prioritizes velocity over almost everything else, accepting some chaos and quick changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:06">[00:33:06]</a>.

*   **Strategy Document**: Every product pod writes its own strategy document, acting as a contract with leadership. This document outlines:
    *   Goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:10">[00:38:10]</a>
    *   Hypotheses (why they think it will work) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:13">[00:38:13]</a>
    *   Unique positioning (why Ramp is uniquely suited to achieve the goal) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:19">[00:38:19]</a>
    *   Metrics to measure success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:23">[00:38:23]</a>
    *   Initiatives, risks, and long-term outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:27">[00:38:27]</a>
    *   These pod-level strategies are then aligned with the higher-level product and financial strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:52">[00:38:52]</a>.
*   **Reduced Planning Time**: Ramp moved from quarterly, month-long planning sessions (33% of time) to a bi-annual, one-pager company priority document that is much smoother and faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:06">[00:40:06]</a>.
*   **OKRs**: Ramp uses OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) primarily for cross-functional initiatives or financial goals rather than detailed product planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:50">[00:42:50]</a>. The product roadmap is the main contract, and the overall leadership is accountable for it meeting company goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:07">[00:44:07]</a>.

## Hiring and Talent

Ramp's success is heavily attributed to its A-plus engineering and design talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:09">[00:25:09]</a>. They prioritize investing in R&D as a first-class citizen, paying competitively, and building a strong tech brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:22">[00:25:22]</a>.

### Key Traits of Successful Product Managers
When hiring [[becoming_a_successful_product_manager | product managers]], Ramp looks for:
*   **Desire for Impact**: Assessed by past impact or reasons for leaving previous roles (e.g., "things got too slow") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:08">[01:06:08]</a>.
*   **Deep Thinking**: Interviewers go deep into past decisions and trade-offs to understand how candidates think <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:44">[01:06:44]</a>.
*   **Hunger**: A strong drive to achieve and win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:17">[01:07:17]</a>.

Ramp tends to overemphasize these skills rather than necessarily experience, as their business is unique, and past experiences may not directly apply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:02">[01:07:02]</a>.

### Breaking into Product Management
To transition into [[product_management_career_advice | product management]], Jeff Charles advises:
*   **Deep Customer and Product Understanding**: Show impact by combining deep customer and product knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:49">[01:07:49]</a>.
*   **Adjacent Roles**: Find roles adjacent to product that provide relevant experiences, such as product operations, business operations, sales engineering, or solutions engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:16">[01:08:16]</a>.
*   **Prove Yourself**: Demonstrate the ability to do the [[becoming_a_successful_product_manager | PM]] job, often by taking on responsibilities typically assigned to [[becoming_a_successful_product_manager | product managers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:40">[01:08:40]</a>.
*   **Trial Periods**: Ramp sometimes offers a six-month trial period in a new area, with engineers and designers on the team making the final decision on whether the trial [[becoming_a_successful_product_manager | PM]] should join permanently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:50">[01:08:50]</a>.

## Empowering Teams and Avoiding Burnout

Ramp aims to empower everyone to think like a [[becoming_a_successful_product_manager | PM]], giving designers autonomy over specs and priorities and engineers the freedom to break down work and drive projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:34">[00:58:34]</a>. This distributes the traditional [[becoming_a_successful_product_manager | PM]] workload across the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:09">[01:00:09]</a>. The core role of a [[becoming_a_successful_product_manager | product manager]] at Ramp includes:
*   Team building and fostering culture within their specific product pod <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:31">[01:00:31]</a>.
*   Ensuring the team maintains focus on key areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:04">[01:01:04]</a>.
*   Protecting the team from external stakeholders and acting as the central point of contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:10">[01:01:10]</a>.

While a high-velocity culture might seem to lead to burnout, Jeff Charles argues that burnout often occurs when effort doesn't lead to impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:40">[00:29:40]</a>. Velocity, conversely, can help avoid burnout by enabling people to achieve flow states and see their work move forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:04">[00:30:04]</a>. The key is to make work meaningful to individuals, where they feel aligned with goals, empowered with solutions, and like they own their "mini company" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:44">[00:31:44]</a>.

## The Role of Writing and Deep Work

Jeff Charles emphasizes writing as a critical tool for clear thinking and problem-solving. When faced with complex questions, he advises:
1.  **Stop and Think**: Shut down the laptop, take out paper, and write the question simply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:39">[00:49:39]</a>.
2.  **Solo Ideation**: Spend time thinking and trying to answer the question independently before seeking external information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:47">[00:49:47]</a>.
3.  **Refine with Reading**: After initial thinking, read to fine-tune ideas and identify new questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:25">[00:51:25]</a>.

This approach helps to scale decision-making, incentivize teams, manage headcount, avoid politics, and make critical strategic choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:03">[00:50:03]</a>. Jeff believes writing clearly translates to thinking clearly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:47">[00:50:47]</a>.

To facilitate deep work and writing, Jeff:
*   Blocks out time in his calendar at the end of the week for the next week's deep thinking questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:50">[00:52:50]</a>.
*   Works one day on the weekend for deep work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:04">[00:53:04]</a>.
*   Utilizes early mornings, late afternoons, or weekend days to avoid being in the "critical path" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:26">[00:53:26]</a>.
*   Keeps his calendar unavailable for general meetings, reserving direct contact for critical issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:49">[00:53:49]</a>.

For organization and task management, Jeff recommends:
*   At the end of every meeting, write down tasks owed by self and others clearly, with due dates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:04">[00:55:04]</a>.
*   At the end of the day, group tasks into logical chunks (tactical vs. strategic, important vs. less important) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:31">[00:55:31]</a>.
*   Set Slack reminders for tasks owed by others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:44">[00:55:44]</a>.
*   Focus on freeing up mental "headspace for processing" rather than memory by writing everything down and relying on searchable systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:55">[00:55:55]</a>.
*   Turn off notifications, check emails once a day, and check Slack only at the top of the hour to minimize distractions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:29">[01:14:29]</a>.

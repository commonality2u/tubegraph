Many large companies that traditionally didn't grow up building software are now undergoing [[new_company_approach_and_the_shift_from_traditional_growth_strategies | digital transformations]] to improve their software capabilities and remain competitive [00:40:00]. These organizations often turn to frameworks like Scrum and Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) in their efforts to build products more effectively [00:46:00].

## The Rise of the Product Owner Role and Agile Frameworks
The product owner role, the third fastest-growing role in tech, is largely a phenomenon outside of Silicon Valley's native software companies [02:34:00]. This role emerged not from traditional product management, but as a way to help developers prioritize work within Agile methodologies [00:23:00].

Agile itself began as a movement by software developers in 2001, resulting in the Agile Manifesto, which outlined principles for building better software [01:01:00]. Scrum, a popular Agile framework, was codified by Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland, outlining roles like the product owner and scrum master [01:17:00].

### The Product Owner in Scrum
In its initial version, the Scrum Guide stated the product owner was responsible for "maximizing the value of work done" and could be a product manager for commercial development or a user department manager for in-house development [01:08:00]. However, later versions, particularly the 2013 guide, omitted the suggestion that the product owner could be a product manager [01:13:00].

Historically, the product owner role emerged from a need to help developers prioritize what to work on [02:05:00]. Product owners in this context often became order-takers, focusing on writing user stories and managing backlogs, rather than engaging in strategic work like market research or customer understanding [01:57:00].

### Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe)
SAFe emerged from a desire to scale Scrum and other processes to large organizations [02:00:00]. It was marketed as a comprehensive model for software development, providing a detailed map of an operating model [02:48:00]. Executives in large enterprises appreciate SAFe because it prescribes a structured approach to tying multiple agile teams together at scale [02:57:00].

However, SAFe also contributed to the split between product manager and product owner roles, often placing product owners within agile teams focused on tactical work, while product managers handle broader strategy and discovery [03:21:00].

## Challenges and Pitfalls
Despite the appeal of structured frameworks, many organizations implementing Agile and SAFe encounter significant challenges:

*   **Over-reliance on Process:** Companies can get too caught up in process (e.g., rigid Sprint cadences, numerous meetings) instead of focusing on delivering value and customer outcomes [02:50:00]. There's a risk of "talking about work about work, but not actually getting into what are we achieving here" [05:17:00].
*   **Lack of Strategic Product Management:** Frameworks like Scrum and SAFe don't adequately describe how to perform critical product management activities such as market research, experimentation, and data analysis [01:57:00].
*   **Disconnected Roles:** The separation of product owner and product manager roles can create a highly tactical product owner position without exposure to strategic thinking, hindering career growth [03:37:00]. Some organizations even have separate career paths for these roles [03:47:00].
*   **Insufficient Discovery:** Product teams often commit to work quarterly without adequate upfront discovery or customer feedback, leading to building the wrong things [03:19:00]. Teams frequently claim they "don't have time" for discovery because they are constantly sprinting [03:58:00].
*   **Absence of Product Vision:** Many large organizations lack a strong, transparent product strategy that connects product efforts back to overarching business goals [04:19:00].
*   **Lack of Skilled Leadership:** Leaders buying into these frameworks may not have prior experience running large-scale technology organizations [05:00:00]. Middle managers, whose jobs are often in jeopardy during transformation, can resist change [04:05:00].

## A Holistic Approach to Digital Transformation
For organizations considering a [[new_company_approach_and_the_shift_from_traditional_growth_strategies | digital transformation]], a comprehensive approach beyond just adopting a development framework is essential.

### Develop a Product Operating Model
Instead of merely adopting a development operating model, organizations should define a holistic product operating model that includes:
*   **Product Strategy:** A clear strategy for how products will drive business goals and expand geographically [04:05:00].
*   **Organizational Design:** Structuring teams effectively around products with good coverage of skilled product managers [04:10:00].
*   **Product Operations:** Ensuring the necessary infrastructure (e.g., data access, customer feedback mechanisms) is in place to support product and development teams [04:21:00].
*   **Culture and Incentives:** Rewarding teams for delivering value and achieving business outcomes, not just for shipping features [04:26:00].
*   **Transparency:** Establishing processes and tools (e.g., road mapping tools) to provide visibility into what 4,000+ teams are doing and how it aligns with business goals [04:41:00].

### Prioritize Product Management Expertise
Instead of separating product owners and product managers, organizations should aim to have all product owners function as product managers [05:26:00]. This means:
*   **Focus on Value and Outcomes:** Emphasize understanding customers, solving their problems, and driving measurable business results [04:56:00].
*   **Empower Product Managers:** Ensure product managers have the autonomy and resources to conduct market research, test hypotheses, and make informed decisions [04:14:00].
*   **Invest in Career Paths:** Create clear career ladders for product roles that allow for growth into strategic leadership positions, addressing the "where's my career path" concern often voiced by product owners [04:50:00].

### Strategic Hiring and Continuous Learning
*   **Intersperse Experienced Talent:** Bring in experienced product leaders (Directors, VPs, CPOs) who understand how to build great products at scale and can mentor internal staff [05:32:00].
*   **Commit to Learning:** Leaders new to technology organizations should proactively seek knowledge from other CPOs and understand their own skill gaps, hiring to complement their strengths [05:50:00].
*   **Baseline and Assess Skills:** Provide training to all product staff to establish a common understanding of product management, then assess individual skill sets to determine roles and opportunities for growth [05:31:00]. Some individuals may even realize product management isn't for them and transition to other valuable roles like operations or data analysis [05:40:00].

## Embracing True Agile Principles
At its core, Agile is about moving quickly and delivering great value to customers [01:52:00]. Organizations should embrace these principles rather than becoming rigid about specific processes [01:57:00].

*   **Inspect and Adapt:** Regularly evaluate processes and discard those that are not serving the company's best interest, even if they are prescribed by a framework [02:45:00].
*   **Question Certifications:** Be skeptical of certifications that promise to make someone a competent product manager in a short time [06:40:00]. Real product management requires experience and continuous learning, not just a two-day class [06:40:00]. While certifications might help entry into certain organizations, they are not valued by top tech companies [06:40:00].
*   **Focus on Outcomes in Resumes:** When describing product roles, focus on the value delivered, problems solved, and metrics impacted, rather than listing process-oriented tasks [06:26:00].

Digital transformation is not a "plug-and-play" solution [05:00:00]. It requires a fundamental shift in how a company views software development and product leadership. While it's okay for traditional companies to operate differently from tech giants like Google or Amazon, they can still learn from their success and apply core principles of customer focus, continuous feedback, and strategic product leadership to build amazing products [06:21:00]. Leaders must recognize that software strategy is intertwined with overall company strategy and elevate product roles to the C-suite to drive innovation and competitive advantage [06:31:00].

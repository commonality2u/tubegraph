Historically, engineers have sometimes been treated "a little bit like children" rather than being given the responsibilities needed to thrive as adults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This perspective often led to sheltering engineers from critical business problems, under the assumption that "the engineers won't want to do that work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. However, there is a growing movement towards treating engineers as peers and integrating them into senior [[mentorship_and_team_leadership | leadership roles]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Shifting Landscape and Engineer Empowerment

The market has undergone significant changes, particularly moving from the "zero interest rate era" to a different economic climate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. This shift has altered the dynamic for engineers. In the past, engineers often had significant leverage over companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. This led to a culture where middle management was heavily evaluated on hiring and retention, prompting them to "coddle a little bit" to avoid losing team members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. While this approach might have aided retention, it was ultimately detrimental to engineers, teams, and organizational efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

A positive highlight of the current [[skills_for_the_evolving_engineering_landscape | evolving engineering landscape]] is the opportunity to treat engineers like peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. This means placing them in senior leadership roles without the baseline assumption that they need to be "coddled or hid from the real problems" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. By giving engineers challenging, real-world problems and holding them accountable, they gain valuable opportunities to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

## Accountability and Career Progression

The ability to hold engineers accountable is crucial for their progression into senior roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. If companies are unwilling to hold engineers accountable due to retention fears, it limits their placement in senior positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. This shift allows engineers to achieve the career progression they desire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. Will Larson's book, *Staff Engineer*, explores the career paths available for senior engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

### Measuring Engineering Productivity and Alignment

In the context of engineers in leadership, measuring productivity and effectiveness becomes paramount, especially during times of team reduction and increased focus on efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:45">[00:48:45]</a>.

A primary method for assessing engineering effectiveness is through direct communication:
*   **Talk to Engineers**: Engineers themselves often know if their teams are effective and can identify the reasons for any inefficiencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:32">[00:50:32]</a>.
*   **Align with Business and Product Goals**: Engineering evaluation should be "wholly accountable to the product goals," rather than operating in isolation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:27">[00:51:27]</a>. The purpose of engineering is to support the product and customers, not merely to build novel systems for their own sake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:50">[00:51:50]</a>.
*   **Show the Roadmap**: Clearly demonstrating the valuable, impactful work accomplished in recent months (e.g., six months) can provide clear evidence of productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:03">[00:52:03]</a>.

### Metrics and Tools

While various metrics and dashboards exist (like those based on the DORA metrics: lead time, incident remediation time, failure rate), they are primarily useful as "diagnosis metrics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:30">[00:53:30]</a>. They indicate *where* to focus improvements, not necessarily overall company success or failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:41">[00:53:41]</a>. Leaders must be comfortable reporting on imperfect measures, using them as opportunities to educate stakeholders on the nuances of engineering data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:41">[00:54:41]</a>.

### Strengthening EM-PM Relationships

A key aspect of empowering engineers in leadership, especially for engineering managers (EMs), is fostering strong relationships with [[coaching_and_leadership_in_product_management | product management]] (PMs). Common issues include misaligned incentives or a lack of understanding of each other's needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:39">[00:41:39]</a>.

Recommendations for [[empowering_product_teams_and_operationalizing_context_over_control | empowering product teams]]:
*   **Understand Incentives**: Acknowledge that PMs and EMs have different incentives (e.g., sales goals vs. engineering stability) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:44">[00:41:44]</a>. While simplistic villain narratives are unhelpful, understanding the underlying business needs is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:22">[00:42:22]</a>.
*   **Deep Understanding Before Solving**: Before attempting to resolve conflicts or push for changes, EMs and PMs should strive to deeply understand what the other party truly cares about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:04">[00:43:04]</a>. Often, a compromise can be found that satisfies both parties' true needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:27">[00:43:27]</a>.
*   **Shared Performance Ratings**: One experimental approach involves EMs and PMs receiving the same performance rating, fostering shared incentives and a unified perspective on execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:06">[00:44:06]</a>. This can extend to other functions like design managers or even business leadership in a "trifecta" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:07">[00:45:07]</a>.
*   **Invisible Constraints**: PMs may not realize that engineering managers are often stressed about balancing product demands with their team's need for "interesting work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>. These "invisible constraints" can make EMs seem unreliable, but understanding them can lead to more honest conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:50">[00:47:50]</a>.

## Further Reading

For those aspiring to or working alongside engineering executives, *The Engineering Executive's Primer* by Will Larson, releasing in early 2024, aims to provide insights into this role and how to work effectively with CTOs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:39">[01:11:39]</a>.

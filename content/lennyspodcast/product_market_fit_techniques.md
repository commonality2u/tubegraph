[[Product market fit]] is a critical concept for any startup, defined as being in a good market with a product that can satisfy that market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Rahul Vora, founder and CEO of Superhuman, shares unique insights into achieving and optimizing [[framework_for_finding_productmarket_fit | product market fit]], emphasizing both deliberate strategy and attention to detail.

## Core Principles of Product Market Fit

According to Rahul Vora, the idea of [[framework_for_finding_productmarket_fit | product market fit]] can be broken down into measurable and optimizable components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>.

He identifies four core ideas:
1.  **Measure Product Market Fit:** It is possible to quantify how well your product fits the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:17:00">[53:17:00]</a>.
2.  **Optimize Product Market Fit:** Once measured, the fit can be improved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:22:00">[53:22:00]</a>.
3.  **Systematically Increase Product Market Fit:** A systematic approach can lead to a numerical increase in product market fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:24:00">[53:24:00]</a>.
4.  **Algorithmic Roadmap Generation:** An algorithm can even generate a roadmap guaranteed to increase product market fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:30:00">[53:30:00]</a>.

A key paradox in this process is the need to deliberately *not* act on feedback from many early users, while simultaneously listening intensely and building what people want <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. The product cannot cater to "all people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## The Sean Ellis Test and PMF Optimization

The foundational method for measuring [[indicators_and_metrics_for_productmarket_fit_progression | product market fit progression]] is the [[shan_ellis_test_and_product_market_fit | Sean Ellis test]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:30:00">[55:30:00]</a>.

### Measuring PMF
The core question asked to users is: "How would you feel if you could no longer use this product?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:13:00">[55:13:00]</a>.
Possible responses:
*   "Very disappointed" (devastated/need the product) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:22:00">[55:22:00]</a>
*   "Somewhat disappointed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:21:00">[55:21:00]</a>
*   "Not disappointed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:22:00">[55:22:00]</a>

Sean Ellis found that companies that struggled to grow had less than 40% "very disappointed" responses, while fast-growing companies almost always had more than 40% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:40:00">[55:40:00]</a>. This metric is more predictive of success than Net Promoter Score (NPS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:55:00">[55:55:00]</a>.

### Optimizing PMF and Roadmap Generation
To increase the "very disappointed" percentage:
*   **Do not over-act on feedback from "very disappointed" users:** They already love the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:20:00">[56:20:00]</a>.
*   **Do not act on feedback from "not disappointed" users:** They are too far from loving the product and are essentially a lost cause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:25:00">[56:25:00]</a>.
*   **Focus on the "somewhat disappointed" segment:** These users "kind of love" the product, suggesting that small improvements can convert them into "very disappointed" users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:35:00">[56:35:00]</a>.

Within the "somewhat disappointed" group, further segment by those for whom the main benefit of the product resonates, and those for whom it doesn't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:43:00">[56:43:00]</a>.

1.  **Identify main benefits:** Ask "very disappointed" users *why* they love the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:52:00">[56:52:00]</a>. For Superhuman, this was speed, keyboard shortcuts, design, and time-saving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:57:00">[56:57:00]</a>.
2.  **Filter feedback:** For "somewhat disappointed" users, ask if they like the product for its main benefit or something else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:07:00">[57:07:00]</a>. Politely disregard feedback from those who don't resonate with the main benefit, as they are pulling the product in a different direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:15:00">[57:15:00]</a>.
3.  **Generate roadmap:** Now you have a list of features/aspects people love and a list of specific objections from the targeted "somewhat disappointed" segment.
    *   At the start of each planning cycle, dedicate half the time to **doubling down on what people already love** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:01:00">[58:01:00]</a>.
    *   Dedicate the other half to **systematically overcoming the objections** of the "somewhat disappointed" users who resonate with the main benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:04:00">[58:04:00]</a>.

This approach effectively creates an "algorithm" to guide product development, guaranteed to increase [[framework_for_finding_productmarket_fit | product market fit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:34:00">[53:34:00]</a>. While Superhuman no longer runs this exact engine on the entire product, it is used for individual sub-products (e.g., Superhuman for Sales) and for starting new products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:28:00">[58:28:00]</a>.

### Application of the Sean Ellis Test
Surveys can be conducted via email or in-product pop-ups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:02:00">[59:02:00]</a>. However, changing the survey methodology will invalidate previous numbers, requiring a new baseline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:15:00">[59:15:00]</a>.

## Other Contributing Techniques to PMF

### 1. The Power of Word of Mouth and Brand
The "secret behind virality" is not complex viral mechanics, but rather organic word of mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:53:00">[06:53:00]</a>. This happens when one user spontaneously tells another user about your product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:00">[09:06:00]</a>. To foster this, a product must be "remarkable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:49:00">[11:49:00]</a>.

Superhuman bakes "raw ingredients for growth" directly into its company values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:16:00">[13:16:00]</a>:
*   **Create Delight:** Make something so joyful that it truly brings delight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:53:00">[12:53:00]</a>.
*   **Deliver Remarkable Quality:** Create something so striking, compelling, and worthy of attention that people can't help but tell others about it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:00:00">[13:00:00]</a>.
*   **Build the Extraordinary:** Focus on efficacy and innovativeness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:08:00">[13:08:00]</a>.

### 2. Manual Onboarding
For years, Superhuman manually onboarded every new user with one-on-one concierge sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:47:00">[47:47:00]</a>. This was done to:
*   **Boost User Metrics:** Significantly improve engagement, retention, product market fit scores, NPS, and virality benchmarks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:56:00">[49:56:00]</a>.
*   **Create a Brand:** Kickstart a strong brand by creating a cohort of "super fans" who will spread word of mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:15:00">[50:15:00]</a>.
*   **Focus Engineering:** In an environment with accessible funding, engineers could focus on [[creating_productmarket_fit_and_operationalizing_product_quality | finding product market fit]], solution deepening, or market widening, rather than building complex first-time user experiences or activation flows (as humans handled activation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:48:00">[50:48:00]</a>.

Superhuman scaled this to about 20 people doing manual onboarding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:36:00">[48:36:00]</a>. They stopped when reaching a "top of funnel width" where manually onboarding no longer made financial sense and to cater to personality types who prefer self-service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:31:00">[52:31:00]</a>.

### 3. Strategic Positioning & Differentiated Focus
Choosing a clear, unique, and available position that reinforces product strategy is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:40:00">[43:40:00]</a>. For Superhuman, this was **speed** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:34:00">[44:34:00]</a>.

To identify this:
1.  **Interview Potential Customers:** Ask about pain points with existing solutions. Superhuman found that email took too much time and existing tools were too slow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:16:00">[44:16:00]</a>.
2.  **Assess Uniqueness & Availability:** Determine if the chosen position is unique and not currently occupied by competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:39:00">[44:39:00]</a>. (e.g., Google Chrome's focus on speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:56:00">[44:56:00]</a>).
3.  **Reinforce Product Strategy:** Ensure the position aligns with and amplifies the product's core strengths and competitive advantages (e.g., incumbents struggle with speed due to scale and architecture) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:16:00">[45:16:00]</a>.
4.  **The "Cocktail Party Test":** Observe how users spontaneously pitch the product to others. If the pitch is simple and aligns with the chosen position (e.g., "Dude, you have to use it. It's really fast."), it's a good sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:37:00">[45:37:00]</a>.

### 4. Intentional Product Quality and Attention to Detail
Rahul Vora emphasizes that for mission-critical products like email, a "half-baked" launch can be detrimental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:24:00">[42:24:00]</a>. The approach to quality depends on the market and business model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:59:00">[38:59:00]</a>. While some greenfield opportunities or marketplaces prioritize speed above all else due to network effects, products like Superhuman require immense attention to detail.

Examples of attention to detail:
*   **Custom Font:** Superhuman uses a modified version of Adele Sands, chosen after extensive research to optimize for aesthetics, message conveyance, reading speed, and email address display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:31:00">[33:31:00]</a>. This decision was made pre-launch, with only 10-15 users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:59:00">[37:59:00]</a>.
*   **Time Autocompleter:** A "toy" feature allowing natural language input for setting reminders, which is fun, encourages playful exploration, and elicits pleasant surprises for users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:37">[01:03:37]</a>. This aligns with [[creating_productmarket_fit_and_operationalizing_product_quality | game design principles]] in software.

### 5. Game Design (vs. Gamification)
Instead of mere gamification (adding points, levels), game design focuses on making business software genuinely fun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.
*   **Intrinsic Motivation:** Gamification often undermines intrinsic motivation with external rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:45">[01:04:45]</a>.
*   **Goals, Emotions, Toys, Controls, Flow:** Superhuman focuses on these five areas from game design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:56">[01:02:56]</a>.
*   **"Fun Toys":** Design features that are fun on their own, even without a goal, and combine them into a larger "game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>.

### 6. Pricing Strategy
Pricing should follow positioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:02">[01:06:02]</a>. For Superhuman, positioned as the best email tool for high-performing individuals and teams, they serve the high end of the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>.

They used the **Van Westendorp Price Sensitivity Meter** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:04">[01:07:04]</a>, asking four questions to early users:
1.  Too expensive (would not buy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:15">[01:07:15]</a>.
2.  Too cheap (worried about quality, wouldn't buy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:21">[01:07:21]</a>.
3.  Starting to get expensive (not out of the question, but requires thought) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:29">[01:07:29]</a>.
4.  A bargain (great buy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:40">[01:07:40]</a>.

Most startups aim for price point #4 (bargain), especially in greenfield marketplaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:46">[01:07:46]</a>. However, Superhuman chose price point #3 ($30/month) to align with its "best-in-class" position, allowing for the perception of high value and justifying the cost through significant ROI (e.g., saving 4+ hours/week) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:07">[01:08:07]</a>.

### 7. Solution Deepening vs. Market Widening
At different [[stages_of_productmarket_fit | stages of product market fit]], companies must balance "solution deepening" (making the product better for existing users) and "market widening" (making the product available to more users) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>.
*   **Early Stages:** Focus R&D on solution deepening to achieve [[creating_productmarket_fit_and_operationalizing_product_quality | product market fit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.
*   **Later Stages:** Investment shifts to market widening (e.g., supporting more platforms, integrations like Office 365, iOS, Android), which can decrease perceived product velocity but is necessary for continued growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>. This is a common [[challenges_of_achieving_productmarket_fit | challenge of achieving product market fit]] for scaling companies.

### 8. Organizational Design
A CEO's focus on their "zone of genius" (e.g., product, design, technology, marketing) is critical for speeding up the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>. Rahul Vora reduced his direct reports from 8-9 to 2 by hiring a president, increasing his time on core product areas from 6-7% to 60-70% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>. This shift in org design was a key factor in improving product velocity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>.

### 9. Single Decisive Reason (SDR) for Decision Making
The "Single Decisive Reason" is a thinking tool for making important decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:17">[01:19:17]</a>. It requires identifying one reason that, on its own, supports the decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>. This prevents reliance on a collection of weak reasons, which can be misleading, especially in group settings where risk aversion and consensus-seeking are common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>. If the SDR cannot be isolated, it indicates that the true singular reason for the decision has not yet been identified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. This method helps prioritize decisions with strong, clear justifications.

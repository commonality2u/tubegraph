Early in a company's journey, especially for B2B businesses, prioritizing [[growth_strategies_for_startup_apps | affordable growth channels]] is crucial before investing heavily in paid advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The foundation of a strong online presence—a fast, functional website that search engines recognize—must be established first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:01">[00:27:01]</a>.

## Core Principles

For B2B companies, the primary focus should be on solving active problems for customers, rather than just selling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. [[Productled growth strategies | Growth tactics that do not work]] include simply telling people to check out a website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>. Instead, focus on where people are actively asking questions and genuinely provide value by answering them, then present your solution as a fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. This approach builds trust and can lead to more cost-effective customer acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

## Key Affordable Channels

Deel, a global payroll, HR, and compliance platform, utilized several low-cost channels to achieve rapid growth, going from $0 to $300 million in Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) in three years while remaining EBITDA positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.

### Community Engagement

Tapping into existing online communities is a highly effective, low-cost strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>:

*   **Identifying Communities**: Search for places where your target audience asks questions. Examples include Reddit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>, Quora <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>, Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>, and closed communities like Slack groups or Discord servers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>. Deel specifically used Reddit to track keywords related to international hiring and HR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.
*   **Adding Value**: It's crucial to add value to the community first, rather than just promoting your product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. This means genuinely answering questions and providing solutions, not just linking to your website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>. Deel's team members, including co-founders, directly engaged in these conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.
*   **Understanding Scale**: While effective, these channels have an "upper limit" on audience size. A small subreddit might yield 10 customers, not 5,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. Early on, community engagement might account for 15% of leads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>, but as other channels grow, its percentage might decrease, though the net number of people reached can still increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>.

### Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and Content Marketing

SEO is a powerful channel for B2B companies solving active problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:27">[00:26:27]</a>.

*   **User Intent is Key**: The biggest mistake is simply "shoving keywords" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>. Instead, focus on whether your content "ends the Google search" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>. Google prioritizes content that fully answers a user's question quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>.
*   **Content Strategy**:
    *   **Traffic Light System**: Deel's content team uses a "traffic light system" to prioritize keywords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a>:
        *   **Green Light**: High volume, high intent keywords where the user is looking for a solution and is likely to become a customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>.
        *   **Yellow Light**: Intent is 50/50, user might buy later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>.
        *   **Red Light**: User is not looking to buy (e.g., a university student researching for an article) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>.
    *   **Answering Specific Questions**: Content should directly address what people are searching for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:18">[00:20:18]</a>. For Deel, this includes complex compliance questions about hiring in different countries or tax implications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:36">[00:36:36]</a>.
    *   **Simplicity**: Ensure content is easy to understand, even for a "fifth-grade reading level" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>.
    *   **Continuous Updates**: For topics with changing regulations (like payroll and taxes), continuously fact-checking and updating old articles is as important as creating new ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:49">[00:24:49]</a>. Deel updates roughly five articles and publishes five new ones per week, across multiple languages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:02">[00:25:02]</a>.
*   **Operational Excellence**: SEO requires discipline and continuous effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:23">[00:23:23]</a>. Avoiding "cutting corners" ensures quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:47">[00:23:47]</a>.

### Strategic Partnerships

Partnering with organizations that are trusted resources for your target audience can be highly effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:18">[00:35:18]</a>. For Deel, partnering with Venture Capital (VC) firms was valuable because founders often ask their VCs for recommendations on platforms after receiving funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:35">[00:35:35]</a>. Simply sharing an audience is not enough; the partner needs to be seen as a trusted guide for solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:06">[00:36:06]</a>.

### Long-Tail Paid Channels

Once the basics are covered, expanding beyond major ad platforms (like Google and Facebook) into "long-tail" places can diversify lead flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:34">[00:29:34]</a>.

*   **Diversification**: These are platforms that individually may not contribute significant leads but add up to a substantial portion (e.g., 30% of overall lead flow for Deel) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:40">[00:29:40]</a>. Examples include:
    *   Review sites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:58">[00:29:58]</a>
    *   Smaller niche outlets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>
    *   Newsletter ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:02">[00:30:02]</a>
    *   Podcast ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:03">[00:30:03]</a>
*   **Effort**: These channels often require the same setup effort as larger platforms but are overlooked due to their individual smaller scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:34">[00:30:34]</a>.
*   **Messaging and Optimization**: For any paid advertising, constant creative refreshing (monthly updates) is needed to avoid "creative fatigue" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:39">[00:40:39]</a>. Messaging should also evolve with product updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>.
*   **Measuring Success**: Don't just track leads; analyze the full customer journey from lead to closed-won revenue, including the payback period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:12">[00:41:12]</a>. Deel uses a real-time dashboard to track conversion rates and revenue generated from different ad platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:46">[00:41:46]</a>.

## Prioritization and Foundation

When starting out, focus on building the "skeleton before you put on the makeup" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>:

1.  **Website Presence**: Ensure you have a website that is fast and recognized by search engines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.
2.  **Findability**: Can people find your website? If not, create content to improve discoverability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.
3.  **Clear Messaging**: Your company's one-liner should clearly state what you do and not be generic enough to apply to any business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:14">[00:28:14]</a>. Rapidly A/B test value propositions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:10">[00:29:10]</a>.
4.  **Product Quality**: No [[growth_hacking_and_sustainable_growth_strategies | growth strategy]] will work without a strong, valuable product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:32">[00:42:32]</a>. For B2B, customers will not tolerate subpar products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:23">[00:43:23]</a>. Early-stage companies should prioritize product and engineering talent to ensure a solid core <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:52">[00:43:52]</a>.

## Awareness Campaigns

Early awareness campaigns are often a "waste of time" for B2B businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:38">[00:33:38]</a>. They are time-consuming, expensive, and don't always resonate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:50">[00:32:50]</a>. Instead, focus on converting those already ready to buy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:15">[00:33:15]</a>. Awareness campaigns like Notion's out-of-home ads only make sense much later, once the audience is already familiar with the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:02">[00:34:02]</a>.

## Impact of COVID-19

While Deel launched before the pandemic, COVID-19 accelerated their growth by forcing companies to adopt remote work, validating Deel's vision of a global work platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:46">[00:44:46]</a>. This led to increased demand for solutions to hire internationally, which Deel could provide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>.

## Building a Growth Team

*   **Commitment to Revenue**: Hire individuals who are willing to commit to "closed-won revenue" KPIs, not just lead numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:40">[00:47:40]</a>.
*   **"Little Hands" Mentality**: Employees should be willing to do the "nitty-gritty work" and not shy away from the smallest tasks, regardless of seniority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:46">[00:48:46]</a>.
*   **Early Hires**: Deel's initial growth team hires included a product marketing person to set messaging, a talented copywriter for creative efforts, and a data analyst to ensure all spending was measurable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:45">[00:51:45]</a>.
*   **Team Structure**: Deel employs a hybrid structure of:
    *   **Functional Teams**: Subject matter experts (e.g., product marketing, content, paid ads, brand) who can sit anywhere in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:54">[00:52:54]</a>. This allows for concentrated expertise and faster skill development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:50">[00:53:50]</a>.
    *   **Regional Teams**: Marketing managers focused on specific regions who collaborate with functional teams to execute strategy based on local opportunities and competitive landscapes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:17">[00:53:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:33">[00:54:33]</a>.

## Culture of Growth

Deel's culture emphasizes:

*   **Deel Speed**: Acting with urgency to solve customer problems and build products, significantly faster than competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:28">[00:55:28]</a>.
*   **Default Optimism**: Approaching challenges with a positive mindset, focusing on how solutions can work rather than why they won't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:09">[00:56:09]</a>.
*   **Customer Care**: Recognizing the profound impact of their product on people's livelihoods (paychecks, legal compliance), fostering a deep sense of responsibility and care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:37">[00:56:37]</a>.

These values, which emerged organically before being formalized, empower employees with flexibility and freedom in their work, while expecting intense commitment in return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:17">[00:57:17]</a>.

Ultimately, [[developing_growth_models | growth strategies in tech companies]] are "relatively straightforward" when focusing on basic principles: find your audience, add value, and ensure your product delivers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:39">[01:05:39]</a>. It requires discipline more than rocket science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:57">[01:05:57]</a>.

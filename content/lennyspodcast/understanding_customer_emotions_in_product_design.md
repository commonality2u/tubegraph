Nonan Yu, Head of Product at Linear, emphasizes the critical role of understanding customer emotions in designing beloved products, especially in the B2B SaaS space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. Linear, a product known for its design and speed, focuses on creating tools that make users "hate their day-to-day a little bit" less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.

## Focusing on the User's Emotional Experience

A core philosophy at Linear is to prioritize the Individual Contributor (IC) and their daily experience over the reporting needs of middle managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>. This deliberate choice aims to avoid "bloatedness" in the software that makes ICs "hate their lives" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>. The belief is that if the IC user experience is poor, they will disengage, making reporting data unreliable anyway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>.

## The Goal: "Feel Bad in the Same Way That Customers Feel Bad"

Nonan's approach to [[talking_to_customers_for_product_development | talking to customers]] involves deep [[importance_of_user_feedback_in_product_development | digging and digging]] until he uncovers the underlying emotion driving a feature request <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:31">[00:30:31]</a>. His explicit goal is to "feel bad in the same way that customers feel bad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:10">[00:31:10]</a>. This means moving beyond simple analytical questions about goals or jobs to be done, and instead seeking the "emotional valence that is motivating whatever you're telling me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:50">[00:31:50]</a>.

By having a long enough and deep enough conversation, product managers can level with customers, encouraging them to open up about moments when they felt truly frustrated or "bad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a>.

### Practical Application: Identifying "Schlep Blindness"

This approach helps uncover what Paul Graham calls "schlep blindness"â€”problems users are so accustomed to that they no longer consciously recognize them as pain points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:53">[00:35:53]</a>. By understanding these emotional rhythms of a user's day, product teams can pinpoint opportunities for significant product improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:07">[00:36:07]</a>.

**Examples of Emotional Problem Solving:**

*   **Flexible Deadlines:** Users felt "bad" when forced to commit to overly precise ship dates that led to miscommunication with marketing teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:31">[00:32:31]</a>. Linear's solution was to allow users to specify target dates at any level of granularity (e.g., "Q4 project" instead of "December 30th") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:36">[00:33:36]</a>. This removes the pressure of "false precision" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:58">[00:33:58]</a>.
*   **Customer Requests Feature:** Instead of adding generic custom fields requested by managers (which often burden ICs), Linear identified that a significant portion of these requests stemmed from a desire to track feedback from specific key customers like "Walmart" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>. The solution was to integrate with customer support and CRM tools to automatically tag issues with customer information, reducing manual work for ICs while providing managers with the reporting they needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:10">[00:30:10]</a>. This allows ICs to feel more confident, knowing who is asking for a feature and the exact context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:54">[00:29:54]</a>.
*   **Triage Management:** This feature emerged from users feeling "underwater" with manual issue routing or completely "out of control" due to tickets being "thrown over the wall" with no visibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:04">[00:37:04]</a>. Linear automated the triage process, notifying the right people on a rotation, systematizing a previously chaotic workflow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:32">[00:36:32]</a>.

### The Role of Empathy and User Feedback

The [[the_impact_of_empathy_in_product_management | impact of empathy]] and [[the_role_of_empathy_and_user_feedback_in_product_management | user feedback]] are critical. Rather than building a "beautiful solution that doesn't match with reality," the focus is on solving core problems that truly impact users' work and feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:53">[00:25:53]</a>.

## Expanding the Possibility Space with Extreme Thinking

To foster [[creative_approaches_to_building_beloved_b2b_products | creative approaches to building beloved B2B products]], Linear uses a system for being creative and coming up with non-obvious solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:09">[00:44:09]</a>. This involves asking: "How extreme can you take it?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:31">[00:45:31]</a>. This process, similar to Brian Chesky's "11-star experience" at Airbnb, involves temporarily disregarding constraints like cost or practicality to explore the full "possibility space" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:01">[00:46:01]</a>. The goal is to break past psychological defaults and uncover choices that might otherwise be missed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:26">[00:46:26]</a>.

### Iterating with Extremes: The Draft Saving Feature

For the draft saving feature, Linear explored two extremes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:01">[00:49:01]</a>:
1.  **Fastest possible:** No pop-ups, immediate discard on close <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:08">[00:49:08]</a>. This felt "super unsafe" to users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:39">[00:49:39]</a>.
2.  **Safest possible:** Autosave everything immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:50">[00:49:50]</a>. While safe, it led to a "paper trail of things you change your mind about," like many "Untitled documents" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:07">[00:50:07]</a>.

By testing both extremes, the team understood the nuances of user feeling and arrived at a balanced solution: interrupt the user to save a draft for *new* issues, but autosave existing drafts as modifications in place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:39">[00:50:39]</a>. This iterative process, driven by testing extreme versions and learning from their effects, leads to solutions that feel obvious in hindsight but were not at the outset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:51">[00:53:51]</a>.

## Beyond Solving Problems: Teaching a Way of Working

Linear believes that B2B software not only solves problems but also "teaches them how to work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:29">[00:54:29]</a>. When a company adopts a tool, they are also adopting the underlying practices and competencies embedded within it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:06">[00:55:06]</a>. This means Linear has an [[the_role_of_intuition_and_taste_in_product_development | opinionated way]] of how product teams "should operate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:10">[00:57:10]</a>, derived from observing "high performing teams" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:43">[00:57:43]</a>. The goal is to automate these best practices, providing a "button" for teams to adopt a more efficient way of working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:51">[00:57:51]</a>.

## Collaborative Go-to-Market Approach

Product management at Linear is viewed as a "go-to-market discipline" alongside sales and marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:52">[00:58:52]</a>. Product managers are deeply involved in crafting the messaging and language for new releases, ensuring it resonates authentically with expert practitioners (like engineers and product managers themselves) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:57">[00:59:57]</a>. This "double triangle" collaboration involves product, engineering, and design on one side, and sales, marketing, and product management on the other, with the product manager bridging the "building side" and the "selling side" of the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:06">[01:01:06]</a>. This deep involvement in the go-to-market strategy ensures that what is built truly aligns with commercial goals and resonates with the customer's native language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:36">[01:03:36]</a>. This perspective highlights the [[effective_communication_with_customers | importance of effective communication with customers]].

## Speed and Quality: Not a Trade-off

Linear operates on the principle that there is no trade-off between speed and quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. Instead of rushing, the focus is on being "really competent" and making rapid iterations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. The aim is to have a "workable solution" that tests a key hypothesis after only 10% of the allotted time has passed, allowing for early validation and adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. This helps avoid wasted time building features nobody wants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>.

This approach aligns with the importance of [[integrating_user_research_effectively_into_product_development | integrating user research effectively into product development]] and continuous feedback from users.

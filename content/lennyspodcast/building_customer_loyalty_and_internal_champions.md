Figma's success is largely attributed to its unique bottom-up go-to-market motion, which centers on fostering deep customer loyalty and empowering individual users to become internal champions. This strategy enabled Figma to grow significantly without a traditional sales team for its first three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:33">[01:33:33]</a>.

## The Bottom-Up Go-to-Market Motion

This strategy involves two key steps:
1.  Getting Individual Contributors (ICs) within a company to love the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:01">[01:34:01]</a>.
2.  Enabling these loved users to spread the product throughout their organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:06">[01:36:06]</a>.

This approach contrasts with a "tops-down" SaaS model, where sales target VPs or executive buyers who then push a tool down to their organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:07">[01:05:07]</a>. For technical tools, it's crucial that practitioners love the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:18">[01:15:18]</a>.

### Getting ICs to Love the Product

Building initial loyalty for a new, unknown product involves several key areas:

#### 1. Build Credibility
Especially with a technical audience like designers, traditional marketing language and buzzwords are ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:31">[01:32:31]</a>. Figma focused on:
*   **Technical Content:** Engineers created content explaining how the tool worked and its technical feats, such as using WebGL for a design tool on the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:36">[01:36:36]</a>. This content often reached top spots on platforms like Hacker News <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:40">[01:38:40]</a>.
*   **Design-Focused Content:** The internal design team discussed how they chose to build features and the craft decisions that went into the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:43">[01:34:43]</a>. For instance, detailed explanations of features like Vector Networks or grids, even referencing figures like Joseph Mueller Brockman, resonated with designers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:57">[01:33:57]</a>. Content was intentionally technical and deep, a "bar" being if a marketer could write it, it wasn't good enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:17">[01:36:17]</a>.
*   **Designer Advocates:** The first marketing hire at Figma was a designer advocate, not a marketer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:55">[01:35:55]</a>. This role was crucial for building authenticity by meeting with users, talking to them, writing content, and bringing feedback back to the product team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:22">[01:35:22]</a>. This function, considered "magic dust," has scaled with Figma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:34">[01:35:34]</a>.

#### 2. Build the Product With Your Users
Figma demonstrated a strong commitment to [[product_development_and_customer_fanaticism | customer obsession]] from its earliest days:
*   **Fixing Immediate Blockers:** When Koda, Figma's first user, couldn't open a file due to a MacBook issue, Dylan (Figma's CEO) drove an engineer to Palo Alto to fix it immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>. This willingness to do "things that don't scale" was critical for retaining early users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:02">[00:41:02]</a>.
*   **Direct Engagement:** In the early days, everyone, including engineers and founders, responded to user chats on Intercom, debugging products live and implementing immediate fixes for bugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:29">[00:39:29]</a>. This direct feedback loop fostered user ownership, making them feel invested in Figma's journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:51">[00:40:51]</a>.
*   **Prioritizing Signal over Metrics:** In early-stage startups, raw metrics are often too small to be meaningful. Instead, focusing on *signal* – observing if a few people truly love the product – is more important than optimizing for slight conversion improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:56">[00:23:56]</a>. This aligns with a "step one: get one company to use your product" mentality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:36">[00:24:36]</a>.
*   **"Little Big Updates":** At scale, Figma dedicates "quality weeks" where engineers fix small, annoying issues reported by users on Twitter or through support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:51">[00:52:51]</a>. These "Little Big Updates" are bundled and launched annually, improving quality of life for users and becoming one of Figma's most popular launches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:11">[00:53:11]</a>.

#### 3. Find Channels to Connect One-to-Many
To reach users who might not immediately adopt the product, Figma focused on meeting them where they already were:
*   **Twitter:** Dylan identified Twitter as the primary home for the design community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:18">[00:45:18]</a>. Figma leveraged this existing network by engaging with influencers and pushing out technical content, fostering a highly engaged community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:15">[00:47:15]</a>.
*   **Dylan's Scraper Tool:** Dylan built a tool to identify and map design community influencers on Twitter, revealing clusters of different design topics and their influential figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:05">[00:46:05]</a>. This allowed Figma to directly DM influential designers for feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:58">[00:46:58]</a>.
*   **Personalized Engagement:** Beyond the brand handle, founders (Dylan, Sho) and engineers actively engaged with users on Twitter, answering questions and building personal connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:31">[00:47:31]</a>. This allowed users to passively follow Figma's progress and build confidence over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:05">[00:48:05]</a>.

#### 4. Be Transparent and Authentic
[[building_trust_and_driving_impact_in_product_management | Transparency]] is a core, though uncodified, value at Figma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:19">[00:57:19]</a>.
*   **Public Postmortems:** When experiencing downtime, Figma publishes public postmortems, taking full accountability, explaining technical reasons, and detailing how issues were fixed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:18">[00:55:18]</a>.
*   **Direct Communication in Hard Times:** During major events, such as the acquisition announcement, Figma chose to directly address users in open forums like a Twitter Space with Dylan and other leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:22">[00:56:22]</a>. This decision to be human, authentic, and not hide behind the brand helped turn the tide of public sentiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:41">[00:56:41]</a>.

### Helping Users Spread the Product Within the Organization

Once ICs love the product, the next step is to facilitate its spread:

#### 1. Make it Easy to Try and Share
*   **Generous Free Tier:** Figma offers a free account and a free "starter team" that allows unlimited collaborators but limits the number of files <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:45">[01:02:45]</a>. This encourages team use and collaboration without immediate payment, fostering confidence before organizations commit to paid tiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:02">[01:03:02]</a>.
*   **Unlimited Viewers:** Figma charges only for *editors*, allowing unlimited *viewers* to comment for free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:56">[01:05:56]</a>. This greatly expands the tool's reach within an organization, making it useful to a wider range of roles like product managers who need to provide feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:17">[01:06:17]</a>.

#### 2. Empower Designer Advocates in the Sales Process
*   **The "Tom Factor":** When Figma hired its first salesperson, it also brought in a designer advocate, Tom Lowry, who had championed Figma adoption at his previous company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:56">[01:07:56]</a>. Tom, a technical expert without a quota, would join sales calls to explain the product, understand user problems, and share best practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:51">[01:08:51]</a>. This "Tom Factor" significantly increased deal closure rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:51">[01:09:51]</a>.
*   **Scaling Advocates:** This role has scaled within Figma, with teams of Developer Advocates and FigJam Advocates, including regional advocates (e.g., Japan Designer Advocate) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:11">[01:51:11]</a>. These advocates are passionate users who emerge from the community, providing invaluable technical expertise and acting as a bridge between users, product, and sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:50">[01:51:50]</a>.

#### 3. Leverage Operational Adoption Drivers
*   **Design Systems:** Initially a blocker, Design Systems became a key driver for Figma adoption, particularly for upgrades from Pro to Organization/Enterprise tiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:51">[01:12:51]</a>. Design Systems allow organizations to create libraries of reusable UI components (e.g., buttons, headers) that maintain consistency and efficiency across hundreds of designers and engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:15">[01:11:15]</a>.
*   **Community and Content Focus:** Figma engaged the Design Systems community through informal meetups and then built features and content around this area, including the "designsystems.com" property and the "Schema" conference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:10">[01:13:10]</a>. This transformation of a blocker into an advantage is a core lesson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:52">[01:14:52]</a>.

#### 4. Cultivate and Empower Internal Champions
*   **Ongoing Relationship Nurturing:** Champions don't go away; their relationship with Figma must be continually maintained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:22">[01:16:22]</a>. This includes addressing their concerns (e.g., a tweet from an upset champion prompting immediate action) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:34">[01:16:34]</a>.
*   **Career Growth and Amplification:** Figma actively helps champions grow their careers by offering opportunities to speak at events (like Config or Schema), amplifying their profiles on social media, and establishing them as thought leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:15">[01:17:15]</a>. This creates a self-reinforcing flywheel where passionate users become advocates, sharing their expertise and further [[building_brand_and_maintaining_product_quality | building Figma's credibility]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:41">[01:17:41]</a>.

## Prerequisites for This Approach

This [[creative_approaches_to_building_beloved_b2b_products | creative approach to building beloved B2B products]] is most effective when:

*   **Technical, Craft-Focused Audience:** The target audience is technical and deeply cares about their tools and craft, finding significant value in using the tool on their own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:52">[01:19:52]</a>. This provides a rich topic for conversation beyond just "collaboration" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:10">[01:20:10]</a>.
*   **Existing Community:** An existing community for the target audience is already in place (e.g., the design community on Twitter) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:57">[01:20:57]</a>. This provides a distribution channel, making it easier to gain initial traction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:11">[01:21:11]</a>.
*   **Collaborative ICs:** The core IC audience has many connection points within their organization, making it natural for them to collaborate and spread the tool (e.g., designers working with PMs, engineers, etc.) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:22">[01:21:22]</a>.
*   **Leadership Buy-in:** An executive or [[role_of_product_leaders | leader]] deeply believes in this model and is willing to champion it, even when metrics aren't immediately clear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:58">[01:22:58]</a>. This requires trusting intuition and focusing on qualitative signal over raw metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:41">[01:23:41]</a>.

While Figma faced challenges, such as designers initially resisting collaborative workflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>, its commitment to these principles ultimately led to significant success. Maintaining this approach at scale requires continued advocacy within the company to protect these core growth drivers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:03">[01:18:03]</a>.

The Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD) framework is a powerful approach for [[understanding_and_identifying_user_needs | understanding and identifying user needs]] by focusing on the progress customers are trying to make. Co-created by Bob Moesta and Clay Christensen, JTBD shifts the focus from product features to the underlying reasons why people "hire" products or services in their lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Core Premise of Jobs-to-be-Done

The fundamental premise of JTBD is that people **hire products** to make progress in their lives, rather than simply buying them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. This perspective highlights that demand for a product arises from a "struggling moment," not from the creation of the product itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. By understanding these struggling moments, companies can unlock hidden insights and create successful products and services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

For example, a Snickers bar is often "hired" when someone has missed a meal, needs energy, and wants to return to their tasks quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. Its competitors aren't just other candy bars, but also protein drinks, Red Bull, or coffee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. In contrast, a Milky Way is often "hired" after an emotional experience, consumed alone for regrouping, competing with things like a glass of wine or a run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. This illustrates how JTBD helps uncover the true competitive set from the "demand side" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

## Misconceptions of JTBD

A common misconception about JTBD is that it's solely about "pain and gain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. While pain is a factor, the more critical elements are **context and outcome** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. The context surrounding a problem makes an seemingly irrational decision rational <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Without understanding the full context, a story might seem like an anomaly, but it's typically because the "rest of the story" is missing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:18">[00:55:18]</a>.

Another mistake is to only focus on the desired outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:47">[00:54:47]</a>. Value is not just the outcome but also the starting point of the customer's journey. A significant improvement from a struggling state holds more value than a marginal improvement from an already good state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>.

## The Four Forces Model for Understanding Customer Behavior

The [[understanding_and_identifying_user_needs | Jobs-to-be-Done framework]] identifies four forces that influence whether a customer will switch from an old product (or solution) to a new one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>:

1.  **Push (F1):** The current situation's frustration or "struggling moment" that pushes a customer away from their existing solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. This push is independent of the new product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.
2.  **Pull (F2):** The attractiveness of the new product or a desired new outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.
3.  **Anxiety (F3):** Worries or fears associated with adopting the new product or making a change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>. More features can actually increase anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.
4.  **Habit of the Present (F4):** The inertia and comfort of sticking with the current solution, even if it's not perfect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.

For a customer to change, the combined strength of the **Push (F1)** and **Pull (F2)** must be greater than the **Anxiety (F3)** and **Habit of the Present (F4)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. Reducing friction (F3 and F4) can be as effective as adding new features (F2) in driving adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.

> For example, in house building, a major friction point for downsizers was moving all their old belongings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>. By including moving services and two years of storage in the condo price, even increasing the overall cost, sales increased over 30% because the friction was removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.

## The Customer's Buying Journey: Six Phases

Instead of solely focusing on how a company wants to sell, the sales process should be designed around how customers want to buy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>. The buying process isn't a single event but a journey with distinct phases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>, often including:

1.  **First Thought:** Initial awareness of a problem or need.
2.  **Passive Looking:** Problem-aware but solution-unaware, where customers learn about possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>.
3.  **Active Looking:** Both problem and solution aware, actively trying to frame a solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>.
4.  **Deciding:** Making trade-offs between different alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>.
5.  **First Use:** The initial adoption and experience with the new product.
6.  **Ongoing Use:** How the new habit is built and sustained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>.

Companies like Autobooks have leveraged this by breaking down their sales demos to match the customer's phase in the buying process, leading to significantly higher conversion rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>.

## [[customer_interviewing_techniques | Interviewing Techniques]] for [[understanding_and_identifying_user_needs | Identifying Customer Needs]]

[[customer_interviewing_techniques | Interviewing]] for JTBD is less about traditional market research and more akin to criminal and intelligence interrogation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>. The goal is to understand the causation behind why people make progress, not just what they say they want <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>.

### Key Principles

*   **Focus on the "Why":** The core question is always, "What caused them to do this?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:46">[00:30:46]</a>.
*   **Study Past Behavior:** Never trust what people say they *will* do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:46">[00:36:46]</a>. Instead, interview people who have *recently purchased* your product (or a competitor's) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:29">[00:19:29]</a>. For new products, study behaviors on existing platforms that achieve a similar outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:36">[00:28:36]</a>.
*   **Causation over Correlation/Probability:** JTBD aims to understand the specific chain of events that leads to a decision, rather than relying on statistical probabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>.
*   **Small, Targeted Samples:** For uncovering causal mechanisms, 7-8 interviews can reveal repeating patterns; rarely more than 10-12 are needed per round <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:10">[00:29:10]</a>.
*   **Energy Sources:** Look for functional (time, effort), emotional (frustration, desire for respect), and social (how others perceive me) components that drive the struggle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:30">[00:34:30]</a>.

### Practical Tips

*   **Read "Never Split the Difference":** This book by Chris Voss offers valuable [[behavioral_interview_techniques | behavioral interview techniques]] like mirroring to encourage interviewees to elaborate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:39">[00:27:39]</a>.
*   **No Discussion Guide:** Avoid a rigid list of [[interview_questions_for_candidates | interview questions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:24">[00:30:24]</a>. Instead, use the "four forces" (pushes, pulls, anxieties, habits) as a framework to guide a free-flowing conversation and follow intriguing tangents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:42">[00:30:42]</a>.
*   **"Tell Me More" / "Give Me an Example":** These open-ended prompts help delve deeper than simple "why" questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>.
*   **Mirroring/Playing Back Incorrectly:** Intentionally misstating something the interviewee said can prompt them to correct you and provide more detailed explanations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:54">[00:27:54]</a>.
*   **Bracketing at the "Edge of Language":** When an interviewee struggles to articulate, offer two extreme choices, knowing neither is fully correct. This forces them to elaborate on the nuanced truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:10">[00:31:10]</a>.

### What to Listen For

*   **The Story of Change:** Understand "what in the world happened that says today's the day I need new windows?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>.
*   **Higher and Fire Criteria:** What criteria did they use to "hire" the new product and "fire" the old one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:03">[00:20:03]</a>.
*   **Trade-offs:** People make different trade-offs than what they initially state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26">[00:17:26]</a>. For example, home buyers often say they want an energy-efficient house but end up buying a finished basement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>.
*   **Layers of Language:**
    *   **Platitude Layer:** Superficial, generic responses ("It was good") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:25">[00:38:25]</a>.
    *   **Fantasy/Nightmare Layer:** Exaggerated, emotional responses ("It was so good because of this") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:36">[00:38:36]</a>.
    *   **Actual Events Layer:** The detailed, factual account of what truly happened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:44">[00:38:44]</a>. The goal is to peel back the layers to get to the actual events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:44">[00:38:44]</a>.

### What to Avoid

*   **Asking What They *Will* Do:** People are bad at predicting their future behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:46">[00:36:46]</a>. Focus on what they *have* done.
*   **"Bitching Ain't Switching":** Just because someone complains doesn't mean they're ready to switch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:04">[00:37:04]</a>. Look for actual attempts at progress.
*   **Hypothesizing Jobs in a Conference Room:** Without direct customer interviews, assuming what the jobs are will almost certainly be wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:32">[00:45:32]</a>.

## When JTBD is Not the Right Fit

The JTBD framework is most effective when there's a genuine choice for the customer to make, or where they actively seek progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:12">[00:51:12]</a>. It's less applicable when:

*   **No Real Choice:** If customers have limited or no choice in a product or service (e.g., employer-provided health insurance), their "job" might be to navigate the given options rather than actively "hiring" a new one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:27">[00:51:27]</a>.
*   **Deeply Ingrained Habits:** For products like chewing gum, which are purchased out of deep habit and don't register as a conscious decision, customers often can't recall the specific context of purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:51">[00:52:51]</a>. The job only becomes visible when a change occurs, like switching brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:22">[00:53:22]</a>.

## Common Misinterpretations of JTBD

Many misinterpretations of JTBD arise when people try to apply the framework without genuinely engaging with customers or understanding the underlying principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:52">[00:54:52]</a>:

*   **Focus on Supply Side:** Some approaches focus on what "our product can do" or what "jobs our product can perform," which is a supply-side view. The true JTBD approach centers on the customer and their jobs, not the product's functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:38">[00:49:38]</a>.
*   **Theorizing vs. Learning:** A common pitfall is to hypothesize what the jobs are in a conference room rather than doing the qualitative research to discover them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:32">[00:45:32]</a>. Real insight comes from investigating and revealing causal mechanisms, not from proving pre-existing hypotheses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:43">[00:41:43]</a>.

## The "Dining Room Table" Story: A Case Study in Hidden Needs

Bob Moesta's experience building houses for downsizers illustrates a crucial JTBD insight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:03">[01:03:03]</a>. Customers explicitly stated they didn't want a dining room table in their new, smaller homes, claiming they wouldn't host holidays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:37">[01:03:37]</a>. However, sales were impacted because people wouldn't move if they didn't know where their existing dining room table would go <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:59">[01:03:59]</a>.

The dining room table was an "emotional bank account" representing memories and family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:06">[01:04:06]</a>. Recognizing this "irrational contradiction," Bob designed a space for the dining room table that was too small for actual dining but served as a symbolic place for it. This small architectural change, made against the customers' stated preference, increased sales by 22% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:26">[01:04:26]</a>. This highlights the importance of uncovering the *actual* reasons behind behavior, even when they contradict stated preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:51">[01:04:51]</a>.

Kaj Sari, co-founder and CEO of Linear, shares insights into how his company builds products, cultivates its team, and scales its growth engine, with a deep emphasis on design and strategic focus to achieve [[product_market_fit_and_growth_strategy | product-market fit]].

## The Importance of Design and Craft

Kaj believes that in any domain or industry, the more it matters, the more design matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While the first iterations of new paradigms (like mobile or web) didn't require "super well-designed" products, the bar is now incredibly high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Today, "pretty high level design" is a basic requirement from the very beginning for products to even gain attention or be considered seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

Linear's success is largely attributed to its focus on craft and quality, differentiating it from competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. They prioritize taste and opinions over A/B tests and metric-based goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. This commitment to quality is crucial for business success, as collaboration thrives when the product is frictionless and well-designed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

### Operationalizing Quality

While quality can sometimes extend timelines by a few days, it rarely requires complete re-dos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. Linear operates with a philosophy of pushing out early versions to internal teams or small groups of opt-in customers, even if they are "janky or not that polished" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. This allows them to gather early feedback and make improvements during the building phase, as they believe that "when you start building the thing you actually start realizing more like how it could how it should work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. The focus on polish and craft intensifies for the full general release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.

Contrary to external perception, Linear's process isn't about perfecting everything upfront; it's a balance of pushing things out quickly and then rapidly improving them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

### Design as a Differentiator

Design can be a significant differentiator, especially in crowded markets where users have many choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:11">[00:29:11]</a>. People often select products that "looks the best or that looks the most like quality product to me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:51">[00:29:51]</a>. Design acts as leverage, particularly early on, by setting expectations for users through aspects like landing pages and overall brand presentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:43">[00:28:43]</a>.

### Building a Brand

For Linear, building a brand is about authenticity and consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>. A brand isn't just a logo or colors; it's built over time through "the things you do, the things you say, how you say them, and how you approach things, how you treat customers, how you build the website or the product" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:44">[00:31:44]</a>.

## The Linear Method: A Unique Approach to Product Development

Linear operates with unique principles that contribute to its distinctive culture and product quality:

*   **Minimal Product Managers:** Linear has only one Product Manager (Head of Product), Nonu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. Nonu's role is primarily to figure out the overall product direction and help teams align, rather than making every decision or writing every spec <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>.
*   **Empowered Engineers and Designers:** Without many PMs, responsibilities typically held by PMs, such as scope, communication, and decision-making, are distributed among engineers and designers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>. Project leads can be engineers or designers, taking ownership of getting projects started and working with the team to figure things out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>. This fosters a sense of ownership and allows them to identify and implement quality improvements, like Andreas's work on the dynamic right-click menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>. This model requires hiring individuals with "product sensibility" and a broader scope beyond their specific skill set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:56">[00:58:56]</a>.
*   **Opinionated Software:** Linear aims to provide "good defaults or good opinions" on how features and workflows should operate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:31">[00:40:31]</a>. This approach frees users and teams from spending excessive time "figuring things out" and allows them to focus on their actual work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:38">[00:40:38]</a>. The philosophy is to design something for someone, rather than everything for everyone, leading to optimized solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:47">[00:40:47]</a>.
*   **Cycles (vs. Sprints):** Linear utilizes "Cycles" as a way for teams to focus on a defined set of priorities for a specific time frame (e.g., one or two weeks) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:12">[00:42:12]</a>. This helps teams concentrate on "these few things and forget about the infinite list of other things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:17">[00:43:17]</a>. Cycles run on an automated schedule and are optional for teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:03">[00:43:03]</a>.
*   **No Metric-Based Goals for Features:** While company-level goals (like weekly active users) exist, Linear does not set specific number goals for individual features or launches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:41">[00:43:41]</a>. They believe that their product, a system with multiple parts used by diverse companies, shouldn't be optimized by specific metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:02">[00:44:02]</a>. Instead, the goal is to solve problems, and success is measured by customer agreement that the problem is solved and their enjoyment of the solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:56">[00:44:56]</a>.

## Focus and Avoiding Side Quests

Kaj emphasizes staying focused, using the analogy of "main quest lines" and "side quest lines" from RPG games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:42">[00:55:42]</a>. The core advice is to constantly ask: "is this important to do now or is it important to maybe do later?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:49">[00:54:49]</a> and "does it help the customers, does it help the product?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:01">[00:56:01]</a>. This approach helps avoid distractions and ensures resources are directed towards the most critical tasks.

## Building [[product_market_fit_strategies | Product Market Fit]]

Linear's journey to [[the_importance_and_stages_of_productmarket_fit | product-market fit]] was iterative and segment-specific:

1.  **Early Incubation and Private Beta:** Linear officially started in April 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:31">[01:09:31]</a>. They had a small website with a waitlist and used the product internally by May 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:44">[01:09:44]</a>. They started inviting friends and then people from the waitlist in June 2019, reaching 100-200 users and about 10 companies by June/July <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:54">[01:09:54]</a>.
2.  **Selective Onboarding and Cohort Feedback:** For almost a year, Linear remained in private beta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:07">[01:10:07]</a>. They used a waitlist survey to identify companies using tools they supported and who were genuinely interested in Linear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:17">[01:10:17]</a>. Initially, Kaj manually read surveys and emailed invites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:43">[01:12:43]</a>. They invited small cohorts (e.g., 10 people a week) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:06">[01:13:06]</a>. This "cohort" approach ensured that when one group hit a problem, they could fix it before inviting the next group, making initial development more effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:37">[01:13:37]</a>.
3.  **Experimental Pricing:** During the private beta, Linear added an optional payment feature, allowing users to choose how much they wanted to pay per seat on a sliding scale (e.g., $1 to $20) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>. This experiment provided confidence that there was a market willing to pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:09">[01:16:09]</a>.
4.  **Public Launch and [[finding_productmarket_fit_in_startups | Product Market Fit]] for Segments:** Linear launched publicly in June 2020 with pricing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:42">[01:10:42]</a>. Almost all existing beta companies subscribed to the paid plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:57">[01:10:57]</a>.
    *   **Segment-Specific Fit:** Kaj views [[the_importance_and_stages_of_productmarket_fit | product-market fit]] not as a binary state, but as a "spectrum" tied to specific market segments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:07">[01:19:07]</a>.
    *   **Focus on Early Adopters:** For the first two years, they focused on achieving strong [[product_market_fit_strategies | product-market fit]] within the early-stage startup segment, aiming to become the "default tool" for startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:05">[01:18:05]</a>.
    *   **Expanding Segments:** Over the last two years, they've been working to strengthen [[identifying_and_addressing_signs_of_being_stuck_in_productmarket_fit | product-market fit]] in larger company segments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:41">[01:18:41]</a>.
    *   **Following the "Pull":** They pay attention to which types of companies are naturally drawn to Linear (e.g., crypto companies, now AI companies) and consider focusing on gaining more users within those categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:26">[01:21:26]</a>.

## Unique Hiring Practices

Linear maintains a high hiring bar and grows deliberately, never more than doubling their team size in a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:09">[00:58:09]</a>. They believe in building better with fewer, high-quality people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:47">[00:57:47]</a>.

*   **Beyond the Role:** They look for individuals with "taste" and a broader perspective beyond their direct role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:34">[00:58:34]</a>. For engineers, this means assessing "product sensibility" and the ability to articulate why certain choices are better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:15">[00:59:15]</a>. This ensures that people are willing to take on more scope than their title suggests, fostering a collaborative environment where "it's not my job" is rarely heard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:08">[01:00:08]</a>.
*   **Paid Work Trial:** Linear employs a paid work trial as the final step in their hiring process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:51">[01:02:51]</a>. Candidates act as mini-contractors, given a vague problem statement to understand, scope, build, and present their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. This allows both the company and candidate to assess working together, observe how the candidate operates in their environment, and gauge their ability to make progress quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:33">[01:03:33]</a>. It provides candidates a realistic glimpse into the company's culture and codebase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:36">[01:04:36]</a>.

## Lessons in Leadership

Kaj finds that being a CEO involves a wide range of tasks and constant learning across different domains like finance, legal, and operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:08">[01:29:08]</a>. He emphasizes that hiring and delegation are key to managing this diverse set of responsibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:52">[01:29:52]</a>.

His personal motto, "go slow to go fast," reflects his belief in taking time to think and plan before rushing into tasks, ultimately leading to faster and more effective execution by avoiding the need for fixes later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:04">[01:36:04]</a>. This philosophy extends to respecting people and things, treating tools and resources as valuable assets that should be cared for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:48">[01:36:48]</a>.

Shopify employs a distinctive approach to product development, particularly within its core product teams, where decisions are driven more by [[understanding_and_building_taste_in_design | taste]] and intuition rather than traditional metrics and KPIs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:26">[01:24:26]</a>. This unique philosophy is deeply intertwined with the company's hundred-year vision for commerce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:15">[01:15:15]</a>.

## Intuition Over Metrics for Core Product
For Shopify's core product teams, metrics and KPIs are "essentially banned" as drivers for what they build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:15">[01:22:15]</a>. Instead, the focus is on whether there is "conviction that this is the right technical Foundation to build the future of Commerce" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:49">[01:48:49]</a>. While data is utilized, it is not the overriding factor in decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:56">[01:48:56]</a>. Teams are not held accountable for specific metrics over a six-month period; rather, success is measured by whether they shipped the "right thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:12">[01:49:12]</a>. This assessment is made through a combination of data, qualitative insights, and an innate "product sense" or [[understanding_and_building_taste_in_design | taste]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:18">[01:49:18]</a>.

### Advantages and Disadvantages
The upside of this approach is the ability to ship features that are "for-facing" and to take more risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:31">[01:49:31]</a>. However, a potential downside is that conversations can become highly subjective, leading to "squishiness" in decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:42">[01:49:42]</a>. Ultimately, [[understanding_and_building_taste_in_design | taste]] largely governs what is shipped in core product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:03">[01:50:03]</a>.

### The Role of Leadership in Maintaining Taste
To ensure quality and coherence without strict metrics, Shopify relies on an "opinionated founder" and a select group of leaders who define "what good looks like" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:41">[00:59:41]</a>. Toby, the CEO, is deeply involved in defining the 100-year vision and ensuring that decisions align with the long-term success of merchants and Shopify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:20">[01:42:20]</a>. He emphasizes the importance of the technical "how" in building products, believing that technical architecture determines strategy more than the "what" or "who" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:10">[01:45:10]</a>. This means sometimes taking longer to ship a feature but making a crucial long-term investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:38">[01:45:38]</a>.

Glenn, the head of core product, plays a crucial role in maintaining a consistent bar for [[understanding_and_building_taste_in_design | taste]] and quality. He goes "incredibly deep into every single release that is shipped" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:51">[01:50:51]</a>. All R&D project leads, including Toby, Glenn, and Archie (VP Product & Head of Growth), review every project across the company every six weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:42">[01:44:42]</a>. Each shipped item requires a "-2 approval" from a group lead like Glenn, Carl, or Archie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:28">[01:52:28]</a>. This centralized oversight helps enforce the quality and [[understanding_and_building_taste_in_design | taste]] bar set by a small number of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:13">[01:51:13]</a>.

### Operationalizing Taste: The "No Wizard" Principle
An example of this philosophy in practice is Shopify's "no wizard" principle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:22">[01:57:22]</a>. While "wizards" (step-by-step onboarding carousels) can simplify product setup and lower the bar for users, they typically involve abstracting the actual product experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:19">[01:57:19]</a>. Shopify avoids these and instead aims to embed the simplification directly into the product experience itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:47">[01:57:47]</a>. For instance, instead of a wizard for online store setup, pre-filled sections are generated based on user information and integrated into the editor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:51">[01:57:51]</a>. This approach adheres to the core principle of maintaining a direct, high-quality product experience while still offering ease of use.

## The Broader Context
This "aim-heavy" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:46">[01:41:46]</a>, where intuition and a long-term vision guide core product decisions, is balanced by the Growth team's focus on short-term metrics and long-term GVM (Gross Merchandise Volume) impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:07">[01:37:07]</a>. The collaboration between these different operating styles, which are "intentionally meant to be almost at odds," is built on trust and a shared commitment to shipping high-quality products for merchants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:49">[01:54:49]</a>.

In summary, Shopify's reliance on intuition and [[understanding_and_building_taste_in_design | taste]] in core product development is enabled by a strong, opinionated founder and leadership team who consistently enforce a high standard for quality and align all decisions with a long-term vision, even when short-term metrics might suggest a different path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:09">[01:00:09]</a>.

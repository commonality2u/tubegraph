Growth, in the context of technology companies, has evolved from being seen as a collection of "hacks" to a more holistic approach focused on sustainable, long-term expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:56">[00:55:56]</a>. Sean Ellis, who coined the term "growth hacking," clarifies that his original intention was not to define it as a series of one-off tricks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:16">[01:16:16]</a>. Instead, it was about scrutinizing every action's impact on business [[growth strategies in tech companies | growth]] and focusing on acquiring customers efficiently to an experience that encourages continued product usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:16">[01:16:16]</a>.

## The Sean Ellis Test: A Foundation for Growth

A core component of understanding and achieving sustainable growth is determining if a product has [[growth strategies and achieving productmarket fit in startups | product-market fit (PMF)]]. Sean Ellis famously developed a test, often called the Sean Ellis Test or Product-Market Fit Test, to gauge this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

### What is the Sean Ellis Test?
The test asks a simple question: "How would you feel if you could no longer use this product?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a> Users are given choices:
*   Very disappointed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>
*   Somewhat disappointed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>
*   Not disappointed or not applicable (already stopped using) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>

The goal is to find those who would be "very disappointed," as this indicates a must-have product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

### The 40% Threshold
Historically, a high percentage of users saying they'd be "very disappointed" correlates with successful product performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. A common benchmark, derived from observing many startups, is 40% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. This 40% is considered a leading indicator of PMF; the lagging indicator is actual retention of users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. The 40% threshold serves as a target for teams to avoid prematurely aggressive growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>.

### Using the Test to Improve PMF
The real value of the Sean Ellis Test lies in understanding *who* would be "very disappointed" and *why* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.
*   **Focus on the "Very Disappointed"**: Ignore users who say they'd be "somewhat disappointed," as their feedback might dilute the product for your must-have users, making it "good for everyone but not great for anyone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:00">[00:42:00]</a>.
*   **Deep Dive into "Why"**: Ask "What is the primary benefit you get?" (open-ended first, then multiple choice) and "Why is that benefit important to you?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a> This helps understand the core problem being solved and the user's context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>.
*   **Case Study: Lookout**: Initially at 7% "very disappointed," Lookout discovered its core value was antivirus functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. By repositioning the product to focus on antivirus and streamlining onboarding to deliver that value immediately, the score rose to 40% in two weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.
*   **Case Study: Superhuman**: They leveraged the "somewhat disappointed" users by focusing on those who also valued the *core benefit* important to the "must-have" users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:25">[00:42:25]</a>. They then asked what these "on-the-fence" users needed to consider it a "must-have," staying true to the core while expanding appeal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:43">[00:42:43]</a>.
*   **Actionable Insights**: Use this qualitative data to:
    *   Refine the product roadmap by doubling down on features important to must-have customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>.
    *   Optimize onboarding for the right user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>.
    *   Set the right messaging expectations in acquisition campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>.
    *   Target people with the specific need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>.
    *   Reinforce the benefit through engagement loops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>.

### When to Use the Test
It's recommended to survey a random sample of users who have:
1.  Truly used the product (not just signed up) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>.
2.  Hit the activation moment or used it two or more times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:49">[00:22:49]</a>.
3.  Used it recently (e.g., within the last week or two), indicating they haven't churned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:58">[00:22:58]</a>.
The test is best used early, even with an MVP, to get useful feedback on resonance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.

### Limitations of the Test
*   **One-off products**: Not suitable for experiences like watching a movie or attending a workshop, where re-use isn't expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:13">[00:24:13]</a>.
*   **Investment/Switching Costs**: Scores can be artificially inflated if users have invested heavily in the product (e.g., building a website, setting up an event), making switching costs a significant factor in their disappointment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>.
*   **Sample Size**: While some insights can come from smaller groups, a minimum of 30 responses is suggested for reliable data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:17">[00:33:17]</a>.
*   **Not a Guarantee of Scale**: A high score doesn't guarantee a massive business if the "must-have" group is too small <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:51">[00:34:51]</a>. Focusing on a more passionate, niche customer base is often preferred, as deep relevance gives a better chance of long-term success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:01">[00:36:01]</a>.

## Sustainable Growth Strategies
Once a company has a strong PMF signal (e.g., 40% on the Sean Ellis Test), the focus shifts to [[growth strategies for startup apps | sustainable growth strategies]].

### A Phased Approach to Growth
Sean Ellis's approach prioritizes internal efficiency before scaling customer acquisition:
1.  **Understand the Value**: Deeply comprehend what makes the product a "must-have" for users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:47">[00:48:47]</a>.
2.  **Define a Northstar Metric**: Establish a metric that captures "units of value being delivered" to users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:50">[00:49:50]</a>.
    *   This metric should reflect how many people are experiencing the PMF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:07">[00:50:07]</a>.
    *   It should not be a ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:37">[01:20:37]</a>.
    *   It should ideally be "up and to the right" over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:40">[01:20:40]</a>.
    *   Revenue should be a *byproduct* of value delivery, not the Northstar metric itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:46">[01:20:46]</a>. Examples include "nights booked" for Airbnb or "weekly rides" for Uber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:47">[01:22:47]</a>.
    *   The chosen metric can significantly influence team incentives and product development, as seen when [[growth tactics at Facebook and Meta | Facebook]] shifted from monthly to daily active users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:04">[01:18:04]</a>.
3.  **Map the Value Delivery Engine**: Diagram the entire user journey, from onboarding to engagement, referral, and monetization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:34">[00:50:34]</a>.
4.  **Prioritize Optimization**: Focus on areas with the biggest opportunities for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:50">[00:50:50]</a>.
    *   **Activation First**: This is critical as users are at the highest risk of being lost during initial use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:05">[00:53:05]</a>. The goal is to "collapse that time to value" by getting users to the "aha moment" quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:31">[00:54:31]</a>.
        *   **LogMeIn Case Study**: By improving signup-to-usage rate from 5% to 50% in three months, previously unprofitable acquisition channels became highly scalable and profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:50">[00:55:50]</a>.
        *   **Key Tactics**:
            *   Increase desire (right positioning and messaging) and reduce friction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:36">[01:01:36]</a>.
            *   Ask users *why* they dropped off at specific points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:43">[00:58:43]</a>.
            *   Seek inspiration from successful products in similar categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:39">[01:00:39]</a>.
    *   **Engagement and Referral**: Once activation is optimized, focus on how to keep users coming back and encourage them to bring others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:35">[00:51:35]</a>.
        *   [[developing_growth_loops_and_flywheel_strategies | Growth loops]] are essential. For example, Dropbox's legendary referral program worked because the product already had strong word-of-mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. A referral program accelerates growth when it's already working, but it can't fix a lack of inherent talkability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:15">[01:15:15]</a>.
        *   [[productled_growth_strategies | Freemium]] models require the free product to be "so good that people naturally have Word of Mouth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:14">[01:16:14]</a>.
    *   **Monetization**: Optimize the revenue model to ensure the business is profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:39">[00:51:39]</a>.
    *   **Customer Acquisition**: Only once the internal "engine" is efficient at converting, retaining, and monetizing users should a company "obsess on the channel side" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:41">[00:51:41]</a>. It's difficult to find scalable, profitable acquisition channels without this foundational efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:19">[00:53:19]</a>.

### Evolution of Growth Strategies
Over the past decade, [[growth strategies in tech companies | growth strategies]] have become more complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>. Initially, being data-driven in customer acquisition was enough to win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:17">[01:14:17]</a>. Now, with most online marketers being data and test-driven, competitiveness requires being "super efficient at all parts of the business," including conversion, retention, and monetization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:51">[01:15:51]</a>. This requires significant cross-functional collaboration between marketing, product, sales, and customer success teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:18">[01:26:18]</a>.

### Tools and Key Principles
*   **ICE Prioritization Framework**: Sean Ellis developed ICE (Impact, Confidence, Effort) to systematically compare and prioritize ideas for experiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:19">[01:27:19]</a>. This helps teams decide which tests to run first and promotes better idea generation across the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:30">[01:28:30]</a>. He views "Reach" (from the RICE framework) as already factored into "Impact" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:51">[01:27:51]</a>.
*   **Qualitative Research**: Talking to customers is crucial. Ask them "How did you find this product?" and "How do you normally find products like this?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:36">[01:10:36]</a> This provides vital context that quantitative data alone cannot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. The blend of qualitative and quantitative research leads to much better experiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:13">[01:12:13]</a>.
*   **Asking the Right Questions**: A fundamental principle is that "a problem well stated is a problem half solved" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:49">[01:14:49]</a>. The ability to ask the right questions at the right time is key to solving challenges and achieving [[company growth and scaling challenges | growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:11">[01:33:11]</a>.
*   **AI's Impact**: AI is expected to significantly impact growth work, particularly in modeling potential outcomes of experiments, identifying opportunities, and streamlining analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:48">[01:29:48]</a>. AI can also help overcome internal ego by providing dispassionate recommendations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:05">[01:32:05]</a>.
*   **Focus on Reputation and Learning**: Prioritizing learning and reputation over immediate earnings has proven beneficial, as a strong reputation can open doors to more learning opportunities, which in turn further enhances reputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:21">[01:38:21]</a>.

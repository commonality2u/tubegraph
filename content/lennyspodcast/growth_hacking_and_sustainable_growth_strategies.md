Growth hacking, a term coined by Sean Ellis, refers to the practice of scrutinizing every action to determine its impact on business growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. Initially, it was intended to describe a strategic approach to drive sustainable growth, rather than a collection of one-off "hacks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:47">[01:16:47]</a>. Ellis notes that early in the tech industry, simply being data-driven in customer acquisition was sufficient for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:17">[01:14:17]</a>. Today, with most online marketers being data-driven, success requires hyper-efficiency across all business functions: conversion, retention, and monetization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:48">[01:14:48]</a>. The primary challenge now lies in fostering cross-functional collaboration among marketing, product, sales, and customer success teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:32">[01:15:32]</a>.

## The Sean Ellis Test: Discovering Product-Market Fit

The Sean Ellis Test, also known as the product-market fit test, is a simple question designed to identify if a product is a "must-have" for users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. The core question is: "How would you feel if you could no longer use this product?" with response options including "very disappointed," "somewhat disappointed," or "not disappointed/not applicable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

### The 40% Threshold and its Origins
Ellis observed a pattern that products with a high percentage of users (typically 40% or more) indicating they would be "very disappointed" tended to perform well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. This 40% benchmark emerged from analyzing numerous startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. While not an exact firm number, it serves as a crucial target for teams to aim for before aggressively pursuing growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>. It helps align teams on when to "step on the gas" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>.

### Leading Indicator vs. Lagging Indicator
The Sean Ellis Test is a [[The role of growth teams versus founderled growth|leading indicator]] of product-market fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. The true [[The role of growth teams versus founderled growth|lagging indicator]] is actual user retentionâ€”whether people continue using the product long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. The test allows founders to gauge product-market fit early, even without sophisticated analytics systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

### How to Use the Test Effectively
1.  **Focus on "Very Disappointed" Users**: The most effective use of the test is to analyze the feedback from users who would be "very disappointed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>. This group provides invaluable insights into who they are, how they use the product, what problems it solves, and its primary benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.
2.  **Case Study: Lookout**: When Sean Ellis worked with mobile security company Lookout, their initial score was only 7% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. By analyzing the "very disappointed" users, they discovered the antivirus feature was highly valued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. They then repositioned the product to focus on antivirus and streamlined onboarding to highlight this feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>. This combination of setting the right expectations and providing "speed to value" increased the score to 40% in two weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.
3.  **Ignored "Somewhat Disappointed" Users**: Historically, Ellis advised ignoring users who would be "somewhat disappointed," as they consider the product a "nice-to-have" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:24">[00:26:24]</a>. Focusing on their feedback might dilute the product for the "must-have" users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:00">[00:42:00]</a>.
4.  **[[Implementing productled growth|Superhuman's Approach]]**: Email client Superhuman found a way to use feedback from "somewhat disappointed" users without diluting the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:23">[00:42:23]</a>. They identified the core benefit for their "must-have" users and then asked "somewhat disappointed" users who also valued that benefit what features they needed to make the product a "must-have" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:27">[00:42:27]</a>. This approach allowed them to expand their audience while staying true to their core value proposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:50">[00:42:50]</a>.
5.  **Recommended Survey Timing**: The test should be administered to a random sample of users who have "really used" the product, ideally activated users who have used it twice or more within the last one to two weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00">[00:45:00]</a>.
6.  **Qualitative Follow-up Questions**: After the initial survey, a follow-up survey to the "very disappointed" segment can ask:
    *   "What is the primary benefit that you get?" (initially open-ended, then multiple choice in a subsequent survey to a different group) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:30">[00:45:30]</a>.
    *   "Why is that benefit important to you?" This uncovers the underlying context and pain points, which can be used in marketing messaging (e.g., "Drowning in email?" for Zne) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>.
    *   "What would you use instead if this product were no longer available?" This reveals if the product solves a unique problem or if easy alternatives exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:57">[00:44:57]</a>.

### Limitations of the Test
*   **One-off products**: The test is not suitable for products used only once (e.g., watching a movie, attending a workshop) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:48">[00:24:48]</a>.
*   **Cultural Bias**: Cultural differences can influence results (e.g., Brazilians might be more optimistic, leading to higher scores; Hungarians might be more pessimistic, leading to lower scores) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:31">[00:27:31]</a>.
*   **User Investment**: If surveyed too late in the user journey, after significant user investment (e.g., building a website on webs.com, setting up an event on Eventbrite), the score can be artificially high due to switching costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:48">[00:20:48]</a>.
*   **Sample Size**: A minimum of 30 responses is generally recommended for reliable data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:11">[00:33:11]</a>.

## [[Strategies for company growth and overcoming internal challenges|Sustainable Growth Strategies]]

Sean Ellis advocates for a specific sequence in pursuing [[Marketing strategies and growth|growth strategies]]:
1.  **Understand Value**: Deeply understand the "must-have" value identified by the Sean Ellis Test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:46">[00:49:46]</a>.
2.  **Define North Star Metric**: Establish a metric that captures units of this value being delivered (e.g., Airbnb's "Nights Booked," Uber's "Weekly Rides," Amazon's "Monthly Purchases") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:50">[00:49:50]</a>. This metric should:
    *   Reflect value delivered to customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:09">[01:21:09]</a>.
    *   Not be a ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:37">[01:20:37]</a>.
    *   Be able to trend "up and to the right" over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:40">[01:20:40]</a>.
    *   Correlate to revenue growth, but revenue itself should not be the North Star Metric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:46">[01:20:46]</a>.
    *   Ideally have a time frame (e.g., daily active users vs. monthly active users, as seen with Facebook) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:48">[01:17:48]</a>.
3.  **Optimize Activation**: This is the most critical initial focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:03">[00:51:03]</a>. It addresses the highest risk of losing users and ensures they experience the core value.
    *   **Case Study: LogMeIn**: The company faced a challenge where 95% of sign-ups never performed a remote control session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:51">[00:54:51]</a>. By freezing product development and focusing all teams on improving the sign-up-to-usage rate, they increased it by 1000% (from 5% to 50%) in three months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:28">[00:55:28]</a>. This allowed their previously limited acquisition channels to scale dramatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:59">[00:55:59]</a>.
    *   **Tips for Improving Activation**:
        *   **Understand the problem**: Ask users directly why they dropped off at certain steps (e.g., "Why didn't you download the software?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:08">[00:59:08]</a>.
        *   **Increase desire, reduce friction**: These are the two main levers for conversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:36">[01:01:36]</a>.
        *   **Set expectations**: Clearly communicate the product's primary benefit upfront, like Lookout did with antivirus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.
        *   **Speed to value**: Guide users to the "aha moment" as quickly as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:50">[01:02:50]</a>.
        *   **Inspiration from others**: Study how successful products handle activation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:59">[01:00:59]</a>.
    *   **Defining an Activation Metric**: Start qualitatively by identifying when users have had a "good enough experience" to understand the product's value. Then, find a correlation to long-term retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. The metric should be actionable and occur early in the user journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:12">[01:04:12]</a>.
4.  **Optimize Engagement and Referral**:
    *   **Engagement**: Focus on reinforcing how users can experience the product's benefits more often <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:06">[01:17:06]</a>.
    *   **Referrals**: A referral program is a powerful accelerator when a product already has strong word-of-mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:15">[01:15:15]</a>. It cannot fix a product that people don't want to talk about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:19">[01:15:19]</a>. Dual incentives (for both referrer and referee) tend to work best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:28">[01:13:28]</a>.
    *   **Freemium Models**: For a freemium model to be effective, the free product must be so good that it generates natural word-of-mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:16">[01:16:16]</a>. The premium version must offer sufficient differentiation for users to upgrade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:26">[01:16:26]</a>.
5.  **Optimize Revenue Model**: Ensure the business model is correct and profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:54">[00:53:54]</a>.
6.  **Focus on Customer Acquisition (Channels)**: Only after the internal "growth engine" is efficient should companies "obsess" over acquiring new customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:01">[00:53:01]</a>. This is because acquisition is highly competitive, and inefficient conversion or retention makes scaling difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:19">[00:53:19]</a>.

### Identifying Growth Channels
*   Companies should identify realistic customer acquisition angles unique to their business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:46">[01:07:46]</a>.
*   **Talk to Customers**: A key tactic is asking customers: "How did you find this product?" and "How do you normally find products like this?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:19">[01:10:19]</a>. This qualitative research informs potential channels.
*   **Qualitative + Quantitative**: Combining qualitative insights from customer conversations with quantitative data and testing leads to much better experiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:51">[01:11:51]</a>.

## ICE Prioritization Framework
Sean Ellis also developed the ICE prioritization framework, which stands for Impact, Confidence, and Effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:12">[01:12:12]</a>. He views the "Reach" component in the RICE framework as an unnecessary addition, as it is already implicitly factored into "Impact" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:47">[01:12:47]</a>. The framework's purpose is to provide a systematic, transparent way to compare and prioritize ideas submitted from across the company, enabling a high-velocity testing program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:59">[01:12:59]</a>.

## The Role of AI in Growth
Ellis believes AI will significantly impact growth by:
*   **Modeling Outcomes**: Improving the ability to model potential outcomes of experiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.
*   **Reducing Ego**: Providing dispassionate recommendations for underperforming areas of a business, making it harder for ego to impede necessary changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:05">[01:16:05]</a>.
*   **Improving Experiment Ideas**: Helping to identify opportunities and generate better experiment ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:24">[01:16:24]</a>.
*   **Streamlining Analysis**: Alleviating bottlenecks in the analysis of experiments, which often become a challenge with high-velocity testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:48">[01:16:48]</a>.

## Core Philosophy
Ellis emphasizes that success often comes down to "asking the right question at the right time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:14">[01:33:14]</a>. Rather than immediately jumping to solutions, it's crucial to deeply understand the problem by asking obvious, yet often overlooked, questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:01">[01:35:01]</a>. This focus on learning and reputation, rather than just earnings, has served Ellis well in his career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:21">[01:38:21]</a>. His early writings influenced the initial growth team at TikTok <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:51">[01:40:51]</a>.

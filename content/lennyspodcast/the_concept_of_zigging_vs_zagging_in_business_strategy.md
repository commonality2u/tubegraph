The concept of "zigging when everyone else is zagging" is a core principle in business strategy, emphasizing the value of pursuing unconventional paths. This approach involves making [[High conviction low consensus bets]] â€“ decisions that one strongly believes in, even when most others disagree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:44">[00:28:44]</a>.

## Core Tenet
The fundamental idea is that companies, especially startups, should not automatically assume things must be done in a certain way. Instead, founders should actively try to shape the universe to their liking, even if it means defying traditional norms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:59">[00:18:59]</a>. This requires strong conviction, as disagreements will often come from investors, board members, and even potential partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:26">[00:29:26]</a>.

As Peter Thiel articulates, it's about "being right about something that other people think you're wrong about for a very long time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:57">[00:28:57]</a>.

## Examples of Zigging
*   **Opposite of Conventional Startup Advice:** While common startup advice suggests focusing on one thing and being exceptionally world-class at it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, HubSpot initially did "exactly the opposite" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. They decided to build a broad product suite from year one, including SEO tools, web analytics, and blogging tools, even though strong competitors already existed in each category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:41">[00:51:41]</a>. The core problem they aimed to solve was the small to medium-sized business (SMB) customer's inability to integrate disparate tools, not the lack of individual tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:10">[00:52:10]</a>.
*   **Founders' Work-Life Integration:** HubSpot's co-founders, being night people, implemented a strict "no meetings before 11:00 a.m." rule for years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>. This allowed them to align the company's operating rhythm with their personal preferences.
*   **Focus on SMB Market:** HubSpot made an early, high-conviction decision to target the SMB market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:09">[00:29:09]</a>. At the time, this was considered extremely challenging, with few successful examples beyond Intuit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:12">[00:48:12]</a>. The belief was that while harder to crack, success in SMB avoids revenue concentration and offers millions of potential customers, much like consumer markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:50">[00:47:50]</a>.
*   **Founder's Role Without Direct Reports:** The co-founder, a "startup guy at heart," chose not to have any direct reports during his 18 years at HubSpot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. This allowed him to lean into his strengths and avoid aspects of management he didn't enjoy or excel at <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>.
*   **Company Transparency:** HubSpot decided to designate every single employee as a "designated insider" on the day they went public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:39">[00:26:39]</a>. This allowed them to maintain their core value of transparency by sharing all financials with everyone, despite the associated downsides for employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>.

### Knowing When to Zig (and When Not To)

While zigging can lead to competitive advantages and unique organizational structures, it's crucial to apply this thinking strategically.

> "The number of things that you're contrarian on has to be greater than zero but not too high." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:38">[00:28:38]</a>

*   **Solve the Actual Problem:** When considering a broad approach (going wide, not deep), the decision should stem from a deep understanding of the customer's problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:41">[00:54:41]</a>. If solving the problem genuinely requires a multi-faceted solution, then going wide might be the right zig.
*   **Impose Constraints:** If a broad approach is chosen, self-imposed constraints are necessary to prevent uncontrolled complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:56">[00:55:56]</a>. For instance, HubSpot aimed *not* to be in the top three in any single product category, because their value proposition was the all-in-one integration, not individual best-of-breed features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:16">[00:53:16]</a>. This prevented over-investment in one area and maintained focus on the holistic solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:26">[00:53:26]</a>.
*   **Re-evaluate and Adapt:** Not all contrarian decisions will work out. HubSpot initially had no titles to promote a flat organization, but later realized the value people ascribed to titles for career progression and external signaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:17">[00:30:17]</a>. They adapted by adopting classic titles, demonstrating that it's okay to iterate and change things if the initial contrarian approach creates unintended problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:08">[00:32:08]</a>.
*   **Measure and Learn:** Regularly measure the impact of contrarian decisions. HubSpot's use of "Laughs Per Minute" (LPM) for keynote talks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:42">[00:40:42]</a> and their internal [[Net Promoter Score (NPS) | NPS]] for culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:07">[01:22:07]</a> are examples of quantitative measurement to assess the effectiveness of their unique approaches.

Ultimately, zigging requires a combination of strong conviction, disciplined execution, and a willingness to adapt based on feedback and results.

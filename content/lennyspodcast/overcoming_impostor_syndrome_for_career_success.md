Jeffrey Pfeffer, a professor of organizational behavior at Stanford's Graduate School of Business and author of *The Seven Rules of Power*, emphasizes that a crucial step to growing one's power and advancing in a career is to [[Dealing with limiting beliefs | get out of your own way]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>. This involves addressing common self-sabotaging behaviors, including impostor syndrome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:57">[00:21:57]</a>.

## The Impact of Impostor Syndrome
Impostor syndrome is a psychological pattern where individuals doubt their accomplishments and have a persistent internalized fear of being exposed as a "fraud" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:57">[00:21:57]</a>. Those who suffer from it often believe they were an "admissions mistake" or a "hiring mistake" and that they don't truly deserve their position, feeling surrounded by people "smarter and better than them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:02">[00:22:02]</a>.

This mindset can lead to self-defeating behaviors, such as:
*   **Preemptory apologies:** Starting statements with phrases like "I don't know if this comment is going to be useful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:27">[00:22:27]</a>.
*   **Excessive apologizing:** Regularly saying "pardon me for interrupting" or "pardon me for taking up your time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:41">[00:22:41]</a>.
*   **Disempowering self-descriptors:** Using language that undermines one's own capabilities or worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>.

Ultimately, believing you are "not deserving of the job that you hold" can "leak out" and influence how others perceive you, leading them to also doubt your worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:09">[00:23:09]</a>. This self-inflicted doubt can cap your potential for career growth and impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:01">[00:24:01]</a>.

> [!NOTE] If you worry too much about whether people like you, you are "shooting yourself in the foot" when it comes to acquiring power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:20">[00:23:20]</a>. A key takeaway from Pfeffer's class is, "If you want to be liked, get a dog" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:30">[00:23:30]</a>.

## Strategies for Overcoming Impostor Syndrome
To overcome impostor syndrome and [[Leveraging mindset and personal growth in professional settings | build power]], consider these actionable steps:

### 1. Stop Apologizing Unnecessarily
If you have a comment that isn't useful, don't say it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:35">[00:22:35]</a>. If you have something valuable to contribute, do so confidently without pre-apologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:38">[00:22:38]</a>. If you were hired for a job, you are likely "not only qualified, you're probably overqualified" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:55">[00:22:55]</a>.

### 2. Prioritize Competence and Respect Over Being Liked
While you don't want to be intentionally disliked, your primary focus should be on performing your job effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a>. You were hired to "get a job done" and possess the skills to make your organization successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:27">[00:25:27]</a>. If you fail to use these skills due to concerns about others' opinions, you harm both yourself and your organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:36">[00:25:36]</a>. The goal is to prioritize competence and respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:56">[00:25:56]</a>.

### 3. Acknowledge Others Are Not Necessarily Better
A useful perspective is to recognize that others are "often no better than you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:47">[00:23:47]</a>. This helps to alleviate the feeling of inadequacy often associated with impostor syndrome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:49">[00:23:49]</a>.

### 4. Seek Coaching and Social Support
For many, the process of [[Overcoming fears related to career changes | overcoming fears related to career changes]] and addressing discomfort around [[Navigating Career Transitions and SelfConfidence | building power]] is best achieved with support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:39">[01:17:39]</a>. Jeffrey Pfeffer recommends:
*   **Getting a coach:** Professional coaches can provide guidance and help develop these skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:03">[01:18:03]</a>.
*   **Establishing a personal board of directors:** Assemble a group of individuals who can offer advice, social support, and accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:12">[01:18:12]</a>.

> [!INFO] **The Importance of Practice and Coaching:**
> Learning to wield power, like mastering a skill such as playing tennis or a musical instrument, requires practice and coaching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:55">[00:52:55]</a>. Just as you wouldn't expect to swim the English Channel without starting in pools and gradually increasing the challenge, you shouldn't expect to transform your approach to power overnight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:38">[00:53:38]</a>. The key is to start where you can and incrementally "push yourself out of your comfort zone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:07">[00:54:07]</a>, perhaps by just 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:58">[00:54:58]</a>. This gradual approach allows for [[overcoming_and_learning_from_failures | learning]] and adaptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:33">[00:54:33]</a>.

The ability to command a room, [[improving_communication_skills_for_career_advancement | communicate effectively]], and demonstrate presence are all skills that "can be mastered" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:41">[00:46:41]</a>. These are not innate personality traits but learned behaviors that can significantly contribute to one's career success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:46">[00:47:46]</a>.

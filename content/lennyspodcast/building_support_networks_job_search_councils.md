Job search councils are peer support groups, typically consisting of six to eight job seekers, designed to provide mutual support and guidance throughout the job search process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:47">[02:57:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:33">[03:07:33]</a>. Developed by Phil Terry, author of "Never Search Alone," these councils apply a product-focused lens to the job search, helping individuals define their [[candidate_market_fit_and_job_targeting | candidate market fit]] and [[job_search_strategies_and_mindset | play to win]] in the job market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:44">[03:00:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:37">[03:15:37]</a>.

The overarching philosophy of these councils is the importance of not [[job_search_strategies_and_mindset | searching alone]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:16">[04:29:16]</a>.

> "Everyone no matter who they are, feels insecure and anxious in the job search, and if you do it alone, it magnifies it." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:67">[03:47:67]</a>
> — Phil Terry

## Origins and Inspiration

Phil Terry's inspiration for job search councils dates back to his mother, who, in 1960, formed a support group for elementary school teachers that met for 50 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:18">[05:02:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:95">[05:13:95]</a>. This group helped his mother navigate a difficult job market in the mid-70s after losing her tenure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:57">[05:50:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:57">[06:06:57]</a>. Terry formalized this approach, first establishing CEO councils for internet CEOs in the mid-90s, and later product and general management councils <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:75">[04:47:75]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:98">[04:51:98]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:44">[09:09:44]</a>. The methodology was then adapted and offered to the broader community, free of charge, through the "Never Search Alone" initiative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:19:95">[09:19:95]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:21:55">[09:21:55]</a>.

## Structure and Process

Over 2,000 job search councils have been launched, operating as a 100% free, volunteer-driven initiative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:15:23">[09:15:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:20:94">[09:20:94]</a>.

### Joining a Council
1.  **Application**: Individuals apply through the Phil Terry website (phil.org) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:32:00">[10:32:00]</a>.
2.  **Seeker Classification**: Applicants are matched into groups based on their employment status:
    *   **Slow Seekers**: Individuals who are currently employed but seeking a new job, having a "full-time job and can't work as quickly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:52:00">[10:52:00]</a>. They typically meet every two weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:15:93">[12:15:93]</a>.
    *   **Fast Seekers**: Individuals who are currently out of work and looking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:57:12">[10:57:12]</a>. They typically meet twice a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:12:87">[12:12:87]</a>.
3.  **Moderator Role**: Job seekers can volunteer to be moderators, which offers faster matching and additional training and support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:03:00">[11:03:00]</a>. The program has over 2,000 moderators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:23:00">[11:23:00]</a>.
4.  **Orientation**: After matching, participants attend a live orientation program to understand the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:31:00">[11:31:00]</a>.
5.  **Resources**: Members receive a free 100-page workbook with templates, guides, and questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:46:00">[11:46:00]</a>.
6.  **Meeting Zero**: The first meeting is called "Meeting Zero," where members share personal stories to build trust and create an open, vulnerable environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:01:00">[12:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:11:00">[15:11:00]</a>.

The process continues until a job is found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:23:00">[12:23:00]</a>.

## Benefits and Impact

Job search councils provide a crucial "private safety net" against the anxiety and fear that often accompany the job search, especially during economic downturns caused by "creative destruction" in capitalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:18:00">[18:18:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:15:00">[19:15:00]</a>.

Benefits include:
*   **Emotional Support and Accountability**: Councils provide a space for members to bounce ideas, maintain [[job_search_strategies_and_mindset | emotional balance]], and stay accountable, especially when emotional energy is low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:37:00">[13:37:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:11:00">[14:11:00]</a>.
*   **Faster Job Search**: Data suggests that the average job search in a council is 3 months, at the lower end of the national average of 3-6 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:24:00">[22:24:00]</a>.
*   **Confidence Building**: The supportive environment helps members feel less alone, counteracting feelings of worthlessness and increasing confidence in interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:00">[10:04:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:52:00">[10:52:00]</a>.
*   **Structured Methodology**: Councils guide members through specific tactics, such as the "Manukan Two-Pager" (what you want/don't want in a job) and the "Listening Tour" (gathering market feedback and refining [[candidate_market_fit_and_job_targeting | candidate market fit]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:00:00">[23:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:41:00">[24:41:00]</a>.
*   **Networking and Visibility**: The listening tour and regular updates to one's network (e.g., monthly "update notes") cultivate "listening posts" – people invested in one's success who might alert them to opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:18:00">[26:18:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:39:00">[39:39:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:43:00">[43:43:00]</a>.
*   **Honest Feedback and Reality Checks**: Councils help members interpret market feedback, including potentially tough realities about their [[candidate_market_fit_and_job_targeting | candidate market fit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:56:00">[30:56:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:52:00">[39:52:00]</a>. This contrasts with doing it alone, where individuals might overestimate or underestimate their fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:00:00">[27:00:00]</a>.
*   **Overcoming the "Inner Critic"**: Sharing experiences within the group helps members recognize and address their own "impostor syndrome and inner critic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48:00">[07:48:00]</a>.

## Core Principles

### Playing to Win
Instead of simply "not playing to lose," candidates are encouraged to proactively shape their job search. This involves creating a "job mission with OKRs" (Objectives and Key Results) for the role they are applying for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:28:00">[50:28:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:35:00">[50:35:00]</a>. This document, outlining anticipated outcomes and accountability, helps candidates formulate insightful interview questions and demonstrates initiative to hiring managers, often leading to immediate offers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:19:00">[51:19:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:52:00">[52:52:00]</a>. It also provides leverage for negotiating non-salary aspects like project budgets, team training, or mentorship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:36:00">[53:36:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:06:00">[54:06:00]</a>.

### Asking for Help
A foundational element, heavily influenced by Phil Terry's personal experiences, is the power of [[asking_for_help_and_leveraging_networks | asking for help]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:31:00">[11:31:00]</a>. Key counter-intuitive rules about [[asking_for_help_and_leveraging_networks | asking for help]]:
*   It's a sign of confidence, not weakness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:57:00">[11:57:00]</a>.
*   It's a giving activity, not a taking one, as people feel honored and happy to offer their expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:57:00">[11:57:00]</a>.
*   It fosters independence, not passivity, by actively engaging one's network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:57:00">[11:57:00]</a>.
*   It improves one's reputation rather than harming it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:57:00">[11:57:00]</a>.

Effective [[asking_for_help_and_leveraging_networks | asking for help]] involves doing homework, being thoughtful, honest, and showing respect for the other person's expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:49:00">[14:49:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:53:00">[15:53:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:03:00">[16:03:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:56:00">[17:56:00]</a>. This can manifest in various ways, from seeking feedback on emails to conducting "listening tours" and "peer coaching calls" with experienced professionals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:53:00">[19:53:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:50:00">[20:50:00]</a>.

### Continuous Engagement
Even after finding a job, or if the job search extends, continuous engagement is crucial. This includes:
*   **Monthly Update Notes**: Regularly informing one's network about job search progress, even if there's no major news, keeps them engaged as "listening posts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:43:00">[43:43:00]</a>.
*   **Debriefing Interviews**: Discussing interviews with council members or trusted peers helps in objectively analyzing performance and identifying areas for improvement, counteracting personal biases or [[job_search_strategies_and_mindset | inner critic]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>.
*   **First 90 Days Calls**: For new hires, connecting with peers in similar roles to discuss job mission with OKRs, anticipate challenges, and gain insights for the initial 30-60-90 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:57:00">[20:57:00]</a>.
*   **[[career_advancement_strategies | Career Evolution Calls]]**: For those seeking advancement, consulting with individuals at their target career level to understand the path from their current role to the next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:33:00">[21:33:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

Job search councils offer a powerful, community-based approach to [[job_search_strategies_and_mindset | finding a job]], especially in challenging markets. By leveraging the collective support, insights, and accountability of a peer group, individuals can navigate the emotional and practical hurdles of the job search more effectively, fostering confidence, refining their focus, and ultimately securing a job they love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.

Storytelling is a significant buzzword in business, with many professionals aspiring to be storytellers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, truly embracing [[the_importance_of_storytelling_in_business | storytelling]] means separating oneself from the crowd, a risk many are hesitant to take <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. The alternative, however, is to remain "in the herd" and be forgettable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Why Stories are Memorable
The human mind is not designed to remember pie charts, facts, statistics, or platitudes not attached to imagery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. If communication does not incorporate [[techniques_for_better_storytelling | storytelling]], it becomes easily forgotten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. As an example, many conference attendees cannot recall what a speaker said by the time they leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

Matthew Dicks, author of "Storyworthy" and a 59-time Moth Story Slam winner, emphasizes that an effective story must be rooted in a singular moment of transformation or realization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[01:08]</a>. This core concept, often referred to as a "5-second moment," is what makes a story resonate deeply with an audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.

## Core Principles of Memorable Storytelling

### The "5-Second Moment"
Every good story centers around a single, pivotal moment, whether it's a profound transformation (changing from one type of person to another) or a realization (shifting one's understanding) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. This change accumulates from events, feelings, and thoughts, culminating in a specific "flip" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. The purpose of a story is to bring this moment to maximum clarity for the audience, allowing them to experience it alongside the storyteller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. The majority (98%) of a story's content serves as context for this singular moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

*   **Example: Eileen the Student**
    Dicks shares a story about a student named Eileen who lacked confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. After much effort to build her confidence, a "5-second moment" occurred when Eileen, unprompted, playfully quipped back at him, indicating her newfound trust and confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. This brief moment allowed Dicks to realize her transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.

*   **Example: Star Wars**
    The first *Star Wars* film can be seen as a story about Luke Skywalker's transformation from a non-believer in the Force to someone who embraces it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. His decision to turn off his targeting computer and rely on the Force is his 5-second moment of religious realization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

### Starting at the End
When telling true stories, storytellers should start at the end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. Knowing the transformative moment allows the storyteller to define the "opposite" beginning, framing the narrative around a clear opposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. For example, in a romantic comedy like *When Harry Met Sally*, the audience knows the characters, who initially dislike each other, will end up together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. The journey to that predictable end is what makes the story entertaining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>. This approach ensures the story conveys something of importance, rather than merely recounting chronological events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.

### The Power of Change
A moment of transformation or change lends importance to a story and allows the audience to connect with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>. While specific content might not be relatable (e.g., teaching), the universal experience of change (e.g., lacking confidence and then finding it) exponentially increases a story's appeal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>.

### The "Dinner Test"
A good story, especially in formal settings, should mimic the style of a captivating story told over dinner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>. This means avoiding "performance art" elements like unattributed dialogue or starting with sound effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>. The language should feel natural and slightly elevated, free from verbal filler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>.

### Personal Stories
Stories must be *your* story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>. Telling a story about someone else lacks vulnerability, which is a key component of effective [[the_importance_of_storytelling_in_presentations | storytelling]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a>. Audiences connect when the storyteller opens their heart and mind, sharing something personal, even if others might be unwilling to do so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:23">[00:19:23]</a>. Stories about others can be reframed by centering them on how that experience impacted *you* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>. For instance, children of Holocaust survivors can share their family's history by focusing on how those experiences shaped their own lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>.

### Vacation Stories (and What NOT to Do)
Most vacation stories are simply a recounting of events that bore others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:33">[00:20:33]</a>. Unless a vacation involves a "5-second moment of change," it's not worth telling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a>. If such a moment occurs, the story should focus solely on that moment, rendering the broader vacation context irrelevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>. The shortest version of every story is often the best, starting as close to the end as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>.

## The Importance of Stakes
Stakes are what an audience should be worried about or wondering about during a story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:35">[00:23:35]</a>. Without stakes, listeners disengage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:44">[00:23:44]</a>. Storytellers must assume no one wants to listen and work relentlessly to make the audience wonder what comes next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:08">[00:24:08]</a>.

Ways to add stakes:
*   **Elephant**: Immediately present something big and worrying at the start, even if it's not the core of the story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:24">[00:25:24]</a>. This provides immediate engagement, similar to a movie trailer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:50">[00:25:50]</a>.
*   **Backpack**: Inform the audience of your character's (or your own) hopes, dreams, or plans upfront <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:22">[00:26:22]</a>. This allows the audience to feel the stakes when things go awry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:39">[00:26:39]</a>.
*   **Breadcrumbs**: Drop small hints or incomplete ideas that build anticipation, like a gun in a scene that you know will eventually be fired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>.
*   **Hourglass**: When the audience is on the edge of their seat, slow down the narrative and add details to prolong the suspense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:21">[00:27:21]</a>.
*   **Crystal Ball**: Predict a (possibly terrible) future or outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:48">[00:27:48]</a>. If the prediction is realistic, it immediately creates worry and stakes for the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:22">[00:28:22]</a>.

Stakes should build throughout the story, rather than being front-loaded, keeping the audience engaged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:49">[00:31:49]</a>.

### Surprise
Surprise is a powerful element in storytelling, where the audience didn't see something coming but then recognizes its inevitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>. The best surprises are those that feel both inevitable (information was subtly placed earlier) and completely unexpected (cleverly hidden) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>. Every story should have at least one moment of surprise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:51">[00:28:51]</a>.

## Storytelling in Business
In business, most communication is "round, white, and flavorless," intentionally so because people fear standing out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:48">[00:34:48]</a>. However, this leads to being forgettable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:19">[00:35:19]</a>. [[building_effective_communication_strategies | Effective communication]] in business requires incorporating storytelling to create memorable connections.

### Benefits of Storytelling in Business
*   **Standing Out**: Storytelling helps individuals and companies separate themselves from the "herd" of forgettable presentations and data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:09">[00:35:09]</a>.
*   **Human Connection**: Stories allow individuals to be seen as human beings rather than corporate monoliths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:08">[00:44:08]</a>.
*   **Memorability**: Audiences remember stories long after facts and figures are forgotten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>.

### Practical Applications
*   **Boris's Story (Resilience)**: A factory owner, Boris, used a personal story about his son striking out in a championship baseball game to teach his sales team about resilience after failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:21">[00:38:21]</a>. Instead of scolding them for sulking, he shared his son's quick recovery from disappointment, providing a tangible example of moving on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:09">[00:40:09]</a>. This fostered connection and a shared understanding of desired behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:50">[00:40:50]</a>. Dicks advocates for building a "vault of stories" (bricks) rather than just finding stories to solve immediate problems (Band-Aids) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:21">[00:41:21]</a>.
*   **Marsha's Story (Corporate Narrative)**: Marsha, a director of corporate communications at Slack, used a 30-second anecdote about her lonely Tuesday night during the pandemic when she conceived a core narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:40">[00:43:40]</a>. Including this personal, vulnerable detail in her presentation significantly increased audience connection and engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:51">[00:43:51]</a>.

### Personal Interest Inventory
To make stories personal and relatable in business, develop a "personal interest inventory" – a list of personal details that can be subtly weaved into conversations or presentations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:50">[00:44:50]</a>. Examples include:
*   **Marital Status**: Being married implies a level of stability and decency, fostering connection with many <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:10">[00:45:10]</a>.
*   **Hobbies/Interests**: While less common, highly intense shared interests like running marathons can create immediate, strong connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:08">[00:46:08]</a>.
*   **Profession**: Sharing details from an everyday job, like being an elementary school teacher, can instantly make you more likable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:36">[00:47:36]</a>.

The goal is to be full of "color and edge and flavor," remembered as an individual rather than a generic corporate entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:46">[00:46:46]</a>.

### Keeping People Listening in Business (The Four Ways)
To hold an audience's attention in business, utilize:
1.  **Stakes**: As discussed, keep the audience wondering and worried <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:28">[00:49:28]</a>.
2.  **Surprise**: Deliver unexpected moments that are both surprising and inevitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>.
3.  **Suspense**: Build anticipation and keep the audience engaged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:05">[00:50:05]</a>.
4.  **Humor**: Daring to be funny sets you apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:16">[00:50:16]</a>. While risky, humor makes a presentation memorable and enjoyable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:38">[00:51:38]</a>.
    *   **Nostalgia**: Leverage shared past experiences, like old VCRs or the 1980s job market, to create relatable and often humorous content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:27">[00:53:27]</a>. This also demonstrates expertise in a field by showing historical understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:31">[00:56:31]</a>.
    *   **"One of These Things Is Not Like the Other"**: Present two expected elements, followed by an unexpected, humorous third element <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:54">[00:56:54]</a>.

### Non-Obvious Applications (Scientists and Apples)
A biotech company selling precisely sized tubes struggled to gain leads despite having superior data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:07">[00:59:07]</a>. One scientist, advised to avoid data, told a story about the "nightmare" of buying different types of apples for his family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:51">[00:59:51]</a>. He then connected this to his company's tubes, emphasizing that they provide exactly what customers need, unlike competitors who offer only one generic "Macintosh" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:15">[01:00:15]</a>. This [[using_metaphors_to_communicate_and_inspire | metaphorical storytelling]] generated more leads than all other scientists combined, creating a positive, memorable association every time conference attendees saw apples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:44">[01:00:44]</a>.

This demonstrates "speaking with adjacency"—matching theme, meaning, or message rather than direct content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:21">[01:03:21]</a>. The "snap" when the audience realizes the connection (apples to tubes) is powerful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:10">[01:04:10]</a>.

## Building a Story Bank: Homework for Life
To consistently have stories, Dicks developed "Homework for Life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:02">[01:07:02]</a>. Every day, before bed, he records one moment from the day that would be "worth telling as a story" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:35">[01:07:35]</a>. This is done in an Excel spreadsheet with two columns: date and the story moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:49">[01:07:49]</a>.

### Benefits of Homework for Life
*   **Endless Stories**: It reveals that life is filled with countless story-worthy moments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:10">[01:08:10]</a>.
*   **Developing a Storytelling Lens**: Regularly searching for moments trains the mind to see and recognize story potential that was previously overlooked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:34">[01:08:34]</a>.
*   **Recovering Time**: It helps individuals hold onto their days, making time feel less like it's flying by <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:17">[01:09:17]</a>.
*   **Seeing Patterns**: Reviewing daily moments can reveal patterns and insights about one's life, relationships, or behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:10">[01:12:10]</a>. For example, Dicks realized he "fought" with his wife by grumbling through chores, a pattern revealed by his entries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:31">[01:13:31]</a>.
*   **Recovering Past Memories**: The practice often triggers forgotten memories, which can also be added to the story bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:41">[01:10:41]</a>.
*   **Therapeutic Value**: It allows for self-reflection and a deeper understanding of one's experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:07">[01:11:07]</a>.

To start, dedicate time each day (e.g., at lunchtime, after work, and in the evening) to recall and record moments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:10">[01:18:10]</a>. Begin with faith that consistency will improve the ability to find stories over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:02">[01:16:02]</a>.

## Overcoming Public Speaking Nerves
Public speaking is a common fear, but understanding its nature can alleviate it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:57">[01:19:57]</a>.
*   **Pre-Talk Nervousness**: 98% of nervousness occurs *before* speaking; once speaking begins, most of it dissipates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:01">[01:20:01]</a>. Accepting this can be a relief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:47">[01:20:47]</a>.
*   **Everyone is Nervous**: Most people, even very famous public figures, experience nervousness before speaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:55">[01:21:55]</a>.
*   **Preparation**:
    *   **Record and Listen**: Record your talk or pitch and listen to it passively (while doing chores, commuting) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:23">[01:22:23]</a>. This allows the content to "seep into your soul" and become ingrained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:35">[01:22:35]</a>.
    *   **Focus on Transitions**: Most people forget transitions, not the content of sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:15">[01:23:15]</a>. Actively listen for and mentally rehearse the transitions between scenes or topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:20">[01:23:20]</a>.
    *   **Avoid Memorization**: Memorizing a talk is often counterproductive and leads to more suffering if a word is forgotten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:31">[01:24:31]</a>. Focus on remembering the flow and key points rather than word-for-word <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:41">[01:24:41]</a>.

## The Power of Saying "Yes"
Saying "yes" to opportunities, even those that seem crazy or undesirable, opens doors to extraordinary experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:49">[01:26:49]</a>. Not saying yes presumes knowledge of what lies beyond the opportunity, which is arrogant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:54">[01:26:54]</a>. A "yes" can always become a "no" later; you can step through the door, assess, and then step back if it's not for you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:38">[01:27:38]</a>. Often, the things that frighten us the most are the things that are best for us <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:05">[01:29:05]</a>. Saying yes creates a "causal chain" of unexpected events and connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:41">[01:29:41]</a>.

## A Tactical Tip for Storytellers
To immediately improve storytelling, start every story with **location** and **action** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:01">[01:39:01]</a>.
1.  **Location**: Start by stating where you are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:21">[01:39:21]</a>. Location activates imagination, allowing the audience to visualize the setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:24">[01:38:24]</a>.
2.  **Action**: Immediately follow with something happening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:03">[01:39:03]</a>. This indicates to the audience that the story is moving forward and grabs their attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:10">[01:39:10]</a>.

This simple technique signals to the audience that a story is beginning, creating silence and allowing the storyteller the space to speak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:10">[01:40:10]</a>. Storytelling is less about facility with language and more about making strategic, tactical decisions before speaking to entertain the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:12">[01:17:12]</a>.

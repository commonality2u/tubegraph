Melissa Perry, CEO and founder of The Product Institute, emphasizes that successful organizations need to establish robust product management practices that go beyond just one piece of development to build better products overall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:32">[00:36:32]</a>.

## The Evolution of the Product Owner Role

The Product Owner (PO) role did not emerge from product management as it is known today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>. It came out of a desire to help developers prioritize their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:10">[00:30:10]</a>. Agile methodologies, including Scrum, were initiated by software developers in 2001 with the Agile Manifesto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. The Scrum Guide, written by Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland, introduced specific roles, including the Product Owner, Scrum Master, and developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>.

In its first version, the Scrum Guide stated the Product Owner was responsible for maximizing the value of work done and could be a Product Manager for commercial development or a user department manager for in-house efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. However, the more widely adopted 2013 Scrum Guide removed the explicit mention that a Product Manager could be a Product Owner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>. This shift contributed to a misunderstanding of the Product Owner's scope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:54">[00:20:54]</a>.

### Product Owner vs. Product Manager

The Product Owner role, as typically defined in Scrum, focuses on prioritizing the backlog, writing user stories, and working closely with developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>. They are accountable for ensuring the team works on the most pressing, highest-value items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>. However, this often translates into an "order taker" role, making them extremely tactical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:37">[00:34:37]</a>.

In contrast, traditional Product Managers in software-native companies (like Google or Amazon) are responsible for end-to-end product management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. This includes:
*   Market research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>
*   Talking to customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>
*   Working with developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>
*   Iterating and testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>
*   Understanding customer needs and defining hypotheses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>

## Challenges in Large Organizations

Many large, non-tech companies, especially those not traditionally building software (e.g., banks, insurance, pharmaceutical companies), adopt Scrum and other [[Frameworks for growth in product management | frameworks]] like Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) in their [[Digital Transformation]] efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:07">[00:40:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:42">[00:40:42]</a>. SAFe, a scaled agile framework, emerged from a desire to scale Scrum and other processes across large organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:39">[00:26:39]</a>. It is attractive to executives because it provides a highly prescriptive operating model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:42">[00:27:42]</a>.

However, SAFe often introduces a problematic split between Product Managers and Product Owners:
*   **Product Owners** are part of the agile team, focused on keeping the backlog full for developers, often without time for customer interaction or strategic thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:42">[00:29:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:58">[00:31:58]</a>. Their job becomes primarily tactical, acting as "order takers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:37">[00:34:37]</a>.
*   **Product Managers** in a SAFe structure may sit at a higher level, focusing on strategy and feeding requirements down to Product Owners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:27">[00:34:27]</a>.

This separation creates several issues:
*   **Misconception of Roles**: Product Owners are often trained in two-day classes on backlog management and prioritizing work, but not on market research, data analysis, or experimentationâ€”skills crucial for a Product Manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:18:55]</a>.
*   **Lack of Strategic Input**: Teams may commit to features in quarterly "Big Room Planning" without proper discovery or customer feedback, leading to building the wrong things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:17">[00:31:17]</a>.
*   **Overhead and Bureaucracy**: Rigid adherence to frameworks like SAFe or Scrum can lead to excessive meetings and a focus on "work about work" rather than delivering value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:29">[00:24:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:17">[00:51:17]</a>.
*   **Unclear [[Career Growth Framework for Product Managers | Career Paths]]**: Many organizations adopting these roles lack a clear career path for Product Owners, leaving them unsure how to advance to more strategic Product Manager roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:47">[00:34:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:50">[00:45:50]</a>.

### For Product Owners Seeking Growth

To transition from a tactical Product Owner role to a strategic Product Manager, individuals should:
*   **Shift Focus to Value**: Understand that their role is more than just working with developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:16">[00:57:16]</a>. Instead of focusing on process (e.g., "I prioritized the backlog"), highlight the *value* delivered (e.g., "solved X problem, resulting in Y metric increase") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:45">[01:04:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:03">[01:05:03]</a>.
*   **Seek Strategic Ownership**: Proactively push back on tasks without clear goals and ask "what do we hope will happen when we release this?" to connect work to outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:32">[00:59:32]</a>.
*   **Engage in Discovery**: Volunteer to participate in customer research, even if it's considered the Product Manager's job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:05">[00:59:05]</a>.
*   **Inquire About Career Paths**: Ask leaders about their [[Career Growth Framework for Product Managers | career paths]] to prompt organizational awareness and potential changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:47">[00:58:47]</a>.
*   **Be Cautious with Certifications**: While certifications like "Certified Scrum Product Owner" (CSPO) may help secure roles in organizations adopting Scrum/SAFe, they typically do not signify the full skill set of a Product Manager needed in tech-first companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:03">[01:07:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:37">[01:08:37]</a>. Experience is more valued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:28">[01:10:28]</a>.
*   **Consider Internal or External Moves**: If an organization doesn't support [[Improving product management skills | improving product management skills]] or provide a clear career path, seek out different divisions or external companies with strong product leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:52">[01:01:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:06">[01:02:06]</a>.

### For Leaders Driving Transformation

Leaders should:
*   **Develop a Holistic Product Operating Model**: This involves defining product strategy, organizational design around products, establishing product operations (e.g., access to data, customer interaction tools), and aligning culture and incentives with product outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:38">[00:41:38]</a>.
*   **Focus on Principles, Not Dogma**: Agile methodologies should be viewed as principles to move quickly and deliver value, not rigid, step-by-step processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:27">[01:17:27]</a>.
*   **Invest in Skilled People**: Bring in experienced product leaders (e.g., CPOs) and individual contributors who can mentor and elevate the capabilities of existing teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:39">[00:53:39]</a>. Supplement training with opportunities to practice and learn from experienced professionals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:10">[00:54:10]</a>.
*   **Unify Roles**: Eliminate confusing separate titles like "Product Owner" and "Product Manager." Instead, implement a single product management career ladder with clear levels (e.g., Associate Product Manager, Product Manager, Senior Product Manager) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:08">[01:13:08]</a>. Re-evaluate existing roles and provide opportunities for people to opt into or out of the product management path based on their skills and interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:38">[01:14:38]</a>.
*   **Integrate Software Strategy at the C-Suite Level**: Recognize that digital and software strategies are integral to overall business strategy, driving innovation and competitive advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:20">[01:21:20]</a>. A Chief Product Officer (CPO) can bridge this gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:55">[01:21:55]</a>.
*   **Be Adaptable**: Continuously inspect and adapt processes to ensure they serve the company's and customers' best interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:04">[01:20:04]</a>.

Ramesh Johari, a professor at Stanford University, researches and teaches [[role_of_data_science_in_marketplace_businesses | data science]] methods and practices with a focus on the design and operation of online marketplaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:05">01:04:05</a>. He has advised major marketplaces such as Airbnb, Uber, Stripe, Bumble, Stitch Fix, and Upwork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:05">01:14:05</a>. His expertise covers building thriving marketplaces, fueling growth flywheels, the centrality of [[role_of_data_science_in_marketplace_businesses | data science]], designing review systems, and the [[the_impact_of_ai_on_business_and_technology | impact of AI]] on [[role_of_data_science_in_marketplace_businesses | data science]] and experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:05">01:46:05</a>.

## The Role of [[role_of_data_science_in_marketplace_businesses | Data Science]] in Marketplaces

Marketplaces, like Airbnb or Uber, fundamentally sell the removal of friction or "transaction costs" in finding a place to stay or a ride <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:05">06:35:05</a>. Both sides of the marketplace – the buyers (e.g., guests, riders) and the sellers (e.g., hosts, drivers) – are customers of the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:52:05">07:52:05</a>.

Unlike ancient markets made of stone, modern online marketplaces, underpinned by technology, can be constantly architected and re-architected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:05">09:07:05</a>. This dynamic nature means that [[role_of_data_science_in_marketplace_businesses | data science]] is crucial for adapting to the continuous movement of attention and inventory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:05">09:12:05</a>.

The core problems that [[role_of_data_science_in_marketplace_businesses | data science]] addresses in marketplaces include:
*   **Finding Matches** – connecting buyers with available sellers (e.g., a guest finding a room, a host finding a guest) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:31:05">09:31:05</a>.
*   **Making Matches** – helping users select the best option from multiple possibilities (e.g., an employer choosing from job applicants) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:05">09:51:05</a>.
*   **Learning About Matches** – gathering feedback (e.g., ratings, reviews, passive data) to improve future matching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:18:05">10:18:05</a>.

This entire cycle of finding, making, and learning about matches is the essence of [[role_of_data_science_in_marketplace_businesses | data science]] in marketplaces, underpinned by algorithms and data to remove friction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:00:05">11:00:05</a>.

## The [[the_impact_of_ai_on_business_and_technology | Impact of AI]] on [[role_of_data_science_in_marketplace_businesses | Data Science]]

[[the_impact_of_ai_on_business_and_technology | AI]], specifically large language models (LLMs) and generative [[the_impact_of_ai_on_business_and_technology | AI]], are transforming the landscape of [[role_of_data_science_in_marketplace_businesses | data science]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:09">01:09:09</a>.

### Prediction vs. Causation
A key challenge for [[role_of_data_science_in_marketplace_businesses | data scientists]] in the age of [[the_impact_of_ai_on_business_and_technology | AI]] is understanding the difference between prediction (correlation) and making decisions (causation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:51">00:34:51</a>. Machine learning models excel at predicting outcomes by identifying patterns in past data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:11">00:31:11</a>. However, effective decision-making requires understanding the *causal* [[impact_of_ai_on_product_management | impact]] of an action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:36">00:34:36</a>.

For example, predicting a customer's high lifetime value (LTV) is different from understanding how much *more* they will spend because of a specific promotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:05">00:33:05</a>. The goal is to make decisions that *increase* net value, not just identify high-value customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:08">00:34:08</a>. This shift from "machine learning to causal inference" is critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:49">00:35:49</a>.

### Expanded Frontier of Ideas and Increased Human Pressure
While [[the_impact_of_ai_on_business_and_technology | AI]] tools can automate tasks like coding and visualization, making them easier and faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:24">01:09:24</a>, their most significant [[the_impact_of_ai_on_business_and_technology | impact]] is expanding the frontier of possibilities for [[role_of_data_science_in_marketplace_businesses | data science]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:50">01:09:50</a>. [[the_impact_of_ai_on_business_and_technology | AI]] can generate an "astronomical explosion of explanations and ideas" and thousands of creative variations for testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">01:10:00</a>.

Paradoxically, this expansion puts **more pressure on the human** to be in the loop, not less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:08">01:10:08</a>. The human role becomes even more important in filtering, funneling, and identifying what truly matters among the vast possibilities generated by [[the_impact_of_ai_on_business_and_technology | AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:18">01:10:18</a>. This requires greater "data literacy" from individuals interacting with these tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:38">01:22:38</a>.

### Experimentation and Learning
Experimentation is essential for understanding the causal [[impact_of_ai_on_product_management | impact]] of changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:41">00:39:41</a>. However, companies often fall into the trap of being too risk-averse, focusing on incremental changes and running experiments for too long, driven by incentives for "wins" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:52">00:41:52</a>. The language of "winners and losers" in A/B testing can discourage taking bigger risks that could lead to significant learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:29">00:43:29</a>.

It is crucial to shift from a "winning and losing" mindset to a "learning" mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:03">00:45:03</a>. Even if an experiment "fails" to produce a direct win, it can still provide valuable insights into the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:07">00:44:07</a>. This means:
*   **Cultural Shift** – Leaders should expect [[role_of_data_science_in_marketplace_businesses | data scientists]] to articulate what they are learning about the business, not just deliver statistically rigorous results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:47">00:54:47</a>.
*   **Hypothesis-Driven Testing** – Each test should articulate hypotheses about business flows, funnels, or user preferences to ensure learning is prioritized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:02">00:55:02</a>.
*   **Bayesian A/B Testing** – Utilizing past learning to build "prior beliefs" before running new experiments can help combine historical data with new experiment data to reach more informed conclusions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:25">00:56:25</a>. This also encourages contributing information to a shared knowledge base, rewarding those who perform experiments that move the collective understanding forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:55">00:56:55</a>.

Learning is not free; there is a cost associated with running experiments, especially "holdout groups" that miss out on potential benefits from new features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:17">00:59:17</a>. Recognizing this cost of learning helps reinforce the importance of conducting meaningful experiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:10">01:00:10</a>.

Linear, led by co-founder and CEO Ki Sarin, exemplifies a unique approach to building both a company and its product, deeply rooted in a [[impact_of_company_culture_on_product_development | culture]] focused on craft and quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. This distinct philosophy prioritizes taste and opinions over traditional metrics and A/B testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

## Core Principles of Product-Focused Culture

Ki Sarin believes that in any domain, the more something matters, the more design matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. While early iterations of new paradigms (like mobile or web) didn't require "super well-designed" products, the bar is now incredibly high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Today, high-level design is essential from the beginning for a product to even be considered seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

Key aspects of Linear's product-focused culture include:

### Emphasis on Craft and Quality
At Linear, the commitment to craft and quality starts with hiring people who genuinely care about it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. The company believes that collaboration, a core function of their product, only happens if people use the product, and friction or poor experience makes it annoying to use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. Quality and craft are therefore seen as very important for business success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.

While there can be trade-offs, such as pushing back timelines by a few days to fix an issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>, Linear is comfortable with early "janky" experiences for internal or small beta groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. The aim is to get feedback early and improve quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. The true polish and craft are applied before the full general release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. This approach balances a "perfection mindset" with the need to push things out quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.

### Unique Team Structure
Linear operates with a lean product management structure, having only one product manager who serves as the head of product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. The decision to hire a PM came when the product grew too large for the founders to track everything, and a PM was needed to help define the product direction and align teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>.

Instead of specialized roles where engineers only code, Linear believes in a broader scope for its team members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:29">[00:29:29]</a>. Project ownership is given to the project team, consisting of engineers and designers, who identify opportunities for improvement during the [[building_new_products_within_larger_companies | building]] process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>. This allows for deep attention to detail, like an engineer noticing and fixing subtle UI issues (e.g., right-click menu diagonal movement) without being told <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>. This fosters a sense of ownership and allows the company to operate with "less people but people who are more high caliber and can think about larger scope" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:13">[01:01:13]</a>.

### Hiring for Product Sensibility
[[building_effective_product_teams | Building effective product teams]] in this model requires a very high hiring bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>. Linear specifically looks for individuals who care about craft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>, possess product thinking skills, and can articulate why some choices are better than others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:58">[00:58:58]</a>. This means interviewing engineers not just for their technical skills but also their product skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:43">[00:21:43]</a>. The goal is to hire people interested in a broader scope than just their specific skill set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:28">[00:28:28]</a>. They look for "taste" and an understanding of how things are done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:34">[00:58:34]</a>.

A unique aspect of their hiring process is a paid work trial, where candidates act as mini-contractors, solving a vague problem, building a solution, and presenting their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:51">[01:02:51]</a>. This allows both the company and the candidate to see how they work together and understand the company culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:33">[01:03:33]</a>.

### Focus and Avoiding Distractions
Linear maintains focus by adhering to core principles learned from Y Combinator: "talk to customers, build the product, exercise" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:50">[00:53:50]</a>. Anything outside these three is likely the "wrong thing to do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:58">[00:53:58]</a>.

The company categorizes tasks into "main quest lines" and "side quest lines" (from RPG games), encouraging teams to avoid side quests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:42">[00:55:42]</a>. This helps [[influence_of_company_culture_on_employee_focus_and_distraction | maintain focus]] on building the core product and making it "awesome for customers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:11">[00:56:11]</a>. This also involves saying "no" to things that aren't immediately crucial, like specific security certifications, even if they will be needed later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:27">[00:55:27]</a>.

### Customer Understanding over Metrics
Linear does not set specific metric goals for features or launches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:50">[00:43:50]</a>. Instead, they focus on solving problems, with success measured by customers agreeing the problem is solved and enjoying the solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:56">[00:44:56]</a>. This approach is rooted in understanding the problem and believing in the "right solution" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:16">[00:47:16]</a>.

The "science" aspect of their process involves extensive user research and regular communication with customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:01">[00:46:01]</a>. Founders and team members actively engage with customers, answering questions and understanding their challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:12">[00:46:12]</a>. This broad understanding allows the team to use intuition and judgment for decision-making rather than relying solely on data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:41">[00:47:41]</a>. Mistakes are accepted as part of the process, with the understanding that they can be fixed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:54">[00:49:54]</a>.

### Continuous Improvement and Cycles
Linear employs a concept called "Cycles," which are similar to sprints but emphasize consistent, focused work rather than just speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:57">[00:42:57]</a>. Cycles help teams manage an "infinite list of things to do" by establishing priorities for a specific time frame (e.g., one or two weeks) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:53">[00:41:53]</a>. This allows the team to concentrate on a few key tasks and avoid distraction from new incoming requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:12">[00:42:12]</a>.

This [[building_a_culture_of_speed_and_optimism | culture of speed]] is not about rushing, but about taking the necessary time to think and then executing efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:34">[01:36:34]</a>. The principle is "go slow to go fast," ensuring thoughtful decision-making upfront to avoid rework later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:04">[01:36:04]</a>.

## Impact on Growth and Product-Market Fit
Linear's product-focused culture has significantly influenced its growth strategy. The company initially launched a website with a waitlist and used a survey to selectively invite smaller companies that would benefit most from their early-stage tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:13">[01:10:13]</a>. This allowed them to onboard users in cohorts, fixing issues and refining the product based on feedback from each group before inviting the next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:58">[01:13:58]</a>.

This measured approach allowed them to achieve product-market fit within specific customer segments, particularly early-stage startups that valued speed and shared similar values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:07">[01:17:07]</a>. They view product-market fit as a spectrum, continuously working to strengthen it across different market segments, rather than a binary state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:07">[01:19:07]</a>. This focused growth strategy, sometimes counter-intuitive (e.g., doubling down on a successful customer type like universities for Zoom), allows for deeper capture of specific markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:21">[01:20:21]</a>.

Ultimately, Linear's product-focused culture, emphasizing quality, empowered teams, and deep customer understanding, serves its long-term goal of being in the "retention and trust business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:10">[01:11:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:10">[01:51:10]</a>. By continually delivering a high-quality product, they aim to build lasting relationships with customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:51">[01:51:51]</a>.

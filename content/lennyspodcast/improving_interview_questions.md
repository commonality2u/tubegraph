*   **Follow-up**: After the candidate asks initial questions, the interviewer states that the scientists are annoyed and will only answer *two* more questions, then expect a plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.
*   **Purpose**: To see how candidates identify the most impactful "I" (insightful) questions from a broad set of possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. There's no single right answer, but examples include "Is it safe enough for humans or not?" and "Is it more expensive capex or Opex?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

An honest, humble answer that acknowledges imperfections is preferred over a perfect, polished one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>.

### 10. Tell me about a time something went wrong.

*   **Asked by**: Niel Singal, VP of Product at Facebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>

*   **Purpose**: To break the typical interview mindset where candidates try to predict what the interviewer wants to hear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>. This question forces candidates to be genuinely opinionated and authentic, preventing the dismissal of high-quality people who might otherwise seem unoriginal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>.

*   **Purpose**: To test [[evaluating_selfawareness_and_introspection_in_interviews | introspection]] and see if the candidate can be open and introspective when they hit limits or struggle, rather than blaming others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>.
*   **Related Question**: "Do you consider yourself lucky?" This question is fascinating because it can reveal if insecure individuals decline to admit luck, while those who are comfortable should acknowledge it, recognizing that everyone is privileged and lucky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>.

### 14. Tell me about a time that you delivered something that was impactful.
*   **Asked by**: Lauren Izzo, Head of Growth at Notion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>
*   **Purpose**: To understand how the candidate defines "impact" and what it means to them. For growth practitioners, a good answer often shows intrinsic motivation about having an impact on the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>.

Indian immigrants hold prominent leadership positions in major US technology companies. The CEOs of Microsoft, Adobe, Alphabet, IBM, Palo Alto Networks, and even Starbucks were born in India and immigrated to the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This demographic might represent the largest ethnic group of CEOs in US tech companies, excluding white males <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:02">[01:11:02]</a>.

## Factors Contributing to Success

Several factors are believed to contribute to the notable success of Indian immigrants in business and tech leadership roles in the US:

### Immigrant Mindset
Immigrants often possess a unique drive, characterized by a "chip on the shoulder" and a strong hunger for success. This stems from the struggles they endure and their typically humble backgrounds with limited initial resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:20">[01:12:20]</a>.

### Cultural and Educational Background
Indian society often fosters an appreciation for mathematics and logic, which heavily influences educational paths. This societal inclination leads to a high number of engineering graduates from India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:49">[01:12:49]</a>. The rigorous filtering criteria of competitive exams in India also contribute to a highly skilled and disciplined workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:22">[01:13:22]</a>.

### Leadership Philosophy and Mythology
A significant aspect of the success of Indian CEOs can be explained through an application of Indian mythology and management principles, particularly as observed by scholar Devdutt Pattanaik <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:30">[01:13:30]</a>.

*   **Following Dharma**: Many successful Indian CEOs excel by following the "Dharma" (principles or foundational values) of the company's founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:01">[01:15:01]</a>. They prioritize sustaining and growing the established principles rather than diluting them or changing the company's identity for personal legacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:04">[01:15:04]</a>. This approach demonstrates humility, recognizing that the company was built on a pure form factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:31">[01:15:31]</a>. This aligns with the concept of [[navigating_career_growth_and_advancement_in_tech | Level 5 leadership]] where the focus is on the business, not the individual leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:08">[01:17:08]</a>.
*   **Archetypes of Leadership**: Indian mythology features three major gods: Brahma (creation), Shiva (destruction), and Vishnu (sustenance) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:41">[01:13:41]</a>.
    *   Founders often embody Brahma and Shiva, creating and disrupting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:43">[01:15:43]</a>.
    *   CEOs, particularly Indian ones, often excel in the "sustenance" role, likened to Vishnu and his avatars (like Rama and Krishna) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:30">[01:15:30]</a>.
    *   **Rama** represents high values and high obedience, following principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:50">[01:13:50]</a>.
    *   **Krishna** represents high values but low obedience, often associated with entrepreneurial spirit and adaptability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:22">[01:14:22]</a>.
    *   Successful Indian CEOs demonstrate a strong ability to move between these two archetypes, adapting to challenges while maintaining core values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:03">[01:16:03]</a>. For example, Satya Nadella's actions during the OpenAI crisis showed a "Krishna" like adaptability, while still returning to a "Rama" like focus on scaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:18">[01:18:18]</a>. This cyclical evolution of creation, sustenance, and destruction is seen as inherent, like the Brahma-Vishnu-Mahesh cycles in Indian mythology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:26">[01:26:26]</a>.

### Long-Term Orientation
Indian culture tends to foster a long-term mindset. This is exemplified by phenomena like the high prevalence of arranged marriages (95%) and a very low divorce rate (less than 1%) in India, suggesting a focus on long-term commitment and problem-solving within relationships rather than short-term dissolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:04">[01:19:04]</a>. This long-term perspective influences decision-making in business, contrasting with more short-term behaviors that can lead to negative outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:50">[01:18:50]</a>.

## Lessons from Success

The success of Indian immigrant CEOs suggests that maintaining the core "Dharma" or values of a company, adapting strategically, and embracing a long-term perspective are crucial for leadership in large organizations. This approach, rooted in cultural and philosophical understanding, prioritizes sustainable growth over personal legacy-building, contributing to the longevity and expansion of major corporations.

However, it's noted that while India is seeing a rise in entrepreneurial respect and events like National Startup Day, the culture still does not fully celebrate risk-takers in the same way some Western societies do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>. This contrasts with the inherent risk-taking often required for founders, highlighting a potential reason why these leaders thrive as CEOs (sustainers) rather than starting new ventures in India. The "gift of struggle" from humble beginnings is also seen as a powerful motivator, providing a drive that can be hard for those born into privilege to acquire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:35">[01:08:35]</a>.

Furthermore, India's market dynamics, with high Daily Active Users (DAUs) but low Average Revenue Per User (ARPU), lead to a different product development approach than in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:22">[02:23:22]</a>. This is partly due to lower per capita income and a cultural difference in valuing time, as most Indians have never been paid an hourly salary and thus don't conceptualize time in that way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>. Trust, or the lack thereof in institutions, also concentrates trust in "super apps" and established brands like Tata, making brand significantly more important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.

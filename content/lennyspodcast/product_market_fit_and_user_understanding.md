According to Uri Levine, co-founder of Waze and nine other companies, the biggest lesson from his extensive startup experience is to [[the_concept_of_product_market_fit_and_its_evolution | fall in love with the problem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This core philosophy underpins effective [[developing_customer_discovery_methods_for_productmarket_fit | user understanding]] and is crucial for achieving [[product_market_fit_strategy | product market fit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:47">[01:44:47]</a>.

## Falling in Love with the Problem
Uri Levine's book, "Fall in Love with the Problem, Not the Solution: A Handbook for Entrepreneurs," emphasizes that entrepreneurship is about value creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:30">[03:28:30]</a>. The simplest way to create value is to solve a problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:54">[03:30:54]</a>.
Starting with the problem provides a "north star" for the journey, leading to fewer deviations and a higher likelihood of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:35">[04:12:35]</a>. It also helps in telling a more compelling story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:15">[04:22:15]</a>. For example, instead of describing Waze as "an AI crowdsourced navigation system," presenting it as a tool to "help you avoid traffic jams" resonates more with customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:08">[04:29:08]</a>. When customers care, they want the company to succeed and will help achieve that success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:33">[04:47:33]</a>.

The process involves:
1.  **Identify a big problem**: Something worth solving that would make the world a better place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:41">[05:04:41]</a>.
2.  **Identify who has this problem**: If only one person has it, consider a therapist instead of a startup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:26">[05:14:26]</a>.
3.  **Speak with those people**: Understand their perception of the problem before building a solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:60">[05:31:60]</a>. This ensures value creation if the solution works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:10">[05:43:10]</a>.
4.  **Passion**: It's crucial for founders to be passionate about the problem they are solving, as the entrepreneurial journey is hard and long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:27:07">[11:27:07]</a>. This personal passion helps drive through hardships and engage others to follow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:49:57">[11:49:57]</a>.

> "If you start your story with our company is or our system is...you focus on your solution. If you start with the story with the problem we are solving is then you focus on the problem. If your story start with the value that we create for you is then you focus on the user. The last two are way better than focus on the solution." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:13">[06:36:13]</a>

## Product Market Fit: The Key to Survival
[[importance_of_productmarket_fit_for_startups | Product market fit]] means creating value for your customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:17:10">[19:17:10]</a>. Without it, a company will "die" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:23:15">[19:23:15]</a>. Once a company achieves [[levels_of_productmarket_fit_and_their_significance | product market fit]], the core product often doesn't change significantly because it has found the value it creates for customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:04:31">[20:04:31]</a>.

### The Long Journey to PMF
Figuring out [[understanding_the_framework_for_finding_productmarket_fit | product market fit]] is usually the longest part of a startup's journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:10:11">[19:10:11]</a>. It can take years:
*   Waze: 4 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:27:00">[20:27:00]</a>
*   Microsoft: 5 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:32:00">[20:32:00]</a>
*   Netflix: 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:35:00">[20:35:00]</a>
*   ChatGPT: 7 years before it was widely known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:43:00">[20:43:00]</a>

### The Core Metric: Retention
The single most important metric for [[levels_of_productmarket_fit_and_their_significance | product market fit]] is **retention** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:01:00">[21:01:00]</a>. If customers come back, it means value is being created; if they don't, it means value is not being created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:06:00">[21:06:00]</a>. For products with high frequency of use, 3-month retention of 30-50% is a good indication of PMF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:50:00">[26:50:00]</a>.

### Waze's Product Market Fit Journey
Waze started in Israel and was successful there, then expanded globally at the end of 2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:14:00">[22:14:00]</a>. However, it wasn't "good enough" in most places, leading to high churn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:42:00">[22:42:00]</a>. Waze achieved PMF through continuous iteration and speaking with drivers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:38:00">[23:38:00]</a>. It took over a year of iterations until early 2011 to see it work in multiple metropolitan areas in the US, countries in Europe, and Latin America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:03:00">[24:03:00]</a>. Some markets, like Japan, were never a fit for Waze's crowdsourced model due to complex address systems requiring perfect information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:44:00">[24:44:00]</a>.

Interestingly, while Waze started with the vision of helping people avoid traffic, its primary value evolved to creating **certainty** for users about arrival times, which is a higher value than just saving time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:51:00">[28:51:00]</a>.

## Understanding Users for Product Market Fit
To build a successful product, it's crucial to understand users.

### The Danger of Building for Oneself
Founders often make the mistake of building a product for themselves, assuming others will use it in the same way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:07">[10:07:07]</a>. Steve Wozniak, co-founder of Apple, highlighted this when he expressed relief that Uri used the iPhone's volume button for photos, "the way that I meant it to be" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:41">[01:05:41]</a>. This anecdote shows that different people use products in different ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:52">[01:05:52]</a>. For Waze, some users rely on the screen, while others prefer audio guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:01">[01:06:01]</a>.

To avoid this mistake:
*   **Watch new users**: Observe how they interact with the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:23">[01:07:23]</a>.
*   **Ask "why"**: If users are not doing what's expected, ask why <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:29">[01:07:29]</a>. This "why" is key to making the product successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:33">[01:07:33]</a>.

### User Adoption Groups
Users can be grouped by their ability to adapt to new things or behaviors:
*   **Innovators (2%)**: Use something new just because it's new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:16">[01:08:16]</a>.
*   **Early Adopters**: Try new things when they realize there's value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:37">[01:08:37]</a>.
*   **Early Majority (1/3 of population)**: This is the most important group, where market leaders emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:58">[01:08:58]</a>. They are afraid of change ("Don't Rock the Boat") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:10">[01:09:10]</a>. They fear complexity and embarrassment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:41">[01:09:41]</a>.
    *   To win the early majority, **simplicity** is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:03">[01:10:03]</a>. Products should iterate by adding features, then removing unused ones to reduce complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:16">[01:10:16]</a>.
    *   Most product owners are innovators or early adopters, making it hard to understand the early majority without observing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:40">[01:10:40]</a>.

### Learning from Unsuccessful Users
Instead of solely focusing on successful users at the bottom of the engagement funnel, it's crucial to speak with those who *failed* in the funnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:48">[01:12:48]</a>. This includes people who downloaded the app but didn't register, or registered but didn't use it, or used it but didn't come back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:55">[01:12:55]</a>. They hold valuable insights into "why" the product wasn't creating value for them, which is essential for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:07">[01:13:07]</a>.

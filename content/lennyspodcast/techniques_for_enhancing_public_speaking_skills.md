Becoming a [[strategies_for_effective_public_speaking_and_reducing_nervousness | better speaker]] is described as a significant "accelerant of your professional life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. This article explores various tactics, insights, and practical exercises from public speaking expert Tristan de Fontbelle, co-creator of Ultra Speaking, to help individuals become more comfortable and effective when speaking in public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## Core Insights for Public Speaking

### Speaking as a Meta-Skill
The biggest misconception about tackling public speaking is underestimating how transformative it can be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. Speaking is a meta-skill, meaning that as you improve, your life generally improves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. Similar to fitness, improvements in speaking can lead to increased energy, better self-perception, and enhanced confidence, positively impacting work, friendships, and family interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. Humans are naturally evolved to speak, possessing "incredible hardware" for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. Over time, "bugs in the software" (bad habits and anxieties) can develop, but these can be debugged and upgraded, potentially changing your entire life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

### The Enjoyment Barometer
If you don't enjoy speaking, you might be doing it wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. Enjoyment serves as a barometer: if you're enjoying yourself, you're likely doing things right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. Speaking is a natural human ability, and in comfortable environments (like with family or close friends), communication is "extraordinarily enjoyable" and empowering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. When feeling pressured in a business setting, people often try to speak differently, overthinking and attempting to control every word <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. This makes speaking unenjoyable and counterproductive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. This principle also applies to [[importance_of_practicing_public_speaking | practice]]: it must be enjoyable and rewarding to sustain motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.

### Speaking as a Subconscious Flow
Speaking is fundamentally a subconscious, flow-oriented process, not a conscious one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>. When you speak best, you're not thinking about speaking; you're fully attuned to what you're trying to convey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>. The goal is to enter and maintain a flow state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. This mindset shifts focus from symptoms (e.g., filler words) to root causes (e.g., discomfort with slowing down or pausing) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>. Addressing root causes, such as feeling "boxed in" or lacking self-trust under pressure, unlocks freedom and allows for natural expression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>.

## Tactical Tips for Presentations and Meetings

Tristan suggests three key tactics to apply immediately:

1.  **Think Up**: When gathering your thoughts, instead of looking down (which can appear uncertain or distracted, especially on video calls), look up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>. Looking up makes you appear thoughtful and confident, reducing the likelihood of interruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>. A simple reminder like "think up" on a sticky note can help establish this habit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>.

2.  **End Strong**: Many speakers tend to "end weak," either trailing off or expressing self-doubt at the conclusion of their statements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>. This is akin to a pilot having a smooth flight but a horrible landingâ€”the ending leaves the lasting impression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>. Anticipate moments of self-awareness and uncertainty at the end of a thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>. Either make your ending sound definitive or use "summary prompts" like "so to wrap up," "in summary," or "my point here is..." to guide your brain to a strong conclusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:22">[00:20:22]</a>.

3.  **Stay in Character**: Speakers often self-sabotage by "leaking" their insecurities, such as nervously laughing or admitting they're "not making sense," even when the audience doesn't perceive any issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:37">[00:21:37]</a>. This is because speakers often feel their internal anxieties are visible to everyone, but "nobody can tell people cannot see what you feel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:18">[00:22:18]</a>. Breaking character forces a negative lens onto the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>. The solution is simple: don't share your insecurities; "stay in it" and put your best foot forward from beginning to end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:43">[00:24:43]</a>. When you stay in character, you'll often receive positive feedback, reinforcing confidence and diminishing the internal "noise" of self-doubt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:34">[00:25:34]</a>. Most people speaking in meetings feel nervous, but it's rarely evident unless the nervousness is extreme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:15">[00:26:15]</a>.

## Practice Games for Public Speaking

[[importance_of_practicing_public_speaking | Improving public speaking skills]] requires active speaking practice, not just reading or watching content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:53">[00:29:53]</a>. Games are an effective way to practice because they are fun, provide intrinsic reward, and involve short, deliberate reps followed by immediate feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:06">[00:31:06]</a>. These games create "turbulence" (challenges) to highlight areas for improvement and build resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:13">[00:42:13]</a>.

### Conductor
This game helps speakers tap into different energy levels and states. The speaker is given a random topic and then shown a series of numbers (1-10) representing desired intensity levels, or "breathe" prompts for pausing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:10">[00:35:10]</a>. The goal is to adjust voice and energy to match the number, or relax and pause during "breathe" moments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:37">[00:35:37]</a>. This forces the speaker to access different "folders" of insights and memories that correspond to specific energy levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:21">[00:44:21]</a>. It demonstrates that "energy leads, emotions follow, and words fill in the gap" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:37">[00:47:37]</a>.

### Triple Step
Designed for individuals who struggle to stay on a single thought or get easily distracted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:15">[00:51:15]</a>. The speaker receives a random speech title and then, during their speech, six random words or phrases appear, which they must seamlessly integrate into their ongoing narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:50">[00:51:50]</a>. The objective is to maintain a strong direction and focus, allowing the unexpected words to work within the existing flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:47">[00:54:47]</a>. This game builds resilience and can serve as a warm-up exercise before important meetings or presentations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:19">[00:55:19]</a>.

### Conviction Prompts
This exercise focuses on developing executive presence by forcing the speaker into a state of conviction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:11">[01:10:11]</a>. The speaker receives a random topic and then specific sentence beginnings (prompts) that they must say aloud and complete naturally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:26">[01:10:26]</a>. These prompts are chosen to elicit a stronger belief in what is being said, forcing the speaker to "care more" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:46">[01:10:46]</a>. Most people need to bring more conviction to their words to ensure their ideas are heard and valued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:43">[01:11:43]</a>.

## Preparation Methods for Talks

### The Accordion Method
This method revolutionizes speech preparation by shifting from writing to speaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:26">[01:26:26]</a>. Instead of creating a lengthy script and memorizing it (which is prone to errors), the Accordion Method emphasizes speaking to create extreme clarity and identify the essence of a talk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:36">[01:26:36]</a>.

**Process:**
1.  **Initial Brain Dump**: You can start by writing down all your ideas to get them out of your head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:22">[01:28:22]</a>.
2.  **Compress (Go Down the Accordion)**: Speak for a set time (e.g., 3 minutes), adhering to "stay in character" and "end strong" rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:44">[01:28:44]</a>. Then, reduce the time constraint (e.g., 2 minutes, then 1 minute, then 30 seconds), forcing you to shave off noise and focus on the essential ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:19">[01:29:19]</a>. By 30 seconds, you'll have only the core components of your talk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:49">[01:29:49]</a>. This process provides clarity on the true purpose of your talk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:56">[01:29:56]</a>.
3.  **Expand (Go Up the Accordion)**: From the condensed version (e.g., 30 seconds), gradually increase the time constraint (e.g., back to 1 minute, 2 minutes, 3 minutes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:06">[01:30:06]</a>. With more time, you intentionally bring in aligned elements, anecdotes, or examples, building on the core <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:26">[01:30:26]</a>.

**Benefits:**
*   **Internalization, Not Memorization**: The talk becomes deeply internalized, relying on pillars and natural flow rather than rote memorization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:08">[01:31:08]</a>.
*   **Flexibility**: You can easily adapt the talk to different timeframes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:27">[01:31:27]</a>.
*   **Clarity and Intentionality**: Every element is chosen intentionally, resulting in a clear, focused, and powerful message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:07">[01:28:07]</a>.

For prepared talks, you might have four bullet points: your one core message, and three "bookmarks" or pillars to guide your speech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:01">[01:34:01]</a>.

### The Bow and Arrow Technique
This technique is a mindset shift, urging speakers to focus on "what you want your audience to remember" rather than "what you want to say" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:41">[01:38:41]</a>. Most people only remember one key thing from a talk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:02">[01:39:02]</a>.

*   **The Arrow (One Thing)**: Identify the single sentence that is the *only* thing you want your audience to remember <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:22">[01:39:22]</a>. This acts as a North Star, providing clarity for both you and your audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:42">[01:39:42]</a>.
*   **The Bow (Support)**: Add "weight" to your arrow by providing compelling anecdotes, data points, stories, or emotional elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:02">[01:40:02]</a>. These "pull the bow back" to give your arrow maximum impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:24">[01:40:24]</a>.

This technique is applicable at both macro and micro levels. For talks with slides, ask yourself "what is my one thing?" for each slide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:26">[01:42:26]</a>. The title of the slide itself can be that one key takeaway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:23">[01:43:23]</a>.

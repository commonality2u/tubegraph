Whiz, a cloud security company, achieved unprecedented growth, reaching $100 million ARR in just 18 months and over $500 million ARR within five years of its founding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:10">[03:07:10]</a>. This rapid success came despite an initial period of uncertainty and a significant [[strategies_for_pivoting_in_earlystage_companies | pivot]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>. Ros Herberg, Whiz's Chief Marketing Officer and VP of Product Strategy, shares key [[challenges_and_strategies_for_creating_successful_startups | challenges and strategies]] from the company's early days.

## The Initial Idea and the Critical Pivot

When Ros joined Whiz as the first product manager, the company was officially founded as "Beyond Networks" with an idea in the network security space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>. Despite the founders' strong background in cloud security, they initially aimed to do something different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48:00">[07:48:00]</a>.

In the initial weeks, the team held 10 to 15 meetings daily with potential customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:00">[08:22:00]</a>. While customers would say things like "sounds interesting" or "would love to hear more," Ros, as the product manager, still didn't understand exactly what they were going to build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:00">[09:16:00]</a>. This confusion, coupled with the realization that customers weren't incentivized to reveal their true disinterest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:55:00">[10:55:00]</a>, led to a crucial discussion. Ros, feeling she didn't understand the product, raised her concerns, which opened up a deep discussion among the founding team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:00">[10:07:00]</a>.

This led to a [[strategies_for_pivoting_in_earlystage_companies | pivot]] to cloud security, a domain the founding team knew best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:21:00">[18:21:00]</a>. The shift occurred about six weeks after Ros joined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

## Identifying Product-Market Fit Signals

After the [[strategies_for_pivoting_in_earlystage_companies | pivot]] to cloud security, the customer conversations fundamentally changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:37:00">[18:37:00]</a>. Instead of polite interest, customers started asking specific questions:
*   "How are you pricing this?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:14:00">[13:14:00]</a>
*   "When can we start doing a PO?" (Proof of Value) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:28:00">[13:28:00]</a>
*   "I know exactly who I need to connect you to in my team." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:31:00">[13:31:00]</a>

This indicated genuine "pull" from the customers, a strong sign of [[developing_growth_models_for_startups | product-market fit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:57:00">[20:57:00]</a>. Ros notes that initially, teams have a bias to look for affirmation rather than critical feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:51:00">[13:51:00]</a>. The shift meant actively seeking signs of *deep enthusiasm* and commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:09:00">[14:09:00]</a>.

An example of this commitment was a Fortune 10 company that, despite being asked to complete a long list of technical questions to "buy time" for Whiz to prepare its product, returned the filled-out questionnaire the very next day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:05:00">[20:05:00]</a>. This showed strong commitment and a clear desire for the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:27:00">[20:27:00]</a>.

## Founder-Led Sales in the Early Stages

In the early days of Whiz, the founding team, including Ros, personally handled sales and closed deals, even before hiring their first salesperson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:33:00">[21:33:00]</a>. They closed a couple of million in ARR this way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:36:00">[23:36:00]</a>.

Ros emphasizes a key lesson from this experience:
> "If if you can't do it one time and to end then you like the core core Core Group the chances of just bringing somebody from the outside to solve that problem it's wishful in some ways I but it never ends up that way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:53:00">[22:53:00]</a>

This approach allowed the founders to deeply understand the sales process and instilled confidence in their first sales hires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:02:00">[22:02:00]</a>.

## The Shifting "Heat" and the Role of Marketing

Ros later transitioned from VP of Product to Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) and VP of Product Strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:56:00">[23:56:00]</a>. This was an unconventional path, as she had no prior marketing experience, having spent her career in engineering and product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:16:00">[24:16:00]</a>.

Her decision to move into marketing was driven by the realization that after achieving [[developing_growth_models_for_startups | product-market fit]] and building a sales team, marketing became the next critical "block" for scaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:09:00">[27:09:00]</a>. While Whiz was winning Proof of Value (POV) against competitors, many potential customers hadn't heard of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:10:00">[25:10:00]</a>.

Ros uses a metaphor of "heat" shifting within the organization:
*   **Early days:** Heat was in product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:21:00">[28:21:00]</a> (figuring out what to build).
*   **Next:** Heat moved to engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:38:00">[28:38:00]</a> (building the product).
*   **Then:** Heat shifted to sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:51:00">[28:51:00]</a> (selling the initial product).
*   **Finally:** Heat moved to marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:58:00">[28:58:00]</a> (generating awareness and pipeline).

### Marketing Strategies for Awareness and Brand
Ros's approach to marketing is unconventional, focusing on making "a lot of noise" and taking chances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:04:00">[33:04:00]</a>. She contrasts marketing with product development:
> "Marketing is quite the opposite in my opinion there's no cost to anything no maintenance to anything no technical depth no anything like if tomorrow I post a video on Wizz LinkedIn page and I think that video is super funny and nobody likes that video nothing happened tomorrow I'll post a different video no maintenance bye-bye forgot it ever happened" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:39:00">[37:39:00]</a>

This philosophy of low-cost experimentation allowed for bold [[growth_hacking_and_strategies | growth hacking and strategies]], such as transforming Whiz's booth at the RSA security conference into a "Whiz of Oz" theme with actors like Dorothy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:52:00">[38:52:00]</a>. This starkly contrasted with the typical "red and black" cyber security booths and significantly increased traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:09:00">[39:39:00]</a>. Whiz also adopted a positive, optimistic brand with bright colors like pink and blue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:23:00">[39:23:00]</a>.

Ros believes that a CMO needs deep trust with the founding team and a profound connection to the product and market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:03:00">[35:03:00]</a>. This deep understanding helps them simplify complex technical messages for a broader audience, which she calls the "dummy explanation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:42:00">[48:42:00]</a>. She constantly reminds her team that customers don't live in the "Whiz bubble" and don't assume knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:03:00">[49:03:00]</a>.

## Culture and Leadership for Sustained Growth

Whiz fosters a flat and open organizational culture where impact is valued over seniority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:22:00">[16:22:00]</a>. Ros highlights the importance of being able to say "I don't understand" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:57:00">[15:57:57]</a>, a vulnerable act that led to Whiz's critical [[strategies_for_pivoting_in_earlystage_companies | pivot]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:00">[10:07:00]</a>. This reflects the company's trust in its employees to challenge assumptions and contribute to strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:54:00">[52:54:00]</a>.

Ros also attributes her personal career progression and willingness to take on challenging roles to being "okay with being pretty sure I'm going to fail at something and still attempting it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:19:00">[41:19:00]</a>. This mindset, cultivated since childhood, emphasizes that "friction is good" and that hard work and courage outweigh innate talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:44:00">[43:44:00]</a>. This perspective aligns with Whiz's early approach of creating "hurdles" for potential customers, ensuring true commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:27:00">[20:27:00]</a>.

## Whiz's Continued Trajectory

Whiz is now a company of approximately 1,500 employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:38:00">[53:38:00]</a>. The company continues to prioritize its independent path, believing it can become one of the biggest security companies in the world due to the rapidly growing cloud security market and its leadership position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>.

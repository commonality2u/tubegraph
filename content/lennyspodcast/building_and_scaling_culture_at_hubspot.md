HubSpot co-founder and CTO Dharmesh Shah explains how the company approached [[creating_and_maintaining_team_culture_and_passion | creating and scaling its culture]] from its earliest days, emphasizing unique and often contrarian practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

## Origins of HubSpot's Culture
The concept of "culture" was not explicitly discussed at HubSpot until about three or four years into the company's existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:12">[01:16:12]</a>. Shah's co-founder, Brian Halligan, tasked him with "doing" culture, despite Shah's self-professed unsuitability for people-centric roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:51">[01:16:51]</a>. Shah interpreted this task as articulating the existing culture, rather than creating a new one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:40">[01:17:40]</a>.

To define the culture, Shah approached it like an engineer, asking: "If I could write a Python function that would measure the probability of success of a new person coming into HubSpot, what would the factors be?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:51">[01:17:51]</a>. He conducted an internal NPS (Net Promoter Score) survey, asking employees how likely they were to recommend HubSpot as a place to work, and the reasons for their answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:56">[01:19:56]</a>. The overwhelming reason for employee happiness was "the other people at HubSpot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:22">[01:20:22]</a>. This led him to identify the attributes that defined these people, which formed the basis of the initial culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:38">[01:20:38]</a>.

The resulting 16-slide presentation was named the "Culture Code" deck, reflecting the idea of defining culture as if it were code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:48">[01:20:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:57">[01:20:57]</a>.

## Core Principles and Practices

### Culture as a Product
A central tenet of HubSpot's approach to culture is the belief that "culture is a product" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:25">[01:22:25]</a>. Every company builds two products: one for its customers and one for its team (the culture) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:31">[01:21:31]</a>.
This perspective leads to several key implications:
*   **Customer Feedback:** Just as external customer feedback is vital for product development, internal "customers" (employees) provide feedback on the culture product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:57">[01:21:57]</a>. HubSpot conducts quarterly NPS surveys for its culture product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:09">[01:22:09]</a>.
*   **Iteration and Evolution:** The job of a leader is not to preserve culture but to iterate on it, similar to how product code is continuously improved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:57">[01:22:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:02">[01:23:02]</a>. This is because employee needs change as the company scales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:53">[01:22:53]</a>.
*   **Transparency in Feedback:** All survey responses are published internally, categorized, and addressed in "All Minds" (All Hands) meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:20">[01:23:20]</a>. Leadership identifies and commits to fixing "bugs" in the culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:49">[01:23:49]</a>.
*   **Core Values vs. Adaptable Elements:** While a culture will have core values (like product values, e.g., building for SMB, ease of use) that endure, other aspects can and should change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:46">[01:25:46]</a>.
*   **Aspirational Culture:** Including aspirational elements in the culture deck, clearly marked as such, helps them become increasingly true over time as new employees join and embody those aspirations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:18">[01:29:18]</a>.

### Transparency
Transparency is a core value and "founding principle" that has endured since HubSpot's early days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:25">[00:28:25]</a>.
*   **Information Sharing:** Initially, all company information (balance sheet, capital raises, payroll status) was equally shared with every employee, with only two exceptions: illegal information (e.g., acquisitions under NDA) and salaries, as salaries are co-owned by the company and the individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>.
*   **Going Public:** When HubSpot went public, they discovered there was no legal limit to the number of "designated insiders" (those with access to financials) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:34">[00:26:34]</a>. HubSpot designated every single employee as a designated insider the day they went public, maintaining their commitment to transparency despite the "downside" of trading window restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:39">[00:26:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:01">[00:27:01]</a>. This continues today with over 7,000 employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:11">[00:27:11]</a>.
*   **Simplicity of Binary Decisions:** The decision to share everything (binary decision) was simpler than curating what to share, and this approach scaled unexpectedly well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:09">[00:34:09]</a>.

### Fighting for Simplicity
HubSpot views entropy and complexity as natural enemies of a growing company, summarizing this battle with the phrase "fight for simplicity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:01">[00:39:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:53">[00:39:53]</a>.
*   **The Second Law of Thermodynamics:** Shah applies the second law of thermodynamics (entropy increasing over time) to companies, stating that "over time, unless you intervene, everything goes to crap" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>. Companies eventually fight complexity, which can lead to a "slower death" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:01">[00:39:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:30">[00:39:30]</a>.
*   **Proactive Simplicity:** It's never too early to plant the seeds of simplicity in the culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:40">[00:39:40]</a>.
*   **Product Simplicity:** In its early years, HubSpot had a rule that for every new feature ("knob or dial") added to the product, one had to be removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:06">[00:41:06]</a>. This coarse measurement forced consideration of the "long-term cost of that complexity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:21">[00:43:21]</a>.
*   **Self-Imposed Constraints:** Building for SMBs and having a freemium product naturally limited complexity, as there wasn't an "army of people" to implement or support highly complex features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:13">[00:44:13]</a>.

### Lean into Strengths: No Direct Reports
A unique aspect of HubSpot's culture, particularly for its CTO, is Dharmesh Shah's long-standing policy of having no direct reports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">[00:37:37]</a>.
*   **Early Decision:** This was decided during the founding meeting, where Shah acknowledged he "sucked at management" and preferred to focus on what he enjoyed and was good at <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>.
*   **Personal and Company Benefit:** This arrangement has allowed Shah to leverage the benefits of a large, scaled company (making big bets, long-term planning) without the downsides of managing large teams, keeping him engaged and happy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>. It's also been productive for HubSpot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>.

### Decision Making: Debate, Decide, Unite
HubSpot strives to make better decisions through a process of "debate, decide, unite" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:17">[01:04:17]</a>.
*   **Data-Informed, Not Data-Driven:** While data is valued, it's acknowledged that "data doesn't make decisions, people do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:16">[01:03:16]</a>.
*   **Designated Responsible Individual (DRI):** For every decision, a specific person is designated as the DRI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:36">[01:03:36]</a>.
*   **Open Debate, Unified Commitment:** The process encourages open debate and exploring all options. Once a decision is made, even if individuals disagreed, the team is expected to unite around it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:25">[01:04:25]</a>. This is a "softer" variation of Amazon's "disagree and commit" principle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:02">[01:05:02]</a>.
*   **Flash Tags:** To qualify the weight of communication, Shah uses "flash tags" in emails and other media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:45">[00:58:45]</a>:
    *   `#FYI`: For your information, no response expected.
    *   `#Suggestion`: A thought to explore, no response expected, but should be considered.
    *   `#Recommendation`: Thought through, research done, a response expected if not followed.
    *   `#Plea`: A strong request, almost a mandate, but still allows for autonomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:18">[01:00:18]</a>. This maintains autonomy, as there are no true mandates at HubSpot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:20">[01:01:20]</a>.

### Early Company Practices
Some early practices, driven by simplicity and a flat organizational structure, became defining cultural elements:
*   **Fixed Salary:** For the first year to year and a half, everyone, including the founders, received a fixed salary of $5,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:56">[00:52:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:58">[00:52:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:09">[00:53:09]</a>.
*   **No Meetings Before 11 AM:** Both co-founders were "night people," leading to a rule of no meetings before 11 AM in the early years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>. Later, this evolved to "you just can't invite one of the co-founders to it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a>.
*   **Seating Lottery:** To avoid office politics around desk assignments, HubSpot implemented a "seat shuffle" lottery every time a new employee was hired in the early days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:12">[00:35:12]</a>. This evolved to a quarterly lottery with some local optimizations (e.g., engineers needing quiet) and was used for hundreds of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:24">[00:36:24]</a>. This simple solution avoided significant "grief" and fostered better chemistry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:45">[00:36:45]</a>.
*   **No Titles:** In the early years, HubSpot had no titles for employees as a manifestation of its flat organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:19">[00:30:19]</a>. However, this eventually changed to classic titles because titles serve as a "signaling device" for career progression, especially outside of HubSpot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:07">[00:31:07]</a>. Making up titles was deemed ineffective as they lacked meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:14">[00:32:14]</a>.

## Aspirational Culture
HubSpot's culture includes elements that are aspirational rather than strictly factual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:18">[01:29:18]</a>. Shah intentionally kept these aspirations in the public-facing Culture Code deck, even if they weren't entirely true at the time, reasoning that they would become "increasingly True by virtue of being in the deck" as people joined and aspired to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:43">[01:29:43]</a>.

> [!TIP] **Lessons for [[scaling_a_company_culture_while_maintaining_user_trust | Scaling a Company Culture]]**
> *   **Culture is a product**: Continuously iterate and gather feedback.
> *   **Fight complexity**: Proactively embed simplicity into systems and processes.
> *   **Lean into strengths**: Design roles and structures that allow individuals to excel where they are strong.
> *   **Be contrarian (selectively)**: Challenge conventional wisdom where high conviction meets low consensus.
> *   **Aspirational culture**: Use written principles to guide future behavior and growth.

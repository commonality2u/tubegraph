Melton Berkowitz, Head of Growth at Deel, shares insights on how to effectively utilize low-cost growth channels, particularly for B2B businesses. Deel, which grew from zero to a mind-boggling $300 million in Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) in three years while remaining EBITDA positive, kickstarted much of its early growth through these strategies. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>

## Back to Basics First
Before diving into any growth strategy, especially paid advertising, it's crucial to ensure foundational elements are solid. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:01">[00:27:01]</a>

### Website Fundamentals
*   **Presence and Speed:** Do you have a fast website that search engines recognize? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a> A successful paid ad program is impossible if your website loads in four or more seconds. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:34">[00:27:34]</a>
*   **Clarity of Pitch:** Ensure people understand what your product does. Avoid generic B2B statements that could apply to any business. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:03">[00:28:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:40">[00:28:40]</a>
*   **Technical Foundation:** Deel's first step was moving their hard-coded website to a platform that allowed for easy access and A/B testing. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:57">[00:28:57]</a>

### Core Philosophy: Adding Value
The most effective low-cost channels are often places where people are actively seeking answers to problems. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>
*   **Problem-Solving over Sales:** In the B2B world, businesses start because there's an active problem. People don't want to be sold to; they want their problems solved. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>
*   **How to Add Value:**
    *   **Ineffective Way:** Simply stating "Hey, we solved that problem, check out our website." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>
    *   **Effective Way:** Genuinely explain the solution to their problem, and then present your product as a fit. Treat the person like a friend and answer their question first. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>

## Key Low-Cost Growth Channels

### 1. Community Engagement
Melton specializes in engaging with communities to drive growth. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>
*   **Strategy:** Find online communities (like Reddit, Quora, Twitter) where your target audience is asking questions related to the problems your product solves. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>
*   **Deel's Example (Reddit):** Deel set up keyword alerts for questions related to HR or international hiring. A team member (not an automated system) would then go in and provide helpful advice. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a> This was implemented on Melton's first day at Deel. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>
*   **Impact:** While early on this was a significant part of their funnel (15%), as the company grew, its percentage contribution decreased, but the net number of people reached continued to grow. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>
*   **Important Note:** Understand the upper limit of the audience size in a community (e.g., a subreddit of 1,000 people might yield 10 customers, not 5,000). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>
*   **Closed Communities:** Consider private Slack or Discord communities, or partnerships with groups like Y Combinator, if you can gain access and provide value. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>

### 2. Search Engine Optimization (SEO)
SEO is critical for businesses solving active problems. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:27">[00:26:27]</a>
*   **The "Search Over" Principle:** When creating content, the goal is for the user's Google search to be *over* after reading your article. Search engines prioritize content that fully answers questions, so users don't have to go back to Google. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>
*   **Deel's Content Strategy:**
    *   **Operational Approach:** Deel's content team acts more as an operational team than a purely creative one, following a clear framework for what gets published. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>
    *   **Traffic Light System:**
        *   Identify up to 700 related keywords (closely or distantly related). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>
        *   Rank keywords by highest to lowest volume. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>
        *   Determine user intent for each keyword:
            *   **Green Light:** High intent, person wants your solution. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>
            *   **Yellow Light:** Medium intent, could be a future customer. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>
            *   **Red Light:** Low intent, not looking to buy (e.g., university student doing research). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>
        *   Prioritize green light keywords from highest to lowest volume. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>
    *   **Content Creation Process:**
        1.  **Understand Search Intent:** What are people trying to understand? Use Google's "People also ask" section for follow-up questions. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:18">[00:20:18]</a>
        2.  **Match Google's Results:** Be aware of what Google currently services for a keyword (e.g., "EOR" might mean Enhanced Oil Recovery, not Employer of Record). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>
        3.  **Simplicity & Keywords:** Ensure content is easy to understand (e.g., 4th-grade reading level) and uses relevant keywords naturally. Tools like Clearscope can help. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:37">[00:21:37]</a>
*   **Deel's SEO Example:** They excel at explaining "what an EOR (Employer of Record) is and isn't," covering downsides and when not to use it, to fully satisfy the search intent. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>
*   **Operational Volume:** Deel's content team produces about five new articles and five article updates per week across multiple languages. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>
*   **Commitment:** SEO requires consistent, time-consuming effort. Trying to automate or cut corners results in low-quality resources that don't rank. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:23">[00:23:23]</a>

### 3. Strategic Partnerships
Partnering effectively means choosing partners who are trusted resources for your target audience. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:18">[00:35:18]</a>
*   **Beyond Audience Overlap:** It's not enough to share an audience; your partner must be a trusted guide when your audience has the problem you solve. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:29">[00:35:29]</a>
*   **Deel's Example (Venture Capital Partners):** Venture Capital firms are ideal partners because founders often ask them for recommendations on platforms to use when expanding their team after receiving funding. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:35">[00:35:35]</a>

### 4. Paid Ads (After Foundations are Set)
Once basic infrastructure and organic channels are strong, paid ads can be scaled.
*   **Long-Tail Strategy:** After covering major ad platforms (Google, Facebook), focus on "long-tail" places that individually contribute less, but cumulatively diversify lead flow (e.g., review sites, newsletter ads, podcast ads). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:37">[00:29:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:04">[00:30:04]</a>
*   **Creative Fatigue:** Regularly update ad creatives (e.g., monthly) to combat creative fatigue. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:39">[00:40:39]</a>
*   **Messaging Evolution:** Ensure ad messaging evolves with product changes. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:58">[00:40:58]</a>
*   **Full Funnel Tracking:** Track not just leads generated, but how many convert to clients and the revenue generated over time. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:10">[00:41:10]</a> This allows for proper calculation of payback period and informed spending decisions. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:38">[00:41:38]</a>

## Role of Product in Growth
Acquisition channels won't work if the product doesn't live up to expectations. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:32">[00:42:32]</a>
*   **Quality is Core:** A strong product that users find valuable and want to keep using is fundamental. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:15">[00:42:15]</a>
*   **Team Composition:** At early-stage companies, a disproportionately large sales team compared to engineers might indicate a weak product that won't sustain long-term growth. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:04">[00:44:04]</a>

## Deel's Growth During COVID-19
While Deel started before the pandemic, COVID-19 accelerated the world's adoption of remote work, which aligned with Deel's vision of a global work platform. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:41">[00:44:41]</a> This forced people to test the hypothesis of not being in the same room as colleagues. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:07">[00:45:07]</a> Many companies that went back to offices still ended up with global teams, necessitating Deel's solution for global payroll and hiring. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:31">[00:45:31]</a>

## Building the Growth Team
Melton emphasizes hiring individuals who are willing to commit to revenue goals and do the "dirty work." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:32">[00:47:32]</a>
*   **Commitment to Revenue:** Candidates should be willing to commit to closed-won revenue Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), not just lead numbers. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:38">[00:47:38]</a>
*   **"Little Hands" Mentality:** Deel values a culture where no matter their position, employees are willing to get into the "nitty-gritty" work. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:36">[00:48:36]</a>
*   **Hiring Sequence:** Deel's early growth team hires included:
    1.  **Product Marketing Lead:** To bridge product and go-to-market teams and set messaging. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:47">[00:51:47]</a>
    2.  **Copywriter:** To refine messaging and tone. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:02">[00:52:02]</a>
    3.  **Data Analyst:** To ensure every dollar spent was tracked and understood, even if considered "too early" by some. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:10">[00:52:10]</a>
*   **Team Structure:** Deel utilizes both functional and regional teams:
    *   **Functional Teams:** Subject matter experts (e.g., product marketing, content, paid ads, brand) whose location doesn't matter. This allows for focused expertise and faster skill leveling. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:54">[00:52:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:50">[00:53:50]</a>
    *   **Regional Teams:** Marketing managers focused on specific regions with local expertise, who then collaborate with functional teams to execute strategies. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:17">[00:53:17]</a>

## Deel's Culture: Deal Speed and Default Optimism
Deel's culture emphasizes two main components: what team members bring, and what the company gives back. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:13">[00:55:13]</a>
*   **Team Member Contributions:**
    *   **Deal Speed:** Act with urgency to solve customer problems, whether it's answering a query in 24 hours or building a product feature ten times faster than competitors. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:26">[00:55:26]</a>
    *   **Default Optimism:** Maintain a positive outlook and ask "how can this be done?" rather than focusing on why it won't work. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:09">[00:56:09]</a>
    *   **Customer Care:** Recognize that dealing with payroll and hiring is incredibly personal, affecting people's livelihoods and businesses legally. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:35">[00:56:35]</a>
*   **Company Giveback:**
    *   **Flexibility:** Employees choose how and when they work, and from where, as long as they deliver results. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:23">[00:57:23]</a>
*   **Values Development:** Deel's values were formalized about a year into the company's existence, crystallizing existing cultural practices and common phrases (e.g., "deal speed"). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:08">[00:58:08]</a>

## Remote Work at Deel
Deel has been a remote-first company from day one, even before the pandemic. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:32">[01:03:32]</a>
*   **Authenticity:** Remote work allowed team members to show up as their authentic selves, sharing glimpses of their home lives (pets, partners), fostering camaraderie before meeting in person. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:40">[01:04:40]</a>
*   **Early Experience:** Melton herself worked at Deel for a year and a half before meeting many team members in person at a conference. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:35">[01:03:35]</a> This didn't hinder their rapid growth, which reached over $50 million ARR before many in-person meetings occurred. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:45">[01:03:45]</a>
*   **Focus on Core:** Due to being a "pandemic business," some non-essential elements like company swag were deprioritized until later stages (e.g., reaching a billion dollars in valuation). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:06">[01:04:06]</a>

## Final Thoughts on Growth
Growth, while often perceived as difficult, is relatively straightforward when focusing on first principles: identify where your audience is, add value, and ensure your product delivers on its promise. It requires discipline but is not "rocket science." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:32">[01:05:32]</a>

In the realm of [[product_management_roles_and_overhiring | product management]], understanding the balance between output and impact is crucial for career growth and effectiveness. Vikr Diwan, a prominent product leader in Asia, outlines a "three Ws" framework for career growth in product management: "what you produce," "what you bring to the table," and "what's your [[the_operating_model_in_product_management | operating model]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

## What You Produce: Focusing on Output and Execution

Early in a product management career, the primary focus should be on "what you produce," specifically tangible outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. This means concentrating on getting tasks done and shipping products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>, rather than immediately obsessing over grand strategy or vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.

Examples of outputs include:
*   Launching a product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>
*   Analyzing and running an experiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>
*   Contributing to a go-to-market strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>
*   Sourcing content for a homepage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>
*   Preparing briefs, slides for leadership reviews, or legal reviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>

As a product manager gains experience and comfort with outputs, they begin to influence "outcomes" by determining which outputs are necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. This naturally leads to leadership and directional responsibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. Even at senior levels, it's vital not to lose touch with the "Individual Contributor (IC) roots" and to continue working on outputs, as this builds rapport and credibility within the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. The core idea is to "be useful" to the team, manager, and company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Don't be a "Mini CEO" too early
> When starting out, a product manager has not "earned the right to inform strategy and vision" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>. The initial focus should be on [[executing_strategy_effectively_in_product_management | getting stuff done]] effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>. This mindset is important even for senior individuals starting with a new team or company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>.

## What You Bring to the Table: Impact on Impact

The second "W" focuses on "your impact on impact" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>. It's not enough for a product to succeed; a product manager must clearly demonstrate their contribution to that success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>.

This involves:
*   Producing high-quality artifacts, such as PRDs (Product Requirement Documents), product notes, product strategy documents, and design briefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a>. These artifacts demonstrate skill in areas like data and metrics, design and research, technology, and strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>.
*   Moving beyond mere arguments or pushbacks to channeling questions, inputs, and direction into strategic choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>.
*   Having a "detail-orientedness" and ensuring high quality in all created documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>. The aim is to create an "aura of I got this" so that colleagues trust tasks assigned to you will be completed well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>.

## Your Operating Model: Collaboration and Decision Making

The third and often most crucial "W" is "what's your [[the_operating_model_in_product_management | operating model]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>. This refers to effective communication, collaboration, organizational, and community skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>. Product managers, often mistakenly perceived as "mini CEOs," must understand they are one part of a larger team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>.

Key tenets for effective [[decision_making_in_product_management | decision making in product management]] include:
1.  Raise difficult issues without being difficult to work with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a>.
2.  Bring out important topics without drawing importance to yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>.
3.  Be in charge of getting decisions made, not making all the decisions yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>.

To successfully push back on ideas, a product manager should aim to bring the conversation from an emotional to a logical space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:53">[00:25:53]</a>. The goal is to be seen as someone who adds value and helps advance the product, rather than an obstacle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a>.

## Common Pitfalls and Growth Strategies

Career growth can be impeded by:
*   **Focusing on what you cannot control**: Mid-senior product managers often shift their focus from personal learning and growth to organizational issues or external factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:45">[00:28:45]</a>. It's crucial to redirect focus to areas within one's control, such as improving skills in data, technology, communication, or design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:10">[00:29:10]</a>.
*   **Relationship with change**: As individuals become mid-senior, their "rate of change" in skills can slow down, impacting growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:28">[00:30:28]</a>. To counter this, continuously benchmark oneself against industry bests, not just within the organization, to identify areas for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:09">[00:31:09]</a>.
*   **How you see yourself**: The stories product managers tell themselves about their attributes (e.g., "high agency," "hyper collaborative") can become self-limiting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a>. For example, a "high agency" PM might feel it's okay to be brash or cut corners, while a "hyper collaborative" PM might avoid being decisive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:36">[00:32:36]</a>. Recognizing and correcting these internal narratives, often with feedback from trusted individuals, is essential for continued [[coaching_and_mentoring_in_product_management | growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:10">[00:33:10]</a>.

### Practical Steps for Skill Development
To improve skills and foster growth, product managers should:
*   **Be open to feedback**: Actively listen to and act on feedback, viewing it as a gift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:35">[00:39:35]</a>.
*   **Pick a focus area**: Rather than trying to improve everything at once, identify one or two areas with the highest leverage for growth. For example, if from a design background, focus on data or tech; if from data/tech, focus on design/research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:07">[00:41:07]</a>. Soft skills like communication and collaboration are lifelong learning journeys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>.
*   **Embrace the "learner" mindset**: Continuously interacting with smarter people, reading books, and consuming educational content helps stay grounded and foster a hunger for learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:51">[00:35:51]</a>.

## Defining the Product Manager Role

The [[navigating_ambiguity_in_the_product_management_role | ambiguity of the product manager role]] can be a source of confusion. A product manager's primary responsibility is to work on anything that is blocking the progress of the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:06">[00:48:06]</a>. The role combines art and science, with frameworks providing the science to refine the art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:09">[00:49:09]</a>.

The product manager is a co-collaborator across various disciplines:
*   **Data** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:31">[00:49:31]</a>
*   **Design and Research** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:44">[00:49:44]</a>
*   **Technology** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:42">[00:49:42]</a>
*   **Strategy** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:41">[00:49:41]</a>
*   **Communication** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:04">[00:52:04]</a>
*   **Collaboration** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:06">[00:52:06]</a>
*   **Organizational skills** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:08">[00:52:08]</a>
*   **Community** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:08">[00:52:08]</a>

The PM is the "community enabler" that ties everyone together toward a common mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:28">[00:52:28]</a>. The role is less about the title and more about playing a role that clarifies things and elevates the team's overall contribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:20">[00:51:20]</a>.

> [!TIP] It's Never Too Late
> It's never too late to pursue what you want to do or be in your career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:47">[01:08:47]</a>. Even if you start late or work in smaller settings, consistent effort and dedication to [[trust_building_and_impact_focus_in_product_management | growth]] can lead to significant success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:31">[01:08:31]</a>.

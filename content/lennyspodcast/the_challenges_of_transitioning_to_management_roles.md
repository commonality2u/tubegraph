Nikhail Singhall, a product leader at Meta, highlights the significant [[evolving_team_structures_and_management_skills | challenges in transitioning to management roles]], particularly within the tech industry. He notes that the industry often fails to adequately train its managers, leading to widespread issues and a lack of preparedness among those stepping into leadership positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:14">[00:35:14]</a>.

## Why Managers Often Struggle

Singhall describes the lack of formal training for managers in tech as a "massive epidemic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:17">[00:36:17]</a>. The prevailing assumption is that if someone is a good coder, they're ready to manage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:46">[00:35:46]</a>, or if they can talk, they can product manage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:53">[00:35:53]</a>, or if they can ship a product, they should tell others what to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:58">[00:35:58]</a>. This creates a disconnect between the skills required for building products and the skills needed to teach people how to build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:03">[00:36:03]</a>.

Common pitfalls for new managers include:
*   **Misunderstanding the "steering wheel" concept** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:19">[00:37:19]</a>: New managers often think management is about dividing and conquering, or teaching someone to ride a bike by holding on and then letting go <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:34">[00:37:34]</a>. However, Singhall likens it more to being in the sidecar of a motorcycle â€“ attached but having a specific role of giving counsel while the other person drives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:51">[00:37:51]</a>. The key is understanding how to truly share responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:06">[00:38:06]</a>.
*   **Managing without an invitation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:18">[00:38:18]</a>: Managers often operate from a place of organizational power, rather than earning the right to manage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:21">[00:38:21]</a>. It's crucial to be invited in by direct reports, like a "vampire knocking on the door" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:36">[00:38:36]</a>. This means asking how you can help and waiting for them to invite you to assist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:01">[00:39:01]</a>. Once invited, focus on specific areas of partnership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:40">[00:39:40]</a>.

## Advice for New Managers

Given the industry's shortcomings in management training, Singhall emphasizes self-service learning tools and community as vital resources for new managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:08">[00:46:08]</a>.

### The Power of Community
He suggests that all product managers, especially new managers, should be part of an active community where they can be authentic and safe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:09">[00:47:09]</a>. This allows individuals to realize they are not alone in their [[challenges in product management | problems]] and to share best practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:33">[00:46:33]</a>. Such communities offer a powerful propellant for learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:26">[00:47:26]</a>, which may be more impactful than formal learning and development departments within organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:44">[00:36:44]</a>.

Singhall created a community called "The Skip" specifically for Chief Product Officers (CPOs), recognizing that being a leader can be a lonely job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:26">[00:48:26]</a>. This community fosters trust and allows members to share dilemmas and find solutions together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:17">[00:49:17]</a>. While the CPO community is selective, the broader concept of community learning is highly recommended for all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:20">[00:51:20]</a>.

### Managing Meeting Operating Systems
A practical tip for new leaders, especially when they have low context about a new company or product, is to focus on the "meeting operating system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:49">[01:19:49]</a>. This involves treating meetings like a product, with versions and regular feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:14">[01:20:14]</a>. By structuring meetings, defining discussions, attendees, and decision-making processes, new leaders can identify inefficiencies that those ingrained in the system cannot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:09">[01:21:09]</a>. This prioritizes process, which then positively impacts people and product outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:21">[01:21:21]</a>.

Gustav Alstromer, a Group Partner at Y Combinator, highlights key pitfalls that lead to early-stage startup failures, drawing from his experience working with over 600 companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">01:22:00</a>. He emphasizes that the most common [[common_startup_challenges_and_failure_points | reason companies fail]] is remarkably simple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">00:00:00</a>, and often boils down to a core principle: make things people want <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">00:00:22</a>.

## Failure to Talk to Users and Find Product-Market Fit
The primary reason companies fail is that they do not talk to users, which prevents them from finding product-market fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">00:00:05</a>. If product-market fit isn't found, nothing else truly matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">00:00:10</a>. This fundamental mistake involves not learning whether what you're building is actually useful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">00:00:19</a>.

> "If I drill down like what makes companies fail it's it's quite simple it's just like they don't talk to users which means they don't find proc Market fit and if they don't find product Market fit like nothing else really matters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">00:00:00</a>

**Advice:**
*   Y Combinator's early program pushes founders to share customer conversations, what they learned, and details about their users' existing tools, problems, and the intensity of those problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:21">00:23:21</a>.
*   Watch users, or have them screen share and walk you through their daily workflow to truly understand their pain, rather than just asking them how difficult a task is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:55">00:32:55</a>.
*   Paul Graham's advice to Airbnb founders, "Why are you talking to me and not in New York right now talking to them?", highlights the importance of being with your customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:26">00:27:26</a>. This inspired the article "Do Things That Don't Scale" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:37">00:27:37</a>.
*   Successful founders talk to a large volume of customers (e.g., 100-200) to understand their needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:21">00:28:21</a>.

### Fear of Talking to Customers
Many founders, especially technical ones, are afraid to talk to customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:52">00:23:52</a>. They fear rejection, mistakenly believing that if someone doesn't use their product, they hate it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:27">00:29:27</a>. However, most people are indifferent; they're busy and don't care enough to remember or hate a product they tried once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:58">00:29:58</a>.

**Advice:**
*   Internalize that indifference is the most common reaction, not hate, and people will give you a second chance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:11">00:30:11</a>.
*   Understand that only about 10% of any customer group are early adopters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:47">00:24:47</a>. Finding these early adopters takes significant effort and reaching out to many people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:51">00:24:51</a>.
*   The early outreach is essentially sales, so founders need to overcome the fear of rejection inherent in that process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">00:24:27</a>.

## Not Being Technical Enough or Having a Technical Co-founder
Another common mistake for early-stage startups, particularly outside of YC, is not being technical or understanding what it truly takes to build a successful technology company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:24">00:25:24</a>.

*   This often manifests as not valuing engineering, such as a non-technical founder taking 90% equity and offering only 10% to an engineer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:29">00:35:29</a>.
*   Relying solely on hired engineers or contracting teams is generally not effective, as product development requires continuous iteration and deep understanding of engineering decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:30">00:36:30</a>.

**Advice:**
*   Learn to value the engineering piece of the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:23">00:35:23</a>.
*   Seek out technical co-founders. Many technical people are looking for business co-founders who can handle sales and fundraising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50">00:35:50</a>.
*   Alternatively, non-technical founders can learn to code enough to build a prototype and understand the value and process of engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:57">00:36:57</a>.

## Approaching a Startup as a "Career Step"
Starting a company should not be viewed as merely a career step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">00:14:27</a>.

*   If successful, it becomes an entire career, often 10 years or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">00:14:37</a>.
*   If unsuccessful, it's not generally something people aspire to put on their resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">00:14:44</a>.
*   Founders with significant financial, family, or relationship constraints should carefully consider starting a company, as it demands immense dedication and is much harder than a normal job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">00:15:28</a>.

## Focusing on Strategy Over Execution
For small startups, focusing on "strategy" is a [[common_pitfalls_in_strategic_planning | common misconception]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:31">00:53:31</a>. Strategy is more relevant for large corporations that can pursue multiple initiatives simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:41">00:53:41</a>.

**Advice:**
*   Early-stage startups can only do one thing at a time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:43">00:53:43</a>.
*   Good founders are execution-oriented, maintaining one clear priority and continuously working towards it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:10">00:54:10</a>.
*   Before product-market fit, the strategy *is* getting people to want your product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:27">00:54:27</a>.

## Confusing External Validation with Product-Market Fit
Founders often mistake external validation—such as being accepted into an accelerator like YC, or receiving investment—for having product-market fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:41">00:26:41</a>.

**Advice:**
*   Y Combinator reminds new batches on day one that almost none of them have product-market fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:59">00:26:59</a>.
*   The most important thing is talking to customers and learning what truly matters to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:09">00:27:09</a>.

## Not Having a Clear Decision-Making Process
In small founding teams, lacking a defined process for making decisions can lead to inefficiency and re-hashing discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:37">00:55:37</a>.

**Advice:**
*   The founding team needs to agree on how decisions will be made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:21">00:56:21</a>.
*   Regardless of whether it's more autocratic or collaborative, the key is to have a process and adhere to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:46">00:55:46</a>. Decisions should be made on short sprints (weekly or bi-weekly), and everyone should feel good about the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:07">00:56:07</a>.

## Starting with a "Growth Team Mindset" Too Early
While a growth mindset is crucial for scaling, applying it too early can be a [[common_misconceptions_in_growth_strategies | mistake]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:44">00:57:44</a>.

**Advice:**
*   Early on, the focus should be on "doing things that don't scale" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:58">00:57:58</a>. This involves unscalable, high-touch interactions to deeply understand customer needs and build a product they truly want <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:01">00:58:01</a>.
*   A scalable distribution strategy becomes critical once a product is working and has achieved initial traction (e.g., 1,000 sign-ups a day) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:19">00:57:19</a>.

In summary, the most common [[common_startup_challenges_and_failure_points | challenges and strategies in early-stage startup growth]] revolve around customer focus, technical capability, and a relentless, execution-oriented approach. [[practical_advice_for_earlystage_founders | Successful founders]] prioritize deeply understanding and serving their users above all else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:11">00:26:11</a>.

At 37signals, co-founder and CEO Jason Fried champions a unique approach to business, emphasizing efficiency, profitability, and small, focused teams over rapid, venture-fueled growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. This philosophy contrasts sharply with the "go big or go home" mentality often prevalent in the tech industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## The 37signals Model

37signals, known for products like Basecamp and HEY, operates without investors or a board, has no plans to go public, and never intends to sell the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. Key aspects of their model include:
*   **Consistent Profitability** The company has been profitable for 24 consecutive years, making tens of millions of dollars in profit annually, a feat most venture-backed companies never achieve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. They prioritize making more money than they spend, maintaining healthy margins to allow for experimentation and enjoyment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.
*   **Lean Team Size** With only about 75 employees, 37signals serves over 100,000 customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. This contrasts sharply with competitors like Asana (1,600 employees), ClickUp (1,000 employees), and Slack (2,500 employees), which often have similar customer bases but generally lack profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.
*   **Focus on Efficiency, Not Growth** Unlike many companies driven by aggressive growth targets, 37signals focuses on [[staying_lean_and_efficient_in_business | efficiency]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. This means avoiding unnecessary complexities like multiple product versions, tiered pricing for enterprise clients, or large sales teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.
*   **Strategic Constraints** Fried believes that constraints, such as small teams and limited cash, often lead to better outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. Having too much money can lead to "sloppiness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:55">[01:16:55]</a> and the temptation to hire more people and spend heavily on marketing, which deters [[staying_lean_and_efficient_in_business | scrappiness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:38">[01:20:38]</a>.
*   **"Stay-Up" Mentality** Instead of being a "startup" focused on rapid growth and exit, 37signals embodies a "stay-up" philosophy, emphasizing endurance and long-term sustainability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>. Fried sees entrepreneurship as a job he wants to keep doing, creating a company he enjoys working at <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:59">[01:02:59]</a>.

## Product Development with Small Teams

37signals employs a unique product development framework called "Shape Up," detailed in their free book at basecamp.com/shapeup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:50">[00:33:50]</a>. This methodology emphasizes:
*   **Six-Week Cycles** Instead of time estimates, projects are allocated a fixed "appetite" of no more than six weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:03">[00:34:03]</a>. This prevents projects from dragging on indefinitely, a common source of demoralization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:11">[00:37:11]</a>.
*   **Two-Person Teams** Each feature or project is developed by a maximum of two people: one programmer and one designer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. This avoids the complexity, slow decision-making, and indecision common in larger project teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.
*   **Shaping the Work** Work is "shaped" ahead of time, providing a clear idea of what needs to be done, but teams are given latitude to determine *how* to achieve it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:20">[00:35:20]</a>.
*   **Cooldown Periods** After each six-week cycle, a two-week "cool down" period allows team members to work on minor improvements, fix bugs, or explore ideas that aren't tied to the main cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:49">[00:42:49]</a>. This prevents burnout from continuous "sprints" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:39">[00:43:39]</a>.

## Decision-Making and Culture

*   **Intuition and Gut Feeling** Fried openly admits to making decisions based on intuition, gut feeling, and judgment, rather than solely relying on data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:14">[00:44:14]</a>. He believes that even data-driven decisions ultimately involve human judgment, influenced by thousands of undescribable factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00">[00:45:00]</a>.
*   **Hiring for Instinct** When [[hiring_and_team_management_philosophy_in_tech_startups | hiring]] designers and product people, Fried looks for individuals with strong taste, admiration for good products, and the ability to "riff on the spot" with ideas, indicating a well-developed gut instinct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:08">[00:51:08]</a>.
*   **Avoiding War Metaphors** 37signals consciously avoids military and "war" metaphors in business, such as "conquering markets" or "destroying competition" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:55">[01:09:55]</a>. This is done to foster a mindset of creation, pride, and excitement rather than destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:14">[01:11:14]</a>.
*   **"Play" in Product Development** Fried encourages a sense of "play" in product development, allowing for exploration and experimentation with designs and ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:50">[00:54:50]</a>.

## The Path of Bootstrapping

For entrepreneurs considering the [[staying_lean_and_efficient_in_business | bootstrapping]] route, Fried advises:
*   **Control Costs** The most controllable factor in business is costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:18">[01:12:18]</a>. Keep expenses incredibly low, avoiding unnecessary spending on branding or office space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:11">[01:13:11]</a>.
*   **Self-Reliance First** Figure out how to do as much as possible on your own before bringing in a second person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:41">[01:12:41]</a>.
*   **Embrace Simplicity** While business is hard, things are relatively simple until you intentionally make them complicated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:52">[01:13:52]</a>.
*   **Practice Making Money** Bootstrapping forces entrepreneurs to practice the fundamental skill of making money, leading to greater proficiency over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:51">[01:18:51]</a>.
*   **Negative Visualization** Be at peace with the worst-case scenario. This acceptance allows businesses to move forward and take risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:46">[01:14:46]</a>.

## "Once" Products: A New Direction

37signals is now venturing into "Once" products, a line of non-SaaS business software where customers pay once, download the software, and install it on their own servers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:32">[01:24:32]</a>. This is a deliberate shift from the prevalent subscription model, anticipating a market turn away from [[scaling_and_automating_business_processes | subscription fatigue]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:56">[01:23:56]</a>. The first "Once" product will be a relaunch of Campfire, their original group chat tool from 2006, offered as an alternative to expensive, subscription-based chat tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:01">[01:27:01]</a>. These products will prioritize core functionality, be built quickly by small teams, and even include the source code for customization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:19">[01:29:19]</a>.

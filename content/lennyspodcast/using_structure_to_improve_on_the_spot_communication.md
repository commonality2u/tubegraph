Matt Abrahams, a professor at Stanford University's Graduate School of Business and host of the *Think Fast Talk Smart* podcast, emphasizes the critical role of structure in [[Effective spontaneous speaking techniques | improving spontaneous speaking]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:54">[01:13:54]</a>. The majority of our daily communication is spontaneous, rather than prepared talks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>, making this skill a "superpower" for career growth, meetings, and leading teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. The good news is that with help, anyone can get better at it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>.

## The Importance of Structure in Spontaneous Speaking

When speaking spontaneously, many people tend to "spew out information" or itemize details, taking the audience on their own journey of discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:33">[00:36:33]</a>. However, human brains are not wired for lists; they are wired for story and the logical connection of ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:13">[00:37:13]</a>. A structure provides a clear beginning, middle, and end, acting as a package of information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:23">[00:37:23]</a>.

By using a structure, the burden of thinking "what to say" and "how to say it" is halved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:52">[00:37:52]</a>. It's like having a recipe: if you have a recipe and good ingredients, you can cook a good meal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:01">[00:38:01]</a>.

## Key Structures for On-the-Spot Communication

Abrahams highlights several fundamental structures that can be applied to various spontaneous speaking situations:

### 1. Problem-Solution-Benefit (PSB)
This common structure, often seen in advertising, presents a problem, how it's solved (e.g., with a product or service), and the resulting benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:33">[00:37:33]</a>. It provides a logical flow of ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:44">[00:37:44]</a>.

### 2. PREP (Point, Reason, Example, Point)
The PREP structure helps to deliver a concise and impactful message:
*   **Point**: State your main point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:40">[00:38:40]</a>.
*   **Reason**: Provide a reason for your point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:42">[00:38:42]</a>.
*   **Example**: Offer a specific example to support your reason <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:43">[00:38:43]</a>.
*   **Point**: Restate or review your main point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:45">[00:38:45]</a>.
This is particularly useful in scenarios like product team discussions: "Here's what I think, here's why, here's an example, and let me just remind you again what the point I'm making" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:53">[00:38:53]</a>.

### 3. What, So What, Now What
This three-question structure is highly effective for broader updates, presentations, or feedback sessions, especially in a product team context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:02">[00:39:02]</a>:
*   **What**: Describe your product, service, update, or feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:05">[00:39:05]</a>.
*   **So What**: Explain why this is important and relevant to the audience, company, or clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:15">[00:39:15]</a>.
*   **Now What**: Outline what comes next or what actions should be taken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:24">[00:39:24]</a>.
Packaging information this way makes it more digestible and memorable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:42">[00:39:42]</a>.

## Applying Structures to Specific Situations

### Giving Feedback
Feedback should be viewed as an opportunity to problem-solve collaboratively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:53">[00:52:53]</a>. Instead of simply bestowing an opinion, invite the other person to work together on the issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:11">[00:53:11]</a>.

The **What, So What, Now What** structure is useful for feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:57">[00:53:57]</a>. For example, if someone speaks too quickly during a presentation:
*   **What**: "When you talked about the implementation plan, you spoke a little quicker than you did with the other parts and you didn't go into the same level of detail." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:08">[00:54:08]</a>
*   **So What**: "When you speak quickly without a lot of detail, people might think you're not as prepared or you're really concerned about this part." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:16">[00:54:16]</a>
*   **Now What**: "Next time, I suggest you slow down and include these two or three bits of data so that people see you really are knowledgeable on this area." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:23">[00:54:23]</a>

Another robust structure for feedback is the **Four I's**:
*   **Information**: Set the context for the feedback, making it clear what behavior is being addressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:04">[00:55:04]</a>.
*   **Impact**: Share the impact of the behavior on you, the feedback giver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:10">[00:55:10]</a>.
*   **Invitation**: Invite the other person to discuss or address the issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:15">[00:55:15]</a>.
*   **Implications/Consequences**: Discuss the potential benefits or negative consequences of addressing/not addressing the behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:17">[00:55:17]</a>.

### Toasts and Tributes
Often the most frequent public speaking event, toasts (including work tributes) can be improved with the **WHAT** acronym <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:06">[00:57:06]</a>:
*   **W - Why are we here**: State the purpose of the gathering, especially in a work context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:23">[00:57:23]</a>.
*   **H - How are you connected**: Briefly explain your relationship to the event or person being honored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:42">[00:57:42]</a>.
*   **A - Anecdote**: Tell a relevant, accessible, and concise story or example. This is where the core content and emotion of the toast can be conveyed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:03">[00:58:03]</a>. Showing emotion through anecdotes is more impactful than simply stating feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:11">[01:02:11]</a>.
*   **T - Thanks/Gratitude**: Express appreciation and signal closure, perhaps with a "cheers" or similar phrase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:18">[00:58:18]</a>.

Remember to **be brief**; nobody has ever complained about a toast that was too short <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:31">[00:59:31]</a>.

### Q&A (Question & Answer)
View Q&A sessions as an opportunity to extend, expand, connect, and learn, even in hostile situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:08">[01:03:08]</a>. Avoid common pitfalls like saying "good question" to every query or "does that make sense?" at the end of every answer, as these can come across as time-buying or insecure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:39">[01:03:39]</a>. Instead, ask "Did I answer your question?" or "Can I tell you more?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:02">[01:04:02]</a>.

Use the **ADD** structure for answering questions:
*   **Answer**: Provide a clean and concise answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:08">[01:07:08]</a>.
*   **Detailed Example**: Give a specific example to reinforce your answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:10">[01:07:10]</a>.
*   **Describe Relevance**: Explain the significance or relevance of your answer to the audience. Don't assume people will connect the dots themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:12">[01:07:12]</a>.

### Apologizing
When apologizing, take responsibility for the transgression itself, not just how it made someone feel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:40">[01:07:40]</a>. Use the **AAA** structure:
*   **Acknowledge**: State exactly what you did wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:18">[01:08:18]</a>.
*   **Appreciate**: Express appreciation for the difficulty or negative impact your action might have caused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:36">[01:08:36]</a>.
*   **Amend**: Propose a specific action you will take to remedy the situation or prevent it from happening again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:44">[01:08:44]</a>.

## General Principles for Improving Spontaneous Communication

*   **Prepare to be Spontaneous**: Just as athletes or jazz musicians practice extensively to perform spontaneously, you must prepare to be spontaneous in communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>. This preparation involves addressing both mindset and the actual messaging through structure and focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:49">[00:35:49]</a>.
*   **Repetition, Reflection, and Feedback**: The only way to get better at communication is through consistent practice.
    *   **Repetition**: Regularly apply these structures in different situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:42">[00:41:42]</a>.
    *   **Reflection**: Think about what worked and what didn't after a communication event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:46">[00:41:46]</a>.
    *   **Feedback**: Seek input from others, as we are not always the best judges of our own communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:48">[00:41:48]</a>.

### Resources for Practice:
*   **Toastmasters**: A wonderful organization primarily designed to provide practice opportunities for public speaking, including specific "Table Topics" for [[Effective spontaneous speaking techniques | on-the-spot speaking]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:35">[00:42:35]</a>.
*   **Improvisation Classes**: Improv focuses on being present, collaborative, and open, teaching valuable skills for [[Improving communication skills | communication]] beyond just comedy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:49">[00:42:49]</a>.
*   **University Extension Classes**: Many universities offer continuing studies or extension classes on [[Improving communication skills | communication skills]] that are open to the public, often virtually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:11">[00:43:11]</a>.

By consciously adopting and practicing these structures, individuals can significantly enhance their [[Effective spontaneous speaking techniques | on-the-spot communication]] skills, becoming more clear, confident, and impactful communicators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:54">[01:05:54]</a>.

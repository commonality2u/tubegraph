When seeking employment, individuals should adopt a focused approach, akin to using a "spear and not a net" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This philosophy, which mirrors how a product person thinks about new products, emphasizes a narrow, clear focus rather than a "spray and pray" method common when people are laid off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:32">[00:31:32]</a>.

## The Role of Job Search Councils

A powerful method for job searching involves joining or forming [[job_search_councils | Job Search Councils]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. These are support groups consisting of six to eight job seekers who commit to supporting each other throughout the job search process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:48">[02:57:48]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.

### Benefits of Job Search Councils
*   **Flipping Anxiety to Hope**: Placing anxious people together and encouraging openness and vulnerability can transform fear into hope, motivation, accountability, and confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:03">[04:01:03]</a>.
*   **Accountability and Support**: Councils help job seekers bounce ideas, provide support, and maintain accountability, especially when emotional energy is low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:37">[01:37:37]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>.
*   **Community and Connection**: In a world of increasing loneliness, these councils foster real community, offering a sense of belonging and support during challenging times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:54">[01:26:54]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>.
*   **Faster Job Search**: Data suggests that the average job search within a Job Search Council is approximately three months, which is at the lower end of the national average of three to six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:25">[02:25:25]</a>.
*   **Free and Volunteer-Driven**: Over 2,000 councils have been launched, operating completely free of charge, supported by 20,000 hours of volunteer work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:15:00">[09:15:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:00">[09:37:00]</a>. Funds from book sales are reinvested to support their operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:00">[09:56:00]</a>.

### Joining a Council
Individuals can apply at Phil.org. They are separated into "slow seekers" (employed but looking) and "fast seekers" (unemployed) to match different cadences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:48:00">[10:48:00]</a>. Volunteering as a moderator offers faster matching and additional training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:12:00">[11:12:00]</a>. After matching, participants go through an orientation and receive a free 100-page workbook with templates and guides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:46:00">[11:46:00]</a>. Councils typically meet twice a week for fast seekers and every two weeks for slow seekers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:11:00">[12:11:00]</a>.

## Candidate Market Fit

Understanding your candidate market fit is crucial for a successful job search, especially in a down market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:29:49">[20:29:49]</a>. This concept helps job seekers understand that market conditions, not personal worth, influence job opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:44:00">[21:44:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:55:00">[21:55:00]</a>.

### Steps to Determine Candidate Market Fit
1.  **Manukan Two-Pager**: Begin by articulating what you want and don't want in a job, which most people do not do when first laid off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:01:00">[22:01:00]</a>. This initial draft is shared with the council for feedback and refinement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:51:00">[23:51:00]</a>.
2.  **Listening Tour**: Conduct a series of conversations to gather market feedback on your skills and experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:42:00">[24:42:00]</a>. This involves:
    *   **Reverse Exit Interviews**: Speaking with former colleagues to understand your strengths and projected self-image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:18:00">[27:18:00]</a>.
    *   **Broader Network**: Asking trusted contacts, "If you were in my shoes, how would you approach this?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:34:00">[27:34:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:36:00">[27:36:00]</a>.
    *   **Recruiters**: Engage recruiters by seeking their advice on where you might be a fit, rather than immediately asking for a job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:42:00">[28:42:00]</a>. Building relationships with recruiters even when employed is highly beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:09:00">[28:09:00]</a>.
3.  **Refine Focus**: After the listening tour, create a narrow, clear Candidate Market Fit statement, typically with three to four attributes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:13:00">[31:13:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:33:00">[33:33:00]</a>. This helps people remember you and be expansive in their thinking about opportunities for you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:00:00">[32:00:00]</a>. It's crucial for the council to sign off on this statement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:09:00">[34:09:00]</a>.
4.  **Update Network**: Share your refined Candidate Market Fit statement with your network and post it on LinkedIn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:16:00">[34:16:00]</a>.

### Adapting to Market Conditions
Market conditions can change rapidly, affecting candidate market fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:36:00">[34:36:00]</a>. For instance, a VP of product two years ago might now only be a fit for a director role due to increased supply of senior talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:24:00">[21:24:00]</a>. Sometimes, a two-step strategy is necessary, where an individual takes a role that may seem like a step down to gain experience closer to the "technology frontier" and then progresses to their desired role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:39:00">[40:39:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:41:00">[41:41:00]</a>. Staying close to the technology frontier is vital as new jobs and opportunities arise there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:38:00">[42:38:00]</a>.

## Playing to Win and [[negotiation_tactics_for_job_offers | Negotiation Tactics]]

When interviewing and negotiating, job seekers must "be in charge" and "play to win, not to lose" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:38:00">[49:38:00]</a>.

### Job Mission with OKRs
Create your own version of the job description as a "job mission with OKRs (Objectives and Key Results)" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:28:00">[50:28:00]</a>. This document outlines what you believe you will be accountable for and the outcomes you will deliver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:06:00">[51:06:00]</a>.

*   **Benefits**:
    *   Helps develop great interview questions to clarify the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:21:00">[51:21:00]</a>.
    *   Impresses hiring managers; one senior Amazon hiring manager stated he would hire someone "on the spot" if they did this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:57:00">[51:57:00]</a>.
    *   Distinguishes candidates, often making the difference between getting an offer (gold medal) versus not (silver medal) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:22:00">[52:22:00]</a>.
    *   Helps clarify job expectations, preventing situations where "job A turned out to be job B" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:23:00">[53:23:00]</a>.
    *   Sets up the candidate for successful [[negotiation_tactics_for_job_offers | negotiation]] by demonstrating initiative and accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:39:00">[53:39:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:51:00">[59:51:00]</a>.

### Four Legs of Negotiation
After receiving an offer, engage in a "collaborative conversation" about what is needed for success in the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:51:00">[53:51:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:07:00">[57:07:00]</a>. This involves discussing resources, support, and budget tied to your proposed OKRs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:14:00">[59:14:00]</a>. Examples include discussing technical debt budget, training for the team, or hiring additional staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:26:00">[54:26:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:50:00">[55:50:00]</a>. Even junior candidates can discuss mentorship or professional development opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:16:00">[56:16:00]</a>.

*   **Financial Negotiation**: Even in a tougher market, 87% of the time, asking for more money results in getting it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:17">[01:00:17]</a>. This should be phrased as an open question, e.g., "Are you open to [desired salary]?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:02">[01:01:02]</a>.
*   **Format**: Conduct these discussions live, either in person or over the phone, ideally with the hiring manager rather than just the recruiter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:44">[01:02:44]</a>.

## The Importance of [[the_importance_of_asking_for_help_in_job_searches | Asking for Help]]

[[the_importance_of_asking_for_help_in_job_searches | Asking for help]] is a transformative act, often perceived as a weakness but is actually a sign of confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:17">[01:17:17]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>.

*   **It's a Giving Activity**: When done well, asking for help is a generous act, making the person asked feel valued and honored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:10">[01:15:10]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:15">[01:16:15]</a>.
*   **It Fosters Independence**: Engaging with others for support helps individuals become more independent and accountable in their search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:35">[01:16:35]</a>.
*   **It Improves Reputation**: Rather than harming reputation, [[the_importance_of_asking_for_help_in_job_searches | asking for help]] thoughtfully can enhance one's professional standing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:37">[01:16:37]</a>.

### How to Ask for Help Well
*   **Do Your Homework**: Don't ask others to do the work for you; seek advice, support, and perspective after preparing yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:36">[01:13:36]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:51">[01:49:51]</a>.
*   **Be Open and Vulnerable**: Share your challenges and uncertainties in a safe environment, such as a Job Search Council <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:24">[01:15:24]</a>.
*   **Be Honest**: Clearly state what you are asking for, without hidden agendas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:56">[01:27:56]</a>.
*   **Consider the Relationship**: Tailor your request to the relationship you have with the person you're asking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:16">[01:26:16]</a>.
*   **Trust Your Emotions**: If you don't trust someone, don't be overly open or vulnerable with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:13">[01:27:13]</a>.

## Maintaining Momentum and Emotional Balance

The job search process can be emotionally taxing, with many feeling insecure and anxious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:26">[01:29:26]</a>. This is a common experience, not a personal failing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:52">[01:29:52]</a>.

*   **Emotional Balance Sheet**: Managing emotional balance is the most important aspect of a job search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:05">[01:40:05]</a>. Councils help by transforming anxiety into motivation and confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:03">[04:01:03]</a>.
*   **Update Notes**: Consistently send monthly update notes to your network, even if there's no major news, to keep them informed and invested in your success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>.
*   **Debrief Interviews**: After interviews, debrief with someone (e.g., your council) to gain perspective and counter inner critics that might distort your perception of performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:12">[01:07:12]</a>.
*   **Gratitude House Exercise**: Before interviews, reflect on all the people who have helped you throughout your life to build confidence and feel less alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:22">[01:05:22]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:01">[01:07:01]</a>.

## Mentorship and Continuous Learning

Developing mentors, both "dead or distant" (like authors whose books you study) and living, is crucial for career evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>. Reading widely, including history and science, helps develop critical thinking skills essential for product leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:31">[01:47:31]</a>.

Providing constructive feedback, especially during challenging situations like layoffs, requires specific techniques to ensure it is delivered humanely and effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:08">[00:47:08]</a>. Matt Mashari, an executive coach, emphasizes the importance of personalized, compassionate communication to prevent anger and foster trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:22">[00:20:22]</a>.

## Key Principles for Difficult Conversations

When delivering difficult news or feedback, the method of delivery is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

*   **One-on-One Communication**
    It is vital that individuals hear difficult news, such as a layoff, from their manager in a one-on-one setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Hearing such news via email, group chat, or in a group setting can feel dehumanizing, leading to anger and public backlash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Personalized delivery is key to maintaining a humane process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:46">[00:47:46]</a>.
*   **Allowing Emotional Expression**
    During difficult conversations, it's important to create space for the other person to express their emotions. Being in a group prevents this emotional release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
*   **Pre-framing the Conversation**
    Before delivering tough news, it's beneficial to warn the person that the conversation will be difficult and to mentally prepare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>. This preparation can help prevent the amygdala (the brain's fear center) from being completely overwhelmed by surprise, allowing for a more measured emotional response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:17">[00:30:17]</a>.

Matt Mashari shares [[techniques_for_managing_and_delivering_feedback | techniques for managing and delivering feedback]] that extend beyond just conveying information:

### Addressing Fear and Anger
Fear often leads to bad advice and exaggerated predictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. When someone is gripped by fear, their perception of reality can be distorted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.

*   **Consulting an Unbiased Party:** If you suspect someone is acting out of fear, encourage them to consult with someone who is not experiencing fear, as that person can see the situation more clearly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>.
*   **Identifying Anger:** Anger is often a "cover" for underlying pain. It externalizes this pain, potentially damaging relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>. To address anger in others, an "I statement" focused on perception can be effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>:
    > "I perceive you to be in anger." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>
    This approach avoids accusation and allows the person to recognize and potentially shift out of their angry state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>.

### Making People Feel Heard
For effective feedback, it's crucial to ensure the recipient feels genuinely heard. This process has multiple levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:05">[00:32:05]</a>:

*   **Verbal Confirmation:** Repeat back what you've heard to confirm understanding:
    > "Lenny, I think what I heard you say is [restate their point]. Is that right?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:46">[00:32:46]</a>
    Continue this until the person confirms you've understood them accurately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:53">[00:32:53]</a>.
*   **Reflecting Underlying Thoughts/Emotions:** Go deeper by reflecting what you imagine their unstated thoughts or emotions might be, especially if they are couching their feedback to avoid hurting feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:22">[00:33:22]</a>. For example:
    > "Lenny, I think what I'm hearing you say is you're pissed off and you're thinking 'screw you Matt, how dare you walk into the office and not even say hello to me.' Is that close?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:34">[00:33:34]</a>
    Often, their thoughts are "bigger than their words," and acknowledging this makes them feel deeply understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:07">[00:34:07]</a>.
*   **Action and Explanation:** After making someone feel heard, you must either accept the feedback and state what you'll do about it, or explain clearly why you cannot accept it, sharing your own context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:16">[00:34:16]</a>. This ensures they understand the rationale behind your decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:38">[00:34:38]</a>. This also helps in [[improving_communication_skills | improving communication skills]] within the team.

### Practical Application and Learning
[[providing_effective_feedback | Providing effective feedback]] and handling difficult conversations can be learned through practice. Matt Mashari's methods are often documented as step-by-step scripts that can be followed. By implementing these scripts, individuals can see immediate positive results, which provides the necessary motivation to continue improving these skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:11">[00:35:11]</a>.

> "Once you do it one time, like, 'oh my God, that worked so well,' that's the only motivation you need." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:32">[00:35:32]</a>

This systematic approach makes complex interpersonal skills accessible and actionable.

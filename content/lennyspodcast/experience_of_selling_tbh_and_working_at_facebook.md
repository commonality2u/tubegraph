Nikita Beer, known for building and launching multiple top-ranking apps, sold his first major success, TBH, to Facebook for over $30 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:13">[02:11:13]</a>. This acquisition occurred just nine weeks after TBH's launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:07">[03:07:07]</a>.

## Selling TBH

The process of selling a company is described as "one of the most draining processes" a founder can experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:22">[03:22:22]</a>. When meeting with Facebook, Nikita was told they had 80 people assigned to the deal, while his entire team consisted of just himself, two engineers, and one designer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:36">[03:37:36]</a>. Facebook's team, described as the "SWAT team of M&A," visited their small, "dingy old office" in Oakland, which cost $1,800 a month in rent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:50">[03:50:50]</a>. The sale became a "pretty competitive bidding process" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:20">[02:20:20]</a>.

A memorable moment during the acquisition process involved Nikita flying to Los Angeles to meet with a bidder. When asked about TBH's App Store ranking, he revealed that thanks to a strategic state-by-state rollout, the app had just launched in California and become the number one app in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:50">[02:49:50]</a>. To prove this, his CTO, Eric Hazard, used a real-time installation dashboard to show new installs lighting up the map, including the very block where the meeting was taking place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:50">[02:49:50]</a>.

## Working at Facebook

After the acquisition, Nikita joined Facebook's "youth team," which comprised about 150 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:02">[03:32:02]</a>. This marked his first official job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:02">[03:32:02]</a>, and his title was product manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:02">[03:32:02]</a>.

### Perceptions of Product Management

Upon joining Facebook, Nikita observed that the company operated like an "academic environment for social networks," with extensive studies on retention and impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:02">[03:32:02]</a>. However, he soon realized that the role of a [[transitioning_into_product_management | product manager]] in a large tech company like Facebook involved "very little product management" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:39">[03:39:39]</a>. He found that PMs were primarily involved in writing documents, acting as "team secretary," and seeking approvals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:29">[03:49:29]</a>.

He noted a significant detachment from the actual design process, as a separate design organization handled all visual and flow aspects. This was challenging for Nikita, who considers himself primarily a designer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:09">[04:09:09]</a>. He holds the view that "products live and die in the pixels," and for zero-to-one initiatives, product managers should be deeply involved in designing the hierarchy, pixels, and flows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:51">[04:51:51]</a>.

### Building New Products at Facebook

Nikita spent four years at Facebook, working across multiple organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>. His favorite role was within the New Product Experimentation (NPE) group, where he collaborated with other founders on building standalone apps from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>. During his tenure, he built approximately eight apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:08">[04:08:08]</a>.

He found it "much, much more difficult to build apps at a large company" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a> due to several factors:
*   **Difficulty in Verbalizing Ideas** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:36">[04:36:36]</a>: It's hard to discuss the nuanced, often primal, motivations for app adoption (e.g., "building an app for teens to flirt") in a formal setting with seasoned professionals who may prioritize how ideas reflect on them personally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:36">[04:36:36]</a>.
*   **Risk Aversion and Incentives** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:29">[04:29:29]</a>: Internal incentives often discourage presenting ideas based on hunches without existing market signals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:29">[04:29:29]</a>. Employees focus on performance reviews and bonuses, making it safer to propose copying an already successful product rather than innovating from first principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:29">[04:29:29]</a>. This often means large companies copy existing products to gain internal momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:29">[04:29:29]</a>.
*   **Slow Response to Market Signals** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:47">[04:47:47]</a>: Incumbents take a long time to respond to competitive threats. An app might chart in the App Store, be discussed internally, undergo market research, lead to a framing deck, and then enter development, a process that can take 12 to 24 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:55">[04:55:55]</a>. This makes it challenging for them to launch completely new "zero to one" products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:29">[04:29:29]</a>.

Despite these challenges, working at a large company offered benefits such as abstracted financial and legal concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:59">[04:59:59]</a>. However, it also introduced new complexities like regulatory scrutiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:59">[04:59:59]</a>.

### The Tim Cook Painting

While at Facebook, Nikita's team was physically seated near Mark Zuckerberg's desk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:51">[05:51:51]</a>. They had brought an old "pop art painting" of Tim Cook from their previous office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:52">[05:52:52]</a>, which Nikita saw as symbolic of Apple's control over their destiny as app developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:52">[05:52:52]</a>. The painting was displayed in their new area, overlooking Zuckerberg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:52">[05:52:52]</a>. Eventually, an executive assistant suggested they take the painting home, as it was inappropriate to have a picture of another big tech executive overlooking them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:52">[05:52:52]</a>. Nikita still keeps the painting as an artifact from that chapter of his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:52">[05:52:52]</a>.

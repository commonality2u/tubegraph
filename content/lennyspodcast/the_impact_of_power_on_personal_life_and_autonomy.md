While power can lead to positive outcomes such as promotions, increased salary, career happiness, and reduced stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>, it also significantly impacts an individual's personal life and autonomy. The realities of acquiring power often bear little resemblance to societal ideals or personal aspirations, leading to discomfort and a perceived conflict with how one "wants to live their life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

## Power vs. Autonomy

A core principle highlighted by scholar James G. March is that one can have power or autonomy, but not both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:14">[01:11:14]</a>. Choosing a life of freedom and control over one's time often means forgoing positions of immense power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:19">[01:11:19]</a>. Those in powerful roles, such as university deans or CEOs, often have their schedules completely dictated by their positions, leaving little personal control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:47">[01:11:47]</a>. This lack of autonomy extends to simple aspects of daily life, where assistants might control a powerful person's schedule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:12">[01:12:12]</a>.

## Loss of Privacy and Scrutiny

Increased power inevitably brings enormous visibility and scrutiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:22">[01:14:22]</a>. Actions that might have gone unnoticed or been forgiven in the past become public spectacles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:34">[01:14:34]</a>. Individuals in positions of power, like presidents of universities or countries, find their personal lives, associations, and every decision dissected publicly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:41">[01:14:41]</a>. This means a significant loss of privacy and very little control over one's personal narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:09">[01:15:09]</a>.

## The Trust Dilemma and Personal Toll

With wealth and power comes the "trust dilemma," where individuals may question whether people associate with them for who they are or for the position they hold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:30">[01:15:30]</a>. Beyond personal privacy, the pursuit and maintenance of power can take a severe toll on personal relationships and family life. The speaker highlights cases of suicides and high divorce rates among those in powerful positions, emphasizing the price paid not only by the individual but also by their loved ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:59">[01:16:59]</a>.

## Utilizing Power for Good

Despite these downsides, the influence of power is a fundamental reality of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:31">[01:03:31]</a>. It is argued that if one wishes for power to be used for positive outcomes, then more "good people need to have power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:01">[00:55:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:48">[01:06:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:22">[01:08:22]</a>. Individuals, even those initially uncomfortable with the concept of acquiring power, can learn the [[seven_rules_of_power | skills of power]] and leverage them to achieve significant positive change, such as driving profound advancements in medicine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:29">[01:07:29]</a>. To effect change, especially against entrenched interests, the application of power and influence is often necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:45">[01:08:45]</a>.

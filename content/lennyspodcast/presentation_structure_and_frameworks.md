Nancy Duarte, a best-selling author, speaker, and CEO of Duarte Incorporated, has helped create over 250,000 presentations for influential leaders, brands, and institutions worldwide, including Apple, Google, the World Bank, and Al Gore's *An Inconvenient Truth* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. She shares tactical advice on how to improve [[crafting_compelling_presentations | presentations]], tell better stories, reduce nerves, and use simple communication frameworks to improve dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## Core Philosophy: Empathy First <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>
Duarte's methodology is grounded in empathy, emphasizing the importance of thinking about the audience first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>. In a presentation, the audience holds the power, as they choose whether to accept or reject an idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>. The presenter's role is to act as a "mentor," coming alongside the audience to help them get unstuck or provide a "magical tool" for their internal and external journeys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a>. This means understanding their internal conflicts and anticipating the difficulty of the actions requested of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>.

### Three Essential Tips for Crafting Presentations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>
When starting to create a presentation, Nancy Duarte recommends three key points to remember:

1.  **Your audience is the hero** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>: This is an empathy-centric approach where you consider the audience's perspective and challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>. Signs of success include visible understanding and positive reactions from the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:32">[00:23:32]</a>.
2.  **Infuse your talk with story** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>: Utilize story structures with a beginning, middle, and end, incorporating a "rise and fall" dynamic that builds and releases tension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:30">[00:24:30]</a>. Storytelling creates longing in the audience, helping them desire a future they hadn't considered before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>.
3.  **Ask yourself, "Can they see what I'm saying?"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>: Use visual tools, live sketchers, or even drawing on a napkin to help the audience visualize your message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:20">[00:36:20]</a>. This can include diagrams, "star moments" of dramatic data, evocative stories, or beautiful pictures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:39">[00:36:39]</a>.

## The "What Is, What Could Be, New Bliss" Framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:52">[00:26:52]</a>
This framework, visually represented as a fluctuating line, is a core element of [[crafting_compelling_presentations | compelling presentations]] based on story structure:
*   **What Is**: Start by stating the current reality or problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:58">[00:26:58]</a>.
*   **What Could Be**: Transition to a potential future state or solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:04">[00:27:04]</a>.
*   **New Bliss**: Conclude by painting a picture of a world where your idea has been adopted, creating longing for this future state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:14">[00:27:14]</a>.

This pattern of "what is, what could be" repeatedly contrasts the current reality with an imagined future, ultimately leading to the "new Bliss" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:20">[00:27:20]</a>. This structure applies not only to big stage talks but also to everyday interactions, like phone calls or even convincing a spouse to do chores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:22">[00:31:22]</a>.

## Presentation Formats and Slide Design

### Slide Docs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:40">[00:42:40]</a>
For presentations meant to be circulated via email without a live presenter, a "slide doc" is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:53">[00:42:53]</a>. These contain more words, stronger pictures, and can include extensive appendices, similar to Amazon's six-page memo but with added visuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:56">[00:42:56]</a>.

### Slide Design Principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:38">[00:41:38]</a>
*   **One Point Per Slide**: Each slide should convey a single point that supports the overall "big idea" of the presentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:38">[00:41:38]</a>.
*   **Audience Adaptation**: The density and visual style of slides should be tailored to the audience and their cultural communication norms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:20">[00:44:20]</a>. Some audiences (e.g., executives or consulting firms) prefer denser slides with the conclusion upfront, while others benefit from more cinematic, visually driven slides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:51">[00:45:51]</a>.
*   **Pre-Planning**: Before opening presentation software, it's beneficial to sketch out the narrative and key points using storyboards or boxes, allowing for a more thoughtful and less linear approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:28">[00:48:28]</a>.

## Movements and Leadership: The Torchbearer Concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:13">[01:01:13]</a>
From her book *Illuminate*, Duarte introduces the concept of a "torchbearer" leader, who understands where they are headed but doesn't necessarily see the entire path clearly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:26">[01:02:26]</a>. The torch provides just enough light to dissipate fear for those following <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:37">[01:02:37]</a>.

Movements follow a five-act structure:
1.  **Dream**: Leaders verbalize the vision of the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:05">[01:02:05]</a>.
2.  **Leap**: People choose to commit to the journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:11">[01:02:11]</a>.
3.  **Fight & Climb**: The "messy middle" where individuals overcome roadblocks and maintain enthusiasm through ongoing challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:29">[01:03:29]</a>.
4.  **Arrive**: The ultimate realization of the desired future state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:56">[01:03:56]</a>.

Throughout these phases, leaders use speeches, stories, ceremonies, and symbols to provide emotional fuel and guide people toward a larger initiative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:58">[01:03:58]</a>.

## [[product_management_strategies_and_frameworks | Product Management Applications]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:43">[01:07:43]</a>
Storytelling can be integrated into various phases of [[product_management_strategies_and_frameworks | product management]]:
*   **Empathy-Driven Strategy**: Airbnb's "Snow White" project is a prime example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:01">[01:08:01]</a>. By literally walking through a day in the life of their customer (a host), illustrating each scene, the team realized the need to shift to a mobile-first strategy and defined their core user journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:12">[01:08:12]</a>.
*   **Conveying Meaning**: Product managers often struggle to articulate the "why" behind their designs, beyond just describing features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:22">[01:09:22]</a>. Adding meaning and wrapping it in a story can influence product adoption and reveal the hidden work and passion behind its creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:46">[01:09:46]</a>.
*   **Product Reveals**: Large product launches, like Apple's, are prime opportunities for telling compelling stories about the newly revealed item <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:10">[01:10:10]</a>.

## Duarte Inc.'s Presentation Crafting Process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:04">[00:50:04]</a>
Duarte Inc. approaches [[crafting_compelling_presentations | presentations]] like Pixar makes movies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:42">[00:50:42]</a>. For high-stakes moments, they:
1.  **Craft the Narrative**: Develop the core story, "big idea," and script <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:57">[00:50:57]</a>.
2.  **Visualize Key Moments**: Map out and chunk the presentation, sometimes developing revolutionary models that drive web assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>.
3.  **Build Consensus**: Circulate initial models and narratives internally to gather feedback and build agreement across departments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:22">[00:51:22]</a>.
4.  **Refine and Deliver**: Work out kinks in the narrative before the final delivery, focusing on the voice track and overall impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:38">[00:51:38]</a>.
The process is adapted to each unique presenter and audience, whether it's a massive stage event or a meeting without slides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:09">[00:53:09]</a>.

## [[managing_presentation_nerves_and_stage_presence | Managing Presentation Nerves and Stage Presence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:50">[00:54:50]</a>
Nervous presenters often have deep, thoughtful content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:07">[00:56:07]</a>. Nerves stem from a "fight or flight" instinct, where the body perceives the stage as a threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:45">[00:56:45]</a>.

Tips for managing nerves:
*   **Visualize the Audience**: Sit in an audience seat, imagine yourself speaking, and then visualize friendly, delighted faces looking back at you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>. This helps change the mental model of a judging audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:23">[00:57:23]</a>.
*   **Pre-Talk Rituals**:
    *   **Calming**: Find a quiet, dark place backstage to breathe and focus on content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:08">[00:58:08]</a>.
    *   **Humor**: Watch funny videos or recall personal jokes right before going on stage to induce laughter and chemically shift from nervousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:26">[00:58:26]</a>.
    *   **Breathing**: Practice controlled breathing patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:49">[00:59:49]</a>.
*   **Passion**: Choose a topic you are deeply passionate about to practice [[public_speaking_and_humor_in_presentations | presenting]] from your "soul" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:20">[01:15:20]</a>. This experience can be tapped into for future presentations, even on less engaging topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:35">[01:15:35]</a>.

## Remote Presentations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:19">[00:53:19]</a>
Remote presentations require specific adjustments:
*   **Eye Contact**: Practice looking directly into the camera instead of at faces on the screen to maintain connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:30">[00:53:30]</a>.
*   **Presence**: Recognize that traditional body language and presence are diminished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:09">[00:54:09]</a>. Coaching often focuses on how to project presence in a virtual space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:20">[00:54:20]</a>.
*   **Hybrid Challenges**: As some return to offices, hybrid meetings present new communication challenges, with remote participants struggling to be heard amidst those in the room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:11">[00:55:11]</a>.

## Final Advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:14">[01:15:14]</a>
To become a better presenter, choose a topic you are truly passionate about and work on that talk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:20">[01:15:20]</a>. The ability to present from a place of passion will translate to all other presentations, making you a more impactful communicator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:35">[01:15:35]</a>.

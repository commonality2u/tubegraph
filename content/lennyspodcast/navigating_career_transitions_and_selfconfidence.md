Amy Vora, Chief Product Officer at Faire and former Facebook product leader, shares insights on navigating career changes and building self-confidence, emphasizing the importance of authenticity, intuition, and continuous learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:39">[01:34:39]</a>.

## Authenticity and Imperfection

Amy Vora aims to be as authentic as possible, showing that individuals can be "pretty messy and imperfect at times, yet still be very successful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>. She observed that successful people, especially women, often appeared to have everything figured out, responding to emails instantly, seemingly not sleeping, and always looking perfect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>. This perception led her to believe she might never be successful because she loves sleep and wastes time on "absurd things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. For a period during the pandemic, she even worked out of her bathroom due to the need for a quiet space away from her three kids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>.

It took time for Amy to realize that "no one's got it fully figured out" and that most people are "winging it and learning as we're going" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>. This perspective normalizes the struggles behind the scenes of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>.

## Trusting Intuition in Career Choices

For a long time, Amy felt held back because she didn't have a strict career plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>. However, she found that the most important thing has been to acknowledge this truth about herself and instead follow her intuition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>. Her success has consistently come from:
*   Doing "the thing that feels right" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>.
*   Going to "the place that feels like home" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>.
*   Working with people who "feel like my friends" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>.
*   Working where she feels she can be "lucky" and "creative" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>.

Rather than relying on "spreadsheet math" to predict career paths, she encourages an emotional assessment of a job: "What would it be like if I were doing this job? What would I think about on my commute? Who would I have lunch with? Do I like them?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:00">[09:12:00]</a> This emotional response is often more telling than a five-year plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:23:00">[09:23:00]</a>. Feeling "at home" in a role is linked to trust with colleagues, which allows for taking more risks and doing better work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:00">[09:37:00]</a>.

## The "Hill Climb" Metaphor for Change

Amy uses the "hill climb" metaphor to illustrate the difference between a local optimum and a global optimum in career and life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:55:00">[26:55:00]</a>. This involves being on top of one "hill," feeling good about optimizing a current system, but seeing a higher "mountain" in the distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:09:00">[27:09:00]</a>.

To reach the higher mountain, one must decide whether to take the risk of climbing down their current hill, crossing an "unknown chasm," and then climbing back up to the same level, with more climbing ahead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:32:00">[27:32:00]</a>. This is applicable to big career moves, new jobs, or new relationships, where one gives up something that works well without a guarantee of success on the new path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:19:00">[28:19:00]</a>.

> "The thing that gets me through the valley is remembering what the summit feels like" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:03:00">[29:03:00]</a>.

This metaphor helps set expectations that the "slog" of being in the "valley" is a normal part of the journey towards a better outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:21:00">[29:21:00]</a>.

## Cultivating Confidence: Sublimating Ego and Embracing Curiosity

BOS, the CTO of Meta, describes Amy Vora as someone who could have a profound disagreement but respond with genuine curiosity, saying "fascinating, you have to tell me more why you think that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:24:00">[10:24:00]</a>. This approach tears down walls between different points of view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:49:00">[10:49:00]</a>.

Amy admits this did not come naturally to her, as she used to enjoy being right and found her identity in "being the person who was right and being the person who knew everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:05:00">[11:05:00]</a>. However, she learned that this approach did not serve her well in the working world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:22:00">[11:22:00]</a>. A former manager pointed out that not only was she expending a lot of energy trying to figure everything out by herself, but she was also often not reaching the best answer because she was ignoring information others possessed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:38:00">[11:38:00]</a>.

The key shift was realizing it's "more important to get to the outcome than to be right" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:46:00">[13:46:00]</a>. By embracing curiosity and openness, she learned more, achieved better outcomes, and made work more interesting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:12:00">[12:12:00]</a>. This creates a positive feedback loop: curiosity leads to learning, better outcomes, and improved relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:11:00">[14:11:00]</a>. The visceral reaction to disagreement is reinterpreted as a chance to learn more, rather than a signal to shut something down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:00:00">[16:00:00]</a>. Taking a pause before responding helps calm the body and mind, leading to a better response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:29:00">[16:29:00]</a>.

## Navigating Feedback and Self-Perception

Amy received feedback early in her career that she "could be the smartest person in the room, but it doesn't matter if people don't like you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:27:00">[48:27:00]</a>. Taking this feedback seriously, she initially tried to be more likable by "shrinking myself a little bit and not being so aggressive, not being so opinionated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:57:00">[48:57:00]</a>, even wearing earth tones for two years to "fade back" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:16:00">[49:16:00]</a>. While this approach seemed to work for a while, her team eventually needed her to express her opinions as a leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:26:00">[49:26:00]</a>.

She now advises others, especially women, to not "dampen who you are and your strengths" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:38:00">[55:38:00]</a>. Instead of shrinking, the goal is to "expand your tool sets" by building new ways to work with diverse people and problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:40:00">[50:40:00]</a>. This approach makes you "bigger and more powerful and more expansive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:59:00">[50:59:00]</a>. Amy also notes that women often receive more personal feedback about their style rather than the content of their role, and it's important to choose how to interpret and act on such feedback, rather than reacting immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:59:00">[52:59:00]</a>.

She also challenges the idea that women need to find a "mentor" or "sponsor," viewing it as an additional "burden" or "hoop" not typically imposed on other demographics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:04:00">[54:04:00]</a>.

## Ramping Up in New Senior Roles

Transitioning to a new senior role, like Amy's move from Meta to Faire, can be challenging because individuals often expect to be as proficient as they were in their previous long-held position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>. Amy reminds herself that it takes time to build up the necessary vocabulary, cultural context, network, and product knowledge in a new environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:11">[01:07:11]</a>. The priority should be learning enough to make impactful changes in the future, rather than immediately changing everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:17">[01:07:17]</a>.

Her move to Faire, with its new business model, people, and customer problems, presented a dramatic learning curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:30">[01:07:30]</a>. This transition also helped her overcome a "deep-seated insecurity" about whether her success at Meta was solely due to that specific environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:03">[01:08:03]</a>. Leading through change in a new place with a new customer set and business model proved to be very affirming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:19">[01:08:19]</a>.

## Career Journeys: From Temp to CPO

Amy's career journey at Facebook began as a temporary employee in PR, even though she had no qualifications or an interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:15">[01:14:15]</a>. She quit her previous job with the ambition to be involved in the "wild stuff happening in Silicon Valley in the mid-2000s" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. She admired Facebook as a "magical product" that people felt was "more important to me than my car" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:37">[01:13:37]</a>.

To get her foot in the door, she leveraged networking, convincing a contact to introduce her to everyone in the office in exchange for coffee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:54">[01:13:54]</a>. She told everyone, "I really want to work here, I'll do whatever you need" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:10">[01:14:10]</a>. This led to an offer to review press releases as a temp, which she accepted, moving to California, sleeping on couches, and eventually being hired full-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:32">[01:14:32]</a>.

A significant, yet often under-discussed, [[key_attributes_of_successful_startup_founders | mental health crisis]] exists among [[key_attributes_of_successful_startup_founders | founders]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. The stress associated with being a [[key_attributes_of_successful_startup_founders | founder]] is difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:25">[00:55:25]</a>.

## Worse Than Failure
People often perceive a [[common_reasons_startups_fail_and_how_to_avoid_them | startup fail]]ure as the worst possible outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, it is considered far worse to be trapped in a "zombie Undead company" that a [[key_attributes_of_successful_startup_founders | founder]] hates but cannot leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Building a company that becomes a "malign force in the world" and feeling complicit in its negative impact is described as "way way worse" than failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. There are real-world examples of successful [[key_attributes_of_successful_startup_founders | founders]] who, after selling their companies for significant wealth, faced severe mental health struggles, including suicide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:42">[00:55:42]</a>.

> "far worse is to be in a company that won't die a zombie Undead company that you hate but you can't leave" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>
>
> "there are worse things in having your [[common_reasons_startups_fail_and_how_to_avoid_them | startup fail]] and so [[building_a_startup_culture | building a company you hate]] that that becomes a malign force in the world you know that you have to go pretend you weren't involved with or that like you feel complicit in what like that's way way worse and I wish more [[key_attributes_of_successful_startup_founders | Founders]] would take that more seriously early on" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>

Many companies are still alive but are "almost never going to succeed," leaving [[key_attributes_of_successful_startup_founders | founders]] feeling stuck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:20">[00:56:20]</a>.

### Why Founders Stay Stuck
*   **Fear of Admitting Failure:** It is psychologically damaging for [[key_attributes_of_successful_startup_founders | founders]] to admit that their company didn't work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:50">[00:47:50]</a>. Many founders are adamant they never failed, never pivoted, and that "everything's exactly the way they saw it" from the beginning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:01">[00:48:01]</a>.
*   **Ego Identification:** For many, their identity is deeply tied to their company, leading them to feel that if the company dies, "they also must die" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:05">[00:59:05]</a>. This emotional attachment can prevent rational decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:17">[00:59:17]</a>.
*   **False Hope:** Some [[key_attributes_of_successful_startup_founders | founders]] cling to the idea that "It's always darkest before the dawn," even when continued operation makes no sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:39">[00:56:39]</a>.

## Strategies for Founders
To avoid or address this crisis, [[key_attributes_of_successful_startup_founders | founders]] should:

*   **Prioritize Mental Sanity:** If a [[key_attributes_of_successful_startup_founders | founder]] finds [[onboarding_and_decisionmaking_at_startups | cognitive dissonance]] painful or struggles to maintain [[resilience_and_perseverance_in_startups | mental sanity]] in uncertainty, the startup path may not be for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.
*   **Build the Company You Want:** [[key_attributes_of_successful_startup_founders | Founders]] should strive to build a company that aligns with their personal values and vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:40">[00:53:40]</a>. This reduces the risk of creating an entity they will later despise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:52">[00:53:52]</a>.
*   **Introspection:** [[key_attributes_of_successful_startup_founders | Founders]] should honestly ask themselves if they truly want to continue working on their current company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:26">[00:58:26]</a>. If the answer is no, it's acceptable to move on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:38">[00:58:38]</a>.
*   **Set Time-Bound Experiments:** If a [[key_attributes_of_successful_startup_founders | founder]] is unsure if their current strategy is working, they can commit to a fixed period (e.g., six weeks) to intensively test a core assumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:34">[01:14:34]</a>. This dedicated focus can reveal if progress is possible or if they are in a "law of diminishing returns" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:09">[01:15:09]</a>.
*   **Embrace Self-Discovery:** The process of [[journey_and_challenges_of_early_employees_in_a_startup | building a startup]] is inherently a process of self-discovery, where the [[key_attributes_of_successful_startup_founders | founder's]] vision evolves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:30">[01:02:30]</a>. It is important to be aware of how personal understanding changes and not rely on potentially faulty memory or biased narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:12">[01:05:12]</a>.
*   **Prioritize Learning:** The scientific method emphasizes that if you cannot fail, you cannot learn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:15">[01:15:15]</a>. [[key_attributes_of_successful_startup_founders | Founders]] must create a psychological environment where admitting when something isn't working is possible, enabling learning and adaptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:16">[01:16:16]</a>.
*   **Consider a Pivot:** If the current path is consistently fruitless, [[key_attributes_of_successful_startup_founders | founders]] should discuss potential new directions, even if it means putting the old project on hold for a fixed period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:29">[01:16:29]</a>. Often, everyone secretly wants to try something new but is afraid to voice it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:37">[01:17:37]</a>.
*   **Confront the Truth with Investors:** Avoid sugarcoating reality in investor updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. Honest communication, even about struggles, is crucial for timely decisions.
*   **Integrate Values into Governance:** [[key_attributes_of_successful_startup_founders | Founders]] who want their organizations to be trustworthy and committed to values like "human flourishing" must embed these principles directly into the company's structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:05">[01:35:05]</a>. This ensures that even if the [[key_attributes_of_successful_startup_founders | founder]] leaves, the company's core promises and values are maintained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:17">[01:35:17]</a>. Legal structures like Public Benefit Corporations or social purpose corporations, or even custom agreements like the "board mission pledge" or "LTSV" (Long-Term Stock Exchange Vehicle), can help formalize these commitments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:01">[01:44:01]</a>.
*   **Consult Legal Counsel Early:** It is critical to discuss governance structures and safeguards with lawyers early on, as delaying these conversations often leads to "too late" scenarios where changes are no longer feasible due to investor interests or IPO preparations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:51">[01:52:51]</a>. For example, a standard incorporation might legally obligate a company to sell to an "evil Corp" if it offers the highest price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:05">[01:47:05]</a>.
*   **Reject Sociopathic Business Models:** Recognize that some business models are inherently "exploitative extractive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:01">[01:38:01]</a>. [[key_attributes_of_successful_startup_founders | Founders]] can choose to build companies that create "net new value" and are dedicated to human flourishing, which can also lead to greater financial success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:04">[01:38:04]</a>.

> "I think we've just gotten confused that making all forms of making money are the same but we all know that that's not true there's exploitative extractive ways of making money and then there's truly additive ways of making money that that actually create net new value" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:56">[01:37:56]</a>

By consciously designing organizations with a deeply embedded ethical framework and a focus on long-term value creation, [[key_attributes_of_successful_startup_founders | founders]] can foster healthier companies and avoid the disillusionment and mental health challenges associated with misaligned ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:45">[01:40:45]</a>.

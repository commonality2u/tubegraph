Katie Dill, Head of Design at Stripe, has built and led design teams at three hypergrowth companies: Airbnb, Lyft, and Stripe. Her experience provides valuable lessons on [[Leadership and management development | leadership and management development]], team management, and operationalizing quality in fast-paced environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:14">[01:11:14]</a>.

## Personal Development and Learning

One of the biggest learning experiences in Katie Dill's [[the_personal_development_of_a_founder_and_leadership_lessons | leadership career]] occurred early in her tenure at Airbnb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:04">[05:22:04]</a>.

### The "Intervention"

Hired to lead the 10-person experience design team, Katie came in ready to make changes based on feedback she received during her interview process, which highlighted low engagement scores and collaboration issues within the design organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>. About a month into her role, half of her design team, along with an HR partner, staged a meeting to list her perceived wrongdoings and dislikes about her actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:00">[06:25:00]</a>.

Katie initially wanted to defend herself but, fortunately, listened instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>. The clear theme was that she hadn't earned their trust; they didn't believe she cared about them or shared their goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:00">[08:01:00]</a>. This realization led her to immediately shift her operating style from "coming in swinging" to "coming in listening" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40:00">[08:40:00]</a>.

By actively listening to individuals and understanding their motivations, she began to make necessary organizational changes while bringing the team along <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:59:00">[08:59:00]</a>. This shift resulted in the design team having the best engagement scores in the company a couple of months later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:00">[09:16:00]</a>.

## Organizational Structure and Team Collaboration

Creating a [[Leadership and company culture | high-functioning organization]] involves strategic team organization and fostering community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:02:00">[10:02:00]</a>.

### Co-location and Dual Identity

Katie advocates for engineers, product managers, and designers to work and sit together, fostering shared goals and easy communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:09:00">[10:09:00]</a>. This co-location helps prevent wasted work and misalignment that can occur when disciplines work in silos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:17">[01:03:17]</a>.

However, it's also crucial to build community within disciplines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:20:00">[10:20:00]</a>. Employees should feel like they wear "two T-shirts": one for their cross-disciplinary team (e.g., Marketplace) and one for their core function (e.g., Design) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:37:00">[10:37:00]</a>. Regularly bringing design teams together for shared moments helps build this internal community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:27:00">[10:27:00]</a>.

### Mitigating Interference

At Lyft, Katie transformed a design team that was physically separated from engineering and product by a locked door <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:19">[01:02:19]</a>. While this setup provided a safe space for creative exploration, it led to wasted work, misalignment, and slower processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:17">[01:03:17]</a>. By evolving the way the teams worked and physically breaking down the walls, they brought design, engineering, and product together. This resulted in faster iteration cycles and better clarity, while still maintaining dedicated creative spaces for focused work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:16">[01:04:16]</a>.

## Driving Quality as a Leadership Priority

[[Effective leadership and strategic thinking | Effective leadership]] recognizes that quality is not just a design concern but a non-negotiable, long-term aspect of product development that directly contributes to growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:30:00">[13:30:00]</a>.

### Quality is Growth

The idea that "quality is growth" is central to driving business outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:45:00">[15:45:00]</a>. Making a product easier to use, more understandable, and more desirable encourages more people to use it, use it more often, and recommend it to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:52:00">[15:52:00]</a>.

Stripe's growth team is maniacally focused on building better experiences because they directly correlate to business metrics, such as increased activations from improved onboarding flows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:09:00">[16:09:00]</a>. For example, by improving the quality of its checkout experience, Stripe observed a 10.5% increase in businesses' revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:27">[01:00:27]</a>.

### Operationalizing Quality

To ensure quality, several [[engineering_leadership_and_management_strategies | management strategies]] are employed:

*   **Group Effort**: Quality is a collective responsibility, not just one team's or individual's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:29:00">[29:29:00]</a>. Internal communication and consistent standards are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:03:00">[30:03:00]</a>.
*   **Vision and Alignment**: Even with talented people, a shared vision is needed to ensure individual contributions form a cohesive whole, like an architect's plan for a house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:22:00">[30:22:00]</a>.
*   **Editing and Curation**: There needs to be a mechanism for editing and curating the work to ensure all pieces fit together harmoniously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:21:00">[31:21:00]</a>.
*   **Courage**: Leaders must have the courage to say, "This isn't good enough; let's try again," even if it means pushing back on significant effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:55:00">[31:55:00]</a>.
*   **User Perspective**: Truly understanding quality requires empathy for the user's journey, as products are rarely experienced in isolation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:34:00">[32:34:00]</a>.

### "Walk the Store" Process

Stripe implements a "Walk the Store" process, where leaders (engineering, product, design) regularly review critical user journeys from the user's perspective, like walking the floor of a store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:32:00">[35:32:00]</a>.

*   They "friction log" their experiences, noting what works and what doesn't, filing bugs, and reaching out to relevant teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:39:00">[35:39:00]</a>.
*   The reviews span the entire user journey, from initial internet searches to the website, documentation, and product dashboards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:05:00">[36:05:00]</a>.
*   Teams score the journeys based on a rubric evaluating usability, utility, desirability, and surprising delight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:12:00">[45:12:00]</a>. A color-based scoring system (e.g., yellow, green) avoids getting bogged down in precise quantitative numbers for qualitative judgment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:45:00">[45:45:00]</a>.
*   Quarterly calibration meetings (Product Quality Review, PQR) bring leaders together to discuss scores, debate interpretations, and align on the company's quality bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:35:00">[36:35:00]</a>. This process increases awareness and accountability, leading to upstream improvements and a shared understanding of quality across the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:47:00">[37:47:00]</a>.

### Prioritizing Quality

Instead of strict time allocation (e.g., 10% on fixes), Stripe relies on hiring individuals with great judgment and pride in their work, and explicitly advocating for quality at the highest levels of the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:29:00">[47:29:00]</a>. This fuels teams' decision-making during planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:07:00">[48:07:00]</a>.

## Team Performance and Growth

Katie Dill uses a simple yet powerful formula to conceptualize team performance: **Performance = Potential - Interference** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:05:00">[55:05:00]</a>.

*   **Increasing Potential**: This involves hiring top talent and investing in [[leadership_and_management_development | talent development]], helping individuals grow and increase their capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:37:00">[55:37:00]</a>.
*   **Decreasing Interference**: Leaders must identify and remove obstacles that hinder great work, preventing burnout and ensuring team members can operate at their best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:50:00">[55:50:00]</a>. As a company grows, processes constantly need to be adjusted to reduce new interferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:21:00">[56:21:00]</a>.

### Fostering Awareness and Transparency

As companies grow, people can lose touch with what's happening across the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:14:00">[57:14:00]</a>. To combat this, Katie's design teams regularly share screenshots or prototypes of their work in a shared Google Slide deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:42:00">[57:42:00]</a>.

*   This practice, done every couple of weeks, allows designers to see what others are working on, identify collaboration opportunities, and learn from patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:00:00">[58:00:00]</a>.
*   The decks are also shared with product managers, engineering leaders, and company leaders, providing a clear visual overview of ongoing development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:21:00">[58:21:00]</a>.
*   This "opening up the curtain" on work-in-progress, while initially challenging, helps identify redundant projects or misalignments sooner, ultimately improving work quality and saving time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>.

### Embracing Bold Ideas

Companies should fight against the "fear of bold ideas" or only pursuing incremental changes because they are easier to measure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:01">[01:08:01]</a>.

*   **"Reach for the stars, land on the Moon"**: This motto encourages creating a vision for the ideal, comprehensive experience (an "11-star experience") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:02">[01:09:02]</a>.
*   This North Star vision, even if only implemented incrementally, guides the entire process, ensuring that individual efforts contribute to a cohesive, high-quality outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:40">[01:10:40]</a>.

## Hiring for Success

When hiring designers (or any team member), focus on qualities beyond just technical skills:

*   **Taste and Character**: It's easier to teach tools and processes than to instill great taste and strong character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:28">[01:11:28]</a>. Look for a "hit rate for great judgment and great taste" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:41">[01:11:41]</a>.
*   **Humility**: A humble individual will be more attentive to user feedback, curious about challenges, and collaborative within a team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:05">[01:12:05]</a>.
*   **Hustle/Hutzpah**: The act of creation can be daunting, and having the courage to propose new ideas, fight for quality, and execute rapidly is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:47">[01:12:47]</a>.
*   **Early-Stage Hiring**: For younger companies, a "doer" is often needed initially, but it's important to also integrate a user-focused strategy from the start. This might involve a senior [[coaching_strategies_for_executive_success | leader/design advisor]] alongside a full-time executor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:42">[01:13:42]</a>.

## Philosophy of Design and [[Entrepreneurship lessons and strategies | Entrepreneurship]]

At its core, design is about bringing **intentionality** to decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:42">[01:19:42]</a>. Whether designing a doorknob or a company strategy, asking "who is impacted by this?" or "who is using this?" leads to better outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:49">[01:19:49]</a>. While design expertise brings creativity and taste, anyone can bring more care and intentionality to their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:47">[01:20:47]</a>.

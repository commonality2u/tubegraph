Many companies are facing significant challenges in their approach to building products, leading to a critical need for transformation. This involves moving away from outdated practices and embracing what is referred to as the "product operating model" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:16">[01:16:16]</a>. This model emphasizes principles and outcomes over rigid processes and outputs, aiming to give companies the best possible chance of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:15">[09:17:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:01:05">[10:01:05]</a>.

## Why Transformation is Necessary
Several macro-factors are converging to necessitate this shift in [[Challenges in Product Organizations | product organizations]]:

*   **Over-hiring and Lowered Standards**: Many companies over-hired during the pandemic, often lowering hiring bars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:50:00">[12:50:00]</a>. This led to "ridiculous roles" and an excess of staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:47:48">[12:47:48]</a>.
*   **Financial Pressures**: A change in the financial world has increased the cost of funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:02:00">[13:02:00]</a>.
*   **Impact of Generative AI**: The predicted impact of generative AI creates uncertainty and will have a very real impact on roles, though the exact timeframe is uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:13:00">[13:13:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:53:00">[13:53:00]</a>.
*   **Bloated Team Sizes**: Especially outside Silicon Valley, team sizes have "gotten out of hand," with an abundance of roles like agile coaches, product owners, [[Product Operations and Scaling Product Management | product Ops]], and business analysts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:19:00">[14:19:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:03:00">[15:03:00]</a>. Smaller, more effective teams can often produce more and better results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:39:00">[14:39:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:51:00">[14:51:00]</a>.
*   **Remote Work Challenges**: While full co-location is unlikely to return, remote employees have contributed to a "real hit" on velocity and innovation for many companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:34:00">[15:34:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:52:00">[15:52:00]</a>.
*   **Over-reliance on Processes**: Many companies believe the answer lies in processes, such as SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework), which is "depressingly popular" outside Silicon Valley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:00:00">[17:00:00]</a>. This often results in little in the way of outcomes despite significant cost and waste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:21:00">[17:21:00]</a>.

Companies need to take a hard look at how they build products and serve customers, learning from the best companies that achieve more with less proportional spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:04:00">[18:04:00]</a>.

## Product Management Theater vs. Empowered Product Teams
A significant issue is the prevalence of "product management theater" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:00">[05:09:00]</a>, where individuals carrying the [[Role of Product Managers in Organizations | product manager]] title are not performing the true role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:01:00">[24:01:00]</a>.

### Feature Teams (Delivery Teams)
Many organizations operate with "feature teams" or "delivery teams" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:09:00">[19:09:09]</a>.
*   **Output-focused**: They are given a roadmap of features or projects to design, build, test, and deploy, often with specific dates and timeframes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:07:00">[21:07:00]</a>.
*   **Project Management Role**: The [[Role of Product Managers in Organizations | product manager]] in such a team often functions as a project manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:16:00">[19:16:00]</a>, which may lead to engineers or designers preferring to handle the work themselves due to perceived lack of value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:28:00">[19:28:00]</a>.
*   **Overpaid for Value**: Individuals in these roles are often "dramatically overpaid for the value they provide" because it's essentially a project management role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:02:00">[20:02:00]</a>.
*   **"Why" comes from elsewhere**: The rationale or "why" for features often comes from the product strategy, not the [[Role of Product Managers in Organizations | product manager]] on a feature team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:42:00">[25:42:00]</a>.
*   **Vulnerability**: These roles are among the most vulnerable when companies undergo cutbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:20:00">[29:20:00]</a>.

### Empowered Product Teams
In contrast, an empowered product team is focused on delivering outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:43:00">[21:43:00]</a>.
*   **Outcome-focused**: They are given customer problems or business problems to solve, with success measured by whether the problem is solved, not just by shipping a feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:50:00">[21:50:00]</a>.
*   **[[Impact in product management | Impact]] on Time to Money**: Strong product companies understand that it's about "time to money" – generating value – rather than just "time to market" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:31:00">[22:31:00]</a>.
*   **Creator Role**: The [[Role of Product Managers in Organizations | product manager]] on an empowered team is a "creator, not a facilitator" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:17:00">[25:17:00]</a>. They work alongside design and engineering to develop solutions that are usable, feasible, valuable, and viable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:08:00">[23:08:00]</a>.
*   **Essential Skills for [[Becoming more strategic in product management | Strategic Product Management]]**: A real [[Role of Product Managers in Organizations | product manager]] brings critical skills:
    *   Expertise in users and customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:01:00">[26:01:00]</a>.
    *   Understanding of data: how the product is used, how usage changes, and purchase patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:27:00">[26:27:00]</a>.
    *   Representation of business constraints: compliance, sales, marketing, financial cost, monetization, and legal issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:37:00">[26:37:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:51:00">[53:51:00]</a>.
    *   Deep understanding of the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:18:00">[27:18:00]</a>.
    *   The ability to assess [[Impact in product management | viability]] (does it work for the business – can it be sold, marketed, serviced, is it compliant and legal?) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:51:00">[53:51:00]</a>.

## The Product Operating Model Defined
The product operating model is a conceptual model, not a rigid process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:01">[01:04:01]</a>. It boils down to a set of 20 core principles that are consistently found in the best product companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:30">[01:04:30]</a>. These principles guide how a company operates and innovates.

The model covers three main dimensions:
1.  **Deciding What to Work On**: This involves the product strategy, where leaders determine which problems to solve and "place the bets" for the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:28">[01:05:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:38">[01:05:38]</a>.
2.  **Solving Problems**: Teams need the skills for product discovery to come up with good solutions that work for both the customer and the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:46">[01:05:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:51">[01:05:51]</a>.
3.  **Building, Testing, and Deploying Product**: This dimension focuses on reliable, demonstrable delivery that shows clear outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:02">[01:06:02]</a>.

### Core Competencies
The product operating model relies on four key competencies, often new for most companies in their true form, even if titles exist:
1.  **Real Product Manager**: A serious [[Role of Product Managers in Organizations | product manager]], not a product owner or feature team product manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:02">[01:07:02]</a>.
2.  **Real Product Designer**: Encompassing service design, interaction design, visual design, and user research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:09">[01:07:09]</a>.
3.  **Real Tech Lead**: Crucial for technical leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:15">[01:07:15]</a>.
4.  **Real Product Leader**: A manager who knows how to coach their people and execute a real product strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:19">[01:07:19]</a>.

### Key Principles
Examples of principles found in the product operating model:
*   Innovation is more important than predictability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:51">[01:08:51]</a>.
*   Learning is more important than failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:56">[01:08:56]</a>.
*   Principles are more important than process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:58">[01:08:58]</a>.
*   Teams are empowered with problems to solve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:05">[01:09:05]</a>.
*   Teams have a real sense of ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:14">[01:09:14]</a>.
*   Addressing product risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:23">[01:09:23]</a>.
*   Embracing quick experimentation and testing ideas responsibly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:26">[01:09:26]</a>.
*   Small, frequent, uncoupled releases, often supported by CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery) and robust instrumentation/monitoring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:35">[01:09:35]</a>.

## Addressing Specific Roles and Concepts

### Product Operations (Product Ops)
[[Product Operations and Scaling Product Management | Product Ops]] is analogous to DevOps or Design Ops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:57">[01:11:57]</a>. In good companies, the core of [[Product Operations and Scaling Product Management | product Ops]] involves user research and data analysts, consolidating these functions under one leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:16">[01:12:16]</a>. This provides small, high-leverage support to product teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:43">[01:14:43]</a>. However, it can be misinterpreted, with some companies focusing on "process and governance," which is a "huge red flag" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:06">[01:13:06]</a>. There is also a concern that some product leaders use [[Product Operations and Scaling Product Management | product Ops]] to avoid their own responsibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>.

### Founders and Hiring Product Managers
It is often advised that founders should avoid hiring [[Role of Product Managers in Organizations | product managers]] too soon, as the founder's job initially is to be the product person responsible for value and viability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:56">[01:15:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:33">[01:16:33]</a>. Bringing in a real [[Role of Product Managers in Organizations | product manager]] too early can cause conflict, leading to "too many cooks in the kitchen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:41">[01:16:41]</a>. It becomes more useful to hire [[Role of Product Managers in Organizations | product managers]] once a company reaches a certain scale, often around 20-25 engineers, or after achieving [[Creating productmarket fit and operationalizing product quality | product-market fit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:03">[01:17:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:25">[01:17:25]</a>.

## Challenges in [[The future of product management | Product Management Field]]
Many individuals in the [[Role of Product Managers in Organizations | product management]] industry view themselves as victims, "stuck in a feature team" with no recourse but to quit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:36">[01:01:36]</a>. However, there is significant agency available to individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>.

*   **Misleading Advice**: A major frustration is that much of the online content and certifications for [[Role of Product Managers in Organizations | product managers]] (up to 90%) propagates the "feature team" model, rather than true product management principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>. This makes it difficult for new [[Role of Product Managers in Organizations | product managers]] to learn the right way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>.
*   **"Buyer Beware"**: Individuals must exercise judgment and critical thinking when seeking advice and evaluating potential managers or companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:11">[01:17:11]</a>.
*   **Sales-Driven Companies**: Some argue that sales-driven, feature-factory companies are acceptable, but this often leads to poor product quality and may not be sustainable long-term when competing with companies employing a true product model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:50">[01:17:50]</a>.
*   **AI Disruption**: The administrative and project management tasks common in feature teams are highly vulnerable to automation by generative AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:57:00">[52:57:00]</a>. This further emphasizes the need for [[Role of Product Managers in Organizations | product managers]] to "uplevel" their skills to focus on value and viability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:57:00">[52:57:00]</a>.

## Transforming for Survival and Success
Companies must take a hard look at how they build products and serve customers, and how to best meet their needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>. Those that transform have the best chance to survive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:29">[01:08:29]</a>. Individuals can also take control of their careers by assessing and raising their skills, which can lead to appreciation and promotion within their current company, or even inspire broader organizational change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>. This transformation requires not only empowered teams but also leaders doing their job of setting strategic direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:11">[01:08:11]</a>.

In the business world, storytelling is a significant buzzword, with many aspiring to be storytellers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, truly being a storyteller means differentiating oneself from the "herd," a risk many are unwilling to take <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The alternative, however, is being forgettable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. People often forget details from presentations or keynotes shortly after hearing them because our minds are not designed to retain facts, statistics, or platitudes not attached to imagery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. Therefore, the risk of not telling stories is being completely forgotten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

This article draws insights from Matthew Dicks, author of *Storyworthy*, a book widely regarded for its tactical and practical approach to [[the_power_of_storytelling_in_communication | storytelling]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. Dicks, a 59-time Moth StorySlam winner and nine-time GrandSlam champion, also teaches [[crafting_compelling_presentations | storytelling]] and public speaking to individuals and teams at companies like Slack, Amazon, Lego, and Salesforce through his company, Speak Up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

## The Core of Every Story: The 5-Second Moment

Every compelling story revolves around a singular "5-second moment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. This moment represents either:
*   **Transformation:** A change from one type of person to another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.
*   **Realization:** A shift in belief or understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

These changes, while seeming to occur over time, culminate in a single, distinct moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. The purpose of a story is to bring this moment to the clearest possible light for the audience, allowing them to experience the transformation or realization alongside the storyteller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. The vast majority of a story (98%) provides the context needed to reach this singular moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. This holds true for oral stories, written novels, movies, and TV shows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE] Matthew Dicks's Story of Eileen
> As an elementary school teacher, Dicks recounts a moment with a student named Eileen, who had anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. He had been working to build her confidence since September <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. One day, he hesitated to call her to the board for math due to the risk of upsetting her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. Afterward, he asked her if she was ready, and her cheeky reply, "First of all, I don't like that cheeky smile of yours," became his 5-second moment of realization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. He realized Eileen trusted him and felt confident enough to be herself, indicating she was ready to be called to the board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. This brief story could be expanded to include the journey of building her confidence and Dicks's past teaching failures, all leading to that pivotal moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.

## Story Structure: Beginning and End in Opposition

Knowing the 5-second moment of change or realization helps shape the entire story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. For true stories, storytellers should start at the end, as the ending informs everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. A story, at its essence, is about two moments in time – a beginning and an end – operating in opposition to each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE] Star Wars and Romantic Comedies
> *   **Star Wars (A New Hope):** The story is about Luke Skywalker, who initially relies on technology, but through Obi-Wan Kenobi, learns to believe in the Force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. His transformation moment is when he turns off his targeting computer and uses the Force to destroy the Death Star, embodying a shift from no religion to having religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. This resonates universally because people understand the journey of finding belief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.
> *   **Romantic Comedies:** In movies like *When Harry Met Sally*, the audience knows from the start that the two protagonists, who claim to dislike each other, will end up together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>. The enjoyment comes from the journey, not the unknown outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>.

Starting with the end guarantees that the story has something important to say, unlike mere chronological reporting of events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.

## Elements of a Compelling Story

### The Dinner Test (Authenticity)
A good story, especially in formal settings like a keynote or a pitch, should closely resemble a story one would tell someone at a dinner table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>. This means avoiding "performance art" elements such as unattributed dialogue or starting with a sound effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>. The aim is a slightly elevated, natural way of speaking, free from verbal detritus like "you know" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>.

### Tell *Your* Story (Vulnerability)
Stories should be about the storyteller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>. Telling a story about someone else, especially if they are not present, can feel like fiction to the audience and lacks the crucial element of vulnerability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>. Storytelling requires opening up one's heart and mind, sharing something meaningful or even something most people wouldn't share publicly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:49">[00:18:49]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE] Personal Connection in Business
> Marsha Rovski, formerly Director of Corporate Communications at Slack, had to craft a narrative to compete with Microsoft Teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:04">[00:42:04]</a>. Her brilliant narrative originated from an inspiration she had while feeling lonely during the pandemic, with two glasses of wine on a Tuesday night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:42">[00:42:42]</a>. Initially, she omitted these personal details, but later, for a smaller audience, she included a 30-second anecdote about that night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:24">[00:43:24]</a>. The result was a profound connection with the audience, who related to her human experience rather than a corporate persona <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:41">[00:43:41]</a>.
>
> In business, avoid being "round, white, and flavorless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:44">[00:46:44]</a>. Instead, be full of color, edge, and flavor, striving to be an individual people remember <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:48">[00:46:48]</a>. Incorporate personal details strategically. For instance, if asked "How are you doing today?", a personal yet amusing answer, like mentioning "my fifth graders were actually decent human beings today," reveals personality and creates a connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:52">[00:47:52]</a>.

### Importance of Change and Universal Appeal
Change is crucial because it has a great universal appeal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>. While specific daily events may only resonate with those in similar fields, the experience of personal change – like finding confidence – is relatable to a much wider audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>. Focusing on change exponentially increases a story's universal appeal and ability to connect with an audience, even if the content is unrelated to their own lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>.

### Building Stakes and Suspense
Stakes are what the audience should be worried about, wanting for the storyteller, or wondering about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:34">[00:23:34]</a>. Without stakes, the audience stops listening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:44">[00:23:44]</a>. Assuming the audience is not inherently interested, a storyteller must relentlessly work to make them wonder what the next sentence will be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:09">[00:24:09]</a>.

> [!TIP] Ways to Add Stakes to Your Story
> 1.  **Elephant at the beginning:** Immediately present a significant challenge or conflict that makes the audience wonder what will happen next. This is like the large spaceship shooting at a small spaceship in *Star Wars* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:24">[00:25:24]</a>. It doesn't have to be the main point of the story, but it grabs attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:08">[00:26:08]</a>.
> 2.  **Backpack:** Share your plan or hopes with the audience before executing them, so they carry your hopes and dreams with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:22">[00:26:22]</a>. If the plan goes awry, they feel the "oh no" moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:38">[00:26:38]</a>.
> 3.  **Breadcrumbs:** Offer hints or incomplete ideas that create anticipation, like a gun introduced in a room, indicating it will eventually be relevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>.
> 4.  **Hourglass:** When the audience is on the edge of their seat, slow down time and add details to prolong the suspense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:21">[00:27:21]</a>. This makes them wait for the resolution, increasing engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:32">[00:27:32]</a>.
> 5.  **Crystal Ball:** Predict a future outcome, often a terrible one, to make the audience worry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:48">[00:27:48]</a>. Even if the prediction is not accurate, if it's realistic, it creates a powerful stake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:11">[00:28:11]</a>.
>
> Stakes should build throughout a story, rather than being front-loaded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:49">[00:31:49]</a>. While most stakes should occur in the first half to engage the audience, new stakes can be introduced through plot in the second half to maintain momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a>.

### The Power of Surprise
Surprise is a delightful moment when the audience doesn't anticipate something, but once it happens, they understand why it was inevitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:33">[00:28:33]</a>. A great surprise is both inevitable and unexpected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:16">[00:29:16]</a>. This requires planting enough information earlier in the story so that when the surprise occurs, the audience feels it was logically destined, yet the information was cleverly hidden to prevent them from seeing it coming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:22">[00:29:22]</a>.

### Incorporating Humor
Humor is a brilliant, beautiful, and simple way to differentiate yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:48">[00:51:48]</a>. Being funny involves taking a risk and expecting the audience to find something funny, which can be daunting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:29">[00:50:29]</a>. However, it allows you to stand out like a "Phoenix that everyone has been waiting to hear all day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:28">[00:51:28]</a>.

> [!TIP] Strategies for Humor in Business:
> 1.  **Nostalgia:** Leverage the past to create humor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:27">[00:53:27]</a>. Describing old technology (like a 22-pound VCR) or past societal norms (no allergies, no helmets) can be inherently funny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:32">[00:53:32]</a>. In business, this works well when rolling out new products or services, allowing you to speak nostalgically about old ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:57">[00:53:57]</a>. It also demonstrates expertise and a deep understanding of your field's history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:33">[00:56:33]</a>.
> 2.  **"One of These Things Is Not Like the Other" (Sesame Street game):** Present three items, where two are expected, and one is unexpected and therefore funny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:54">[00:56:54]</a>. For example, a hardware store might sell shovels (expected), offer a wide selection of nails (expected), but also have a "nameless, faceless machine" for self-checkout (unexpected and amusing) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:06">[00:57:06]</a>.

Humor, when embedded within a story, is less risky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:35">[00:58:35]</a>. If a joke doesn't land, the story still progresses, and the audience may not even realize humor was intended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:37">[00:58:37]</a>.

## Crafting a Story's Opening

To begin a story effectively and grab the audience's attention, use two key elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:17">[01:38:17]</a>:

1.  **Location:** Start by stating where the story takes place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>. Location activates imagination, allowing the audience to apply a thousand adjectives and visualize the setting with clarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:29">[01:38:29]</a>. This creates a fully realized environment in their minds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:50">[01:38:50]</a>.
2.  **Action:** Immediately describe something happening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:01">[01:39:01]</a>. This signals to the audience that the narrative is moving forward, capturing their attention from the outset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:07">[01:39:07]</a>. Like movies starting with immediate action (e.g., a spaceship battle), this grabs people right away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:13">[01:39:13]</a>.

For individuals who may find it harder to command attention in a room (e.g., marginalized groups), starting with "I'm in a place doing a thing" signals to people that a story is about to be told <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:05">[01:40:05]</a>. This can silence the room and provide the speaker the space to share their story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:32">[01:40:32]</a>.

## Practical Application: Homework for Life

[[exercises_to_generate_and_collect_story_ideas | Homework for Life]] is a process to ensure an endless supply of stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:04">[01:09:04]</a>. The core idea is to reflect each day, before bed, and note down one moment from the day that would be worth telling as a story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:35">[01:07:35]</a>. This is typically done in a simple two-column spreadsheet (date and a stretched-out column for the moment) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:49">[01:07:49]</a>.

Initially, one might find less than two moments per day, but over time, one develops a "lens for storytelling," seeing more and more potential moments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:34">[01:08:34]</a>. Dicks, for example, started at 1.8 moments per day and now finds 7.6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:52">[01:08:52]</a>. Only about 10% of these moments become full stories or parts of stories, but the other 90% are valuable for holding onto one's days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:29">[01:10:29]</a>.

> [!INFO] Benefits Beyond Story Collection:
> *   **Time Recovery:** This practice helps recover time, making days feel longer and more accounted for, rather than feeling like time "flies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:39">[01:11:39]</a>.
> *   **Pattern Recognition:** Observing daily moments helps one identify patterns in their life they might otherwise miss, leading to deeper self-understanding and new story ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:08">[01:12:08]</a>.
> *   **Memory Recovery:** Actively looking for daily moments can trigger forgotten memories from the past, which can also be added to the log <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:41">[01:10:41]</a>.

To start, consistently record moments daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:52">[01:15:52]</a>. Even on days with seemingly minor events, record something. Consider doing this periodically throughout the day to capture fleeting observations before they are forgotten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:03">[01:18:03]</a>.

## Overcoming Public Speaking Nerves
Public speaking is often a major fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:57">[01:19:57]</a>. The good news is that 98% of nervousness occurs *before* speaking; once the speech begins, much of it dissipates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:01">[01:20:01]</a>. This pre-talk nervousness is normal and experienced by most people, even famous performers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>.

> [!TIP] Reducing Public Speaking Nerves:
> 1.  **Preparation:** Knowing your material reduces anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:12">[01:21:12]</a>.
> 2.  **Passive Listening to Recordings:** Record your talk and listen to it passively while doing other activities (e.g., shopping, chores) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:23">[01:22:23]</a>. This allows the material to "seep into your soul" and become part of you, making recall effortless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:35">[01:22:35]</a>.
> 3.  **Active Listening for Transitions:** When actively listening to your recording, pay close attention to the transitions between sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:10">[01:23:10]</a>. Most people forget transitions, not the main points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:15">[01:23:15]</a>. Practice these scene-to-scene movements without necessarily reciting the full story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:02">[01:24:02]</a>.
> 4.  **Avoid Memorizing:** Memorizing a talk can lead to suffering if you forget a line. Instead, aim to "remember your talk without memorizing your talk" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:31">[01:24:31]</a>.

## The Power of Saying "Yes"
Instead of saying no and presuming what an opportunity holds, say "yes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:51">[01:26:51]</a>. Saying no, out of fear or hubris, prevents exploration and discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:56">[01:27:56]</a>. A "yes" can always become a "no" later; you can step through a door, try something, and if it's not for you, step back out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:38">[01:27:38]</a>.

Saying "yes" to frightening opportunities, like taking a stand-up comedy class when you're terrified of failing, can lead to extraordinary outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:05">[01:29:05]</a>. These "yeses" can create unforeseen causal chains, introducing you to people and opportunities you never would have encountered otherwise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:30">[01:29:30]</a>. The things that scare us are often the best for us <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:15">[01:29:15]</a>.

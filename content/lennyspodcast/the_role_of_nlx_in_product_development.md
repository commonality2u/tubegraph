Natural Language Interface (NLX) is emerging as the new User Experience (UX) in [[leveraging_ai_in_product_development | product development]], especially with the rise of AI and agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This shift requires product builders to think differently about design and interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>.

## NLX: The New UX
Traditionally, user interfaces have been consciously designed around Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs), which are rigid and require explicit design due to their unnatural nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>. However, natural language and conversational interfaces are much more "elastic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>.

A common misconception among product builders is that with AI, the model "eats the product," implying no design is needed as users simply chat with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. This is incorrect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>. Just like human conversations have grammar, structures, and invisible UI elements (e.g., a podcast vs. a meeting) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>, natural language interfaces also require thoughtful design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>.

## New Principles and Constructs in NLX
The shift to NLX is introducing new constructs and principles for designing interactive experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>:

*   **Prompt**
    The prompt itself is a new UI element, similar to how a dropdown or menu once was <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>.
*   **Plans**
    When a user gives a high-level goal to an agent, the agent returning a plan (ideally an editable one) is a new and powerful construct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>.
*   **Showing the Work (Progress)**
    Products like GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, and DeepSeek demonstrate "thinking aloud" or "showing the work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:49">[00:19:49]</a>. The challenge is balancing verbosity â€“ too much can feel like a backend process, while too little can erode user confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:03">[00:20:03]</a>. This transparency helps users understand what's happening under the "black box" of AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a>.
*   **Follow-ups**
    Proactively suggesting logical next steps is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>. This requires careful design to avoid being annoying (too many suggestions) or losing an opportunity to guide the user towards a successful outcome (too few suggestions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:13">[00:21:13]</a>.

These new elements make NLX a rich area for [[importance_of_design_and_functionality_in_product_development | product design]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>. The depth of design in seemingly simple conversational interfaces may surprise many <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a>.

## Personalization in NLX
Over time, NLX is ripe for personalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:10">[00:22:10]</a>. Just as human interactions differ, so too will interfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:16">[00:22:16]</a>. Some users might prefer direct, summarized answers (TLDDR), while others prefer a detailed account of the AI's process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>.

## Implications for Product Development
The core principle in this new era of [[the_role_of_ai_in_product_management | AI in product development]] is the importance of prototyping and building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. It's often stated that "demos precede memos" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:59">[00:23:59]</a>. Prompt sets are effectively the new Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:17">[00:23:17]</a>. This approach accelerates the feedback loop in [[developing_a_product_strategy | product building]] by enabling high-bandwidth communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:50">[00:23:50]</a>.

While the time to the first demo is significantly shorter with AI tools, the time to full deployment might be longer, creating an uneven cadence in the [[developing_longterm_strategic_approaches_in_product_development | product development]] cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:08">[00:24:08]</a>. The ease of generating ideas and prototypes raises the "floor" for products, but also the "ceiling," meaning products need to be exceptional to stand out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:53">[00:24:53]</a>.

The role of "taste-making" and "editing" becomes even more critical for product leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:43">[00:25:43]</a>. Without strong editorial guidance, there's a risk of creating a "Frankenstein product" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. While AI enables many people to experiment, the role of experienced product professionals in curating and refining ideas is indispensable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:36">[00:25:36]</a>.

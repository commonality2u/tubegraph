## Building New Products Within Larger Companies

Executive coach Matt Mochary identifies that one of the most important skills for a leader is to learn how to fire people, and the second most important skill is to [[innovating_within_large_companies | innovate within a larger company]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>. He explains that it is incredibly difficult for large companies to innovate, primarily because their core products have millions of users, requiring constant vigilance to ensure site uptime and prevent security breaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:42">[00:55:42]</a>.

### The Challenge of Innovation in Large Companies

The rigorous review process for adding new code or features to a scaled product makes it difficult for innovators to get their prototypes and new features approved in a timely manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:56">[00:55:56]</a>. This means a company's product team or head of product often becomes a bottleneck, hindering rapid iteration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:26">[00:56:26]</a>.

### The "YC Startup Within a Company" Model

Mochary's solution to this challenge involves creating internal "YC startups" that operate independently from the core business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:47">[00:54:47]</a>.

Key elements of this model:
*   **Founder Mentality** The head of the new product team should possess a "founder mentality," someone willing to "break glass" and relentlessly pursue their vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:57">[00:54:57]</a>. Mochary suggests looking for individuals from the Y Combinator (YC) alumni list whose startups may have failed, as they often retain this drive and seek a company that is succeeding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:09">[00:55:09]</a>.
*   **Small Teams** The team should be kept very small to avoid the need for extensive buy-in and to maintain a shared understanding among all members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:24">[00:55:24]</a>.
*   **Decoupled Codebase** The new entity should not be touching the core code of the main product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:20">[00:56:20]</a>.
*   **Independent Reporting Structure** To avoid the slow approval processes within existing departments, the new product team should report directly to the CEO, bypassing heads of engineering or product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:34">[00:56:34]</a>.
*   **Separate Legal Entities (C-Corps)** Mochary's most radical idea is to create a completely new C Corporation for the new product. This makes it clear that it's its own entity and protects the core brand from any potential failures of the experimental product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:59">[00:56:59]</a>. This approach allows the teams to iterate faster because they know potential failures won't harm the company's main brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:55">[00:57:55]</a>.

### Real-World Application

Wee Ang, CEO of Clipboard Health, serves as a prime example of this model in practice. She created five new C Corps in just two months for new products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:44">[00:57:44]</a>. She even deployed two independent teams for each new product: one engineering-focused to build custom code, and another customer relationship-focused that used manual or off-the-shelf solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:05">[00:58:05]</a>. She then observes which approach makes more progress faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:27">[00:58:27]</a>.

### Motivation: Ownership Over Equity

Mochary argues that while people may fight for equity and money, what truly motivates them is the act of [[building_and_scaling_product_innovations | building and scaling product innovations]] that get used in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:17">[00:59:17]</a>. He believes that autonomy and ownership over decision-making and creation are more powerful motivators than large equity stakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:34">[00:59:34]</a>. Amazon, for instance, is known for not offering high equity but empowers teams with significant funding to pursue good ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:47">[00:59:47]</a>.

While fear can be a powerful, short-term motivator for founders (e.g., "if this doesn't work, I'm screwed") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:21">[01:00:21]</a>, it is corrosive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:33">[01:00:33]</a>. Joy, on the other hand, is considered a more sustainable and non-corrosive long-term motivator, allowing individuals to endure longer and enjoy the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:42">[01:00:42]</a>.

### Implementation and Success

Companies that have implemented this model, such as Scale AI and Attentive Mobile, are seeing positive results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:28">[01:01:28]</a>. Mochary suggests that as more examples of its success emerge, more companies are adopting this approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:37">[01:01:37]</a>. This method of [[building_0_to_1_products_within_a_company | building 0 to 1 products within a company]] can be a crucial strategy for larger organizations to remain agile and competitive.

In the B2B landscape, selling isn't about moving commodities, but rather about solving problems for customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. As sales representatives in SaaS, the goal is to help customers understand why a specific solution is the best fit for their needs, being honest about both strengths and weaknesses, and guiding them through the purchasing process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:53">[00:37:53]</a>. This approach stands in contrast to selling commodities, which often relies on high-pressure tactics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>.

## The Role of Sales in a Startup
According to Jason Lemkin, founder of SaaStr, if you are a B2B business, you will likely need a sales team eventually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:26">[00:26:26]</a>. While some companies like Canva and early Slack successfully deferred hiring a sales team due to epic self-serve products, most B2B businesses will eventually require a sales-led motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. Even companies that start with Product-Led Growth (PLG) often realize it's not working and transition to a sales-led approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. Most companies operate on a hybrid model, combining self-serve with sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.

Founders need to be honest about the sales motion required to acquire their first 10-20 customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. If customers require effort for deployment, have security questions, or need onboarding, a self-serve PLG motion alone will likely fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. Rejecting a sales-led approach due to personal discomfort can lead to significant revenue loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

### When to Hire Your First Salesperson
Founders should aim to close their first 10 customers personally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. This allows them to become proficient at the "middle part" of sales – talking about the product and market, answering questions, and building rapport – even if they aren't skilled at initial outreach or closing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>. Customers often prefer interacting directly with the CEO or founder in the early stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.

A key sign it's time to hire a salesperson is when more than 20% of a founder's time is booked with sales-related activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>. At this point, founders need leverage to avoid their calendar becoming unmanageable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>.

## Building Your First Sales Team
### Initial Hires and Roles
It's recommended to hire two sales reps initially to allow for A/B testing of human performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>. These first two hires should be **Account Executives (AEs)**, who are responsible for working and closing leads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:15">[01:06:15]</a>. They may also do some outbound and SDR work in the early days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:38">[01:08:38]</a>.

When interviewing, expect to speak with around 30 candidates to find the right fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>. Many will be unprepared, but look for one or two who seem like "magicians" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>.

**Qualities of Early Sales Hires:**
*   **Someone you would buy your own product from** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>. This indicates they understand the product and the customer's problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>.
*   **"Pirates and Romantics"**: Individuals with a bit of quirkiness, extra IQ points, and who genuinely love your product despite its early-stage limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>.
*   **Product Gurus/Experts**: Early sales team members must be deeply knowledgeable about your product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:32">[00:31:32]</a>.
*   **Experience**: A couple of years of B2B sales experience is ideal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:15">[00:26:15]</a>. They also need enough maturity to be trusted with precious early leads and customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:36">[00:26:36]</a>.
*   **Motivation**: They should genuinely love sales as a craft and be motivated by money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:12">[00:28:12]</a>. Avoid candidates who don't want to actively sell anymore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>.
*   **Past Experience Heuristic**: Prioritize candidates whose previous product was *harder* to sell than yours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:02">[00:55:02]</a>. This indicates they've developed strong selling skills and problem-solving abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:38">[00:55:38]</a>. Conversely, hiring from a company with an easier-to-sell product can lead to disaster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:14">[00:55:14]</a>. Look for those from more competitive or technical spaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:24">[00:57:24]</a>.

**Interviewing Tip**: Implement a "sell me this app" exercise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:45">[00:35:45]</a>. Give them time to prepare (e.g., by watching explainer videos or webinars) and have them pitch your product to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:55">[00:35:55]</a>. This reveals their product understanding and sales acumen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:14">[00:36:14]</a>. Also, always ask: "What do you want to do in your first 14 days?" The best candidates will mention meeting customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:31">[00:30:31]</a>.

### Compensation and Quota
Early sales compensation typically follows a 50/50 split between base salary and on-target earnings (OTE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:07">[00:47:07]</a>. In the very early days, consider a "ramp" period where reps keep 100% of what they close for the first one to three months to help them put "points on the board" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:09">[00:46:09]</a>.

The ultimate goal is for a sales rep to bring in 3-5 times what they take home in total compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:50">[00:47:50]</a>. If this ratio is achieved, don't be afraid for your sales reps to make a lot of money; it means the company is also making a lot of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:21">[00:52:21]</a>.

### Hiring a VP of Sales
Do not hire a VP of Sales until you have at least two sales reps consistently hitting quota and closing deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:27">[00:27:27]</a>. Hiring a VP of Sales too early (before repeatable sales are established) almost guarantees failure and burns through cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>. A VP of Sales's primary job is to scale a repeatable sales process from 3 reps to 300, not to find product-market fit or be the first rep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>.

The first VP of Sales should typically be a "stretch" hire (e.g., a former director) rather than a highly seasoned VP looking for their third gig <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:44">[01:02:44]</a>. This ensures they are willing to actively participate in selling ("carry a bag") and are deeply involved in deals 20-30 hours a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:08">[00:29:08]</a>. Avoid VPs who only want to manage and have no interest in selling the product themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:31">[00:32:31]</a>.

### Sales Organization Evolution
The sales organization typically grows based on "rules of eight" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:42">[01:00:42]</a>:
*   Eight Sales Development Representatives (SDRs) need one manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:43">[01:00:43]</a>. SDRs are entry-level positions focused on emailing, dialing, and screening leads to pass to AEs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:51">[01:05:51]</a>.
*   Eight Account Executives (AEs) need a director above them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:46">[01:00:46]</a>.
*   Eight directors could have a VP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:54">[01:00:54]</a>.

A VP of Sales should actively hunt for two directors once they have around eight direct AE reports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:40">[01:01:40]</a>.

## Product and Sales Collaboration
### Product's Involvement in Sales
Product leaders, especially the Head or VP of Product, should be deeply involved in sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:28">[01:10:28]</a>. They should attend key customer meetings, especially for large deals, as they possess the deep product knowledge and gravitas to make commitments that sales reps cannot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:06">[01:11:06]</a>. This involvement can be a strategic weapon for a B2B company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:56">[01:12:56]</a>.

### Managing Feature Requests from Sales
The tension between product and sales is a healthy sign of a well-run B2B company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>. To manage this tension effectively, give the head of sales a dedicated budget (e.g., 10% of story points) for feature requests each quarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:44">[01:14:44]</a>. This forces the sales team to prioritize their needs and discourages constant shifting priorities that can derail product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:51">[01:14:51]</a>.

Product leaders should hold weekly meetings with their team to review sales' prioritized requests, ensuring alignment and understanding of new inputs from the field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:41">[01:19:41]</a>.

### Other Advice for Sales and Product
*   **Trial Length**: The 14-day trial length became common because Salesforce sales teams wanted to close deals faster within the same month, not because it was better for the customer or product usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:19">[01:31:19]</a>. Consider longer or even infinite trials (like early Slack, Canva, or Zoom) if it aligns with customer needs and encourages product adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:56">[01:31:56]</a>.
*   **Annual Contracts**: Forcing smaller businesses (SMBs) into annual contracts is often bad advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:51">[01:32:51]</a>. It's better to let customers pay how they want to pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:06">[01:33:06]</a>. Product teams should act as the "voice of the customer" and push back against short-term financial gains that compromise customer experience and long-term compounding revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:28">[01:33:28]</a>.
*   **Product Team P&L/Revenue Goals**: Be cautious about "weaponizing" product teams by tying their KPIs directly to revenue goals, especially for experimental features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:18">[01:23:18]</a>. This can lead to customer-hostile tactics and "dark patterns" that negatively impact customer relationships and long-term compounding growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:57">[01:25:57]</a>. Focus on relentlessly bringing down churn, as this is critical for long-term growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:02">[01:27:02]</a>.
*   **"Year of the Customer"**: Founders and product leaders should prioritize making customers happier. This means stepping up, being the "VP of free" (championing the free user base) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:14">[01:41:14]</a>, and shipping "three great things" that truly add value to the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>. Great products inspire teams and drive growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:22">[01:41:22]</a>.

## Practical Sales Techniques
*   **Always ask for Next Steps**: In every meeting, learn to ask for a clear next step. This doesn't always have to be asking for money, but could be arranging another demo for different stakeholders or scheduling the next meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:41">[01:27:41]</a>. Don't simply end a Zoom call and wait for prospects to act; proactively move the deal forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>.
*   **Focus on Problem Solving**: B2B sales is about understanding and solving problems, not just pushing a product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. The best sales reps are experts who can explain the product's value, address competition, and understand the customer's environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:53">[00:37:53]</a>.

## Learnings from Running a Conference
SaaStr began as a community in 2011-2012 for B2B founders, evolving from meetups to large-scale annual events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:34">[01:50:34]</a>. The events serve as a meeting place for founders who have hit scale (1M-20M ARR), particularly those outside Silicon Valley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:35">[01:51:35]</a>.

**Surprising aspects of running a conference:**
*   **Cost**: Events are extremely expensive, with costs rising significantly at larger scales. While small meetups or steak dinners are cheap, large multi-day events can cost millions (e.g., $2 million for London, $10 million for Bay Area with 12,000 people) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:19">[01:54:19]</a>. Costs per attendee increase at scale, sometimes reaching $1,000-$2,000 per person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:55">[01:55:55]</a>.
*   **Dis-economies of Scale**: Unlike software, events often exhibit dis-economies of scale, meaning they become proportionally more expensive as they grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:44">[01:55:44]</a>. Many large tech companies used to run their own events but have largely given up due to the high costs and typical financial losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:10">[01:55:10]</a>.
*   **Planning**: Large events require extensive planning, often 14-16 months in advance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:34">[01:56:34]</a>.
*   **Value of Top-Tier Events**: Attendees typically go to only one or two major industry events per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:25">[01:57:25]</a>. It's worth attending or supporting these top-tier events, as they attract the best people and provide significant networking and marketing value. Sub-scale or lower-tier events are often not worth the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:43">[01:57:43]</a>.
*   **Customer Engagement**: Getting customers and prospects together, even for small dinners, can significantly boost sales because customers will sell to prospects for you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:23">[01:52:23]</a>.

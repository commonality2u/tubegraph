When searching for a job, individuals need a narrow, clear focus, similar to how a product is built with a specific [[product_market_fit_techniques | product market fit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This concept is termed "candidate market fit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. It's challenging to determine one's [[challenges_of_achieving_productmarket_fit | candidate market fit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, but realizing it's about the marketplace, not a personal failing, can be a relief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

## Defining Candidate Market Fit

Candidate market fit is a critical job search tactic, particularly important in a down market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>. The job search places individuals in a marketplace with supply and demand characteristics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>. For instance, if there is high supply, such as many Directors of Product in the tech world due to layoffs, a Director might need to consider a Senior Manager role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:59">[00:20:59]</a>. This shift is not a personal statement about the candidate but reflects the marketplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:44">[00:21:44]</a>. Understanding this market reality can be a great relief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:54">[00:21:54]</a>.

## Steps to Establish Candidate Market Fit

### 1. The Manukan Two-Pager: Defining Your Wants
The first radical step is to define what you want and don't want in a job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>. Most people, especially when laid off, tend to "spray and pray" applications without this clarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:12">[00:22:12]</a>. This initial slowdown is necessary to go fast, similar to a product person strategizing before building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>. The "Manukan two-pager," named after Allison Manukan, involves a simple document outlining likes and dislikes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:02">[00:23:02]</a>. Sharing this draft with a job search council allows for collaborative learning, where others' insights can help refine your own preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>.

### 2. The Listening Tour: Gathering Market Feedback
Once a draft of the Manukan two-pager is complete, the next step is to conduct a "listening tour" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>. As the job seeker, your skills and experience are the "product" being brought to market, so it's crucial to understand what the market wants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:46">[00:24:46]</a>.

There are three types of structured listening tour conversations:
*   **Reverse Exit Interviews:** Speak with former colleagues to understand your strengths and what roles they believe you're a fit for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:18">[00:27:18]</a>.
*   **Broader Network:** Engage your wider network, asking the "golden question": "If you were in my shoes, how would you approach this?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:34">[00:27:34]</a>.
*   **Recruiters:** Recruiters prefer specific questions about market fit and advice rather than being barraged with "get me a job" requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:42">[00:27:42]</a>. Building relationships with recruiters, even when not actively looking for a job, is highly beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:09">[00:28:09]</a>.

The listening tour serves to gather market research and customer feedback on your fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:20">[00:26:20]</a>. It also helps create a network of "listening posts" â€“ people invested in your success who might inform you of relevant opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:29">[00:26:29]</a>. While some feedback may be difficult or even unhelpful, the job search council can help interpret and process it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:28">[00:30:28]</a>.

### 3. Creating a Narrow Candidate Market Fit Statement
After completing 10-15 listening tour conversations, it's time to create a focused candidate market fit statement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:04">[00:31:04]</a>. It's natural to want this statement to be broad and expansive, but like [[product_market_fit_techniques | product market fit]], a narrow, clear focus is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:16">[00:31:16]</a>. When looking for a job, you need a "spear, not a net" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>. A specific statement, such as "I am looking for a director of product role in a healthcare Series B startup in San Francisco," allows your network to be expansive in their thinking on your behalf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:49">[00:32:49]</a>. Conversely, a broad statement like "I'll take any product job" makes it difficult for people to remember you or identify suitable opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:39">[00:32:39]</a>.

Common attributes to consider for your CMF statement include:
*   Stage of company (e.g., startup, large enterprise) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:01">[00:35:01]</a>
*   Industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:20">[00:35:20]</a>
*   Level of role (e.g., individual contributor, director, VP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:22">[00:35:22]</a>
*   Function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:24">[00:35:24]</a>
*   Culture (e.g., specific policies, remote/hybrid preferences) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:26">[00:35:26]</a>

Once your CMF statement is refined and approved by your job search council, share it widely with your network and on platforms like LinkedIn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:08">[00:34:08]</a>. The market is dynamic, so your CMF may change over time, requiring flexibility and adaptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:32">[00:34:32]</a>.

## Challenges and Mindset in CMF
It can be difficult to accept a candidate market fit that suggests a lower-level role than previously held <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:31">[00:39:31]</a>. For example, a senior executive from traditional media might need to take an individual contributor role at a top streaming company because the market values different experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:03">[00:39:03]</a>. This can be "hard and humiliating at times" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:55">[00:39:55]</a>.

Some individuals may need a "two-step strategy" to reach their desired role, taking an intermediate position to gain relevant experience before moving to their ultimate goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:41">[00:40:41]</a>. It's crucial to remain active in your job search, especially by continually updating your network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:06">[00:44:06]</a>. Being passive, abandoning networking, or not updating your CMF can lead to getting stuck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:27">[00:44:27]</a>.

## The Role of Job Search Councils
[[customer_interactions_and_productmarket_fit | Job search councils]] are supportive groups of 6-8 job seekers who commit to supporting each other through the job search process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:30">[02:57:30]</a>. They provide a methodology to figure out candidate market fit and encourage playing to win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>. Everyone, regardless of their seniority, feels insecure and anxious in the job market, and doing it alone magnifies these feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>. These councils transform anxiety into hope, motivation, accountability, and confidence by fostering openness and vulnerability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>. This support is especially vital when grappling with the potentially humbling realities of candidate market fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:25">[00:31:25]</a>.

Jason Fried, co-founder and CEO of 37signals, advocates for an approach to business decision-making that heavily relies on gut instinct, intuition, and feeling, rather than solely on data and long-term planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:09">[01:49:09]</a>. This philosophy is a cornerstone of 37signals' unique operational model, which emphasizes independence, efficiency, and simplicity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:52">[01:03:52]</a>.

## Intuition vs. Data-Driven Decisions

Fried believes that while data can play a part in decision-making, it is ultimately a [[nonlinear_decision_making_in_business | judgment call]] made by humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:51">[01:44:51]</a>. He admits that he doesn't always know *why* he makes certain calls, but he's comfortable admitting that <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:46">[01:45:46]</a>. He posits that executives are often hired for their judgment and experience, not just their ability to read spreadsheets, as these qualities bring "undescribable things to bear" on business decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>.

> "I'm comfortable admitting that that I don't really know why I'm making these calls but I'm making these calls regardless and I'm not looking at number and going if this is 51% versus 49% I'm going this way for sure that could be an input perhaps but it's not the only input." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:46">[01:45:46]</a>

He stresses the importance of trusting one's intuition and gut, as it has "absorbed everything" and often contains valuable, though unquantifiable, insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:32">[01:46:32]</a>.

## Operationalizing Instinct and Feeling

At 37signals, this emphasis on feeling and intuition is woven into the company's culture and processes:

*   **Questioning beyond "knowing":** Fried often asks team members "what do you think?" or "how does this feel?" rather than "what do you know?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:45">[01:47:45]</a>. This encourages team members to share their subjective perceptions about products, flows, words, or colors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:02">[01:48:02]</a>.
*   **Rejection of hard targets:** The company operates without financial goals, OKRs, KPIs, revenue targets, or growth targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:48">[01:48:48]</a>. Success is defined by profitability and the desire to "do it again" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:17">[01:06:17]</a>. This aligns with [[unquantifiable_metrics_and_the_importance_of_joy_and_delight_in_business | unquantifiable metrics]] like pride and enjoyment in the work itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:16">[01:11:16]</a>.
*   **Flexible planning:** Instead of long-term plans, they rethink their direction every six weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:28">[01:03:28]</a>. This allows for adaptability and ensures decisions are based on current thinking, not past assumptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:40">[01:04:40]</a>. This highlights a [[practical_application_of_strategic_thinking_in_business | practical application of strategic thinking]] that is agile and responsive.

### Hiring for Intuition

When hiring designers and product people, Fried looks for candidates whose "gut is filled with ideas" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:41">[00:52:41]</a>. He probes their taste, what products they admire, and their influences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:10">[00:51:10]</a>. During interview projects, he'll ask what they would do with more time to see where their raw instincts lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:57">[00:51:57]</a>. He seeks a "synchronicity" and "resonance" in riffing on ideas, indicating a shared intuitive wavelength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:18">[00:53:18]</a>.

### "Play" in Product Development

The process of exploring ideas is described as "play" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:50">[00:54:50]</a>. This contrasts with a "rigid, boring approach" and allows for creative exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:03">[00:55:03]</a>. This sense of play is seen as a key aspect of their independent business model, fostering "creative exploration" and excitement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:51">[01:30:51]</a>.

## The Benefits of Trusting Gut Instinct

Relying on gut instinct allows for greater flexibility and responsiveness. Without external investors or the pressure for infinite growth, 37signals can adapt its direction as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:06">[01:04:06]</a>. This contrasts with the "default path" of venture-backed companies that often leads to fixed goals like exits or massive scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:43">[01:02:43]</a>.

Fried likens their company to a "stick shift business," where everything is direct, tight, and straightforward, without many layers of abstraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:05">[01:43:05]</a>. This directness, much like driving an older car, provides a "real directness" and connection to the work that can be lost in more "simulated" or automated large businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:57">[01:43:57]</a>.

## When Gut Instinct Flourishes

The environment for nurturing intuition and gut instinct is best when constraints are present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:35">[01:19:35]</a>. Having "loads of money" creates "very few constraints" which tends to lead to sloppiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:40">[01:19:40]</a>. Bootstrapping a business, for example, forces entrepreneurs to "figure out how to make money," building essential "scrappy skills" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:56">[01:19:56]</a>.

> "The reason I think it's great for entrepreneurs to to start bootstrapping is because they just have more practice making money they get better and better and better at the fundamental skill you need to have ultimately to a successful business which is to make money." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:47">[01:18:47]</a>

## Future Exploration: A Book on Intuition

Fried is considering writing a new book focused on the role of gut and intuition in business decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:29">[01:45:29]</a>. This book would aim to celebrate and explore how intuition is used in hiring, product decisions, and policy, providing a counter-narrative to traditional business literature that often emphasizes measurable outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:51">[01:45:51]</a>. He recalls a conversation with Charlie Munger, who affirmed the power of trusting instinct and acknowledged that many innovations occur because one doesn't know how others do things, relying solely on gut and feeling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:40">[01:47:40]</a>.

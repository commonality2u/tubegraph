Shas Doshi emphasizes the critical importance of developing and evaluating one's "good taste" as a product leader, extending beyond just product aesthetics to the underlying beliefs and decision-making frameworks that guide a career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:46">[00:25:46]</a>. This insight emerged from his own career reflections, recognizing mistakes he made early on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:08">[00:26:08]</a>.

## The Misconception of Strategy and Execution

Early in his career at Google, Shas encountered an environment where the prevailing belief was, "we don't do strategy here, strategy is for MBAs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:36">[00:26:36]</a>. He adopted this mantra, asserting that "execution is everything and we don't do strategy around here" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a>. Even when a more experienced PM tried to guide him towards considering [[developing_and_implementing_product_strategy|strategy]], he dismissed it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:15">[00:27:15]</a>.

The realization of this error came during his time at Twitter around 2014, post-IPO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:44">[00:27:44]</a>. Despite Twitter possessing incredible assets—its product, network effects, brand, and talent—the company and its product were struggling to meet their potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:04">[00:28:04]</a>. Shas recognized that Twitter's biggest challenge was a "product strategy problem," lacking a "real compelling cohesive product strategy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:26">[00:28:26]</a>. This experience, further solidified at Stripe while growing earlier-stage products, highlighted the immense [[the_importance_of_strategy_and_decisionmaking_in_product_leadership|importance of a clear product strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:10">[00:29:10]</a>.

## Redefining "Taste" in Product Leadership

Traditionally, "taste" in product management often refers to "beautiful pixels," "perfect product," or the "Steve Jobs-esque passion" for design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:28">[00:29:28]</a>. However, Shas suggests a deeper meaning:

> "Taste is about the beliefs we choose to create within ourselves as product leaders, and then those beliefs end up dictating everything we do, including how we manage, how we lead, how we make decisions." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:05">[00:30:05]</a>

This broader definition of taste involves how product leaders "evaluate things that come my way," focusing not just on product flows, but on "what are the things I choose to believe, how do I learn, who do I learn from, what content I learn from, what content I resonate with" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:28">[00:30:28]</a>. Shas embarked on a journey to cultivate this better taste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:15">[00:31:15]</a>.

### True Taste: Recognizing Quality Without Immediate Results

True taste, according to Shas, is "the ability to identify what is really good without needing to see its results" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:38">[00:31:38]</a>. It requires discernment beyond mere observation of success. For example, recognizing Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang as a genius in 2024, after massive stock price growth, requires "Zero taste" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:09">[00:32:09]</a>. The true taste would have been recognizing his genius in 2010, before the widespread success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:33">[00:32:33]</a>. This is akin to the sports adage "game recognize game" – identifying talent during practice, not just after a player becomes famous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:50">[00:32:50]</a>.

Shas also cautions against becoming "stuff graders" who dismiss everything as "crap," noting that "that requires Zero taste" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:28">[00:33:28]</a>. Anyone can criticize; true taste lies in recognizing potential and quality.

### Common Pitfalls Affecting Taste

Shas identifies several common pitfalls that product leaders fall into, indicating a lack of discerning taste:

*   **Over-excitement for cool metaphors**: Being attracted to catchy phrases like "two-way doors" over more descriptive but less catchy terms like "reversible and irreversible decisions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:06">[00:34:06]</a>. This is often combined with **authority bias**, where an idea gains traction simply because a respected figure (e.g., Jeff Bezos) said it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:51">[00:34:51]</a>.
*   **Impression by alliterations**: Phrases like "fail fast" gain appeal due to their catchy alliteration, even if a less poetic but equally meaningful term like "fail quickly" would be ignored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:04">[00:35:04]</a>.
*   **Being impressed by complicated charts and incomprehensible math**: Some leaders exploit this by using complex visuals and data as a "strategy" to appear intelligent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:02">[00:36:02]</a>.

## Developing Better Taste

Developing better taste involves:

*   **Shedding ingrained patterns**: Recognizing and abandoning patterns of thought and belief that are built on social proof and authority rather than rigorous evaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:41">[00:36:41]</a>.
*   **Evaluating ideas independently**: Discerning an idea's merit separate from its "social proof and Authority proof" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:55">[00:36:55]</a>. This leads to becoming a more "critical thinker" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:24">[00:37:24]</a>.

This shift in perspective is crucial for a product leader's growth, enabling more thoughtful [[product_management_skills_and_best_practices|decision-making]] and a deeper understanding of what truly constitutes quality.

Uri Levine, co-founder of Waze and nine other companies, emphasizes that the biggest lesson he has learned from co-founding 10 companies and serving on 20 startup boards is to "fall in love with the problem, not the solution" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. This philosophy is so central to his approach that it's the title of his book and printed on his t-shirt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

## Why Fall in Love with the Problem?

The core of entrepreneurship is value creation, and the simplest way to create value is to solve a problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

Key benefits of this approach include:
*   **North Star for the Journey** The problem serves as a "north star," guiding the entrepreneurial journey and leading to fewer deviations from the course, thereby increasing the likelihood of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
*   **Compelling Story** A problem-centric narrative is far more compelling to customers and investors. Instead of saying, "I'm going to build an AI crowdsourced navigation system," saying "I'm going to help you avoid traffic jams" resonates deeply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. When customers care, they want the company to succeed and will help achieve that success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
*   **Guaranteed Value Creation** By starting with a problem and then building a solution, there's a guarantee of creating value if the solution works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. Conversely, starting with a solution risks building something nobody cares about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.
*   **Personal Passion** The entrepreneurial journey is "hard and complex and long" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. Therefore, it's crucial for founders to be personally passionate and "in love" with the problem they are solving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. This passion, which ties into [[finding_and_pursuing_your_true_passion]], provides the internal drive needed to navigate the hardships of the journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>. The goal is to then engage everyone else to fall in love with the same problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.

## Identifying and Validating Problems

Uri Levine suggests looking for problems that cause personal frustration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>, such as hating traffic or leaving money on the table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>. Once a problem is identified, the next step is to validate it:

*   **Speak with Users** It's essential to talk to many people who might have the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. While 100 is a good aspirational number to push beyond one's comfort zone, speaking with 20 strangers can provide significant validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. This aligns with the [[importance_of_talking_to_customers_in_startups]] for gathering feedback.
*   **Look for Shared Problems** If the founder is the only person on the planet with the problem, a therapist is a better solution than building a startup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. A problem is validated if people spontaneously describe *their* perception of the problem or say, "Oh, I know someone that has this problem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.
*   **Focus on the "Why"** When discussing a startup, founders should lead with "why" they are doing something (the problem they solve or the value they create), not "what" they are doing (the company or system) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.

## Iteration and Pivots

The journey of solving a problem is a multi-dimensional, roller-coaster journey of failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>. Waze, for example, iterated for over a year to achieve product-market fit across various geographies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:58">[00:23:58]</a>. The key is to [[the_role_of_struggling_moments_in_product_innovation | fail fast]] and iterate until the solution is "good enough" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>.

### Example: Oversee Deals

Uri Levine's company, Oversee, initially aimed to help consumers save money on airfare after booking by monitoring price drops and enabling rebooking. While the problem was real, consumers were unwilling to take the necessary action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. Recognizing this, the company pivoted from a Business-to-Consumer (B2C) model to a Business-to-Business (B2B) model, providing automatic rebooking for corporates, which saved them about 10% of their travel budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. This pivot illustrates how staying focused on the underlying problem (saving money on flights) allows for flexibility in the solution and target audience.

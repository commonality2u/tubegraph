Uri Levine, co-founder of Waze and nine other companies, highlights that the most significant lesson from his extensive experience in co-founding companies, building two unicorns, and advising over 50 founders, is the importance of falling in love with the problem, not the solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. This philosophy is so central to his approach that it became the title of his book, "Fall in Love with the Problem Not the Solution: A Handbook for Entrepreneurs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Steve Wozniak, co-founder of Apple, even stated that this book "will change your life and become your Bible if you're an entrepreneur" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

## Why Fall in Love with the Problem?

The core reason for this focus is that entrepreneurship is fundamentally about value creation, and the simplest way to create value is to solve a problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

Key benefits of this approach include:
*   **North Star for the Journey** When you are in love with the problem, it serves as the "north star" for your journey, leading to fewer deviations from the course and increasing the likelihood of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.
*   **Compelling Storytelling** Focusing on the problem creates a much more compelling story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. For example, instead of describing Waze as an "AI crowdsourced navigation system" (which might not resonate), it's far more impactful to say, "I'm going to help you to avoid traffic jams" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. When customers care about the problem you're solving, they want you to succeed and are more likely to help you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
*   **Personal Passion and Drive** The entrepreneurial journey is inherently difficult, complex, and long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>. Being personally passionate and "in love" with the problem provides the internal drive necessary to navigate these hardships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. This passion then helps engage everyone else—from employees to investors—to join the journey and follow your leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.

## Identifying the Right Problem

Starting with a problem means identifying a significant issue, something "worth solving" that would make the world a better place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>.

### Validation Through User Engagement
Once a potential problem is identified, the next crucial step is to speak with the people who experience it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>. This helps [[importance_of_talking_to_customers_in_startups | understand their perception of the problem]] and validate its existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.
*   **Quantity of Feedback** Aim to speak with a significant number of people, ideally 100, to get out of your comfort zone and beyond just friends and family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. Even speaking with 20 unfamiliar people can provide sufficient validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.
*   **Clear Signals** True validation comes when people don't just agree they have the problem, but describe it in their own words, or even correct your initial understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. If you are the only one on the planet with the problem, "get a therapist" instead of building a startup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
*   **Origin of Ideas** For Levine, startup ideas often stem from personal frustration with existing situations, such as traffic or inefficient money management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>.

### Solution-First Pitfalls
Many entrepreneurs make the mistake of starting with a solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. They send emails or pitch decks describing "what we are doing" rather than "why" they are doing it, or the problem they solve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. If you start with a solution, you risk building something "no one cares" about, which is deeply frustrating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

> "If you start your story with 'our company is' or 'our system is'... you focus on your solution. If you start with the story with the problem we are solving is... then you focus on the problem. If your story start with the value that we create for you is... then you focus on the user. The last two are way better than focus on the solution." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>

## Problem-Centric Product Development

### Iterative Approach to Product-Market Fit
Once a problem is identified, the focus shifts to finding [[challenges_and_pitfalls_in_product_management | Product-Market Fit]] (PMF). This is the longest and most critical phase of a startup's journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>. PMF means creating value for customers, and without it, a company will fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:23">[00:19:23]</a>.

Waze's journey exemplifies this iterative process. After initial success in Israel, Waze was made global in late 2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:14">[00:22:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:35">[00:22:35]</a>. However, it wasn't "good enough" in major markets like the US or Western Europe; it only found traction in a few smaller countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:58">[00:22:58]</a>. Through constant dialogue with users, understanding their pain points, and iterating on the product, Waze eventually achieved widespread adoption in 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:10">[00:23:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>. This highlights the importance of [[lessons_from_failures_and_the_importance_of_persistence | persistence]] and rapid iteration.

> "The biggest enemy of good enough is perfect. You don't need to be perfect, you need to be good enough in order to win the market." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>

### Adapting to User Behavior
Understanding how users *actually* use a product, rather than how the creators *intended* it to be used, is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:51">[01:05:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:51">[01:06:51]</a>. For example, Waze found that while some users relied on the visual screen for navigation, many others preferred audio prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:21">[01:06:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:31">[01:06:31]</a>. This requires watching users and asking "why" they behave the way they do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:23">[01:07:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:33">[01:07:33]</a>.

Recognizing different user types is also important:
1.  **Innovators (2%)**: Use new things just because they are new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:20">[01:08:20]</a>.
2.  **Early Adopters**: Adopt once they see value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:41">[01:08:41]</a>.
3.  **Early Majority (1/3 of population)**: Market leaders, but fear change ("Don't Rock the Boat") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:14">[01:09:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:16">[01:09:16]</a>. They avoid new solutions if they perceive them as complex or fear embarrassment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:39">[01:09:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:43">[01:09:43]</a>.
4.  **Late Majority/Laggards**: Will only use a product if they absolutely have to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:43">[01:11:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:45">[01:11:45]</a>.

To capture the early majority, products must be simple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:03">[01:10:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:06">[01:10:06]</a>. This often involves continuous iteration, adding features that users adopt, and then removing unused features that add complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:18">[01:10:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:30">[01:10:30]</a>. Product owners, often innovators or early adopters themselves, must actively observe and understand the early majority to bridge this gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:40">[01:10:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:55">[01:10:55]</a>.

### Learning from Unsuccessful Users
When analyzing a product's funnel of use (download, registration, first use, gaining value, returning), it's common to focus on successful users at the bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:26">[01:12:26]</a>. However, to improve, it is essential to speak with users who *failed* to progress through the funnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:55">[01:12:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:57">[01:12:57]</a>. These individuals — those who didn't register, or registered but didn't use the product, or used it but didn't return — hold invaluable insights into "why" the product wasn't creating value for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:59">[01:12:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:07">[01:13:07]</a>. This "why" is what makes a great product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:13">[01:13:13]</a>.

## Conclusion

Falling in love with the problem is not just a philosophical stance but a practical framework that guides entrepreneurs through the complexities of startup development. It drives value creation, provides a clear vision, fosters passion, and helps in strategically navigating the journey toward product-market fit and growth.

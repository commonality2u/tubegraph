While "storytelling" is a business buzzword, many individuals are hesitant to fully embrace it because it requires separating oneself from the crowd, which can feel risky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. However, remaining "in the herd" leads to being forgettable; people often can't recall anything said in a presentation soon after it's over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Our minds are not designed to remember facts, statistics, or platitudes not attached to imagery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. The risk of not telling stories is being completely forgotten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

Matthew Dicks, author of *Storyworthy*, emphasizes the importance of storytelling in various contexts, from personal life to business and [[public_speaking_and_the_use_of_humor | public speaking]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:06">[01:28:06]</a>. He teaches individuals and teams at companies like Slack, Amazon, Lego, and Salesforce the skill of storytelling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>.

## Fundamentals of Effective Storytelling

### The 5-Second Moment of Transformation or Realization
Every good story is centered around a singular moment, often called a "5-second moment" (though it can be shorter), which signifies a transformation or realization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:19">[01:17:19]</a>. This moment is where a person changes from one kind of person to another, or from thinking one thing to thinking a new thing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:41">[01:17:41]</a>. The purpose of a story is to bring this moment to clarity for the audience, allowing them to experience the "flip" alongside the storyteller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:20">[01:20:20]</a>. Most of the story (98%) provides context to bring this singular moment to fruition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:40">[01:21:40]</a>.

Knowing the singular moment helps the storyteller understand the end of the story, which then informs the beginning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. Stories essentially operate between two opposing moments in time â€“ a beginning and an end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>. Starting at the end ensures you have something important to say, rather than just reporting on events chronologically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.

### The Dinner Test
When telling a story in a formal setting, it should closely resemble a story you would tell someone at dinner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>. Avoid "performance art" elements like unattributed dialogue or starting with a sound effect, as these are not natural ways of speaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>. Aim for a slightly elevated version of a natural conversation, free from verbal filler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:40">[02:17:40]</a>.

### Tell Your Own Story
Stories must be about you in some way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>. Telling someone else's story can feel like fiction to the audience and prevents the storyteller from expressing vulnerability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. Audiences want someone to open their hearts and minds, which requires personal revelation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>. Even when discussing others' experiences, [[effective_storytelling_in_interviews | center the narrative on yourself]] and how those experiences informed or changed your own life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.

### Avoid Vacation Stories
Unless a vacation involved a fundamental 5-second moment of change for you, don't tell the story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>. If such a moment occurred, focus only on that moment and its immediate context, not irrelevant details like travel or previous days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. The shortest version of every story is the best, starting as close to the end as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>.

### Importance of Stakes
Stakes are what the audience should be worried about or wanting for the storyteller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:00">[03:23:00]</a>. Assuming an audience wants to listen is a misconception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>. Storytellers must constantly make the audience wonder what will happen next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>.

Techniques to build stakes:
*   **Elephant**: Immediately introduce something significant at the beginning that makes the audience wonder or worry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>.
*   **Backpack**: Tell the audience your plan or hopes before carrying it out, so they internalize your desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>.
*   **Breadcrumbs**: Offer small hints or pieces of information without revealing the complete idea, implying future relevance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>.
*   **Hourglass**: When the audience is on the edge of their seat, slow time down by adding details, prolonging the moment of discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.
*   **Crystal Ball**: Predict a future event, even if it's a terrible or false one, to plant worry in the audience's mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>.

Stakes should build throughout the story, rather than being front-loaded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>.

### Surprise and Suspense
[[how_storytelling_creates_memorable_communication | Surprise]] is a delightful moment when the audience didn't see something coming, yet it feels inevitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>. Every story has at least one surprise, often when the storyteller (and audience) realizes something new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>. To achieve this, sufficient information must be placed earlier in the story, but cleverly hidden so the audience doesn't connect the dots until the surprise hits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. Suspense involves keeping the audience wondering, and often leads to surprise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>.

### Incorporating Humor
Humor is a simple yet powerful way to differentiate yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>. Many people want to be funny but are afraid to take the risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>.

<div class="callout">
ðŸ’¡ **Humor Strategies for Public Speaking:**
*   **Nostalgia**: The past, especially relatable past experiences, can be inherently funny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>. When discussing new products or services, speak nostalgically about how things used to be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>. This also demonstrates expertise in your field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>.
*   **"One of these things is not like the other"**: Present three things â€“ two expected, and one unexpected â€“ to create a humorous contrast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>.
</div>

When humor is embedded within a story, even if a joke doesn't land perfectly, the story continues, and the attempt at humor may not even be noticed as a failed joke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a>.

## Storytelling in Business

In business, many people communicate in a "round, white, and flavorless" way because they are afraid to stand out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>. However, storytelling is crucial for [[the_importance_of_storytelling_in_presentations | effective presentations]], investment pitches, internal communications, and sales pitches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>.

### Make it Personal
Companies should avoid being a "corporate monolith without personality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>. Instead, be an actual human being who connects with the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>. A "personal interest inventory" can help identify aspects of yourself to strategically include in your communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>. For example, mentioning you're married can subtly convey reliability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>. Similarly, sharing unique hobbies like running marathons can create intense connections with those who share the interest, despite a smaller "addressable market" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>.

When asked a question, try to subtly include an item of your personality or life that might be of interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>. The goal is to be full of color and flavor, an individual people remember <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>.

### Speaking with Adjacency
Instead of matching content to content directly (e.g., only talking about tubes for a tube company), match the story to the theme, meaning, or message you want to convey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>. This allows for powerful "snaps" where the audience realizes the story was about something seemingly unrelated (like apples) but actually delivered the core message about the product (tubes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>. This creates positive connections with everyday items, embedding advertising into people's lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>.

## Generating Story Ideas: Homework for Life

Homework for Life is a process for continuously generating story ideas, regardless of whether you plan to be a public speaker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>. The goal is to look back on each day and find one moment worth telling as a story, then briefly record it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:35">[01:07:35]</a>. This can be done in an Excel spreadsheet or Google Sheet, with two columns: date and a summary of the moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:49">[01:07:49]</a>.

<div class="callout">
ðŸ’¡ **Homework for Life Prompt**: "If someone kidnapped my family and said you can't have them back until you stand on a stage and tell a story about something that happened today, what would you tell?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:51">[01:09:51]</a>
</div>

This practice helps develop a "lens for storytelling," allowing you to see and recognize more moments worth remembering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:34">[01:08:34]</a>. While not every recorded moment becomes a full story (around 10% do), the other 90% is valuable for holding onto your days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:29">[01:10:29]</a>. This practice also helps:
*   **Recover Time**: It makes time feel less fleeting by documenting daily moments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:39">[01:11:39]</a>.
*   **See Patterns**: It allows you to observe patterns in your life that you might otherwise miss, leading to deeper insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:08">[01:12:08]</a>.
*   **Recall Past Memories**: The act of looking for new stories can trigger forgotten memories from the past, which can then be added to your log <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:41">[01:10:41]</a>.

The process takes time to develop, but consistency is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:54">[01:15:54]</a>. Start today, because every day you don't do it is a day lost forever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>.

## [[techniques_to_manage_public_speaking_anxiety | Managing Public Speaking Nerves]] and Delivery

### Understanding Nervousness
Most nervousness occurs *before* you begin speaking; once you start, much of it dissipates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:01">[01:20:01]</a>. Knowing that this pre-talk nervousness is common and often temporary can be a relief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:50">[01:20:50]</a>. It's also important to remember that almost everyone, even famous public figures, experiences nervousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:55">[01:21:55]</a>.

### Preparation and Practice
Preparation significantly reduces nervousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:12">[01:22:12]</a>.
<div class="callout">
ðŸ’¡ **[[practical_advice_for_reducing_nerves_in_public_speaking | Techniques for Better Storytelling]] & Preparation**:
*   **Record and Listen Passively**: Record yourself giving your talk or story and listen to it passively while doing other activities (e.g., chores, shopping) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:23">[01:22:23]</a>. This helps the content seep into your "soul" and memory, making it easier to recall with ease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:54">[01:22:54]</a>.
*   **Focus on Transitions**: Most people forget the transitions between sections of their talk, not the content itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:15">[01:23:15]</a>. Actively listen to your recording and practice the transitions between scenes or topics to ensure smooth delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:20">[01:23:20]</a>.
*   **Avoid Memorization**: Memorizing a talk can lead to more suffering if you forget a line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:31">[01:24:31]</a>. Instead, aim to remember the talk without memorizing it word-for-word, trusting that the ideas and flow will come naturally through repeated exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:41">[01:24:41]</a>.

### The Power of "Yes"
Saying "yes" to opportunities, even those that seem crazy or undesirable, can lead to extraordinary experiences and stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:52">[01:25:52]</a>. While saying "no" might seem like a way to sequester time, it's often rooted in fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:10">[01:28:10]</a>. A "yes" can always turn into a "no" later, but trying an opportunity opens doors that might otherwise remain closed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:38">[01:27:38]</a>. The things that frighten us are often the things that are best for us <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:15">[01:29:15]</a>. This philosophy contributes to having a rich pool of personal experiences for stories.

### Starting a Story
Every story should begin with two elements:
1.  **Location**: Start by clearly stating where you are. This activates the audience's imagination, allowing them to visualize the setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:21">[01:38:21]</a>.
2.  **Action**: Immediately describe something happening. This indicates to the audience that the story is moving forward and grabs their attention right away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:01">[01:39:01]</a>.

This "location and action" start also acts as a signal to the audience that a story is beginning, often causing them to quiet down and afford the speaker the space to talk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:05">[01:40:05]</a>. It's like the "movie's on," and people instinctively pay attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:38">[01:40:38]</a>.

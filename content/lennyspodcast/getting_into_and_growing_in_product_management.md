## What Makes a Great Product Manager

Maggie Crowley identifies three common threads among the best product managers she has worked with, hired, and managed, regardless of company size or industry (consumer, B2B, startup, or large company): <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>

### 1. Simplifying and Breaking Things Down
The best PMs excel at identifying the single most important thing to do at any given moment and sticking with it until it's finished. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a> This is crucial in large companies with numerous priorities and projects, as well as in startups where many "fires" and opportunities can cause distraction. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a> [[challenges_and_strategies_in_product_management | Prioritization]] is a core aspect of this, requiring not just a decision but also the ability to maintain focus and ensure continued excitement and engagement in the project. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a> PMs need resilience and energy to consistently "beat the drum" for their chosen path. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>

#### How to Build This Skill:
*   **Read Out Loud**: When writing documents, read them aloud to identify overly complicated or nonsensical sections. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>
*   **Be Direct**: State your core message simply and directly, avoiding unnecessary prose. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>
*   **Get Reps and Listen to Feedback**: Continuously practice and solicit feedback on your work from experienced individuals, including founders and managers who possess deep market insight. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>
*   **Cut Unnecessary Information**: Focus on stripping down communication. Maggie recommends deleting the first two paragraphs of almost any document. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>
*   **Apply the Rule of Three**: Limit strategies, conclusions, and next steps to three main points or fewer. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>
*   **Seek Peer Review**: Establish a small group of trusted peers who can review your work and help you simplify it. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>

### 2. Following Up on Results
Truly effective PMs remember to follow up on the metrics and outcomes of their launched products. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a> This is a rare yet high-value activity that managers highly appreciate. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>

#### How to Build This Skill:
*   **Set Calendar Reminders**: Schedule reminders to check dashboards and metrics weeks or months after a product launch. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>
*   **Proactively Share Progress**: Don't rely on managers to notice your achievements; proactively share results to ensure your impact is recognized. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:04">[00:23:04]</a>
*   **Continuously Learn**: Following up on results helps you learn why something succeeded or failed, making you better with each product shipped. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:56">[00:23:56]</a>

### 3. Carrying the Water (Doing the Unglamorous Work)
Great PMs are willing to do the "hard, boring, unglamorous work" such as customer support, sales, marketing, copywriting, and project management. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a> The mindset of "that's not my job" is a red flag; if it needs doing, a PM should do it. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> PMs are ultimately responsible for outcomes and results, meaning they must fill all gaps since no one else is incentivized in the same way. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:22">[00:29:22]</a>

#### The Reality of Product Management
The role of a PM is often the emotional center of the team, requiring constant motivation, excitement, and optimism for the project. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a> While glamorous aspects like deciding what gets built exist, a significant portion of the job involves mundane tasks like QA, customer implementation, selling, and finding users. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:17">[00:31:17]</a> Nothing should be "above" a PM. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:36">[00:31:36]</a>

## Product Strategy and Documentation

### Developing a Product Strategy
A comprehensive product strategy helps define the team's direction and aligns stakeholders. Maggie's approach to writing a strategy document addresses common feedback like "you need to be more strategic." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:10">[00:35:10]</a>

#### Strategy Document Outline:
1.  **Mission and Goals**: Start with the company's and team's mission and overarching goals. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:05">[00:36:05]</a>
2.  **Landscape**: Detail the current business, product, and market situation. Include competitors, SWOT analysis, key risks, and current business goals. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:14">[00:36:14]</a>
3.  **Current State**: Provide an honest assessment of the product, business, and specific area of work. Include what's working/not working, customer feedback, support tickets, and technical hurdles/debt. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:47">[00:36:47]</a>
4.  **Opportunity**: Identify the top one or two opportunities based on the analysis. Define where the team should "play" and "win" given its unique competitive advantage. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:33">[00:37:33]</a>
5.  **Challenges**: Outline the difficulties in seizing the opportunity and what needs to be true for it to work. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:55">[00:37:55]</a>
6.  **Solution**: Propose specific actions and what needs to be built (ideally three key points). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:06">[00:38:06]</a>
7.  **Plan**: Detail how to sequence the work, resource the team, and execute the solution. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:18">[00:38:18]</a>

This document can be extensive (up to 20 pages) due to the depth of analysis, but it typically includes a summary at the top following the Minto Principle for quick understanding. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:55">[00:41:55]</a> It serves as the PM's "homework" to gain confidence in decisions and facilitates conversations by grounding disagreements in data. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:01">[00:43:01]</a> Engineering and design counterparts often engage deeply with such documents. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:14">[00:43:14]</a>

### One-Pager (PRD/Spec)
The one-pager or PRD (Product Requirements Document) is the PM's artifact to define what the product team is doing. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:10">[00:50:10]</a>

#### One-Pager Key Sections:
*   **Background and Context**: <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:57">[00:51:57]</a>
*   **The Problem**: Clearly define the problem. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:01">[00:52:01]</a>
*   **Why This Problem Matters**: Explain the significance. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:01">[00:52:01]</a>
*   **Why This Problem Matters Now**: Justify the urgency and current relevance. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:07">[00:52:07]</a>

These sections center the team around the problem and its importance. It's crucial to share this document with the team early to invite critique and discussion. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:21">[00:52:21]</a>

### Gaining Experience
It often takes several years to feel confident as a PM. Maggie's own experience involved two years in a rotation program at TripAdvisor, followed by a challenging solo product role at a startup, before truly learning and gaining confidence after two more years at Drift. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:45">[00:24:45]</a>

*   **Ship a Lot**: The more products you ship, the more you learn. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>
*   **Go Deep**: While job hopping can lead to faster progression, staying with a company or product for several cycles allows for deeper learning from the consequences of decisions. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:37">[00:25:37]</a>

### Breaking Into Product Management
It's challenging to break into product management, as many companies prefer candidates with prior PM titles. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:37">[00:33:37]</a>

*   **Entry-Level Programs**: Some big tech companies offer hard-to-get entry-level programs. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:19">[00:32:19]</a>
*   **Lateral Moves**: Switching internally within a company is a viable, though challenging, path. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:32">[00:32:32]</a>
*   **Join a Startup**: Startups may be more willing to hire individuals without prior PM experience, though it requires significant onboarding effort from management. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:36">[00:32:36]</a>
*   **Get the Title**: Once you have a PM title on your resume, it becomes much easier to secure subsequent roles. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:37">[00:33:37]</a> The key is to get that first job, then focus on what you've shipped. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:17">[00:34:17]</a>

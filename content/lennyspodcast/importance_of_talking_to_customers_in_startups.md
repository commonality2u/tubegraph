According to Gustav Alstromer, a Group Partner at Y Combinator, the primary reason companies fail is their inability to [[talking_to_customers_for_product_development|talk to users]], which prevents them from finding [[importance_of_productmarket_fit_for_startups|product-market fit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. If a startup doesn't achieve [[importance_of_productmarket_fit_for_startups|product-market fit]], "nothing else really matters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The core mistake startups make revolves around this fundamental aspect: [[talking_to_customers_for_product_development|talking to customers]] and building something genuinely useful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. The enduring principle is simply to "make things people want" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

### Neglecting Customer Conversations
Many startups fail because they don't engage with customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>. Without this interaction, founders cannot discern what is truly important, making their efforts to build products futile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>. A significant portion of the early Y Combinator program is dedicated to pushing founders to describe their [[effective_communication_with_customers|customer conversations]] and the insights gained from them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:21">[00:23:21]</a>.

### Fear of Rejection
A common hurdle, especially for technical founders, is the fear of [[finding_and_reaching_out_to_leads_as_a_startup_founder|talking to customers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:52">[00:23:52]</a>. This often stems from a reluctance to face rejection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:16">[00:24:16]</a>. Founders must understand that approximately 90% of potential customers are not early adopters; they are risk-averse and not incentivized to try new things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:34">[00:24:34]</a>. Therefore, reaching one early adopter might require reaching out to ten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:51">[00:24:51]</a>. This process demands significant effort and persistence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:57">[00:24:57]</a>.

Instead of fearing rejection, founders should realize that customer indifference is the most common outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:11">[00:30:11]</a>. People are busy and often don't remember or care about services they signed up for but didn't use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:40">[00:29:40]</a>. This indifference means there's always a second chance to re-engage with them after improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:17">[00:30:17]</a>.

### Confusing External Validation with Product-Market Fit
Founders often mistake external validations—like acceptance into Y Combinator, investor interest, or positive feedback—for [[importance_of_productmarket_fit_for_startups|product-market fit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:54">[00:26:54]</a>. However, true [[importance_of_productmarket_fit_for_startups|product-market fit]] is validated only by [[talking_to_customers_for_product_development|talking to customers]] and understanding what genuinely matters to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:09">[00:27:09]</a>.

## How to Truly Understand Customer Needs

To grasp the intensity of a customer's problem, it's more effective to *watch* them rather than just *ask* them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:58">[00:32:58]</a>. Observing their daily workflows, having them share their screens, and walking through their processes can reveal pain points they might not even be aware of or able to articulate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:32">[00:33:32]</a>. For example, to understand issues with EV charging, one should rent an EV and personally experience using non-Tesla chargers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:51">[00:33:51]</a>.

Founders need to talk to a significant number of customers; not just five, but ideally 25 to 50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:29">[00:28:29]</a>. This high volume of conversations helps identify early adopters and also serves as an initial [[sales_strategies_for_startups|sales]] process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:38">[00:28:38]</a>.

## Lessons from Y Combinator and Airbnb

Y Combinator's office hours often feature a crucial question: "What's holding you back from moving faster?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>. This question helps founders pinpoint obstacles and prioritize actions that drive progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>. In group office hours, founders share their goals for the upcoming weeks and review past progress, fostering accountability and peer learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>.

The story of Airbnb highlights the power of direct customer engagement. Paul Graham famously advised the Airbnb founders to "do things that don't scale" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:37">[00:27:37]</a> by going to New York to meet their customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:26">[00:27:26]</a>. This hands-on approach allowed them to understand customer needs deeply and build their product effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:42">[00:27:42]</a>.

## Attributes of Successful Founders

Successful founders consistently demonstrate certain attributes, many of which relate to their customer focus and ability to drive [[the_importance_of_velocity_in_startups|velocity]]:

*   **Will to Win and Inspiration**: They are determined to succeed and possess an infectious internal motivation that inspires others to join and work for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:17">[00:41:17]</a>.
*   **Technical Acumen**: While not always the best engineers, they are technical enough to understand the value of engineering and how software can solve problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:46">[00:41:46]</a>.
*   **Customer Obsession and Speed**: They quickly learn [[effective_communication_with_customers|how to talk to users]] and move fast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:02">[00:42:04]</a>. Their focus is squarely on customers, not investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:26">[00:42:27]</a>. Continuous, rapid progress is a strong indicator of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:34">[00:47:34]</a>.
*   **Excellent Communication**: They can communicate complex ideas clearly and tell a compelling story about their mission, which motivates people to follow them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:33">[00:42:35]</a>.
*   **Execution-Oriented**: For early-stage startups, execution trumps strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:48">[00:53:48]</a>. Founders should focus on one priority and relentlessly pursue it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:10">[00:54:10]</a>. Strategy becomes relevant only after achieving [[importance_of_productmarket_fit_for_startups|product-market fit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:27">[00:54:27]</a>.

Ultimately, caring about the product means caring about the customers and their experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:38">[00:56:40]</a>. While scalable distribution strategies are essential for growth, they come after establishing a product that people genuinely want through direct engagement and "doing things that don't scale" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:19">[00:57:21]</a>.

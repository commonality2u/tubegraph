Many leaders frequently find themselves overwhelmed by a continuous cycle of [[The Importance of Execution Over Strategy | execution problems]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:31">[01:05:31]</a>. However, in high-performing environments where individuals have good intentions, most seemingly "execution problems" are, in fact, symptoms of deeper issues related to strategy, interpersonal dynamics, or [[Using operating principles to guide company culture | company culture]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>.

## Identifying the Root Cause

When addressing recurring issues, it's crucial to look beyond superficial fixes. A key sign that an "execution problem" is actually something else is when "band-aid" solutions consistently fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:28">[01:12:28]</a>. If a team is repeatedly solving the same problem, or a particular team is consistently slow, it indicates that the underlying cause has not been addressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:32">[01:12:32]</a>.

### Strategy Problems
A common example of a disguised execution problem is team misalignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:01">[01:06:01]</a>. While leaders might implement solutions like new review processes or regular one-on-ones to foster better alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:49">[01:06:49]</a>, the true issue often lies in [[Strategy and its four critical choices | strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:40">[01:07:40]</a>:
*   **Conflicting Strategies** Teams may be misaligned because they are pursuing different strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:43">[01:07:43]</a>.
*   **Lack of Clarity** More frequently, misalignment stems from an absence of a clear, defined strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:54">[01:07:54]</a>. Without a strong [[Key elements of a successful strategy | strategy]], objectives (OKRs) may be poorly aligned, priorities unclear, and teams will struggle to adapt when circumstances change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:01">[01:08:01]</a>. This leads to teams debating minor issues rather than addressing fundamental strategic mismatches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:31">[01:08:31]</a>.

### Culture Problems
Organizational culture can also manifest as perceived execution problems. If a company's culture primarily incentivizes individuals to optimize for their own OKRs, it becomes challenging for teams to collaborate effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:07">[01:09:07]</a>. Managers may be hesitant to support other teams if it risks their own team's performance reviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:31">[01:09:31]</a>. In such cases, simply arranging more meetings will not resolve the core cultural impediment to cross-functional work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:41">[01:09:41]</a>.

### Interpersonal Problems
Sometimes, the issue is as straightforward as a lack of rapport between two key individuals, such as team managers, which creates ongoing friction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:57">[01:09:57]</a>. In these situations, leaders must recognize this dynamic and actively [[Coaching strategies for CEOs and leaders | coach]] those involved to resolve their differences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:12">[01:10:12]</a>. Addressing the interpersonal conflict can eliminate the need for superficial meetings or processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:24">[01:10:24]</a>.

## True Execution Problems
While many issues stem from strategy or culture, genuine execution problems do exist. These often involve tangible constraints or skill gaps:
*   **Infrastructure Issues** Outdated or inadequate infrastructure can lead to slow performance, outages, or high latency, directly hindering execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:03">[01:11:03]</a>.
*   **Skills Gaps** A lack of necessary skills within a team, such as engineers unfamiliar with a specific technology or product managers misaligned with a project's growth stage (e.g., a "zero-to-one" PM on a mature initiative), can impede progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:30">[01:11:30]</a>.

By discerning between true execution problems and those rooted in strategy, culture, or interpersonal dynamics, leaders can apply more effective and lasting solutions.

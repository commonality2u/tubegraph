Notion, a widely used productivity tool, was co-founded by Ivan Zhao, who also serves as its CEO. Zhao describes the first three to four years of Notion's existence as "the lost years," a period marked by extensive experimentation and learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.

## The "Lost Years" and Pivots

Notion's initial vision was rooted in the belief that "everybody can make and create their software" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The first version was conceived as an easy-to-use developer tool to enable more people to build their own software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. However, after a couple of years, the team realized that most people "just don't care" about creating software; they simply need to get their jobs done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.

This realization led to a crucial pivot: to "hide our vision" of universal software creation within a familiar form factor that people *do* care about – productivity software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>. Zhao likens this approach to giving people "sugar that hides your broccoli inside of it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>. It took over two years to fully realize the need to build a productivity tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>.

> [!INFO] Learning from Failure
> The first version of Notion was more about what Ivan Zhao wanted than what people wanted, a sign of early immaturity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>. The team learned to build from outside their own perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>.

The early years also involved significant technical challenges and repeated code throwaways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. For instance, the team initially bet on Web Components, a new and unstable technology, which led to a complete codebase reset to build on a more reliable foundation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>.

> [!WARNING] The "Lego for Software" Vision
> Notion's long-term vision is to be "the Lego for software," allowing users to create custom tools for their daily work and life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>. This concept, however, didn't initially resonate with the mass market, necessitating the "sugar and broccoli" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>.

### Staying Solvent and Resilient
During these challenging [[early_stages_of_product_development_and_pivot | early stages]], Notion managed to stay afloat by:
*   **Family Support**: Ivan Zhao's mother helped kickstart the company and provided loans to bridge financial gaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>.
*   **Extreme Lean Operations**: The team decided to lay off all but two employees (Zhao and his co-founder Simon Last) to cut costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>. They even moved to Japan and sub-leased their apartment and office in San Francisco, effectively making money while living in Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.
*   **Personal Drive**: The co-founders' shared desire for Notion to exist, stemming from a love for Legos and the concept of creativity and playfulness in tools, kept them going <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.

## Finding Product-Market Fit

Product-market fit for Notion was a gradual process rather than a sudden "boom" milestone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. It was marked by increasing user engagement, incoming revenue, and external validation from investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. A memorable instance of this validation was when a dog food delivery from Andreessen Horowitz arrived at their private office, indicating serious investor interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>.

> [!INFO] The Role of External Validation
> While investors knocking on the door signaled traction, Zhao's internal compass, aided by an investor like Shira Fischer, helped him realize that external validation wasn't the primary driver for a better product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. The focus quickly shifted back to "hardcore building" based on customer feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.

## Notion's Operational Philosophy

Notion's operational approach is characterized by a strong emphasis on lean operations, efficiency, and a deep philosophical outlook on tools and human potential.

### Staying Lean and Craft-Oriented
Notion has maintained a small team and a lean operating model, remaining profitable for years and retaining most of its raised capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>. The company didn't hire a salesperson until it hit over $10 million in ARR and brought on its first Product Manager at around 50 employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:00">[03:23:00]</a>.

This approach stems from the belief that better systems and tools can solve problems more effectively than simply adding more people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>. Notion runs almost entirely on Notion itself, embodying this mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>.

> [!QUOTE] The "Small Bus" Metaphor
> "Notion is a small bus. The smaller the bus is, the easier to turn corners, easier to accelerate, easier to maneuver... The bigger the bus, it is, it just like bigger the bat, bigger the bus, slow down. And as a leader in the company, you decide who sit around you on the bus seat, right? That dictates how fast our overall bus moves, dictate your work and life experience at this company because you're you pick your roommate, you pick your seatmates... that metaphor clicks with people inside a company and and overall help us optimize the make the bus type, make the bus link." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>

The company prioritizes "talent density" over sheer headcount, attracting talented individuals who want to work with other skilled people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>.

### Thoughtful Design and Aesthetic Values
Zhao emphasizes creating a pleasant and inspiring office environment, where the space feels like an artist's studio or a home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>. This includes details like choosing warm white shades, avoiding harsh top lighting, and using home furniture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>.

Notion's conference rooms are named after "Timeless Tools in history" such as the iPhone, Macintosh, Lamy 2000 pens, and Toshiba rice cookers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>. These serve as inspirations, reminding the team to create software that lasts and impacts people's lives for decades, rather than just chasing short-term tech cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>. This approach aligns with the company's philosophy of "craft and values," where skill and personal values combine to make clever tradeoffs and create new, useful things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>.

## The Evolution of a Horizontal Product

Building a horizontal software platform that can do many things well is notoriously difficult and often takes a long time to find [[Founders insights and their importance in startup success | product-market fit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>.

### From Bricks to Boxes
Notion's vision as "Lego for software" meant creating fundamental "Lego bricks" that users could assemble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>. However, the team learned that for mass adoption and enterprise customers, most people prefer "Lego boxes"—ready-made solutions that fit specific business needs rather than assembling from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a>. This required a shift in mindset towards providing "solutions" for enterprise customers, focusing on how Notion could optimize their business P&L and mitigate risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a>.

### Initial Entry Point and Bundling
Notion stumbled upon documents and notes as a primary use case, which provided a large "top of funnel" for growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:00">[05:49:00]</a>. This led to a B2C2B strategy: individual users start with Notion for simple tasks like note-taking or document sharing, then realize its broader capabilities (like relational databases) and bring it to their workplaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:00">[05:49:00]</a>. A significant portion of Notion's B2B customers originate from prior personal use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:00">[05:49:00]</a>.

Notion's horizontal nature allows it to address multiple use cases in one place, which is particularly appealing to startups and mid-market companies that don't require the complexity of specialized vertical tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>. Notion ranks highly in categories like project management, docs, and CRM, despite not explicitly intending to build a CRM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>.

### The Impact of AI on Horizontal Tools
The advent of large language models (LLMs) has been a significant "gift" for tools like Notion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:00">[06:04:00]</a>. AI acts as a "new type of wood" or material, fundamentally changing what's possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:00">[06:04:00]</a>.

Notion has leveraged AI in several phases:
1.  **AI Writer**: Integrating writing capabilities directly into the daily workflow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:00">[06:04:00]</a>.
2.  **AI Q&A/Connectors**: Utilizing AI's ability to reason, understand, and search across bundled information within Notion, and eventually connecting to external sources like Jira or Zendesk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:00">[06:04:00]</a>.
3.  **AI as a Builder**: Perhaps the most fascinating development is AI's capacity to "piece things together" and even "code" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:00">[06:04:00]</a>. This allows AI to act as an agent that can assemble Notion's "Lego blocks" to create any kind of knowledge or customer software, addressing the historical challenge of Legos being hard for everyone to assemble from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:00">[06:04:00]</a>.

## Challenges and Lessons in Leadership

Ivan Zhao's leadership style, while often perceived as soft-spoken, is rooted in directness and a philosophical approach to building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>.

### Personal Growth and Adaptability
Zhao notes the need to "shave off the idealistic part" of himself to build something the world actually cares about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>. As Notion grew, he had to evolve from a "one-to-one influence" to a "one-to-many" storyteller, treating it as a necessary [[The concept of future founder fit and its impact on innovation | craft]] to pick up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>.

### Navigating Product Missteps
Notion experienced a period where it shipped features, like a hardcoded Sprint product for project management, that didn't align with its core "Lego for software" value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>. This created "organ rejection" with employees and customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>. The realization that the product "doesn't feel right" and customer feedback led them to pivot back to the original, modular building principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>.

### The COVID Scaling Crisis
During the COVID-19 pandemic, Notion faced a severe crisis due to rapid user growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>. The entire platform was running on a single PostgreSQL database instance, and despite continuously upgrading to larger machines, they were weeks away from running out of space and a complete shutdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>. The solution involved halting new feature development and dedicating almost every engineer to sharding the database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

Notion's journey reflects a deep philosophical approach to tools, human potential, and business. Zhao believes tools are extensions of us that, once shaped, can come back to shape us <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:00">[06:09:00]</a>. He aims to amplify creativity and beauty in software, aligning Notion's purpose with his personal values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:00">[06:09:00]</a>.

Zhao also highlights the cyclical nature of "bundling and unbundling" in business, referencing historical examples like the unbundling of early PC applications and the subsequent bundling by Microsoft, followed by the unbundling of SaaS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:00">[06:50:00]</a>. With AI and current market trends, he sees a shift back towards bundling, benefiting horizontal solutions like Notion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:00">[06:50:00]</a>.

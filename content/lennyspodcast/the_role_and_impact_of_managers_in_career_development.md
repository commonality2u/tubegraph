Bengali Kaba, with a distinguished career as an early growth Product Manager (PM) at Facebook, Head of Growth at Instagram, VP of Product at Instacart, and Director of Product Management at YouTube, emphasizes the profound influence managers have on an individual's [[career development for product owners and managers | career development]] and impact within an organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Manager as the Most Important Environmental Factor

Kaba's personal framework for choosing where to work and what to work on revolves around the concept that an individual's impact is a function of their environment and skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. Within the "environment" component, the manager is identified as the most crucial variable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Managerial Impact
> A great manager, characterized by empathy, awareness, and strong communication, possesses the ability to strategically adjust various elements of an employee's environment, such as scope, team composition, and even team culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>. This is why the saying, "people don't leave a job, they leave a manager," holds true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>.

### Understanding Your Manager's Perspective
For individuals feeling stuck or unable to make an impact, it's crucial to dispassionately articulate challenges to their manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>. This involves understanding what the manager is optimizing for, as there's often a disconnect between an Individual Contributor (IC) focusing on their specific area and the manager's broader organizational priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>.

> [!TIP] Aligning with Manager Goals
> Seek to understand your manager's priorities and identify tasks or areas within your remit that align with their objectives. This can create synergies and potentially lead to taking on more responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>.

## Manager as Coach and Builder of a "Coaching Tree"

Kaba emphasizes that leading product teams is akin to being a coach, enabling and maximizing the potential of team members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:01">[00:52:01]</a>. The analogy of a "coaching tree" from college basketball is particularly relevant, where head coaches take pride in the success of their assistant coaches who go on to become head coaches themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:54">[00:52:54]</a>.

> [!QUOTE] Bengali Kaba on Coaching Tree
> "The coaching tree of a Mike Shashki, the coaching tree of a John Calipari, these like esteem coaches not because of what not only because of what they've done but because of the tree that they've built... I think it's really important for product leaders to think about what is there like a leadership tree, like who have you help to build up and help to grow and help to get to their next role" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:16">[00:53:16]</a>

This concept highlights that a manager's responsibility extends to coaching individuals to greatness, building a repository of skills, knowledge, and team velocity, ensuring a "rising tide lifts all boats" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:01">[00:54:01]</a>.

## Leveraging Frameworks for Team Development

Drawing from his background in education, Kaba applies Bloom's Taxonomy to assess and develop team members' [[leadership_and_management_development | leadership and management development]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:57">[00:47:57]</a>. This framework helps identify where teams or individual PMs are struggling in terms of critical thinking levels:
*   **Knowledge:** Do they have the core information?
*   **Comprehension:** Do they understand it?
*   **Application:** Can they apply it?
*   **Analysis:** Can they analyze it across business segments?
*   **Synthesis:** Can they connect it to the broader business context?
*   **Evaluation:** Can they prioritize based on overall strategy? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:18">[00:48:18]</a>

> [!EXAMPLE] Applying Bloom's Taxonomy
> A PM might understand a concept like machine learning but lack the opportunity to apply it in diverse scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:50">[00:49:50]</a>. Alternatively, they might know how to apply it but struggle to synthesize its importance for the business context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:12">[00:50:12]</a>. For managers of managers, the goal is to operate at the top of this pyramid, synthesizing and evaluating what's happening across all their product teams to make bigger-picture connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:45">[00:50:45]</a>.

This approach ensures that managers meet people where they are, providing the specific support needed to bridge skill gaps rather than just expecting them to "figure it out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:05">[00:49:05]</a>.

## Learning from Managerial Misalignment

Kaba reflects on his time at Instacart as a period where his vision for the product's future didn't align with the company's operational DNA at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:38">[01:29:38]</a>. He aimed to build systems and processes for institutionalizing work, while the company needed a more tactical, "get your hands dirty" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:35">[01:30:35]</a>.

> [!TIP] Pre-Joining Due Diligence
> Before taking a new role, conduct "understand work" not only with current employees but also with former employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:16">[01:31:16]</a>. Former employees can provide a raw and different perspective, offering a more complete picture of the company's reality than those still employed who might present a "best version" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:41">[01:31:41]</a>. This triangulation of information is vital for assessing alignment.

In conclusion, the manager's role extends beyond task assignment; it encompasses understanding the individual's needs, fostering their growth, and creating an environment where they can maximize their impact. Bengali Kaba's experiences highlight that effective management is pivotal for both individual [[career development for product owners and managers | career development]] and organizational success, requiring a deep understanding of human dynamics and strategic development of [[the_role_of_capabilities_and_management_systems in strategy | capabilities and management systems]].

Effective disagreement is a crucial skill, particularly in professional environments, where it can lead to better outcomes and foster a culture of learning and trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. A key aspect of effective disagreement is overcoming the personal desire to always be right and instead prioritizing the collective goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>.

## Overcoming the Desire to Be Right

Amy Vora, Chief Product Officer at Fair, notes that her past identity was built on "being the person who was right and being the person who knew everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. However, she found that this approach did not serve her well in the working world, as it prevented her from receiving valuable information from others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. An old manager pointed out that not only was she expending a lot of energy trying to think through every possible solution by herself, but she was also often failing to reach the best answer because she ignored information others possessed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.

The fundamental shift needed is to "sublimate your ego a little bit and saying it's more important to get to the outcome than to be right" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. This shift is a battle with oneself, but it is necessary for growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>.

## Embracing Curiosity

A highly effective approach to disagreement is to react with genuine curiosity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. BOS, the CTO of Meta, observed Amy's ability to respond to even profound disagreements with "fascinating, you have to tell me more why you think that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This curiosity tears down walls between differing viewpoints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.

By being curious, one can learn new things and achieve better outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. This creates a positive feedback loop: curiosity leads to learning, which leads to better outcomes, and the other person feels better too <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>. Recognizing that people can look at the same "movie" or meeting and come away with entirely different understandings or "narratives" is fascinating and helpful for understanding how others see the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>.

## Practical Steps for Effective Disagreement

*   **Take a Pause:** When faced with a visceral reaction to disagreement, taking a pause allows the body to calm down and the mind to process, leading to a better, less primal response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>.
*   **Reinterpret Visceral Reactions:** Instead of viewing a visceral reaction as a signal to shut something down, interpret it as an opportunity to learn more and open up discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>.
*   **Acknowledge Different Information and Incentives:** Understand that disagreements often stem from people having different information or incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:03">[01:00:03]</a>. This is a sign of "healthy tension and knowledge," not poor intent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:31">[01:00:31]</a>.
*   **Agree on the Outcome:** Even with differing information or incentives, if all parties agree on the desired company or customer outcome, the discussion becomes about finding the best way to achieve that outcome, using everyone's unique information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:54">[01:00:54]</a>.
*   **Be Explicit:** Have rational, open, and explicit discussions about disagreements rather than trying to hide them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:21">[01:01:21]</a>.

### The Role of Feedback

Receiving and interpreting feedback is crucial for personal and professional growth. Amy received feedback about needing to be more "likable," which she initially interpreted as needing to "shrink" herself and be less opinionated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:49">[00:48:49]</a>. While this approach initially garnered positive reactions, it eventually hindered her ability to lead effectively, as her team needed her opinions and ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:22">[00:49:22]</a>.

Her refined approach to [[giving_feedback_and_making_apologies_effectively | feedback]] involves:
*   **Expanding Toolkits:** Instead of making oneself smaller, the goal is to "expand your tool sets" by building new ways to work with different styles of people and problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:42">[00:50:42]</a>. This makes one "bigger and more powerful and more expansive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:57">[00:50:57]</a>.
*   **Choosing How to Respond:** Not all feedback needs immediate action. It's important to choose whether to act on it directly, look for themes, take action in a different way, or decide that a certain operating style is who you are, while still providing context for your decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:27">[00:53:27]</a>.

> "Don't dampen who you are and your strengths, just continue expanding whenever you run into a problem, just add more to the things that you can do the tools that you have the way you can express yourself just keep on adding and growing and don't like shrink yourself ever." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:38">[00:55:38]</a>

## Embracing Sub-optimality in Leadership

As individuals become more senior, the problems they face are often fundamentally unsolvable in a perfect sense, because if they were, someone else would have solved them already <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:08">[01:02:08]</a>. Senior leaders are often choosing "which branch of sub optimal you're going to put your name on" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:31">[01:02:31]</a>. This perspective helps normalize the fact that decisions at higher levels are rarely perfect, but rather the "least bad" or "best possible for the time" option, consistent with a chosen framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:58">[01:02:58]</a>.

This understanding is important for individual contributors (ICs) to grasp, as they often view leaders' decisions as "terrible ideas" without the full context of limited options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:22">[01:04:22]</a>. Acknowledging that "no org is optimal" and that one optimizes for existing people, products, customers, and technology, helps frame the challenges of [[challenges_and_strategies_for_senior_leaders | senior leadership]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:39">[01:04:39]</a>. While it can feel like "being terrible at everything," the impact on customers and the world makes it worthwhile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:10">[01:04:10]</a>.

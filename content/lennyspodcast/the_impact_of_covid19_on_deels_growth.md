Deel, a payroll, HR, and compliance platform for global teams, was founded *before* the COVID-19 pandemic began <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:41">[00:44:41]</a>. However, the pandemic significantly impacted the company's growth trajectory by forcing many businesses into a "pilot program" of Deel's vision for global work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:52">[00:44:52]</a>.

## COVID-19 as a Catalyst for Global Work
The pandemic compelled companies to adopt remote work, whether employees were a block away or across the globe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00">[00:45:00]</a>. This shift in working models allowed more people to experience the reality that effective work could happen without being in the same physical space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>. As a result, businesses became more comfortable hiring talent regardless of their location, recognizing that the best person for a job might not be within their immediate region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:08">[00:46:08]</a>.

Concerns arose as COVID-19 restrictions began to lift, with some questioning whether Deel's usage would decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:20">[00:45:20]</a>. Deel's consistent response was that they are a "global work platform," not merely a "remote work platform" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:28">[00:45:28]</a>. This distinction proved crucial, as many customers who returned to physical offices later expanded their operations to include offices in various countries like Germany, Canada, the U.S., and France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:33">[00:45:33]</a>.

## Growth Drivers
Deel greatly benefited from being able to provide solutions during a time of urgent need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:56">[00:45:56]</a>. Early on, a significant portion of Deel's growth came through word of mouth, as companies urgently sought solutions for payroll and legally compliant international contractor hiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:30">[00:46:30]</a>. Deel consistently positioned itself as the answer to these specific problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:01">[00:47:01]</a>.

## Internal Adaptations and Culture
Being a "pandemic business" meant that some typical startup elements, like company swag, were deferred until much later in Deel's journey. For instance, swag was only created when the company needed t-shirts for a photo opportunity on NASDAQ after reaching a billion-dollar valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:06">[01:04:06]</a>.

The remote-first culture, established from day one, fostered a unique sense of authenticity and camaraderie among team members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:32">[01:04:32]</a>. Employees were able to show up as their authentic selves in virtual meetings, with pets and partners often visible, which helped build team culture and closeness even before colleagues met in person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:42">[01:04:42]</a>. For example, Melton Quran Berkowitz, Head of Growth at Deel, did not meet many of her colleagues in person until a year and a half after joining the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:21">[01:03:21]</a>. This environment allowed for sincerity and eliminated pressure to conform to traditional office appearances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:50">[01:04:50]</a>.

Graham Weaver, a professor at Stanford Graduate School of Business, often receives the question "What should I do with my life?" from his students, despite teaching a course technically named "Managing Growing Enterprises" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Weaver's primary aim is to help students figure out their life's purpose and escape "autopilot mode" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. He emphasizes that the advice he shares is rooted in his own experience as the founder and CEO of Alpine Investors, a top-performing private equity firm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

## Getting Out of Autopilot Mode

Many people operate in an "autopilot mode," going through daily routines without intentionality or understanding why they do what they do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. This often means living unconsciously, driven by subconscious thoughts and societal pressures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. Weaver stresses the importance of gaining intentionality by creating space, asking deep questions, and aligning one's calendar with life's intentions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>.

### The Genie Framework

To help individuals identify their true desires, Weaver developed the Genie Framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. This exercise involves a hypothetical scenario:
Imagine you find a magic lamp, and a Genie grants you one wish: "Whatever you throw yourself into with your whole life and your career, it's going to turn out great. It's probably going to take longer than you think, it's going to be harder than you think, but you're going to be really happy you did, and it's going to work out beyond your wildest imagination" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.
The question then is: "What would you wish for?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>

The answer reveals a deep-seated desire, unburdened by the [[the_pitfalls_of_shortterm_career_focus | fear of failure]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. This "Genie goal" is what one should strive to pursue, even if it requires preparation or time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>. Itâ€™s about being happy with the journey, which will likely evolve in unexpected ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>.

Other powerful questions to unearth true desires include:
*   "What would you do if you knew you wouldn't fail?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>
*   "If you didn't have to make money, what would you do?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>
*   "What's play for you that is work for other people?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>
*   "What's the thing you really want to do but you're just too embarrassed to say it?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>
*   "Who are some people that you admire and want to be more like, and what do they do?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>
*   "What are some things you want to learn and how do you want to grow over the next 5-10 years?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>

### Overcoming Limiting Beliefs

Limiting beliefs are most dangerous when subconscious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>.
To overcome them:
1.  **Write them down:** Putting them on paper strips them of much of their power and scariness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>.
2.  **Translate into "to-do" items:** Once on paper, fears become specific obstacles that can be consciously addressed, just like any other problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a>.

### The Power of Passion

Pursuing one's passion, or internal scorecard, leads to greater energy, longevity, and success than following an external scorecard or taking a "safe" job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>. This alignment creates a "superpower" where individuals are willing to work harder, longer, and more enthusiastically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:43">[00:24:43]</a>.

Weaver acknowledges that financial constraints are real for many <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:34">[00:25:34]</a>. His advice is to work towards financial stability while simultaneously beginning the journey toward the desired path, even if it's a side project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:50">[00:25:50]</a>.

### Life is Suffering, So Choose Something Worth Suffering For

> "Life is suffering, so figure out something worth suffering for. You're gonna suffer either way." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>

Every path involves hardship. The difference lies in whether that suffering is for something you care about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:47">[00:30:47]</a>. There is no truly "easy" path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:08">[00:31:08]</a>.

### Everything You Want is on the Other Side of Worse First

> "Everything you want is on the other side of worse first." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:34">[00:31:34]</a>

Any significant positive change, whether in health, career, or relationships, typically involves an initial period of discomfort or negativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:50">[00:31:50]</a>. If one optimizes for tomorrow's immediate comfort, they will remain stagnant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:32">[00:32:32]</a>. The key is to make decisions based on what your future self (e.g., five years from now) would wish you had done today, understanding that the initial phase will be difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:55">[00:32:55]</a>. This willingness to endure short-term pain is crucial for avoiding plateaus in [[building_a_long_and_meaningful_career | career development]] and life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:30">[00:33:30]</a>.

### The Nine Lives Exercise

This exercise aims to make the pursuit of a career goal less intimidating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:31">[00:43:31]</a>.
1.  **List nine distinct lives:**
    *   Life one is your current life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:39">[00:43:39]</a>.
    *   All subsequent lives must start from today (no going back in time) and must be exciting to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:07">[00:44:07]</a>.
    *   Examples include starting a business, becoming an author, a professor, an actor, or a social media creator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:16">[00:44:16]</a>.
2.  **Pull desired lives into your current one:** Identify the life that gives you the most energy and integrate aspects of it into your current daily routine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:07">[00:45:07]</a>. This could be a side project or a new hobby <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:21">[00:45:21]</a>. This practice provides tremendous energy for all areas of life and can reveal your true path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:31">[00:45:31]</a>.
3.  **Realize you can live multiple lives:** Over a lifetime, it's possible to experience many of these desired "lives" sequentially, as careers often pivot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:55">[00:45:55]</a>.

### Avoiding "Not Now"

The common phrase "not now" is often a subtle way of saying "not ever" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:37">[00:47:37]</a>.
*   **Embrace "never the right time":** Change is rarely secure or safe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:07">[00:48:07]</a>. Waiting for perfect conditions will lead to waiting indefinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:35">[00:48:35]</a>.
*   **Address obstacles as solvable problems:** Financial constraints, for example, are obstacles to be overcome, not insurmountable barriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:17">[00:49:17]</a>.

## Accountability and Implementation

> "The answer is accountability. How do you how do you keep yourself accountable to kind of living the life you want to live?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:50">[00:48:50]</a>

*   **Executive Coaches:** Similar to a personal trainer for your physical health, an executive coach helps create space for introspection on big life questions (career, relationships, health, spirituality, etc.) and holds you accountable to your intentions and goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:41">[00:37:41]</a>.
*   **Accountability Partner:** If a coach isn't feasible, find a like-minded friend to meet regularly and discuss dreams, hopes, and progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:18">[00:39:18]</a>.
*   **The Power of Talking:** Verbalizing your thoughts and goals activates more of your brain than just thinking or writing, making the process more effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>.
*   **The "Green Notebook" Exercise:** Write down your overarching goal (e.g., "I am the number one rower in the country") and then list three specific actions you will take *today* to move toward that goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:12">[00:41:12]</a>. This simple daily practice powerfully programs your subconscious mind towards your aspirations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:36">[00:41:36]</a>.

## Internal vs. External Scorecard

Life often appears as a series of external obstacles and events, making it feel like an external journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:05">[00:50:05]</a>. However, the true "game of life" is an internal one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:40">[00:49:40]</a>. Most of one's experience is internal, shaped by stories we tell ourselves about what we need to be happy, worthy, or respected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:01">[00:51:01]</a>.

> "The most important thing I've learned in the first 50 years of my life is that the true Game of Life is an internal one, not an external one. And that Journey starts with three powerful words: I am enough." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:36">[00:49:36]</a>

External achievements, such as financial success, do not inherently change internal feelings of happiness, worth, or fulfillment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:08">[00:53:08]</a>. Realizing this can be terrifying but ultimately liberating, as it empowers individuals to define their own internal scorecard and values, rather than relying on external validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:06">[00:52:06]</a>.

## When to Quit

> "I think the time to quit is when you can no longer see the vision and you can no longer really believe the vision and and then when that happens for a long period of time or when maybe you're no longer even excited about the vision." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:37">[01:00:37]</a>

While it's important to persevere through "dark days," a sustained inability to see or believe in the core vision might indicate it's time to quit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:56">[01:00:56]</a>. Instead of quitting, focus on "scaling your bright spots" â€“ identifying what *is* working, even if small, and doing more of that <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:36">[01:01:36]</a>. These small successes can gradually magnify to become a successful strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:52">[01:01:52]</a>.

## Overall Advice

You have one life, one shot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:31">[01:02:31]</a>. Take the time to define what a "wonderful, amazing, incredible life" looks like across all areas: career, relationships, health, spirituality, and finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:36">[01:02:36]</a>. The first step to achieving your dreams is simply to know what you truly want <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:02">[01:03:02]</a>.

> "Don't ask what the world needs. Ask instead what makes you come alive, because what the world needs most is for you to come alive." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:10">[01:07:10]</a>

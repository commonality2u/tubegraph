Effective product positioning is crucial for success in the B2B tech sector. It defines how a product is the best at delivering specific value to a well-defined set of companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>. When a product is not performing well, the problem may not be the product itself, but rather its [[importance_of_proper_product_positioning_in_b2b_tech_companies | positioning]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## The Essence of Positioning

Product positioning encompasses several key elements:
*   Identifying alternatives to your product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.
*   Understanding how your product is different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.
*   Defining the unique value your product delivers that no other can <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.
*   Pinpointing the target audience who values that unique offering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.
*   Defining the market category your product intends to dominate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>.

For B2B tech companies, the ultimate test of positioning is whether it resonates with your actual buyers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. It doesn't matter if a non-buyer understands your product; what matters is if qualified prospects get excited and want to buy it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>.

## Signs of Weak Positioning

Weak positioning can impact an entire company's pipeline, leading to sluggish marketing responses, prolonged sales cycles, and high customer churn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. Key indicators of a [[positioning_and_its_impact_on_sales_strategy | positioning problem]] during sales calls include:
*   **Confusion:** Customers asking "Could you just say that again?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.
*   **Misclassification:** Customers thinking they understand your product but categorizing it incorrectly (e.g., "You're just like Salesforce") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.
*   **Lack of Perceived Value:** Customers understanding what your product does but not why anyone would pay for it ("I just don't get why anyone would pay for that") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

## Aligning Teams on Positioning

A common cause of weak positioning is a lack of alignment across internal teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>. The founder, marketing department, sales team, and product team may all have slightly different ideas of what the positioning is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>. To ensure positioning is effective and adopted, it must be a collaborative effort. Ideally, representatives from marketing, product, sales, customer success, and the executive team (including the CEO) should work together to build it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>. This ensures that everyone brings their expertise and understanding of customers and the product to the table, fostering agreement and alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>.

## April Dunford's Approach to Product Positioning

[[april_dunfords_expertise_in_product_positioning_and_her_approach | April Dunford]], author of "Obviously Awesome," is a leading expert in product positioning, having led teams at seven successful B2B startups and consulted with over 200 companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. She emphasizes that positioning is a foundational marketing concept that requires a clear methodology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

Her methodology for [[developing_a_product_strategy | developing a product strategy]] involves a structured, five-step process:

1.  **Competitive Alternatives:**
    *   This is the critical first step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:27">[00:23:27]</a>. Instead of just identifying direct competitors, companies must consider all "competitive alternatives" â€“ anything a customer might use to solve the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:44">[00:23:44]</a>.
    *   This includes the "status quo" (what the company is currently doing, even if it's inefficient, like spreadsheets or pen and paper) and other products that might land on a customer's shortlist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:59">[00:23:59]</a>. In B2B, roughly 40% of deals are lost to "no decision," meaning the customer sticks with the status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:26">[00:24:26]</a>.

2.  **Differentiated Capabilities:**
    *   Once alternatives are understood, the next step is to list all the unique capabilities your product possesses that competitors do not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>. This includes features, functions, or company-level capabilities like pricing models or professional services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:16">[00:25:16]</a>.

3.  **Value Themes:**
    *   Translate each differentiated capability into the value it provides to the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:32">[00:25:32]</a>. This mapping often reveals two or three core "value themes" that are truly differentiated, rather than just generally valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:46">[00:25:46]</a>.

4.  **Best-Fit Customers (Target Accounts):**
    *   Not all companies will value your unique offering equally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:27">[00:26:27]</a>. Identify the specific characteristics of target accounts that make them deeply care about your differentiated value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:31">[00:26:31]</a>. This helps define your ideal customer profile.

5.  **Market Category:**
    *   Finally, determine the market category that provides the best context for your product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:45">[00:26:45]</a>. The ideal market category makes your unique value proposition obvious to your target customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:11">[00:27:11]</a>. Starting with market category first is a common mistake that can lead to poor positioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:47">[00:26:47]</a>.

### Example: Help Scout

Help Scout, a customer success software company, operates in a competitive market dominated by Zendesk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:50">[00:29:50]</a>.
*   **Competitive Alternatives:** Zendesk, other customer service platforms, or even rudimentary shared inboxes or email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:09">[00:30:09]</a>.
*   **Differentiated Capabilities:** Features for delivering amazing service, such as a proper service-oriented shared inbox, assigning a person (not a ticket number), and intelligent chatbot features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:37">[00:30:37]</a>. Their philosophy is not to push customers to low-cost channels, but to treat them like people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:03">[00:31:03]</a>.
*   **Value Themes:** Delivering amazing customer service that deepens customer relationships and drives growth through customer loyalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:44">[00:31:44]</a>.
*   **Best-Fit Customers:** Small to medium businesses, particularly direct-to-consumer or e-commerce brands, who view customer service as a growth driver, not just a cost center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:52">[00:31:52]</a>.
*   **Market Category:** Customer Success Software, but framed with a unique story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:50">[00:32:50]</a>.

The result of this process is not just a document with bullet points, but a compelling sales narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:01">[00:34:01]</a>. This narrative, articulated through pitch decks, demos, and scripts, ensures that sales, marketing, product, and the CEO are all "singing the same song" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:08">[00:35:08]</a>.

## Positioning vs. Messaging vs. Branding

These terms are often confused, but [[strategies_for_creating_brand_awareness_and_effective_marketing | positioning]] is a fundamental input for both messaging and branding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:27">[00:40:27]</a>.
*   **Positioning:** Defines how a product wins in the market relative to its alternatives and who it wins for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:48">[00:40:48]</a>.
*   **Messaging:** The actual text and language used on a homepage or in communications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:30">[00:40:30]</a>. It cannot be effectively created without first understanding positioning (who the message is for and what the unique value is) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:53">[00:40:53]</a>.
*   **Branding:** Relates to what the company or product stands for, its visual identity, and emotional connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:05">[00:41:05]</a>. This also requires clear positioning to ensure the brand is distinct and resonates with the target buyer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:21">[00:41:21]</a>.

## Positioning for Startups and Early-Stage Products

For very early-stage products, it's often more effective to start with a "positioning thesis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:11">[00:50:11]</a>. This thesis is a documented assumption about who your competitors are, your differentiation, the value you deliver, and your target market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:21">[00:50:21]</a>.

At this stage, the thesis is likely "partially incorrect" because it's based on assumptions and limited data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:51">[00:50:51]</a>. Therefore, it's beneficial to keep the positioning a "little bit loose" initially, allowing the market to pull you in unexpected directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:08">[00:51:08]</a>. This allows for discovery of unforeseen uses or customer segments (e.g., a "tuna fishing net" turning out to be amazing for "grouper") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:21">[00:51:21]</a>.

The transition from "loose" to "tight" positioning occurs when a clear pattern emerges regarding who loves your product and why <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:49">[00:52:49]</a>. This might involve identifying commonalities among customers that weren't initially obvious, such as shared software packages or team structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:20">[00:53:20]</a>. Once these patterns are clear, the company can then confidently "smash your foot on the gas" and target that specific market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:50">[00:53:50]</a>.

## Segmentation vs. Personas in B2B

These terms are often confused, but they serve distinct purposes in B2B.

*   **Segmentation:** How a market is split up into distinct groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:25">[00:55:25]</a>. In B2B, this is typically based on company characteristics (firmographics like size, revenue, geography) or specific attributes like the use of certain software, team structures, or existing problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:21">[00:56:21]</a>. Effective segmentation is "actionable," meaning you can identify and target companies based on these characteristics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:58">[00:56:58]</a>. This informs [[key_strategies_and_practices_for_effective_product_management_and_team_building | go-to-market strategies]], marketing campaigns, and sales targeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:40">[00:57:40]</a>.

*   **Personas:** Focus on the characteristics of a particular buyer or individual within a company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:52">[00:55:52]</a>. They delve into motivations, hopes, dreams, fears, and desired outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:02">[00:56:02]</a>.

In B2B, multiple individuals (often 5-7) are involved in a purchasing decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:11">[00:58:11]</a>. However, the "champion" in the account is by far the most crucial persona <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:52">[01:00:52]</a>. This individual's job is to gain consensus and champion the deal internally, including selling it to the economic buyer (the person who writes the check) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:02">[01:01:02]</a>. If the positioning doesn't resonate with this champion, the deal won't even get on the short list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:16">[01:01:16]</a>. Therefore, focus should be on creating a persona that crushes it with the champion, and then arming that champion to sell to other stakeholders (IT, purchasing, end-users, management) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:30">[01:01:30]</a>. Creating detailed personas for every involved party is often an "utter waste of time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:12">[01:02:12]</a>.

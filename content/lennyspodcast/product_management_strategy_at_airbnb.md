From: [[lennyspodcast]] <br/> 

Airbnb CEO and co-founder Brian Chesky has significantly restructured the company's approach to product management, moving away from traditional models to a more integrated, functional, and CEO-led approach. This shift was largely influenced by internal challenges and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>.

## Evolution of Product Management at Airbnb

Historically, Airbnb operated with a more traditional product management function, which eventually led to challenges such as slow product development, rising costs, internal politics, and bureaucracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

Before the changes, the company experienced:
*   **Technical Debt & Dependencies** Different groups ran on slightly different technical stacks, accumulating technical debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. Teams were highly dependent on core platforms, leading to bottlenecks and backlogs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.
*   **Decentralization and Politics** Teams began building their own versions of shared services (e.g., marketing departments), leading to separate divisions and internal advocacy for individual interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. This fostered [[decision_making_in_product_management | politics]] and bureaucracy, making it hard to know who was doing what and leading to a lack of accountability and complacency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.
*   **Disconnection Between Functions** Marketing and engineering often operated in different "universes," with a disconnect between shipping products and customers knowing about them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. Marketing was seen as waiters and engineers as chefs, with chefs yelling at waiters, despite waiters talking directly to customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>.
*   **Over-reliance on Performance Marketing** Significant spending on performance marketing ($1 billion on AdWords by 2019) without sufficient investment in brand marketing or educating customers about new product features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>. This did not create accumulating advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>.
*   **Incrementalism** A lack of marketing for new features led to an incremental product approach, as major new releases weren't being adopted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>.
*   **Slow Development** Despite efforts to empower teams and delegate, product development became slower and less clear, with teams feeling disempowered by indirect leadership involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>.

### The Pandemic as a Catalyst
The COVID-19 pandemic, which caused Airbnb to lose 80% of its business in eight weeks, served as a "near-death business experience" that provided clarity and forced a drastic re-evaluation of the company's operating model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:20">[02:20:20]</a>. This led to a significant shift in [[the_operating_model_in_product_management | the operating model in product management]], with Chesky getting more involved in details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:10">[02:49:10]</a>.

## Key Pillars of the New Product Management Strategy

Brian Chesky's revamped [[product_management_methodologies | product management methodology]] at Airbnb centers on a highly integrated, functional, and centralized approach, with the CEO playing a direct product role.

### CEO Involvement / Product-Led Leadership
*   **CEO as Chief Product Officer (CPO)** Chesky believes the CEO of a product or tech company should essentially be the CPO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:38">[01:16:38]</a>.
*   **Hands-On Leadership** Chesky pulled decision-making back in, getting deeply involved in product details, reviews, and design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>. He holds regular CEO review sessions (weekly to bi-weekly) for all projects, ensuring direct oversight and immediate bottleneck resolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:29">[02:28:29]</a>.
*   **"Being in the Details" vs. Micromanagement** Chesky differentiates "being in the details" from micromanagement. Being in the details means understanding the work to assess performance and provide development, similar to how a board oversees a CEO, without telling people exactly what to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:50">[00:31:50]</a>.
*   **Clarity and Shared Consciousness** The goal is to provide clarity and enable the entire company to "row in the same direction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. The top 30-40 people in the company now have "one continuous conversation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:16">[02:17:16]</a>.

### Rethinking the Product Management Role
*   **Product Marketing Integration** The traditional product management function was combined with product marketing responsibilities, meaning product managers are now also responsible for understanding how to talk about and distribute the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.
*   **Offboarding Program Management** Many program management tasks previously handled by product managers were offloaded to dedicated program managers, making their roles more senior and high-status within the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.
*   **Smaller, More Senior Teams** The product group was made smaller and more senior, with fewer junior product marketers. All members must understand how to effectively communicate about the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.
*   **Management by Influence** Product marketing managers manage by influence and do not directly control or drive designing or engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.
*   **Expert Leaders** Every executive is expected to be an expert in their functional domain, managing the work first and the people second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:29">[02:26:29]</a>. This eliminates "people managers" whose sole responsibility is people, not the work or domain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:07">[00:36:07]</a>.

### Integrated Product and Marketing
*   **Single Voice** Functions like UX writing were combined with marketing writing to ensure a single, consistent voice across emails, the app, and ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:41">[00:30:41]</a>.
*   **In-House Creative** Airbnb built its own in-house creative agency to handle not just ads but also product creative, integrating brand touchpoints directly into the design process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:15">[00:30:15]</a>.
*   **Marketing as Education** Marketing is viewed as educating people on the unique benefits of new products, rather than just brand or performance marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>.

### Streamlined Operations and Structure
*   **Functional Model** The company returned to a functional model (design, engineering, product marketing, marketing, communications, sales, operations) instead of divisional leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. This ensures cohesive product development, preventing separate teams from building incompatible solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:47">[04:18:47]</a>.
*   **Fewer Projects and Employees** The number of concurrent projects was drastically cut, focusing on doing "about 20% of these things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:30">[02:30:30]</a>. The company aims for fewer employees (under 7,000) and more senior people to avoid slowing projects down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:09">[02:10:09]</a>.
*   **Reduced Management Layers** Layers of management were removed to create a flatter structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>.

### Product-Led Growth Philosophy
*   **Building the Best Product** Airbnb shifted its focus from traditional growth channels like paid growth to betting that building the best possible product and effectively communicating about it will drive growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>.
*   **Product-Marketing Synergy** The strategy emphasizes that you can't build a product effectively unless you know how to talk about it, and being an expert in making a product requires expertise in its market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:00">[00:42:00]</a>.
*   **Strategic AB Testing** AB testing is used with clear hypotheses to ensure improvements, rather than randomly testing variations, to maintain a cohesive system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>.

### Strategic Planning and Cadence
*   **Rolling Two-Year Roadmap** Airbnb now operates with a rolling two-year [[writing_effective_product_strategies_and_onepagers | product strategy]] roadmap that is updated every six months with planned releases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>.
*   **Bi-Annual Product Launches** Products are released twice a year, typically in May and November/October, with the entire company working together towards these launches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>.
*   **Story-Driven Development** Before development, the team figures out the "story" of the product, which often dictates the product itself, fostering a cohesive and unified vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.

## Impact and Benefits of the New Approach
*   **Increased Pace and Decisiveness** The new approach has led to a significant increase in the pace of work and faster decisions, driven by a bias for action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:51">[00:47:51]</a>.
*   **Reduced Bureaucracy and Conflict** Fewer conflicts and less turnover have been observed, as teams are more aligned and leadership is directly involved in resolving bottlenecks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:47">[00:51:47]</a>.
*   **Enhanced Clarity and Alignment** The direct involvement of leadership and the unified roadmap have fostered greater clarity and alignment across the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.
*   **Improved Product Cohesion** By working as a unified functional model and focusing on a single product story, the company can produce cohesive products that feel like they were designed by a few people, not a thousand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>.
*   **Focus on Core Experience** This model has enabled significant product launches like "Guest Favorites," which leverages 370 million reviews and internal data to identify the top 2 million homes, addressing reliability concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>.
*   **Investment in Host Tools** A major overhaul of the "Host tab" was implemented, including an AI-powered photo tour, recognizing that great guest experiences stem from great tools for hosts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a>.
*   **New Design Aesthetic** Airbnb has pioneered a new, more three-dimensional, colorful, and textured design aesthetic for its interfaces, moving away from flat design and integrating AI for sophisticated interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>.

## Advice for Other Companies
Brian Chesky believes this [[product_management_methodologies | methodology]] can work for any company, though it doesn't require going "all the way to 100" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>. His advice includes:
*   **CEO Product Ownership** The CEO, if they are a product person, should see themselves as the chief product officer and be directly involved in the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>.
*   **Interconnected Teams** Product teams should be interconnected and aware of each other's work, avoiding independent silos unless truly separate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.
*   **Expert Leaders** Leaders must be experts in what they are leading, not just people managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.
*   **Lean Teams** Aim for as few people as possible on teams, growing slowly and deliberately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.
*   **Unified Focus** Five teams should work on one thing rather than one team doing five things, fostering collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.
*   **Strategic Launches** Consider doing periodic launches, even if continuous shipping occurs, to package and tell a cohesive story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.
*   **Balance Data, Research, and Intuition** Use data, but also rely on research and intuition; deep understanding cannot be delegated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.
*   **Design Reporting Structure** Ideally, engineering and design should report to the founder/product-led person, and design should not be subordinate to product unless the product person is also a designer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.
*   **Expanded Product Management Scope** Product management responsibilities should expand to include distribution, customer understanding, and storytelling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>. Product managers should blend "Art and Science" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.
*   **Interconnected Marketing and Engineering** Ensure strong ties between marketing and engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.
*   **Minimal Layers** Maintain as few layers as possible between the CEO and other employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.
*   **Story-Driven Vision** Each product release should be a chapter in a larger, ongoing story, viewing the company in a five or ten-year narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.
*   **Unified Direction** The most critical element is for everyone to "row in the same direction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.

## Leadership Philosophy and Continuous Learning
Chesky's leadership philosophy is foundational to Airbnb's [[importance_of_strategy_and_decision_making_in_product_management | product management strategy]] and has helped shape its evolution:

*   **Setting Ambitious Goals** Chesky employs the "add a zero" concept, pushing teams to think 10x bigger or better. This forces first-principles thinking to break down problems and find innovative solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>.
*   **Pace and Decisiveness** A leader's job is to set the pace, which comes from being decisive and having a bias for action, avoiding delays and "circling back" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>.
*   **Seeing Potential** Leaders should see potential in people that they may not see in themselves, fostering a growth mindset rather than demoralizing teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>.
*   **Avoiding Burnout** Chesky observes that being deeply involved paradoxically creates more time once the new system is established, as there are fewer conflicts and surprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>. He emphasizes health, meaningful work, and healthy relationships as key to avoiding burnout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:00">[00:53:00]</a>.
*   **Continuous Learning** Chesky maintains a "beginner's mindset," constantly seeking to learn, study the history of organizational structures, and be "shameless about reaching out for help" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>. He believes in constantly evolving and growing like an artist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>.
*   **Proactive vs. Reactive** Leaders should proactively set agendas and prioritize time based on strategy, rather than reacting to incoming emails or meeting requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>. He aims to say "no" to "fake work" that doesn't advance goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>.

This comprehensive approach to product management, deeply influenced by Chesky's background as an artist and industrial designer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>, seeks to embed design, clarity, and strategic storytelling at the core of Airbnb's operations.

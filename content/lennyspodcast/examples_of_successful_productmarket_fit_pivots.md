Finding [[Stages of productmarket fit | product-market fit]] is the most critical task for a startup within its first three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It is often underexplored and underexplained as a topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. A consistent set of patterns, focusing on demand, satisfaction, and efficiency, has been observed in successful startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. When a startup gets stuck, one of the key strategies is to [[Effective pivot strategies for startups | pivot]] or change certain aspects of their approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## The 4 Ps Framework for Pivoting

First Round Capital has developed a [[Framework for finding productmarket fit | framework]] to help founders find [[Stages of productmarket fit | product-market fit]], which includes a strategic approach to [[Pivoting ideas in startups for productmarket fit | pivots]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:37">[01:37:37]</a>. This framework suggests that four key elements, known as the "4 Ps," can be adjusted when a startup is stuck:
*   **Persona**: Who you are targeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:32">[00:32:32]</a>, or the specific type of customer in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:02">[01:13:02]</a>.
*   **Problem**: The issue you are solving for that persona <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:34">[00:32:34]</a>.
*   **Promise**: How you pitch or describe your solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:36">[00:32:36]</a>, which is tied to positioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:38">[00:33:38]</a>.
*   **Product**: The actual solution or offering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:37">[00:32:37]</a>.

All four of these elements must align for [[Stages of productmarket fit | product-market fit]] to be achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:28">[00:32:28]</a>. Different companies successfully pivot by changing different combinations of these Ps.

## Examples of Successful Pivots

### Vanta: Changing All Four Ps

Vanta, founded in 2016 by Christina Copo, initially explored other ideas, including a "B2B Alexa" smart speaker for meeting summaries and a Drop Shipping concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:15">[00:23:15]</a>. Christina realized these weren't working and shifted her approach to talking to potential customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>. She focused on security, asking CTOs and security engineers what they hated most about their jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a>. Repeatedly, they cited the pain of filling out security questionnaires and doing compliance audits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>.

Christina identified a critical pain point that could "unlock revenue" for companies by helping them achieve compliance certifications like SOC 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:34">[00:24:34]</a>. For her first pseudo-customers (Segment, Front, Figma), she manually filled out spreadsheets and provided them with the necessary documentation, even though no product existed yet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:45">[00:24:45]</a>. This inefficient but highly satisfying approach demonstrated an insane level of customer satisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:56">[00:25:56]</a>.

In Vanta's case, they "changed all four" Ps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:05">[00:32:05]</a>:
*   **Persona**: Shifted from generic business users to security engineers and CTOs.
*   **Problem**: From meeting summaries or drop shipping to compliance automation.
*   **Promise**: From general utility to "unlocking revenue" by enabling enterprise sales through compliance.
*   **Product**: From smart speakers or vague drop shipping solutions to a manual compliance service that eventually became an automation platform.

### Lattis: Keeping the Persona

Jack Altman founded Lattis in 2015, initially as an OKR (Objectives and Key Results) tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:10">[00:29:10]</a>. He observed that companies struggled with OKRs, leading to arguments and employee non-compliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:23">[00:29:23]</a>. While he could sell the OKR tool to heads of HR, customers would use it for one quarter and then churn, finding it ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:41">[00:29:41]</a>.

Jack decided to pivot, but he "kept the Persona" â€“ the head of HR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:10">[00:30:10]</a>. He had built strong relationships with these HR leaders and understood their other problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:37">[00:30:37]</a>. Recognizing the pendulum swing back to favoring Performance Management around 2015-2016, he presented Figma mockups for a new, modern performance management solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:52">[00:30:52]</a>. The response was overwhelmingly positive, leading to sales of his first five to ten customers with just mockups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:27">[00:31:27]</a>.

Lattis's pivot involved:
*   **Persona**: Kept the same (Heads of HR).
*   **Problem**: Changed from OKR management to broader Performance Management.
*   **Promise**: Changed from fixing OKRs to providing a modern, employee/manager-friendly performance management solution.
*   **Product**: Changed from an OKR tool to a people management platform.

### Plaid: Keeping the Product Elements

Plaid initially began as a consumer budgeting app designed to help users save money and budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:20">[00:32:20]</a>. However, it wasn't popular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:30">[00:32:30]</a>. The founders, frustrated, realized they had built a crucial component: an API that connected the app to bank accounts, solving complex underlying issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:35">[00:32:35]</a>.

When friends at companies like Venmo, Robinhood, and Coinbase expressed interest in licensing this core bank account connection technology, Plaid pivoted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:44">[00:32:44]</a>. They kept a lot of the code they had written and the underlying product functionality related to bank connectivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:54">[00:32:54]</a>.

Plaid's pivot is an example of keeping the Product (core technology) but fundamentally changing the other three Ps:
*   **Persona**: Changed from consumers with budgeting problems to developers at fintech companies.
*   **Problem**: Changed from personal budgeting to connecting to bank accounts for other applications.
*   **Promise**: Changed from helping individuals save money to enabling fintech developers to build financial products.

### Ironclad: Changing the Promise/Positioning

Ironclad, a legal tech company founded in 2015, started by positioning itself as an "AI legal assistant" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:08">[00:46:08]</a>. In 2014, this concept was difficult to sell as no one was looking for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:20">[00:46:20]</a>.

A breakthrough occurred when a customer emailed asking, "Are you a CLM?" (Contract Lifecycle Management) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:53">[00:46:53]</a>. Founder Jason Biggs researched CLMs and realized his product *could* fit this existing category. He replied affirmatively and, even with a hastily coded demo made on a train, won a contract against established vendors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:28">[00:47:28]</a>. Ironclad's product was seen as more modern, automated, and AI-powered than competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:55">[00:47:55]</a>.

Ironclad's pivot primarily involved the **Promise** (positioning) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:40">[00:48:40]</a>:
*   They shifted from trying to create a new, unknown category ("AI legal assistant") to playing in an existing, understood category ("CLM") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>.
*   They expanded the definition of the CLM category by highlighting their advanced features, rather than trying to educate the market on a completely new concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:13">[00:48:13]</a>.

### Looker: Mastering Delivery at Level 1

Looker, a business intelligence company founded in 2012, spent a considerable amount of time at Level 1 [[Stages of productmarket fit | product-market fit]] before rapidly accelerating through Level 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:44">[00:43:44]</a>. Founder Lloyd Tabb personally engaged in extensive consulting for the first five customers, spending 20-40 hours modeling their data and teaching them how to use the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:57">[00:43:57]</a>. This was because Looker was not a product that could be sold with mockups; customers needed to see their own data integrated to grasp its value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:02">[00:44:02]</a>.

This intense, inefficient, "forward deploy process" was crucial. Once refined, it became repeatable, allowing them to scale quickly from 5 to 25 customers with high close rates (75%) and zero churn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:34">[00:44:34]</a>.

While not a typical pivot of the "4 Ps," Looker's journey demonstrates a critical shift in *how* they delivered their product to achieve deep customer satisfaction, which then enabled scalable demand and [[Growth strategies and achieving productmarket fit in startups | growth]]. They perfected their [[Product market fit techniques | product-market fit technique]] at the earliest stage, turning a consulting-like approach into a repeatable sales process.

## Key Takeaways

*   **Pivots are Common**: Many successful companies had to make significant changes to their initial vision to find [[Stages of productmarket fit | product-market fit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.
*   **The 4 Ps as Levers**: Understanding Persona, Problem, Promise, and Product provides a structured way to think about what to change when stuck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:56">[00:31:56]</a>.
*   **Don't Be Afraid of Big Pivots**: Founders often make "10% pivots" when a "200% pivot" is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:20">[00:51:20]</a>. It's psychologically hard to let go of an existing approach, but sometimes necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:31">[00:51:31]</a>.
*   **Listen to Customers**: Actively seeking critical feedback and understanding customer pain points (e.g., "dollar-driven discovery") is vital for identifying the right areas to pivot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:16">[01:14:16]</a>. Rick Song of Persona famously tried to avoid being "friendzoned" by customers, directly asking if his product was a necessity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:38">[00:36:38]</a>.
*   **Prioritize Satisfaction Early**: At Level 1, it's acceptable to be inefficient if it helps uncover an intensely satisfying solution for a few key customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:24">[00:22:24]</a>.
*   **Growth Comes from Repeatability**: Once deep satisfaction is achieved, the focus shifts to creating a repeatable process for acquiring and serving customers to scale demand and improve efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>.

The journey to [[Stages of productmarket fit | product-market fit]] is challenging, with roughly 60% of startups never progressing beyond Level 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:58">[01:05:58]</a>. These examples illustrate that strategic [[Pivoting ideas in startups for productmarket fit | pivoting]] is a powerful tool to overcome [[Challenges of achieving productmarket fit | challenges of achieving product-market fit]] and build a valuable company.

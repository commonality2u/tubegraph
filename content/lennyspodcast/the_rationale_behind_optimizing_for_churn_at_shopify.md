Shopify, a highly successful e-commerce platform, employs a unique approach to growth that seemingly "optimizes for churn," a strategy unlike most companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>. This counter-intuitive method is deeply rooted in Shopify's mission, business model, and long-term vision, as explained by Archie Abrams, VP of Product and Head of Growth at Shopify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>.

## A Mission-Driven Approach
Shopify's core mission is to increase entrepreneurship on the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52:00">[06:52:00]</a>. To achieve this, the company aims to lower the barriers to getting started with an online store or business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:00">[07:10:00]</a>. Recognizing that most businesses ultimately fail, Shopify focuses on enabling as many people as possible to try their hand at entrepreneurship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:00">[07:05:00]</a>.

> "It's not that you don't want people to stick around... it's basically make it as easy as possible for people to try it and all you need is a few big wins for it to all work out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:13:00">[08:13:00]</a>.

This philosophy means they are not optimizing every new shop for long-term retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:00">[08:21:00]</a>. Instead, the strategy relies on the success of a few high-growth merchants. Just as in angel investing, where a few successful investments make the entire portfolio worthwhile, the merchants who become "extremely big businesses" like Allbirds or FIGS drive the success of an entire cohort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:28:00">[07:28:00]</a>.

## Revenue Model and Long-Term Value
Unlike most SaaS companies that primarily monetize through subscriptions, Shopify's revenue largely comes from payments, which is directly tied to a merchant's success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:39:00">[07:39:00]</a>. While subscriptions are charged, the significant portion of revenue is generated as merchants grow and produce Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:10:00">[09:10:00]</a>.

This monetization model allows Shopify to grow with the merchant, and the exceptionally successful ones make the entire system profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:13:00">[09:13:00]</a>. Therefore, the primary metric for success is the total GMV produced by a cohort of merchants over a long period (e.g., one, two, or three years), not the retention rate of individual merchants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:27:00">[10:27:00]</a>. This focus on total value, rather than per-merchant metrics, is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31:00">[10:31:00]</a>.

## Impact on Metrics and Experimentation
Shopify's unique approach impacts how metrics are defined and how [[Longterm experimentation and decision making at Shopify | experimentation]] is conducted. Core product teams at Shopify do not have metrics or KPIs, a practice that is "essentially banned" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>. Decisions in core product are made based on taste, intuition, and alignment with a 100-year vision set by CEO Tobi LÃ¼tke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>.

> [!INFO] Shopify's Approach to Metrics
> While the core product operates on intuition and long-term vision, the growth team at Shopify does use leading indicators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:20:00">[12:20:00]</a>. However, their ultimate accountability is still tied to long-term GMV generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:07:00">[13:07:00]</a>.

> Experiments are continuously monitored for their long-term impact on the business, often a year, two, or three years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>. This allows Shopify to revisit decisions and refine input metrics, leading to counter-intuitive findings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:00:00">[14:00:00]</a>. For example, some experiments showing short-term lift in conversion rates may yield no incremental GMV lift a year later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:10:00">[15:10:00]</a>, while others with neutral initial results can have a massive long-term impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:07:00">[16:07:00]</a>.

A key lever in this strategy is addressing "monetary friction" by lowering the barriers to getting started, such as through trial dynamics, trial length, incentives, or price points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:26:00">[16:26:00]</a>. While common belief suggests this might bring in lower-quality users, Shopify found it can "causally change your ability to become successful" by providing more time to develop a business idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:10:00">[17:10:00]</a>.

## Avoiding Funnel Constriction
A significant challenge with optimizing for conversion rates in funnel stages is the tendency for teams to "make it harder to do the thing right before your step in the funnel to increase your conversion rate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>. This happens because restricting the top of the funnel can artificially inflate local conversion rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:21:00">[25:21:00]</a>.

By focusing on the *absolute number* of people who complete a journey stage, rather than conversion *rates*, Shopify incentivizes teams to bring in more people overall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:34:00">[28:34:00]</a>. This encourages reducing friction and making it easier to sign up, even if it might "hurt your conversion rate" in the short term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:04:00">[29:04:00]</a>. The belief is that increasing the total number of activated users will ultimately lead to more successful merchants and higher overall GMV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:47:00">[28:47:00]</a>.

The unique alignment of Shopify's mission, business model, and philosophical approach to metrics allows it to embrace a strategy that, while appearing to "optimize for churn" by accepting high initial attrition, ultimately drives massive long-term growth through the success of its most dedicated entrepreneurs.

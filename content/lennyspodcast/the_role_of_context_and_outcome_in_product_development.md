A common misconception about the Jobs to be Done (JTBD) framework is that it solely focuses on pain and gain [00:00:00]. Instead, it should be viewed through the lens of context and outcome [00:00:04]. When a customer's story seems irrational, it's typically because the full context is not understood; the context makes the irrational rational [00:00:11]. The goal is to understand *where* and *why* people will change their behavior [00:00:33].

Bob Moesta, co-creator of the JTBD framework alongside Clay Christensen, emphasizes that people "hire" products, rather than just buying them, to make progress in their lives [00:00:33]. By understanding the specific context a person is in and the outcome they desire, a different perspective emerges on what truly competes in the market [00:05:40].

## Understanding the "Four Forces" of Progress

The core of the Jobs to be Done method lies in understanding the causation that *pushes* people to decide "today's the day I have to do something different" [00:11:54]. This dynamic involves four key forces:

1.  **Push (F1)**: The context or struggling moment that pushes a person away from their current solution or status quo [00:11:59]. This has nothing to do with the new product but is the reason they would leave the old one [00:12:02]. Without a push, new products may not even be seen, as people are creatures of habit [00:12:08].
2.  **Pull (F2)**: The attraction towards a new outcome, state, or solution [00:12:21]. This is driven by an idea of what's possible [00:12:17].
3.  **Anxiety (F3)**: The worries or concerns associated with adopting a new product or making a change [00:12:42]. More features can even create more anxiety [00:13:19].
4.  **Habit of the Present (F4)**: The inertia or ingrained habits of using the old product or maintaining the status quo [00:12:51].

For a customer to make a change, the forces of Push (F1) and Pull (F2) must be greater than the forces of Anxiety (F3) and Habit of the Present (F4) [00:13:00]. Reducing friction (F3 and F4) can increase sales without even changing the product itself, as demonstrated by including moving and storage services with a condo sale [00:13:27].

## From "Selling" to "Enabling to Buy"

The Jobs to be Done framework emphasizes focusing on the customer, understanding the causation behind their decisions, and using design thinking to enable their progress, rather than trying to sell to them [00:14:07]. This shift is about designing the sales process based on how customers *want to buy*, not how companies *want to sell* [00:14:38].

The buying process typically involves six phases [00:17:01]:
1.  **First Thought** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>
2.  **Passive Looking**: Problem-aware, solution-unaware stage, where customers learn about potential solutions [00:15:40].
3.  **Active Looking**: Problem and solution-aware stage, where customers frame and explore solutions [00:15:46].
4.  **Deciding**: Making trade-offs between alternatives [00:15:51].
5.  **First Use** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>
6.  **Ongoing Use**: Building a new habit [00:17:09].

Understanding which phase a customer is in allows for tailoring the sales process and demonstrations, which can significantly reduce the sales cycle and boost conversion [00:16:17].

## Interviewing for Context and Outcome

Unlike traditional market research that asks what people want, JTBD research is based on "criminal and intelligence interrogation" techniques, focusing on the story of *how* a decision was made [00:17:53].

### Best Practices for Interviews
*   **Read "Never Split the Difference" by Chris Voss**: Learn techniques like mirroring to encourage elaboration by playing back information incorrectly [00:27:43].
*   **Talk to people who *recently made the progress* (purchased or churned)**: People often don't know why they bought something in hindsight, only recalling the moment of purchase [00:38:57]. Studying those who have churned from a product is also crucial, as they are still making progress but found a struggle with the previous solution [00:35:17].
*   **Avoid discussion guides**: This allows for following meaningful information rather than sticking to a fixed set of questions [00:30:24].
*   **Focus on the story**: Extract the pushes, pulls, anxieties, and habits that led to their decision [00:19:42].
*   **Listen for different "layers of language"**:
    *   **Pablum layer**: Surface-level, generic answers (e.g., "It was good") [00:38:25].
    *   **Fantasy/Nightmare layer**: Exaggerated or idealized descriptions [00:38:36].
    *   **What actually happened**: The factual sequence of events and underlying reasons. This requires an investigative approach [00:38:44].
*   **Uncover the true competitive set**: By understanding the customer's context and outcome, companies can see competitors that are not direct industry rivals (e.g., Snickers competing with coffee, not Milky Way) [00:06:00].
*   **Don't hypothesize jobs**: Sitting in a room and guessing what the jobs are will likely lead to incorrect assumptions [00:45:27].

> [!TIP] Interview numbers: Bob Moesta recommends doing about 10 interviews, no more than 12, as patterns of pushes, pulls, anxieties, and habits tend to repeat around seven or eight interviews [00:29:20].

### Three Sources of Energy
When looking for insights into why people make decisions, consider these types of "energy" that drive behavior [00:34:30]:
1.  **Functional Energy**: Related to time, space, effort, or knowledge (e.g., "I need to get back to tasks as fast as possible") [00:34:37].
2.  **Emotional Energy**: How a person feels (e.g., frustrated, overlooked, wanting to feel better) [00:34:44].
3.  **Social Energy**: How others perceive them or how they want to be perceived (e.g., "My boss is going to fire me because I'm not doing this fast enough") [00:34:53].

## Innovation and Trade-offs
Innovation in product development happens when people change their direction [00:55:54]. The "[[The role of product managers | product roadmap]]" should be based on struggling moments rather than just features, as features can become irrelevant with new technologies (e.g., ChatGPT) [00:09:12]. By focusing on struggling moments, the roadmap becomes flexible, allowing for multiple solutions to address the same core problem [00:09:31].

> [!WARNING] The Danger of "Bitching Ain't Switching"
> Just because customers complain or "bitch" about a problem doesn't mean they will "switch" to a new solution [00:37:04]. Companies should prioritize understanding what genuinely causes people to take action and try a new solution, even if they fail initially [00:36:58].

Ultimately, successful product development involves making strategic trade-offs that align with the customer's needs and context, not just the company's internal metrics [00:58:51].

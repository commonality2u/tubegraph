Developing and sustaining a vibrant team and company culture is crucial for success, fostering passion, trust, and collaboration. Mahika Kapor, a Product Manager at Figma, emphasizes the importance of [[leadership_and_company_culture | culture]] and shared insights on how to actively cultivate it within a team and organization.

## The Importance of Culture
Mahika believes that [[leadership_and_company_culture | culture]] is paramount because it establishes trust among people and groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:07">[01:05:07]</a>. When teams feel connected, they are more durable and likely to rally together to find solutions during tough times, rather than disengaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:44">[01:05:44]</a>.

Passion for work, according to Mahika, stems from two things:
1.  Being passionate about the vision being built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:25">[01:05:25]</a>.
2.  Being passionate about the people you work with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:32">[01:05:32]</a>.

Cultivating a positive [[leadership_and_company_culture | culture]] leads to emotional connection within the team, making day-to-day work more enjoyable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:15">[01:05:15]</a>.

## Building a Fun and Connected Culture
Figma actively promotes a culture of "play," where fun is emphasized in work and gatherings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:40">[01:03:40]</a>. This value encourages teams to make time for activities that strengthen bonds. Mahika shared two specific initiatives she spearheaded to foster connection:

### Hot Seat
Hot Seat is a tradition Mahika started at a PM offsite post-pandemic to help the team get to know each other outside of work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:12">[00:59:12]</a>.
*   **How it works**: Each person gets two minutes where others can ask them anything. They can decline to answer, but the atmosphere is kept friendly and comfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:48">[00:59:48]</a>.
*   **Impact**: It helped the team understand what motivates individuals and build deeper connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:55">[01:00:55]</a>. This tradition spread throughout Figma, being adopted by various teams and even the executive team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:14">[01:01:14]</a>.

### The Figgies
The Figgies is an Oscar-style awards ceremony for the product team, inspired by the sales team's annual awards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:45">[01:01:45]</a>.
*   **How it works**: Mahika organized the event with a red carpet and Oscar trophies, recognizing team members in absurd categories like "most likely to name their child Figma" or "most likely to go their career without writing a PRD" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:24">[01:02:24]</a>.
*   **Impact**: It made people feel appreciated for their quirks and energy, celebrating diversity and helping team members understand each other better beyond their work personas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:01">[01:03:01]</a>. Mahika emphasized that even high-production events can be low-cost and scrappy, demonstrating that any idea can be taken on regardless of perceived scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:45">[01:06:45]</a>.

## Cultivating an Entrepreneurial Culture
For a company to remain competitive, it must stay entrepreneurial and constantly innovate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:39">[01:16:39]</a>. Figma's "run with it" value encourages individuals to "sprint off in a direction," seeing this as a manifestation of the company's values rather than a distraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:04">[01:17:04]</a>.
*   Many of Figma's significant product launches, including multi-edit, Jambot (an AI plugin), and the entire widgets platform, originated from hackathons and bottom-up projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:24">[01:17:24]</a>.
*   Mahika views a zero-to-one project as a "flame," and the project lead as "The Keeper of the Hearth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:50">[01:18:50]</a>. It's the PM's job to stoke the flames when they're at risk of dying out and to ensure the idea spreads like wildfire, building enough hype for the entire company to demand it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:45">[01:19:45]</a>.

To successfully bring a new idea into existence:
1.  **Have the right idea**: This comes from deep user empathy and understanding user pain points, not just about the product, but their entire workflow and other tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:18">[01:21:18]</a>. The idea must also align with a broader company goal, such as Figma's goal to expand beyond designers to cover the entire product development cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:50">[01:21:50]</a>.
2.  **Secure buy-in**: Rally leadership and the team behind the idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:22">[01:20:22]</a>. Mahika advises having an "optimism that borders on delusion," a "reality distortion field" where "no" is heard as "not yet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:14">[01:23:14]</a>. Leverage company-wide forums like hackathons or sales kickoffs to present ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:30">[01:26:30]</a>.
3.  **Make it spread**: Ensure the idea gains momentum and investment from across the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:35">[01:20:35]</a>. Figma's multi-month staging/dogfooding process allows for early product exposure and feedback from the entire company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:05">[01:27:05]</a>. This process makes people feel invested, as their feedback directly shapes the product, fostering a collective drive towards success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:16">[01:28:16]</a>.

### Fostering Individual Contribution
PMs should understand the motivations of their team members, as different people want to be involved in the product visioning phase to different extents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:09">[01:30:09]</a>. Some engineers prefer to be handed solutions, while others need to contribute to feel passionate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:33">[01:30:33]</a>. By catering to individual needs rather than the average, PMs can foster a high-functioning team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>. Directly asking team members how much they want to be involved in product decisions is a crucial step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:21">[01:31:21]</a>.

Mahika recommends shouting from the rooftops about insights learned, as this inspires others to contribute to an [[cultivating_an_entrepreneurial_culture_within_organizations | entrepreneurial culture]] within the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:41">[01:29:41]</a>. This high-agency approach, exemplified by her founding of Design Nation, encourages individuals to take responsibility for solving problems they identify, even in the absence of formal backing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:58">[01:11:58]</a>.

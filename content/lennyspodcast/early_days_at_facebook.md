Andrew "Boz" Bosworth, Chief Technology Officer at Meta, joined Facebook in early 2006, as one of its first engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. He was one of a group of five or six engineers who all started on the same day, making them collectively the "tenth engineer" at the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

## Unromantic Realities of a Startup
Contrary to romanticized portrayals, such as those in movies, the early days at Facebook were characterized by immense struggle and sacrifice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

Key aspects of the early experience:
*   **Intense Work Schedule** Boz often worked 120 hours per week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. He had no hobbies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a> and gained weight, often drinking to cope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.
*   **Constant Vigilance** Boz built an early anti-spam/anti-scraping defense mechanism and for about two years, he had to wake up every four hours to check reports for site attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This round-the-clock vigilance was not requested but undertaken out of necessity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>.
*   **Self-Reliance** There were no established experts or support teams. Engineers were responsible for everything from building servers from components bought at electronics stores to racking them in data centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. Support functions like payroll, finance, IT, and HR were not professionally handled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.
*   **Camaraderie Forged in Pressure** While tough, these times built tremendous camaraderie among the team, most of whom lived within a mile of the office and ate most meals together due to their work schedules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

Boz notes that while his sacrifices paid off, many others who made similar efforts were not as fortunate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. This highlights the significant risks involved in startup life, which is "not glamorous" in the moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.

## Early Product Development
During his 18-year tenure at Meta, Boz contributed to several foundational products:
*   **[[lessons_from_building_facebook_newsfeed | Facebook News Feed]]** One of his earliest projects, the [[lessons_from_building_facebook_newsfeed | News Feed]] was the first algorithmically ranked content feed on any social network and is now what most people associate with Facebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. Initially, it faced widespread user outrage, yet simultaneously, user engagement immediately doubled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:57">[00:34:57]</a>. This "cognitive dissonance" between stated preferences and revealed preferences made it easier to stick with the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:12">[00:35:12]</a>. Boz admits they "screwed some things up" in the implementation, particularly by broadly broadcasting content that was previously more contained on profiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:30">[00:35:30]</a>. Despite initial controversy and minor missteps, the core idea of the [[lessons_from_building_facebook_newsfeed | News Feed]] was fundamentally correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:37">[00:36:37]</a>. The combination of the [[lessons_from_building_facebook_newsfeed | News Feed]] and ads has generated trillions of dollars in value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:58">[00:36:58]</a>. The [[lessons_from_building_facebook_newsfeed | News Feed]] also contained what was likely Facebook's first consumer AI code for ranking content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:31">[00:33:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:48">[00:36:48]</a>.
*   **Mobile Ads Platform** Boz built and ran the original Facebook mobile ads platform for four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:29">[00:32:29]</a>. This product was crucial during Facebook's IPO, which was struggling at the time, and it helped save the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:19">[00:44:19]</a>.
*   **Other Core Systems** He also helped build and scale the Facebook messaging system, the profile, the timeline, and Facebook groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
*   **Internal Engineering Boot Camp** Boz was involved in building the internal engineering boot camp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

## [[mark_zuckerbergs_leadership_and_transformation | Mark Zuckerberg's Leadership]] in Early Days
In the early days, [[mark_zuckerbergs_leadership_and_transformation | Mark Zuckerberg]] was deeply involved in product details. When working on the [[lessons_from_building_facebook_newsfeed | News Feed]], [[mark_zuckerbergs_leadership_and_transformation | Mark Zuckerberg]] was whiteboarding every pixel for the front end and emphasizing the need for content ranking on the backend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:56">[00:27:56]</a>. This level of detail-orientation is characteristic of [[mark_zuckerbergs_leadership_and_transformation | Mark Zuckerberg]] when a project falls under his "Eye of Sauron" â€“ meaning he has determined it's the most important thing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:02">[00:31:02]</a>. In such cases, no detail is too small <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:12">[00:31:12]</a>.

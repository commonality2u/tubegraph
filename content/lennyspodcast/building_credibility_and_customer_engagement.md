Claire Butler, Figma's 10th employee and first marketing hire, played a pivotal role in shaping Figma's unique bottom-up go-to-market strategy, which focuses on building deep relationships with individual contributors (ICs) and enabling them to champion the product internally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:58">[01:06:58]</a>.

## Early Days at Figma

In the early days, Figma operated in stealth for about three to four years, building its product quietly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:35">[01:19:35]</a>. Claire joined before the official launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:10">[01:10:10]</a>. A notable early decision was changing the product name from "Summit" to "Figma," a proposal Claire made on her first day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:07">[01:05:07]</a>. The shift aimed to maintain a single, ownable brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:37">[01:05:37]</a>.

The initial phase involved a mix of high-level strategic decisions and "grunt work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:49">[01:04:49]</a>. A particularly stressful period for Claire was leading the launch out of stealth, as she was the sole marketer responsible for messaging, positioning, and PR without external validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:18">[01:08:18]</a>. The team had to learn to trust their intuition and gut feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:44">[01:09:44]</a>.

A key early anecdote highlighting their commitment to user success involved their first user, Koda. When an engineer at Koda couldn't open a file due to a MacBook issue, Figma's co-founder Dylan Field and CTO Evan Wallace drove to Palo Alto to fix it personally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:10">[00:38:10]</a>. This level of dedication was crucial to securing and retaining early users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:12">[00:39:12]</a>.

## Figma's Bottom-Up Go-to-Market Motion

Figma's GTM strategy is defined as a bottom-up motion focused on individual contributors (ICs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:03">[01:14:03]</a>. It involves two main parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:03">[01:14:03]</a>:
1.  Getting ICs at a company to "love" the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:03">[01:14:03]</a>.
2.  Enabling those ICs to spread the product within their organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:03">[01:14:03]</a>.

This differs from a traditional top-down SaaS approach where sales target executives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:05">[01:15:05]</a>. For technical tools, the practitioners must love the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:16">[01:15:16]</a>. Figma operated without a sales team for the first three years, with all revenue coming from self-served accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:33">[01:15:33]</a>. Even later, most marketing qualified leads for sales came from existing free or Pro tier users who wanted to upgrade their entire company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:13">[01:16:13]</a>.

Figma's unique approach involved an "obsession with quality and craft" within the editor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:12">[01:18:12]</a>. While collaboration was a key differentiator, the core tool itself was what practitioners cared about most <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:31">[01:18:31]</a>.

## Part 1: Getting Individual Contributors to Love the Product

Four main areas were critical to fostering this love:

### 1. Building Credibility
Designers, as a technical audience, do not want to be marketed to with buzzwords like "efficiency" or "collaboration" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:23">[01:32:23]</a>. They want to understand how technical features work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:43">[01:32:43]</a>.
*   **Technical Content:** Figma's early credibility came from its engineering and design teams creating in-depth technical content about the tool's unique features, such as using WebGL or their approach to grids and vector networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:36">[01:33:36]</a>. The bar for this content was high: "If I could have written it myself, it was probably too basic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:17">[01:34:17]</a>.
*   **[[building_customer_relationships_and_gathering_feedback | Designer Advocates]]:** Six months after launch, Figma hired its first [[building_customer_relationships_and_gathering_feedback | Designer Advocate]] – a designer, not a marketer – to meet with users, gather feedback, and create content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:57">[01:34:57]</a>. This role, scaled to a full team today, serves as "magic dust" for their go-to-market function, ensuring authenticity and deep user connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:30">[01:51:30]</a>.

### 2. Building with Users
Figma demonstrated deep customer obsession, particularly in its early days when every user mattered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:40">[01:37:40]</a>.
*   **Direct Support:** Everyone at Figma, including engineers, engaged directly with users via Intercom, often debugging issues live and immediately fixing bugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:29">[01:39:29]</a>.
*   **Fostering Ownership:** By actively listening and implementing user feedback, Figma made users feel a sense of ownership over the tool, strengthening their relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:48">[01:40:48]</a>.
*   **Why "Love":** Users need to genuinely love a product to become champions and risk their social capital by spreading it within their organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:30">[01:41:30]</a>. Mere usage is not enough for scalability and organic spread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:49">[01:41:49]</a>.

### 3. Finding Channels for Relationship Building
Instead of expecting users to come to them, Figma went to where designers already were <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:50">[01:44:50]</a>.
*   **Twitter Focus:** Dylan Field identified Twitter as the primary hub for the design community, where designers shared best practices and learned about new tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:18">[01:45:18]</a>.
*   **Influencer Identification:** Dylan built a custom scraper to map out the design community on Twitter, identifying influential figures and different "clusters" of design topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:05">[01:46:05]</a>.
*   **Engagement, Not Sales:** Figma directly messaged influential designers for feedback, not to sell the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:51">[01:48:51]</a>. Company leaders, including Dylan, Sho, and engineers, actively engaged with users, answered questions, and built personal connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:31">[01:47:31]</a>. This allowed users to passively follow Figma's progress and build confidence in the product over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:03">[01:48:03]</a>.

### 4. Transparency and Authenticity
Figma built and maintained strong relationships through continuous transparency and authenticity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:09">[01:49:09]</a>.
*   **Public Post-Mortems:** For downtime incidents, Figma would conduct public post-mortems, explaining the technical issues and how they were fixed, taking full accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:19">[01:54:19]</a>.
*   **Direct Communication During Crises:** During challenging times, such as the acquisition announcement, Figma's leaders (Dylan, Sho, Rajie, Tom) held open Twitter Spaces to speak directly with users, answer any questions, and avoid hiding behind the brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:57">[01:55:57]</a>. This directness helped turn the tide of public perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:55">[01:56:55]</a>.

## Part 2: Enabling Individual Contributors to Spread the Product

Once users love the product, the next step is to empower them to spread it within their organizations.

### 1. Make it Easy to Try and Share
*   **Flexible Free Tier:** Figma allows easy sign-up for a free account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:33">[02:01:33]</a>. A crucial pricing adjustment allowed users to have limited files but unlimited collaborators on free "starter teams." This encouraged free team usage and allowed teams to gain confidence before paying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:45">[02:02:45]</a>.
*   **Free Viewers:** Crucially, only editors are charged, while viewers are free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:57">[02:05:57]</a>. This enables designers to share files with product managers or other stakeholders who can comment without incurring costs, significantly expanding Figma's reach within organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:14">[02:06:14]</a>.

### 2. Designer Advocates (DAs) in Sales
[[techniques_for_effective_customer_communication_and_empathy | Designer Advocates]] (DAs) play a unique and foundational role in Figma's sales process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:41">[02:08:41]</a>.
*   **Technical Experts, Not Salespeople:** DAs, like Tom Lowry (who previously championed Figma at his own company), are passionate users and technical experts with deep product understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:15">[02:08:15]</a>. They never have quotas and don't report to sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:53">[02:08:53]</a>.
*   **"The Tom Factor":** DAs join sales calls to explain product nuances, address technical concerns, and offer best practices, significantly increasing deal close rates (dubbed "The Tom Factor") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:40">[02:09:40]</a>.
*   **Scaling the Role:** This advocacy role has scaled across Figma, with developer advocates and FigJam advocates, as well as regional advocates, ensuring that technical expertise and authentic connection are maintained as the company grows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>. DAs are also vital for synthesizing product feedback for the product team due to their extensive customer interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:14">[02:10:14]</a>.

### 3. Identify and Overcome Operational Blockers
Figma strategically addressed a major blocker to adoption by large organizations: Design Systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:07">[02:11:07]</a>.
*   **Design Systems as Advantage:** While initially a limitation (Figma didn't support shared Design Systems), the company decided to focus on this area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:25">[02:12:25]</a>. They engaged with the Design Systems community through informal meetups to learn their needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:10">[02:13:10]</a>.
*   **Targeted Content and Features:** Figma built features and created content focused on how companies could use and scale Design Systems within Figma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:47">[02:13:47]</a>. This turned the blocker into a key reason for large organizations to upgrade from Pro to Enterprise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:13">[02:14:13]</a>. Events like "Schema" (a conference for Design Systems practitioners) further amplified this focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:04">[02:14:04]</a>.

### 4. Shine a Light on Champions
Figma continuously nurtured relationships with its internal champions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:19">[02:16:19]</a>.
*   **Ongoing Engagement:** Figma actively listens to and addresses concerns from these champions, even if they express discontent publicly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:40">[02:16:40]</a>.
*   **Career Growth and Amplification:** Figma helps these champions grow their own careers by inviting them to speak at events (like Config), amplifying their profiles on social media, and positioning them as thought leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:05">[02:17:05]</a>. This creates a symbiotic relationship: champions gain visibility, and Figma gains further credibility and organic spread from trusted voices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:44">[02:17:44]</a>.

### Scaling the Model
As Figma scales, the challenge is to maintain these core principles of user love and community engagement, even as more traditional top-down motions are introduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:03">[02:18:03]</a>. Events like Config, scaling the DA team, and regional expansion are crucial for protecting and perpetuating this successful bottom-up model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:41">[02:18:41]</a>.

### Prerequisites for this Approach
This bottom-up, love-driven approach is particularly effective for products that:
*   **Technical Audience:** Serve a technical audience (like designers or engineers) who care deeply about the craft and tools they use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:52">[02:19:52]</a>.
*   **Individual Value:** Provide significant value to an individual user on their own, before collaboration is even introduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:08">[02:16:08]</a>.
*   **Existing Community:** Can tap into an existing community where the target audience already congregates (like designers on Twitter) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:57">[02:20:57]</a>.
*   **Collaborative Role:** The IC audience has many connection points within their organization, making them natural "super spreaders" (e.g., designers collaborating with PMs and engineers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:24">[02:21:24]</a>.

Ultimately, the success of this model relies on executive leadership (like Dylan Field) who deeply believes in the approach and prioritizes "signal over metrics" in the early stages, trusting intuition when hard numbers are scarce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:22">[02:23:22]</a>.

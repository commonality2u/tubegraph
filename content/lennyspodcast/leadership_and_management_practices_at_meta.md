Meta, formerly Facebook, has scaled from 30 employees to a 1.5 trillion-dollar business, with its [[metas_strategic_turnaround_and_insights | longest-serving executive]] (other than Mark Zuckerberg) being Naomi Gleit, who joined as employee number 29 and has been with the company for nearly 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. This extensive growth has led to the development of unique leadership and management philosophies.

## Mark Zuckerberg's Leadership
Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta, is seen internally as a "learn-it-all, not a know-it-all" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>. His approach to leadership and personal development has undergone a profound transformation over the years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>.

Key aspects of his leadership include:
*   **Continuous Upskilling** Mark has consistently focused on improving himself, from learning Chinese to achieving an eighth-grade fluency within a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>, to excelling in physical activities like MMA and guitar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>. He has also significantly improved professional skills such as negotiation and public speaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.
*   **Personal Qualities** Beyond his professional role, Zuckerberg is described as a good friend, thoughtful, and a great dad and husband <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>. He actively mentors and teaches, once co-teaching a class on how to build a business to middle school students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>.
*   **Life Lessons** Four core life lessons Mark Zuckerberg teaches are:
    1.  Love yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>
    2.  Only then can you truly serve others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>
    3.  Focus on what you can control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>
    4.  For those things, never give up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>

### The "Small Group"
To manage a massive organization with over 80,000 employees, Mark Zuckerberg relies on a "small group" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>. This leadership team consists of leaders on the most important company projects, often independent of their direct reporting structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:48">[00:20:48]</a>.
*   **Tenure and Motivation** Many members, like Naomi Gleit, have been with Meta for a very long time, motivating them by mission rather than corporate ladder climbing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>.
*   **"Disagreeable Givers"** The group is characterized by "disagreeable givers" â€“ individuals who are deeply motivated by what's best for the company, even if it means pushing back or saying what others may not want to hear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>. This fosters a culture of direct and honest feedback, crucial for an accurate feedback loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:45">[00:22:45]</a>.
*   **Meeting Structure** The small group holds two types of weekly meetings:
    1.  **Strategic Meeting:** Open-ended and unstructured, focused on broader discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:29">[00:23:29]</a>.
    2.  **Operational Meeting:** Highly structured, where owners of priority projects provide tactical weekly updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:39">[00:23:39]</a>.

## Naomi Gleit's "Naomi-isms"
As Head of Product at Meta, Naomi Gleit champions a set of principles she calls "Naomi-isms" for effective product management and execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:15">[00:45:15]</a>. These are practical lessons learned on the job to streamline work and enhance clarity.

Key Naomi-isms include:
*   **PM as a "Conductor"** A Product Manager (PM) is like a conductor leading an orchestra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:14">[00:46:14]</a>. The team, comprising various functions (legal, policy, comms, data analytics, engineering, design), are the different instruments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:21">[00:46:21]</a>. The PM's role is to ensure everyone plays their part correctly and in harmony, at the right tempo and cadence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:34">[00:46:34]</a>. The PM is not the star of the show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:10">[00:47:10]</a>.
*   **Extreme Clarity** This principle emphasizes shared understanding of facts, options, and trade-offs, even when there's disagreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:09">[00:49:09]</a>. It prevents wasted time from misunderstandings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:45">[00:49:45]</a>.
*   **Canonical Everything** To achieve extreme clarity, it's essential to standardize all elements of a project:
    *   **Canonical Nomenclature:** Establishing a shared vocabulary with definitions for all terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:11">[00:50:11]</a>.
    *   **Canonical Docs:** Creating a single, central document for each project that serves as the definitive source of information and links to all other relevant documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This document should include discrete areas of work (workstreams), their single-threaded owners (formerly "directly responsible individuals" or DRIs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:26">[00:54:26]</a>, and the established process for team collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:49">[00:54:49]</a> (e.g., canonical meetings, email lists, chat groups).
    *   **Canonical Visuals:** Using visual representations of frameworks and real-time editing them in meetings to ensure everyone sees and agrees on decisions and next steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:08">[00:51:08]</a>. Numbered lists are preferred over bulleted lists for clear referencing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:25">[00:52:25]</a>.
*   **Simplification** When tackling complex problems, Gleit approaches them from a "kindergarten level," breaking them down into basic building blocks before adding complexity and details. This process often reveals the most important issues to address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:25">[00:56:25]</a>.
*   **Perfect Execution** Prioritizing perfect execution ensures that if a project fails, the reason can be accurately attributed to strategy rather than poor implementation. This allows for clear learning and iteration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:41">[00:58:41]</a>.
*   **Running Effective Meetings**
    *   Send a detailed agenda with a pre-read 24 hours in advance, or risk cancellation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:05">[01:07:05]</a>.
    *   For decision meetings, present three options and a clear recommendation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:08">[01:08:08]</a>.
    *   Use a "traffic light" (red, yellow, green) table to evaluate options against various criteria (e.g., functional perspectives, user experience, engineering feasibility) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:50">[01:09:50]</a>.
    *   Real-time edit the visual during the meeting to document decisions and next steps, preventing post-meeting confusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:15">[01:08:15]</a>.
    *   Send meeting notes via "reply all" to the calendar invite within 24 hours, including decisions and next steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:30">[01:08:30]</a>.
*   **Developing a First-Party Perspective** While fostering collaboration, PMs must also develop their own strong, informed opinions. This requires dedicated time for thinking and, for some, sparring with one or two trusted individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:38">[01:22:38]</a>.

## Focus on Product-Driven Growth and Impact
Historically, growth was primarily driven by marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:14">[00:29:14]</a>. However, Meta's growth team pioneered a [[hiring_and_team_management_philosophy_in_tech_startups | data-driven, product-driven approach]] where the product itself became the biggest lever for growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:28">[00:29:28]</a>.
*   **Retention Focus** The growth team discovered that retention, not just acquisition, was the biggest lever for net growth, leading to the focus on "7 friends in 10 days" or "10 friends in 14 days" as key activation metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:42">[00:26:42]</a>. The value of this metric was its ability to provide extreme clarity and a rallying point for the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:20">[00:34:20]</a>.
*   **Onboarding Innovation** This led to the development of early user onboarding experiences to help new users quickly discover the product's value, as opposed to relying on osmosis among college students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:02">[00:35:02]</a>.
*   **Removing Barriers** The growth team focused on removing both macro barriers (e.g., expanding access beyond college students, to high school, work networks, open registration, and addressing device/internet access with initiatives like internet.org) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:31">[00:39:31]</a> and micro barriers (e.g., optimizing registration flows, allowing email confirmation via any notification click to reduce friction) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>.
*   **Social Impact through Product** This product-driven approach extended beyond growth. For instance, instead of a traditional corporate social responsibility wing, Meta built a product that allowed the community to raise billions for charity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:23">[00:31:23]</a>. Similarly, product solutions were built for platform translation, leveraging the community rather than professional translators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>.

## Personal Productivity and Well-being
Naomi Gleit emphasizes four "must-haves" for personal performance:
1.  **Eat** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:51">[01:12:51]</a>
2.  **Sleep** She prioritizes sleep hygiene, using tools like the Eight Sleep mattress and eye masks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:01">[01:13:01]</a>.
3.  **Alone Time** As an introvert, dedicated alone time is crucial for recharging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:18">[01:13:18]</a>.
4.  **Exercise** Viewing life and work as a "workout," she ensures a non-negotiable morning workout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:32">[01:13:32]</a>. Setting specific physical goals, like achieving five pull-ups, builds confidence that translates to other areas of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:11">[01:14:11]</a>.
*   **Surfing as a Metaphor** Surfing teaches the importance of mental commitment and "standing up into the fear" rather than hesitating, which can be counterproductive and unsafe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>. This applies to both the sport and professional challenges.

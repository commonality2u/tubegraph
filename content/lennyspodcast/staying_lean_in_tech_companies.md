Notion's co-founder and CEO, Ivan Zhao, emphasizes a deeply [[cultural_practices_in_rapidly_scaling_companies | philosophical]] and practical approach to maintaining a lean and efficient organization, contrasting with the common rapid scaling often seen in tech startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:56">[00:33:56]</a>.

## Notion's Lean Journey

Notion's early years, described as the "Lost Years" (the first three to four years), forced a lean operation out of necessity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. Initially, the team tried building a developer tool, but quickly learned that "most people just don't care" about creating software to optimize their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>. This led to a crucial realization: to succeed, they needed to "hide their vision" (allowing everyone to create software) within a more familiar form factor, a productivity tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. This concept is likened to offering "sugar" (productivity software) that hides the "broccoli" (the underlying no-code developer power) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>.

During this period, Notion rebuilt its codebase multiple times, even laying off all but two employees (Ivan and co-founder Simon) to reset the technical foundation built on an unstable web component technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>. This radical reset, which included temporarily moving to Japan to reduce living costs, allowed them to focus intensely on building and designing, operating with extreme efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>.

## The Philosophy of Leanness

Zhao identifies several core reasons and benefits behind staying lean:

*   **Financial Prudence**: Notion has been profitable for years and has not spent most of the money it raised, avoiding the pressure to constantly seek new funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:11">[00:30:11]</a>.
*   **Core Competency and Versatility**: Ivan and Simon possessed diverse skill sets (coding, design, marketing, sales), minimizing the immediate need for a large team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:50">[00:30:50]</a>.
*   **Reduced Overhead**: A smaller team drastically reduces internal communication overhead, making it easier to align minds and operate efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:24">[00:31:24]</a>.
*   **Talent Density**: Notion aims for a high "talent density" rather than just tracking headcount or revenue per employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:09">[00:32:09]</a>. This attracts more talented individuals, creating a positive compounding effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:20">[00:32:20]</a>. This relates to [[hiring_philosophies_and_organizational_structure_in_tech_startups | hiring philosophies and organizational structure in tech startups]].
*   **Systems Over People**: Zhao believes that better systems and tools can solve many problems typically addressed by adding more people. Notion itself, as a "meta tool," is used to run the company, reinforcing this mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:36">[00:31:36]</a>. This forms a core tenet of their [[effective_team_building_and_leadership_in_startups | effective team building and leadership]].

## Practical Advice for Staying Lean

For founders aiming to operate lean, Ivan offers the following advice:

*   **Don't Be Afraid to Reset**: Courage is vital to reset when momentum might be leading you down the wrong path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>. A better abstraction or system can lead to faster progress and recoup "sunk costs" much quicker than a linear approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:04">[00:23:04]</a>.
    *   **Get Sleep**: For personal resilience, "whenever I feel down I just go to sleep then next day I'm I'm just reset" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>.
*   **Focus on Abstraction and Systems**: Understanding that better systems can lead to exponential growth, surpassing linear growth achieved by just adding headcount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:09">[00:32:09]</a>. This is critical for [[navigating_talent_and_skill_changes_in_tech | navigating talent and skill changes]].
*   **The "Small Bus" Metaphor**: Internally, Notion uses the metaphor of a "small bus" to describe their company. A smaller bus is easier to maneuver, accelerate, and turn corners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:43">[00:33:43]</a>. [[leadership_and_communication_in_tech | Leaders]] decide "who sit around you on the bus seat," influencing the speed and experience of the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:56">[00:33:56]</a>. This guides their [[hiring_philosophies_and_organizational_structure_in_tech_startups | hiring philosophies]].
*   **Thoughtful Office Environment**: The physical environment is carefully curated to feel pleasant and cozy, like an artist's studio or home, using home furniture and warm lighting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:21">[00:35:21]</a>. This emphasis on aesthetics and comfort is seen as crucial for fostering creativity and ease, ensuring people feel more at ease and productive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:39">[00:35:39]</a>. These are key [[cultural_practices_in_rapidly_scaling_companies | cultural practices]].
    *   Conference rooms are named after "Timeless Tools" like the iPhone or Macintosh, inspiring the team to create products that last for decades, not just months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:09">[00:36:09]</a>. This reflects an emphasis on "craftsmanship" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:36">[00:37:36]</a>.

## Balancing Vision and Business

Staying lean also involves balancing the founder's vision with market demands. While it's important to build "something you want the world to have" (building for your values and aesthetic) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>, building *too much* for oneself turns into an "art project" with no users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:56">[00:54:56]</a>. Conversely, building *too much* for business results in a "commodity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. The ideal is to create a product that is "authentic to myself and happen to be also useful for others" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:09">[00:41:09]</a>, providing a durable energy source. This relates to [[authenticity_and_leadership_in_tech | authenticity and leadership in tech]].

Ultimately, Zhao believes in creating tools that extend human potential, shaping users for the better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:09">[01:03:09]</a>. By amplifying creativity and beauty through software, Notion aims to align with these values, fostering a positive impact on its users and the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:41">[01:04:41]</a>.

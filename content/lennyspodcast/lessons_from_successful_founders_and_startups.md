From: [[lennyspodcast]] <br/> 

Mike Maples Jr., a renowned early-stage startup investor and co-founder of Floodgate, has dedicated years to researching the origins of great startup ideas and what differentiates successful founders from those who fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:49">[01:24:49]</a>. After reviewing thousands of startup notes and decks over two decades, he has uncovered key patterns in how breakthrough founders think and act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:06">[01:36:06]</a>. His insights aim to help founders, product builders, and investors approach [[challenges_and_strategies_for_creating_successful_startups | startup innovation]] differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>.

## Uncovering Patterns: The Research Approach

Maples approaches his research like a detective, maintaining a database of startups that generated over 100x return on the first check <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:00">[08:41:00]</a>. For each, he seeks a "time capsule" of their early days, including original pitch decks and direct conversations with founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:00">[08:50:00]</a>. This method helps him avoid misremembering events or founders overstating their initial knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:00">[09:30:00]</a>. He focuses on asking non-judgmental questions to understand the true origin stories, pivots, and reasons for early success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:02:00">[10:02:00]</a>. His unique access to early-stage data and sympatico relationships with founders allow for unvarnished accounts of what truly happened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:41:00">[10:41:00]</a>.

A key observation from his research is that 80% of his biggest returning investments came from a pivot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>, highlighting that initial implementations may not be correct, but a strong underlying insight allows for navigation to product-market fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:55:00">[14:55:00]</a>.

## The Nature of Startup Competition

"Business is never a fair fight" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. Incumbents inherently hold an advantage, and startups must embrace "asymmetric warfare" to win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. Startups don't succeed by simply executing "better" than large companies; they win by proposing a radically different future that disorients the incumbent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>. This means avoiding the "comparison trap" and forcing a choice, rather than a comparison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:35:00">[12:35:00]</a>.

> "The way startups win is they just change the subject. They deny the premise of the rules and propose something completely different." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:28:00">[13:28:00]</a>

## Core Elements of Breakthrough Startup Ideas

Maples has identified three essential [[elements_of_breakthrough_startup_ideas_inflections_insights_and_founder_future_fit | elements of most breakthrough startup ideas]]: inflections, insights, and founder future fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These "underlying forces" give an idea the power to escape the "gravitational pull of the present" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:07:00">[15:07:00]</a>.

### 1. Inflections

An **inflection** is an external event that creates the potential for radical change in how people think, feel, and act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:31:00">[15:31:00]</a>. Unlike incremental improvements (like Moore's Law), inflections are turning points where something new is introduced, leading to new empowerment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:03:00">[16:03:03]</a>.

*   **Examples**:
    *   The iPhone 4S shipping with a GPS locator chip enabled ride-sharing companies like Lyft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:52:00">[15:52:00]</a>, also powering DoorDash and Instacart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:09:00">[18:09:00]</a>.
    *   Improved smartphone cameras, increased smartphone adoption, Wi-Fi connectivity, and faster upload speeds enabled Instagram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:12:00">[17:12:00]</a>.
    *   The proliferation of online customer reviews and Facebook Connect facilitated Airbnb's growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:27:00">[24:27:00]</a>. The 2008 financial crisis also served as a macro-economic inflection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:50:00">[24:50:00]</a>.
    *   Regulatory changes allowing tele-medicine visits across state lines during COVID-19 were a non-technological inflection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:14:00">[25:14:00]</a>.
    *   Permanent shifts in belief or behavior, such as the increased acceptance of tele-medicine post-COVID or remote work, can also be inflections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:30:00">[26:30:00]</a>.

*   **Stress Testing Inflections**: When evaluating an idea, Maples asks:
    1.  What specific new thing was just introduced? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:36:00">[21:36:00]</a>
    2.  How does it specifically empower specific people in specific ways? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:41:00">[21:41:00]</a>
    3.  Under what conditions might that empowerment be realized, and under what conditions might it not? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:47:00">[21:47:00]</a>

### 2. Insights

An **insight** is a non-obvious truth about how one or more inflections can be harnessed to change people's behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:12:00">[28:12:00]</a>.

*   **Non-Consensus and Right**: The best startup ideas are non-consensus but right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:45:00">[29:45:00]</a>. If an idea is consensus, it's likely not radical enough and too similar to existing solutions or incumbents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:06:00">[30:06:00]</a>. Breakthrough ideas often face hostility or indifference from most people but resonate deeply with a specific subset who "fall irrationally in love" with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:27:00">[30:27:00]</a>.
*   **Backcasting**: Great founders "backcast" from a radically different future, rather than forecasting from the present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:07:00">[31:07:00]</a>. They envision what must be different for them to be a big winner and work backward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:17:00">[31:17:00]</a>.
*   **The Power of Surprise and Earned Secrets**:
    *   Breakthroughs cannot have a recipe because they are undiscovered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:00:00">[37:00:00]</a>. Founders should adopt a mindset that actively savors surprises, as surprise indicates new learning rather than mere validation of existing beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:43:00">[37:43:00]</a>.
    *   Secrets are "earned" by getting one's hands dirty and exploring cutting-edge developments for their own sake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:15:00">[41:15:00]</a>. This deep immersion allows founders to notice what's missing in the future, tuning their "noticing filter" to a high volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:39:00">[41:39:00]</a>.
    *   Example: Chegg's experiment with "Textbook Flick" tested arbitrary price points beyond their initial hypothesis, revealing students would pay more for textbook rentals, a key surprise that shaped their pricing model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:11:00">[39:11:11]</a>.

*   **Product-Market Fit is the Game**: The goal is to uniquely offer something people are desperate for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:51:00">[42:51:00]</a>. If customers aren't desperate, it could be that the insight is wrong, the implementation is wrong (requiring a pivot like Octa's shift to identity management) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:18:00">[43:18:00]</a>, or the founder is talking to the wrong customers (i.e., not "Lighthouse customers" living in the future) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:01:00">[44:01:00]</a>.

### 3. Founder Future Fit

This element refers to the specific traits a founder possesses that make them ideally suited for a particular future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:23:00">[49:23:00]</a>. It's about who knows the most about this future, has the most intrinsic motivation to pursue it, and possesses the best network in that ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:31:00">[50:31:00]</a>.

*   **Diverse Fits**:
    *   **Young, First-Time Founders**: Often at the cutting edge of new technology with a "beginner's mind," unencumbered by old ways of thinking (e.g., Mark Andreessen, Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:31:00">[49:31:00]</a>. Their knowledge of the future is more valuable than traditional business experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:03:00">[50:03:00]</a>.
    *   **Experienced Industry Insiders**: For ventures requiring trust and established relationships (e.g., Applied Intuition founders had deep roots in the auto industry and prior startup success) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:42:00">[48:42:00]</a>. Todd McKinnon from Salesforce's background inspired trust for Okta's identity management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:18:00">[50:18:00]</a>.

*   **Living in the Future**: The most important aspect is for founders to "live in the future" and notice what is missing there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:08:00">[52:08:00]</a>. This allows their intuition about what to build to be far more accurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:25:00">[52:25:00]</a>.
    *   **Building for Themselves**: Founders like Andreessen or Justin Kan (Justin.tv/Twitch) built products they wished they had, even if initially "terrible ideas" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:41:00">[52:41:00]</a>.
    *   **Lighthouse Customers**: Finding "Lighthouse customers" who are already living in the future and solving their problems can lead a startup to the "promised land" (e.g., Silicon Graphics with Industrial Light & Magic) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:35:00">[58:35:00]</a>.

## Actions of Breakthrough Founders

Beyond having a breakthrough idea, successful founders act differently. They must persuade others to change their habits and move to a different future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:26">[01:04:26]</a>.

### 1. Movements

Startups often succeed by creating **movements**, which are a different way of developing a market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>. A movement leverages the grievance of a minority against the tyranny of a majority, emotionally committing early believers to move towards a different future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:37">[01:05:37]</a>.

*   **Beyond Pragmatism**: Early customers, employees, and investors are driven by belief, not just practical reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:52">[01:05:52]</a>.
*   **Crystallizing Choice**: Movements crystallize choice, making it impossible to be "half in" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:30">[01:06:30]</a>.
*   **Examples**:
    *   Lyft's pink mustaches symbolized a movement challenging traditional taxis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:46">[01:07:46]</a>.
    *   Floodgate positioned seed investing as a movement that would become a permanent feature of the venture landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:54">[01:07:54]</a>.
    *   Clarence Birdseye had to create a movement to enable flash-frozen food, requiring refrigerated trains and supermarket aisles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:41">[01:08:41]</a>.
    *   Tesla's mission to "accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy" appeals to a higher purpose rather than comparing itself to traditional car companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:51">[01:09:51]</a>.
    *   Airbnb's "living like a local" movement turned the consistent experience of hotels into a weakness, forcing customers to choose between predictability and unique immersion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:42">[01:10:42]</a>.

### 2. Storytelling

Effective storytelling is crucial for movements. Founders use narratives to create a stark dichotomy between "the world that is" and "the world that could be" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:50">[01:11:50]</a>.

*   **The Hero's Journey**: Founders should position early believers (customers, employees, investors) as the *heroes* of the story, not themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>. The founder acts as Obi-Wan Kenobi, the mentor offering a call to adventure and tools (the product) to overcome challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:50">[01:12:50]</a>.
*   **Tailoring the Story**: The story must be tailored to different audiences (investors, customers, employees) based on their self-actualization goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:20">[01:16:20]</a>.
*   **Language and Metaphors**: Using powerful metaphors (e.g., Twitter's "tweeting birds") helps communicate the radical difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:15">[01:15:15]</a>.
*   **Pitch Deck Advice**:
    1.  **Slide 1**: State clearly what you do, assuming no prior knowledge (e.g., "We let you rent an extra room in your house," not "We're a marketplace for unused residential housing space") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:46">[01:21:46]</a>.
    2.  **Slide 2**: Articulate the non-obvious insight (e.g., "There's a gap between angels and VCs, and $500K is the new $5M") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:27">[01:22:27]</a>. This sets the context and preempts objections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:27">[01:23:27]</a>.
    3.  **Slide 3**: Present proof points (customers, traction, founders) that validate the insight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:48">[01:23:48]</a>.
*   **Avoid the "Franken-deck"**: Don't try to anticipate and address every objection from non-believers, as this dilutes the core message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:51">[01:20:51]</a>. Focus on finding and convincing those ready to believe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:16">[01:21:16]</a>.

### 3. Disagreeableness

A startup is a fundamentally disagreeable act, as it challenges the status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:38">[01:25:38]</a>. Successful founders must be willing to pursue their obsession, even if it means sacrificing status or being disliked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:17">[01:25:17]</a>.

*   **Challenging Conformity**: Great founders are like "Jonathan Livingston Seagull," willing to be banished from the flock for pursuing something they believe has to happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:47">[01:24:47]</a>.
*   **"Right Kind of Disagreeable"**: This isn't about being rude, but about having a different truth and sticking to it despite external advice (e.g., Ev Williams at Twitter) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:40">[01:26:40]</a>.
*   **High Standards**: Disagreeable founders often have incredibly high standards that inspire greatness in their teams, even if they are tough (e.g., Bill Gates, Elon Musk) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:37">[01:27:37]</a>.
*   **Courage to be Disliked**: Before winning, founders often face skepticism and are seen as "stupid" or "crazy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:12">[01:30:12]</a>. After winning, they may be criticized for "cheating" or breaking rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:20">[01:30:20]</a>. This criticism is part of the territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:36">[01:30:36]</a>.
*   **Embracing Chaos**: Successful startups are often internally chaotic and messy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:51">[01:30:51]</a>. This is normal because movements are messy, and the ambiguity of a radically new future naturally leads to internal disagreements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:02">[01:32:02]</a>.

## Practical Advice for Founders

*   **Get Out of the Present**: Actively immerse yourself in "the future" by interacting with new technologies, working with cutting-edge companies, or following visionaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:52:00">[55:52:00]</a>. Your opinion on the future is only valid if you are living in it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:52:00">[56:52:00]</a>.
*   **Force a Choice, Not a Comparison**: Don't try to be a "10 times better Apple" (an existing solution); aim to be "the world's first banana" (a completely new category) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:49">[01:01:49]</a>. Find customers who are desperate for the new "banana," even if it's imperfectly ripe, and ignore those who love apples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:04">[01:03:04]</a>.
*   **Desperation Threshold**: Customers must be so desperate for your unique offering that they find it "irresistibly drawn to that empowerment" and can't "unsee" its value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>. This desperation allows them to tolerate a startup's inevitable execution challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:15">[01:03:15]</a>.

## Applying Principles to Large Companies

These principles can also be applied within large organizations:

*   **Separate Value Delivery Systems**: Pattern-breaking ideas within a large company require a different value delivery system than normal ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>. The mistake companies make is making these new initiatives too visible or treating them as career-limiting moves if they fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:50">[01:35:50]</a>.
*   **Autonomous & Discreet**: Successful internal pattern-breaking efforts (like Apple's iPhone, Amazon's AWS, or Lockheed's Skunk Works) are often run as autonomous businesses, headed by mavericks, and kept discreet from the main organization in their early stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:43">[01:36:43]</a>.
*   **Willingness to Fail**: Companies should invest a portion of their profits (e.g., 10%) into projects that are likely to fail but have wildly asymmetric upside if they succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:20">[01:38:20]</a>. This willingness to fail enables breakthrough success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:44">[01:38:44]</a>.

## Conclusion

The journey of a startup founder is often lonely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:46">[01:39:46]</a>. It's acceptable if most people don't like an idea; it doesn't mean it's wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:50">[01:39:50]</a>. Maples emphasizes the importance of sticking one's neck out for what they believe they see before others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:02">[01:40:02]</a>, offering his utmost respect and affection to those who embark on this challenging but ultimately empowering path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:11">[01:40:11]</a>.

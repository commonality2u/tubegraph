Acquiring power, often perceived as uncomfortable or even "dirty," is a critical skill for career advancement and personal effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. While the realities of gaining power may diverge from conventional upbringing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>, it is essential to understand that power is a tool—like a hammer or a knife—and its moral implication depends on its wielder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. As stated, "if you want power to be used for good, more good people need to have power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

Research by Gerald Ferris and his colleagues demonstrates that "political skill" is linked to positive outcomes such as higher salaries, promotions, career happiness, and reduced stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. This skill is particularly vital for individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds or underrepresented groups, as it helps them navigate systems that may be "stacked against them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

Jeffrey Pfeffer, a professor of organizational behavior at Stanford's Graduate School of Business and author of *The Seven Rules of Power*, teaches how to build power to get things done and advance one's career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>. His course, "The Paths to Power," is one of the most popular and oversubscribed in the MBA program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:59">[01:13:59]</a>.

## The Seven Rules of Power

Pfeffer's *Seven Rules of Power* outline actionable strategies for building influence and overcoming the discomfort associated with it:

1.  **Get Out of Your Own Way** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>
    *   **[[handling_limiting_beliefs_and_fears | Address Limiting Beliefs and Fears]]:** Discomfort with the idea of power, viewing it as "dirty" or "evil," can prevent individuals from taking necessary steps for career success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>.
    *   **[[handling_limiting_beliefs_and_fears | Overcome Impostor Syndrome]]:** Many people suffer from impostor syndrome, believing they don't deserve their position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>. This leads to disempowering behaviors like preemptory apologies ("I don't know if this comment is going to be useful") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:27">[00:22:27]</a>. If you have the job, you are likely qualified or overqualified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:54">[00:22:54]</a>.
    *   **Prioritize Competence over Likability:** A common self-sabotage is worrying too much about being liked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>. While active dislike is not recommended, prioritizing competence and respect is crucial for performing your job effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.
2.  **Break the Rules** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>
    *   Breaking rules makes you stand out and become memorable, which is vital for career advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>.
    *   Rules are often established by those who benefit from the existing system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>. To disrupt and succeed, do things differently, playing to your strengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.
    *   **Don't Be Afraid to Ask:** Counter to conventional wisdom, asking for help is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. People often overestimate how many times they'll need to ask or how uncomfortable it will be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. The worst outcome is a "no," leaving you no worse off than if you hadn't asked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.
3.  **Show Up in a Powerful Fashion** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>
    *   People respond significantly to how others look and sound, and less so to the content of what they say <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>.
    *   These are [[overcoming_public_speaking_anxiety | learnable skills]], not inherent personality traits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>. Strategies include:
        *   Not reading from notes, maintaining eye contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>.
        *   Keeping communication brief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>.
        *   Using more gestures and open body posture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>.
        *   Speaking with a louder voice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>.
        *   Invading personal space gently, e.g., touching an arm or shoulder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.
        *   Strategic use of anger, as it can signal power by being outside the norm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.
        *   Confidence in one's material also conveys power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>.
4.  **Create a Powerful Brand** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>
    *   To advance, you must be known and differentiated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>. It's not enough to be smart; people must know about your capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>.
    *   Building a personal brand can be reframed not as self-promotion, but as [[the_psychology_of_power_and_selfpromotion | amplifying the impact of your team]] or scaling yourself by sharing knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.
    *   Examples include starting a podcast, writing, contributing to books, or strategically dressing and presenting oneself to be memorable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>. Substance is vital, but visibility is needed for that substance to be recognized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>.
5.  **[[building_and_wielding_influence | Network Relentlessly]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>
    *   Many find networking "dirty" due to a misunderstanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>. The first principle of networking is generosity—focus on what you can do for others, who you can introduce, or how you can be helpful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>.
    *   The broader your social network, the more knowledge you gain and the more opportunities arise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:00">[03:23:00]</a>.
    *   **Become a Broker:** Connect people who would benefit from knowing each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>.
    *   **Pursue Weak Ties:** Strong ties (family, close friends) tend to share redundant information. Weak ties (acquaintances, people in different fields) offer non-redundant information and access to new opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>.
6.  **Use Your Power** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>
    *   When given a position of authority, mobilize resources and take action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>.
    *   Success breeds more success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>. People are attracted to power and want to associate with those who achieve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>. The more you accomplish, the more resources and opportunities you'll be given <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>.
    *   Simply showing that you have power can generate more power, as people tend to follow leading figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>.
7.  **Success Excuses Almost Everything** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>
    *   A critical, perhaps most unsettling, rule is that once power is acquired, the means of acquisition are often "forgiven, forgotten, or both" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>.
    *   Life is not homeostatic; it's self-fulfilling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>. If people believe you are powerful, you become more powerful.
    *   This rule reflects how the world *is*, not how it *should be* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>. People tend to overlook flaws to be close to money, power, and success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>.

## Learning and Practice

The process of learning to acquire power involves moving through stages of denial, anger, sadness, and finally, acceptance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>. It's about gradual skill acquisition, much like learning a sport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>.

Jeffrey Pfeffer's course incorporates:
*   **Goal Setting:** Students identify what success looks like to them at the beginning of the course <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>.
*   **Self-Assessment and Development Plans:** Students rate themselves on attributes of power (e.g., energy, focus, willingness to tolerate conflict) and create plans for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>.
*   **"Doing Power" Assignments:** Practical exercises designed to apply course principles. Examples include:
    *   **Creating Resources:** Identifying and leveraging resources to gain influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>.
    *   **Brand Statement:** Writing and refining a personal brand statement to define how one wants to be known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>.
    *   **"Acting with Power" Drills:** Practicing powerful body language and communication through video exercises and peer feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>.
    *   **Targeted Networking:** Identifying key individuals who could be important for one's career and developing strategies to meet them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>.
*   **Coaching and Feedback:** Students receive regular feedback from executive coaches and peers, which is crucial for skill development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>.

This approach addresses the [[the_knowing_doing_gap | Knowing-Doing Gap]]: merely understanding concepts isn't enough; consistent practice is required for learning to stick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>. Progress is made by pushing oneself slightly outside their comfort zone, incrementally, rather than attempting radical changes at once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>.

## The Price of Power

While power offers significant advantages, it comes with a considerable cost, primarily a loss of autonomy and privacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>. High-power positions often mean less control over one's time and life, constant scrutiny, and the public dissection of personal affairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>. There is also the "trust dilemma," where it becomes difficult to discern if people's praise or association is genuine or simply due to one's position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. The pursuit of power can also take a toll on personal relationships and family life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

To begin acquiring power and [[building_and_wielding_influence | influence]], especially when feeling uncomfortable, the first step is to seek social support and coaching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>. Getting a coach or establishing a "personal board of directors" provides guidance, social support, and accountability, making it easier to step outside one's comfort zone and implement these strategies effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>.

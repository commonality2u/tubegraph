Elena Verna is described as one of the most experienced and intelligent people on growth strategy globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>. She has led growth at companies such as Miro, SurveyMonkey, and Amplitude, and has assisted companies like MongoDB, Netlify, and HP with their [[marketing_strategies_and_growth | growth strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>.

## Evolution of B2B Growth Strategies

B2B products are increasingly becoming "shiny and fun," similar to consumer products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>. Historically, B2B space evolved differently, focusing on utility and efficiency for Enterprise buyers who were not necessarily the end-users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>. This led to "cold interfaces" and "unusable products" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.

However, over the last decade, decision-making power has shifted back to the "prosumer" or employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>. The new wave of B2B products are consumer-like, focusing on user experience, habit formation, and integration into daily life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. This shift is driven by a redefinition of "customer" from the Enterprise buyer to the end-user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>.

Examples of this [[creative_approaches_to_building_beloved_b2b_products | consumerization of B2B]] include:
*   **Slack**: Grew by building for users, not Enterprise buyers, leading to user adoption that pressured buyers to adopt it organization-wide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.
*   **Miro**: Users bring the software into the company, advocating for its use to improve collaboration and effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>.
*   **Amplitude**: Is experiencing a similar "bottom-up" user adoption trend, moving away from traditional data head-driven purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>.

This trend focuses on "customer centricity," starting from onboarding, time to value, activation experience, and building habit loops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>. It's measured by user affinity, advocacy, and Net Promoter Score (NPS) to generate word-of-mouth growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>.

## Product-Led Growth (PLG) vs. Sales-Led Growth

The "game" of [[strategies_for_company_growth_and_overcoming_internal_challenges | company growth]] is a "layering game" where different strategies are introduced sequentially and built upon each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It's a mistake to view [[productled_growth_strategy | product-led]] versus sales-led as an "either/or" decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>. Successful companies execute both strategies correctly and together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>. If a company is sales-led, they should "hunker down" on sales-led and overlay product-led to amplify existing growth, rather than switching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

### Defining Product-Led and Bottom-Up

[[productled_growth_strategy | Product-led growth]] refers to a specific growth model where the product drives customer acquisition, retention, and monetization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>. Bottom-up growth is primarily concerned with acquisition and monetization, leveraging product usage to generate leads for sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>.

**Every company should first focus on being [[productled_growth_strategy | product-led]] in retention** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>. This involves:
1.  **Activation**: Ensuring users get value from the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>.
2.  **Engagement**: Building habitual loops so users frequently use the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>.

Without strong product-led retention, a product-led acquisition engine will struggle because acquisition relies on users buying, referring, or creating content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>.

### Product-Led Acquisition Considerations
*   **One-to-many relationships**: Products with collaboration at their core (like Slack or Miro) are well-suited for [[productled_growth_strategy | product-led acquisition]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>.
*   **Single-mode relationships**: Products without inherent collaboration (like Snowflake) find it harder to establish [[productled_growth_strategy | product-led acquisition]] and often rely on marketing-led and sales-led approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>.

Regardless of the current industry norm, every sector is undergoing transformation, and a [[productled_growth_strategy | product-led sales]] or self-serve model is likely to emerge within the next decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. Companies that don't introduce it risk being disrupted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.

### The Downfall of PLG When Scaling Up

A common pattern for [[challenges_and_strategies_for_earlystage_b2b_startups | B2B startups]] that start with [[productled_growth_strategy | PLG]]:
1.  **Initial PLG Success**: Companies achieve user love, word-of-mouth, community growth, and strong retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>. They monetize self-serve, getting good traction and aggregating users within organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.
2.  **Chasing Enterprise**: A first Enterprise contract is secured, with a high average contract value (ACV), which is exhilarating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>. Companies then double down on hiring more sales people, forecasting productivity per sales head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>.
3.  **Initial Sales Boost**: Everything seems good because there's strong user adoption and Enterprise buyers are often already in the user base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.
4.  **Slowdown**: Sales eventually slows because only a small percentage (30% or less) of buyers are in the existing user base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>. The company needs to find buyers outside the user base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>.
5.  **Disconnection**: Companies invest in Enterprise marketing (e.g., demand gen, ABM specialists) and disconnect from their [[productled_growth_strategy | product usage growth]] and [[productled_growth_strategy | product-led]] tactics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>. Prioritization shifts to Enterprise features, often neglecting user-delighting features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.
6.  **Drying Up Pipeline**: The sales-led inbound, which relies on product usage, starts to dry up because continuous pressure on user growth and community building is lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>.
7.  **Realization/Correction**: Many companies realize they've "forgotten the hand that feeds them" and reinvest in their original [[productled_growth_strategy | growth]] roots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>. Others pivot entirely to a top-down sales machine, which requires a very different structure and profiles of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>.

This overcorrection is common in almost every company, including SurveyMonkey, Netlify, and Amplitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>.
*   **Advice to Founders**:
    *   **ACV Comparison**: Do not compare ACVs of [[productled_growth_strategy | product-led]] self-serve with sales top-down, as PLG often lands accounts earlier with lower initial value, focusing on expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>. Incentivize teams correctly for this expansion model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>.
    *   **Product Roadmap Focus**: Be wary if the product roadmap focuses *exclusively* on Enterprise features, as this indicates a shift away from user-driven growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>. Continuously innovate and delight users to ensure they remain "selling agents" within their organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>.

### The Rise of Product-Led Sales (PLS)

[[productled_growth_strategy | Product-led sales]] is predicted to "box out" traditional top-down sales organizations within the next 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>.

**[[productled_growth_strategy | Product-led sales]] vs. Sales-Driven:**
*   **Product-Led Sales (PLS)**:
    *   Starts with product acquisition and self-serve usage (freemium or self-serve monetization) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>. The product generates usage without human involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>.
    *   Leverages user value to drive expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>.
    *   Has an incredibly low cost of acquisition because it's acquiring a user, not a buyer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>.
    *   Focuses on pipeline creation based on usage, not marketing-qualified leads (MQLs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>.
    *   Looks for "network effects" within an organization's user base (e.g., how many users, velocity, breadth of feature use) to create a product qualification model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>.
    *   Sales gets involved after usage has demonstrated organizational benefit, often targeting hand-raisers first, then accounts that act like hand-raisers but haven't formally raised their hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>.
    *   The product serves as the "sales enablement material" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>.
    *   Enterprise buyers are increasingly "boxed out" of the initial decision-making process, shifting it to the user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>.
*   **Traditional Sales-Led**:
    *   Starts with MQLs or outbound prospecting to find a buyer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>.
    *   Involves many demos and "wining and dining" to convince buyers to purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>.
    *   Often leads to utilization issues post-purchase because the sale happens before significant usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>.

## Freemium vs. Trials

The distinction between freemium and trial is significant for [[saas_business_growth_dynamics | SaaS business growth]].
*   **Freemium**: Allows for free product usage with ongoing feature or usage walls, but with an "ongoing forever" component <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>.
*   **Trial**: Allows free product usage but is "time-bound" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23:00">[04:23:00]</a>.

While fundamentally similar (allowing free usage), the time-bound nature of trials is often problematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23:00">[04:23:00]</a>. A 7-day trial might work for a small startup but alienates large enterprises due to their longer internal processes and dependencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>.
*   **Recommendation**: Instead of a time component, use a usage-based metric for free offerings. For example, MongoDB's freemium model allows a free "community cluster" for development and playing around, but any production use requires a paid model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>.

Even high-friction products (like Amplitude, Twilio, Contentful) that require complex setup can offer a freemium model. While setup might be high friction for large enterprises, it might be low friction for a small startup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>. The continuous innovation in the field, like no-code platforms, pushes down the cost and complexity of self-serve provisioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>.

### Strategic Reasons for Freemium
The biggest mistake is to view freemium merely as a conversion rate optimization tactic for paid products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>. Freemium should have a clear strategic business impact:
1.  **POC (Proof of Concept)**: Allows users to test the product's value (e.g., MongoDB's free cluster) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.
2.  **Indirect Monetization**: Drives acquisition or network effects without direct payment (e.g., Miro's three editable boards, SurveyMonkey's free users driving 100% of acquisition) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>.
3.  **Strategic Land**: To land with a segment you don't monetize immediately but want to expand with later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>.
4.  **Commoditization**: If the offering is already commoditized, you must give it away for free and differentiate through innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>.
5.  **Product Creation/Discovery**: A breeding ground for discovering adjacent use cases and personas, informing the product roadmap (e.g., LinkedIn's freemium base enabling sales and recruiting products) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.
6.  **Data Collection**: Collecting data on freemium users to build better paid products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>.

**Mental Model for Making Features Free**:
*   **Indirect Monetization**: Anything that creates virality or network effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>.
*   **Universality**: Features that suffice for nearly all users, regardless of complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>.
*   **Aha Moment**: Features crucial for a user's initial value realization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>.
*   **Habit Loops**: Features that promote ongoing engagement (e.g., notifications, communication channels) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>.
*   **Friction**: Anything that creates friction for the growth model should be gated in paid; anything that promotes it should be free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:00">[05:14:00]</a>.

## Hiring for Growth

Growth is an "evolution, not a revolution" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>. The more an organization can adopt a "growth mindset," the better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>.

### Finding a Growth Leader
*   **Internal Hire First**: It's often best to find a first growth hire internally (e.g., a finance analyst, existing product manager, data analyst, or technically inclined engineer) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>.
    *   **Benefits**: Internal hires are familiar with the product and its authentic [[marketplace_growth_strategy | growth model]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>.
    *   **Risks of External Hire**: Bringing someone external who tries to "copy paste" their previous company's [[growth_hacking_and_sustainable_growth_strategies | growth model]] onto a new product is likely to fail (99% rejection rate), as growth models are highly authentic and local <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>. External hires need significant time (3-6 months or more) to understand the product's unique growth model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>.

### When to Hire a Full-Time Growth Person
A full-time growth person should only be hired once the company has achieved strong [[finding_productmarket_fit_in_a_b2b_company | product-market fit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a>.
*   **Indicators of Product-Market Fit**:
    *   **Retention**: Demonstrable customer retention, typically measurable after at least six months to a year post-initial offering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>.
    *   **Acquisition & Monetization**: Some initial "green shoots" indicating an ability to acquire and monetize customers and drive product distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>.
*   **Founding Team's Role**: The founding team must establish the initial [[growth_hacking_and_sustainable_growth_strategies | growth model]] themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>. Hiring a growth person to figure out the model from scratch is a "delegation" and sets the company up for failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>.

## General Advice for Approaching Growth

The key to repeatable, sustainable, and competitively defensible growth is understanding how to find patterns in problems to develop frameworks for solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>. Growth should be viewed as a framework problem, not just about conversion rates and revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>. Minimizing context switching is crucial to foster a growth culture and mindset across the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>.

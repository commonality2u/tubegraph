From: [[lennyspodcast]] <br/> 

Andrew Bosworth, widely known as "Boz," is the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of Meta, having joined what was then Facebook in early 2006 as one of its first engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. Over his 18-year tenure, Boz has been instrumental in creating some of the most impactful products in Internet history, including the Facebook News Feed and the original Facebook mobile ads platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:06">[01:03:06]</a>. He also contributed to building the messaging system, profile, timeline, Facebook Groups, and even the internal engineering boot camp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:23">[01:02:23]</a>. More recently, he led the company's AR/VR organization, now known as Reality Labs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:06">[01:37:06]</a>.

## The Reality of Early Startups

The romanticized view of early startup life, often depicted in movies, misses the "pain and suffering" involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. As Facebook's 10th engineer (or somewhere between 10th and 16th, as several joined simultaneously), Boz experienced intense periods, including working 120 hours per week with no hobbies, gaining weight, and drinking heavily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. For two years, he routinely woke up every four hours to check anti-spam reports and defend the site, a self-imposed duty that required immense sacrifice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.

While acknowledging the tremendous camaraderie and memories forged in these "forge of really intense times," Boz emphasizes that this period was "not glamorous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. Early team members had no experts to turn to, often building servers from scratch or driving to acquire components themselves, highlighting the lack of established support functions like payroll, finance, or HR in nascent companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.

Boz respects the enthusiasm for startup culture and the willingness to take risks, but he cautions that success stories often overshadow the sacrifices made by many who do the same work but don't see it pay off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

## [[leadership_principles_and_career_success | Leadership Principles]]

### Communication is the Job

One of Boz's most classic pieces of [[leadership_principles_and_career_success | advice for career advancement]] is that "communication is the job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:39">[00:51:39]</a>. If you aspire to be a leader and have an impact, it is exclusively through affecting other humans via "artifacts or verbalizations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:04">[00:52:04]</a>. He argues that merely having an idea or writing a post is meaningless if it doesn't break through to the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:48">[00:52:48]</a>.

Boz champions "extreme ownership," a concept from the US Marines and Seals, meaning that when something goes wrong, a leader should always ask, "What could I have done differently?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:45">[00:53:45]</a> This includes clearly communicating expectations, setting metrics, or even ensuring the right people are in roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:57">[00:53:57]</a>. He states, "You cannot not communicate; you are always communicating something with your face, with your clothes, with your body" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:38">[00:54:38]</a>.

To communicate effectively, Boz advises:
*   **Multimodality**: Delivering messages in multiple ways (e.g., an all-hands meeting followed by a written post) to cater to different learning styles and absorption rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:46">[00:56:46]</a>.
*   **Address Fears and Concerns**: Acknowledge people's issues and concerns upfront to build trust and ensure they are receptive to your message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:26">[00:57:26]</a>.
*   **Empathy for the Audience**: Understand the mental model of your audience—whether specific individuals, teams, or the general public—to tailor your language and presence to guide them towards your desired outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:53">[00:55:53]</a>.

### Leveraging Your Leaders

A frequently given piece of [[advice_for_career_advancement_at_senior_management_levels | advice for career advancement]] is to "more directly leverage their leaders" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>. Individuals often hesitate to ask for help, fearing it implies weakness or failure to achieve goals independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>. However, Boz emphasizes that the job is not necessarily to *do* it yourself, but to *get it done* effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>. Managers and mentors possess tools and insights that can clear obstacles and accelerate progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>.

He likens it to a director auditioning an actor: "No one wants you to succeed more than the person you are auditioning for" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:27">[01:00:27]</a>. Similarly, a manager benefits when their team members excel, so they are generally rooting for their success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:37">[01:00:37]</a>.

Tips for asking for help:
*   **Provide Concise Updates**: Send "light touches" like a 5-10 sentence email detailing progress, blockers, and questions, with a clear "no response required" if things are on track <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:13">[01:17:13]</a>.
*   **Pre-draft Communications**: When blocked, offer your manager a draft email to send to another person or specific questions to ask, making it easy for them to provide quick, effective assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:16">[01:18:16]</a>.
*   **Understand Manager Preferences**: Ask your manager how they prefer to receive updates and stay informed, as every manager is different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:59">[02:09:59]</a>.

### Transparency and Bottom-Up Culture

Meta fosters a culture of transparency, encouraging internal posts, sharing data, and allowing employees to ask even Mark Zuckerberg questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:18">[02:22:18]</a>. This open information ecosystem is designed to fully leverage talented individuals, preventing them from being blocked by lack of information and reducing frustration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:55">[02:30:55]</a>. Great work often stems from people understanding the mission and having ample information to act autonomously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:55">[02:33:55]</a>.

While it appears as a "bottoms-up culture" where people can experiment and contribute ideas, Boz clarifies that major strategic directions often originate from the top, especially from Mark Zuckerberg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:24">[02:40:24]</a>. The culture allows for "degrees of freedom" within that framework, where employees can bring multiple versions of an idea for refinement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:55">[02:44:55]</a>. Crucially, clear guidelines define where employees have autonomy versus where they are "on assignment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:02">[02:47:02]</a>.

The downside of such transparency is the need for individuals to become adept at managing information overload, triaging incoming communications, and filtering noise to find signal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:11">[02:51:11]</a>.

### The "Eye of Sauron" and Delegation

Boz describes an executive's involvement with a project using the "Eye of Sauron" metaphor: when a project is deemed the most important, no detail is too small for Mark Zuckerberg or other leaders to scrutinize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:02">[03:11:02]</a>. This deep involvement can range from strategic direction to pixel-level design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:50">[03:16:50]</a>.

Regarding delegation, Boz notes that many founders regret delegating too much, especially critical aspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:56">[03:43:56]</a>. The key is to discern "what matters the most" – focusing deep involvement on the critical "hinge upon which success or failure will happen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:12">[03:57:12]</a>. For less critical features or areas with clear roadmaps, rough implementation and iteration are sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:58">[03:59:58]</a>.

### Handling Criticism

Mark Zuckerberg exemplifies "strong opinions loosely held" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:58">[04:39:58]</a>. Boz explains that Zuckerberg is "voracious for all information and all points of view" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:08">[04:45:08]</a>. When given feedback, he listens, often explains his reasoning, and then, uncannily, internalizes the information, leading to shifts in his approach or product direction weeks later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:30">[04:45:30]</a>. He actively pressure-tests feedback by seeking out other perspectives from various team members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:56">[04:56:56]</a>.

## Career Path and Growth

Boz's own career path at Facebook was initially "unusual," involving frequent job changes—almost every six months for a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:52">[03:15:52]</a>. He describes this as like "painting a lot of fences, waxing a lot of cars" to learn new skills, meeting many people, and understanding different organizational dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:35">[03:50:35]</a>. While peers in single tracks were promoted faster early on, his varied experience ultimately paid off, leading to a "vertical" career trajectory when he took on the ads role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:15">[04:19:15]</a>.

### Optimizing for Learning

Boz's primary motivation for moving jobs was "aggressive learning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:57">[04:30:57]</a>. He would move if he felt he wasn't learning enough new things and was bored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:46">[04:35:46]</a>. He advises early-career professionals to "optimize for learning," viewing it as a compound interest investment that yields significant returns over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:35">[04:31:35]</a>.

### Choosing Projects

When selecting projects, Boz suggests two optimal paths:
1.  **Carrying Water in Overlooked Areas**: Taking significant ownership of important areas that the company isn't currently prioritizing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:47">[04:15:47]</a>. This earns immense respect from executives when these areas prove critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:57">[04:37:57]</a>.
2.  **Working on the Most Important Thing ("Rocket Ship")**: Joining projects that are central to the company's current focus, even if it means taking a smaller piece of a larger pie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:47">[04:48:47]</a>. This provides high visibility, invaluable experience "in the fire," and rapid growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:50">[04:13:50]</a>.

He emphasizes the importance of passion: when passionate about something, you do "better work," "smarter work," and are "an order of magnitude more productive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:31">[04:37:31]</a>. Boz learned that he has a "broad palette" for passion and advises giving new roles six months to see if that passion ignites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:59">[04:38:59]</a>. If not, it's okay to move on, as you've still built valuable new skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:22">[04:31:22]</a>.

## Navigating Downturns and Personal Growth

Meta experienced extreme stock fluctuations, including the largest single-day stock drop in history, followed 18 months later by the largest single-day gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:18">[04:17:18]</a>. Boz cites Lou Holtz: "You're never as good as they say you are when you're winning and they're never as bad as they say you are when you're losing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:44">[04:28:44]</a>.

His advice for leaders during downturns:
*   **Trust Internal Knowledge**: Recognize that "you know more than the critics do" about your company's true value, even if external perspectives offer valuable insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:56">[04:29:56]</a>. Read criticism carefully, checking for confirmation bias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:46">[04:35:46]</a>.
*   **Communicate Effectively**: Meta learned that they did not effectively communicate their long-term investments, especially in AI and Reality Labs, to the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:58">[04:46:58]</a>. They then focused on explaining their balanced portfolio of investments, emphasizing that cutting all future growth during tough times is a path to eventual decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:55">[04:54:55]</a>.
*   **Acknowledge Cyclical Nature**: Recognize that business downturns are cyclical, not "a wrath of God," a perspective that was new to many in the workforce who had only experienced boom times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:03">[05:17:03]</a>.

### Personal Failures and "Identity Threat"

Boz views his greatest failures not as product or technical missteps (which are learning opportunities), but as "personal failures where I affected a person in a way that I'm not proud of" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:21">[05:21:21]</a>. These moments often stemmed from a lack of emotional control, fear, or when he felt his "identity was caught up in being right" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:25">[05:24:25]</a>. He calls this "identity threat" – the tendency to react strongly when a core part of one's self-perception is questioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:40">[05:41:40]</a>.

He highlights the importance of [[the_role_of_mentorship_and_community_in_career_development | coaching]] and self-awareness to recognize and manage identity threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:55">[05:54:55]</a>. A key lesson learned from observing a colleague, Ami Vora, was to embrace "genuine and profound curiosity" when faced with disagreement or differing views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:58">[05:57:58]</a>. Instead of reacting defensively, responding with "fascinating, you have to tell me more about why you think that" can break down walls and foster open-mindedness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:22">[06:01:22]</a>.

> "People don't remember what you said; they just remember how you made them feel." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:16">[06:16:16]</a>

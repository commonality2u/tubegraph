From: [[lennyspodcast]] <br/> 

Andrew Bosworth, often known as "Boz," is the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of Meta, joining what was then Facebook in early 2006 as one of its first engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>. Over his 18-year tenure, he has played a pivotal role in creating impactful internet products, including the Facebook News Feed, the original Facebook mobile ads platform, the messaging system, profile, timeline, Facebook groups, and the internal engineering boot camp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. More recently, he led engineering, product, research, analytics, and design as VP of Ads and Business Platform, and in 2017, he created the company's AR/VR organization, now known as Reality Labs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>.

## Early Career and the Grind

In the early days of Facebook, Bosworth was essentially the 10th engineer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. He recalls a period of intense work, often 120 hours per week, with no hobbies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. He didn't sleep for more than four hours at a time for about two years, constantly waking up to check reports for site attacks and battling them back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>. This grueling pace was self-imposed; no one asked him to build the anti-spam defense, but he saw a problem and took it on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.

During this period, there was no expert to ask for help; engineers had to figure things out themselves, even building new servers from purchased components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:28:00">[08:28:00]</a>. Unlike today's startups with professional support for payroll, finance, and HR, early Facebook relied on individual efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:08:00">[09:08:00]</a>. While this phase created tremendous camaraderie, it was "not glamorous" at the time, only seeming so in retrospect after success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>.

### Advice for Founders (with caveats)
Bosworth cautions that his advice for founders comes with a "grain of salt," as he joined Facebook almost two years after its inception and wasn't involved in fundraising, board matters, or the business side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>. However, he highlights that mentorship and resources like podcasts and newsletters now support professionals in the industry in a way that was missing for 15-20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>.

He emphasizes the "big sacrifice" involved in startup life, noting that while his efforts paid off, many others who worked equally hard might not have seen the same results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:40:00">[09:40:00]</a>.

### Leveraging Leaders
One of the most frequent pieces of advice Bosworth gives is for people to "more directly leverage their leaders" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>. He notes that people often want to do things themselves to prove capability, but the primary goal is to get the job done well, and a manager's tools can facilitate this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>. Managers want their team members to succeed, as it makes their own lives easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>.

Tips for leveraging leaders:
*   **Proactive updates:** Send short, "no response required" emails outlining progress, blockers, or questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>. This provides a "little heartbeat" and allows the manager to clear paths or provide guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>.
*   **Drafting requests:** If blocked, draft the specific email or request needed from the manager (e.g., to another team leader) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>. This makes it "super cheap" for the manager to help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>.
*   **Asking about preferences:** Directly ask managers how they prefer to receive updates and stay informed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.

Managers also have a responsibility to know when to let their team "figure that out" and when to refuse to rule, empowering them to find solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>.

### Organizational Transparency
Meta's culture is characterized by high transparency, where almost all information is available internally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. This openness is crucial for leveraging talented individuals, ensuring they have the necessary information to act effectively and feel engaged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>. Much of the phenomenal work at Meta has come from people understanding the mission and having access to vast amounts of information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.

However, this comes at a "tremendous price" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>. Individuals, especially senior hires, must develop systems for managing information, triaging incoming data, and finding "signal amongst all the noise" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>.

### Top-Down vs. Bottom-Up Culture
While Meta is often perceived as a bottom-up culture encouraging experimentation, Bosworth clarifies it's a "bit of a myth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. Leaders like Mark Zuckerberg have strong opinions, and "bottom-upness" operates within that framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>. The key is providing "clear guidelines" on where individuals have space to innovate and where there is "no space" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>. This allows talented people to bring back multiple versions of a concept within established parameters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>.

### Strategic Involvement
Founders and executives often regret delegating too much, especially on critical elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>. The challenge is determining what "matters the most" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>.

At Meta, when Mark Zuckerberg focuses on a project, it's referred to as "the eye of Sauron" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>. In such cases, no detail is too small for him to notice, ranging from high-level strategy to a single pixel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>. Bosworth and other leaders also adopt this "high to low" style for things that matter a ton <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>. This was evident in the early News Feed development, where Mark whiteboarded every pixel, and more recently in modernizing ranking systems where he was "heavily involved" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>. Bosworth himself was "really adamant" about hand tracking and mixed reality making it into Meta's headsets, holding high standards for their performance despite initial team resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>.

There are two optimal places to be in a company:
1.  **Carrying a lot of water in areas the company isn't paying attention to but are known to be important:** Executives deeply respect those who "hold that dam up" and manage critical but less visible functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>.
2.  **On the most important thing (the "rocket ship"):** Here, even a smaller piece of work offers immense visibility, experience, and the chance to "see what it looks like in the fire" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>.

## [[career_advancement_strategies | Career Development and Personal Growth]]

### Finding Passion and Learning
Bosworth learned that he is inclined to be passionate about things once he dives in. He initially resisted working on ads or hardware, but discovered immense fascination in both areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>. His advice is to "give yourself the space to understand if you can get passionate about it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>. If, after about six months, the passion isn't there, it's often better to move on rather than doing "bad work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>.

Passion leads to "better work," "smarter work," and "an order of magnitude more productive" output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>.

### [[navigating_career_transitions_and_promotions | Navigating Career Paths]]
Bosworth's own career arc at Meta involved frequent role changes every six months for a long timeâ€”from integrity to News Feed, site speed, infrastructure, boot camp, messaging, and groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>. He felt like he was "painting a lot of fences" and "waxing a lot of cars" but ultimately gained a broad understanding, like "knowing karate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>. While peers in single tracks might have been promoted faster initially, his diverse experience led to a "vertical" career trajectory once he settled into the ads role for five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>.

His advice:
*   **Optimize for learning:** Especially in early career, prioritize roles where you learn aggressively. If you're not learning enough, move on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>.
*   **Embrace variety:** Gaining a variety of experience across different domains (e.g., internal tools, customer support, infrastructure, user-facing products) is invaluable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>.
*   **Don't fear job changes:** "Don't be jump into new things, give it six months if it's not the thing no problem like you just built a ton of new skills that's going to come in handy I promise you that keep going" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:00">[04:19:00]</a>.

### Dealing with Criticism and External Perception
During Meta's downturn (including the largest single-day stock drop in history), Bosworth learned several lessons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>:
*   **"You know more than the critics do":** While external perspectives are valuable and can reveal blind spots, internal employees possess deeper knowledge of the company's real value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>. It's crucial to read criticism carefully for potential truths but not accept it blindly, avoiding "Gil Manning Amnesia" where one trusts external information about unfamiliar topics more than internal knowledge about their own expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>.
*   **Communication is the job (again):** Meta "did not communicate effectively" with the market about their long-term investments in AI and Reality Labs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>. When economic tides went out (e.g., Ukraine war, interest rate hikes), the market scrutinized these bets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>. Companies need a "balanced portfolio of investments" rather than just shoring up core business during tough times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>.
*   **Cyclical nature of business:** The downturn highlighted that a generation of employees (e.g., those who graduated college in 2009) had never experienced a recession, leading to a mindset unprepared for economic shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.

### The News Feed Experience
The Facebook News Feed, the first algorithmically ranked content feed, was initially "super controversial" and rejected by users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>. However, people immediately doubled their usage, demonstrating "cognitive dissonance" between stated and revealed preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. This taught Bosworth that while listening to customers is important, sometimes conviction in a vision is necessary, as users may not know what they want until they experience it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>.

Bosworth notes that the team did make "little mistakes" in execution, such as inadvertently broadcasting previously "wall posts" to a wider audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>. This highlights the art of distinguishing between when the product idea itself is wrong versus when only the details are flawed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>.

### Personal Failures and Growth
Bosworth differentiates between professional failures (products not used, architectures that didn't scale), which he doesn't regret because he learned from them, and personal failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>. His deepest regrets are "personal failures where I affected a person in a way that I'm not proud of" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>, often stemming from emotional reactions driven by "identity threat" (when a core part of one's self-perception is questioned) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.

He recounts a vivid memory of yelling at a friend and colleague during a technical debate about RPC encoding, driven by his identity being "caught up in being right" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>. This moment was a step towards recontextualizing his approach to be more open-minded and curious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>.

Through [[coaching_strategies_for_executive_success | coaching]], Bosworth learned techniques to manage identity threat and react with genuine curiosity rather than defensiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>. He learned from a colleague, Ami Vora, who would react to profound disagreements with "fascinating, you have to tell me more about why you think that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>. This approach fosters open-mindedness and breaks down communication barriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.

## The Power of Communication

Bosworth firmly believes that "communication is the job" for anyone aspiring to have an impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>. Impact is exclusively achieved through artifacts or verbalizations that affect other humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. He subscribes to the "extreme ownership" philosophy from the U.S. Marines and Navy Seals: if something goes wrong, ask what *you* could have done differently in terms of communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>.

Key communication lessons:
*   **You cannot *not* communicate:** Silence, body language, even clothing all communicate something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.
*   **Empathy for the audience:** Understand the mental model of specific individuals, teams, or the average person, and tailor your language, presence, and persona to guide them from their current understanding to your desired outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>. This "tremendous empathy" is the most challenging but crucial step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>.
*   **Multimodality and repetition:** Use different channels (e.g., all-hands meeting followed by a written post) and reiterate points in various ways (direct, metaphor) to ensure internalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.
*   **Address fears and concerns:** People won't listen if they believe you're unaware of the problems. Start by acknowledging the issue directly ("Hey, let me be clear, this is the issue we're having. I know we're having it, I know it matters") before presenting solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.
*   **Start small, build up:** Begin by influencing one or two people (manager, teammate) and gradually develop skills for larger-scale communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>.

## Personal Philosophy

### Veritas (Truth)
Bosworth has a tattoo of "Veritas," Latin for truth, which is also Harvard's motto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>. While he initially saw honesty as a "get out of jail free card" to say whatever he wanted, he regrets not being kind in his early career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>. Being kind means delivering feedback productively and helpfully, rather than being patronizing or providing half-truths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>. He is still direct and honest but now expresses "true care and belief" when raising concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>.

### Life Motto: "Trust Yourself"
His family's motto is "trust yourself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>. This means trusting your own eyes, ears, and intellect, especially when facing peer pressure or self-doubt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>. It's about having conviction in your decisions and believing in your intrinsic value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>. This also implies trusting yourself to handle the outcomes when risks don't pay off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>.

### [[the_personal_development_of_a_founder_and_leadership_lessons | Lessons from Personal Life]]
Bosworth notes that lessons from his professional life, learned through great mentors and coaches, have made him a better partner and husband <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>. Conversely, deep engagement with literature on raising children (e.g., Dr. Becky's *Good Inside*) has made him a better manager, particularly in understanding and engaging with people's emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>. He emphasizes that the "work of improving yourself is always fruitful and satisfying" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.

From: [[lennyspodcast]] <br/> 

Michael Tru, co-founder and CEO of Any Sphere (the company behind Cursor), envisions a future "after code" where the fundamental nature of software development undergoes a profound transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## The Vision: A World After Code

The core goal with Cursor is to invent a new type of programming, a significantly different way to build software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. In this future, being an engineer will feel more like being a logic designer, focused on specifying intent for how everything should work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The process will distill down to describing intent to the computer in the most concise way possible, defining how software should work and look <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. This new method of building software aims to be "legions higher level and more productive" and in some cases, more accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

Michael Tru contrasts this vision with two prevailing ideas about the future of software:
*   **Continuation of current practices:** Some believe software building will remain largely the same, involving text editing formal programming languages like TypeScript, Go, C, and Rust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.
*   **Chatbot-style interaction:** Others imagine simply typing requests into a bot, asking it to build or change software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

Tru believes both these visions have problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. The chatbot approach lacks precision, making it difficult for humans to have complete control over the software's appearance and functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. The "nothing changes" perspective is seen as incorrect, as technology is expected to improve significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

Instead, the "after code" world will feature a representation of software logic that resembles English, potentially an evolution of programming languages towards pseudocode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. This will be a "much turser and easier to navigate" form, allowing high-level editing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. The human will remain in the driver's seat, maintaining control over all aspects of the software and having a fast iteration loop for making changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

## Evolving Skills for Engineers

In this evolving landscape, the skills valued in engineers and product teams will shift:
*   **Taste as a primary skill:** "Taste" will become increasingly valuable, extending beyond visual design (UI/UX) to encompass the *logic* of how software works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. This refers to having the "right idea for what should be built" and the "effortless translation" of that intent into a functional product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.
*   **Logic Designer vs. Coder:** Engineers will transition into "logic designers," focusing more on "the what" (the desired outcome) and less on "the how" (the underlying implementation details) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.
*   **Reduced need for "carefulness":** Currently, being careful is a crucial skill for software engineers. However, as AI improves, there will be less need for this carefulness and more emphasis on taste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.
*   **Vibe Coding and Control:** "Vibe coding" today involves generating code without fully understanding the details, which can lead to limitations and difficulty in making changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. Future tools aim to give users continued control over details even if they don't fully understand the underlying code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>.

## The Origin Story of Cursor

Cursor began from reflecting on how AI would improve over the next decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>. Two key moments inspired its creation:
1.  **First useful AI product:** Experiencing the first beta version of GitHub Co-pilot was a turning point, as it was the first truly useful AI product the founders had used, and one of the most useful dev tools ever adopted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>.
2.  **AI scaling papers:** Research papers from OpenAI and other organizations demonstrated that AI would continue to improve significantly just by scaling models and data, even without new conceptual ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>.

This led the founders to believe that AI products were now possible and would mature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>. They felt many were focusing on making models but not truly considering how AI would change specific areas of knowledge work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>.

Initially, the team made a "misstep" by deciding to work on what they thought would be an "uncompetitive and sleepy and boring" area: automating mechanical engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>. This venture, lasting four months, faced challenges because the founders lacked expertise in mechanical engineering and struggled to make existing models useful due to data limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>. They eventually realized they were not excited about mechanical engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>.

Returning to programming, they felt that despite time passing, not much had changed, and existing players in the space were not "sufficiently ambitious" about how AI would transform software creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>. This led them to build Cursor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>.

## Building Cursor: Product-Led Growth and Custom Models

Cursor is one of the fastest-growing products, reaching $100 million ARR in 20 months and $300 million ARR in two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. This growth has been "fairly just consistent on an exponential" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>.

### Focus on IDE vs. Agents or Models Alone
The decision to build Cursor as an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) stemmed from several beliefs:
*   **Human control:** A core philosophy is giving humans control over all decisions in the end tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>. This differentiates Cursor from approaches focused solely on full AI automation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>.
*   **Realism about current AI:** A pragmatic view of current AI capabilities indicated that humans still need to be in the driver's seat as AI cannot do everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>.
*   **Limitations of plugins:** The act of programming is expected to change significantly, and existing coding environments have "so so so limited" extensibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>. For the UI and form factor of programming to evolve, control over the entire application (an IDE) is necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>.
*   **Flexibility of interaction:** The future will involve effortlessly moving between different modes, sometimes letting AI "spin off on its own" for tasks, and other times pulling in AI's work to collaborate quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>. Background tasks are particularly useful for easily specified programming tasks like bug fixes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>.

### Counterintuitive Learning: Custom Model Development
A significant and counterintuitive learning for Cursor was the necessity of performing their own model development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>. When they started, they didn't expect to do this, having calculated the immense resources required to train models like GPT-4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:32">[00:32:32]</a>. They believed existing models would suffice if a proper tool was built around them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:01">[00:33:01]</a>.

However, "every magic moment in Cursor involves a custom model in some way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>. While Cursor utilizes large foundation models (like GPT, Sonnet, Gemini) for various components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:23">[00:34:23]</a>, their own models serve specific use cases that foundation models cannot handle due to cost or speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:31">[00:34:31]</a>.

An example is the **autocomplete experience**:
*   Code is unique because future work is often predictable, unlike writing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:52">[00:34:52]</a>.
*   Cursor's "souped-up autocomplete" predicts the next actions across multiple files and within a file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:32">[00:35:32]</a>.
*   This requires models that are incredibly fast (completion within 300 milliseconds) and cost-efficient, as they run constantly (every keystroke) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:45">[00:35:45]</a>.
*   These custom models are specialized in autocompleting "a series of diffs" rather than just generic text sequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>. This specific task is where Cursor's own models, often starting from open-source models, have found significant success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:19">[00:36:19]</a>.

Other uses for custom models include:
*   **Input processing:** Searching a codebase to find relevant parts to show to larger foundation models (acting like a "mini Google search" for code) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:47">[00:36:47]</a>.
*   **Output refinement:** Taking high-level suggestions (sketches of changes) from large models and filling in the detailed code diffs, ensuring accuracy and integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:03">[00:37:03]</a>.

This "ensemble of models" strategy, where specialized models complement larger ones, has been crucial for pushing product quality and speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:28">[00:37:28]</a>.

## Defensibility and Market Dynamics
Tru believes that in the AI space, the primary "moat" or defensibility is the continuous effort to build the best product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:16">[00:39:16]</a>. Unlike traditional software markets that might rely on lock-in or commoditization, the AI market, similar to early search engines or personal computing, has an "incredibly high" ceiling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:05">[00:40:05]</a>. Value can be continually added through R&D, and users can easily switch tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:09">[00:40:09]</a>.

The market for software building tools is seen as "much bigger than people have realized" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:24">[00:43:24]</a>. While there will be many solutions and niches, Tru predicts that there will likely be "one company that builds the general tool that builds almost all the world's software," a "generationally big business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:38">[00:43:38]</a>. This is because the core act of programming is expected to shift from formal languages to something much higher level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:56">[00:43:56]</a>.

Regarding Microsoft's Co-pilot, Tru notes its inspiration but suggests it may not be winning due to both structural reasons (market not friendly to incumbents) and specific historical reasons (original team moving on, coordination challenges) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:30">[00:44:30]</a>.

## Advice for New Users and Future Engineers

### Tips for Cursor Users
To succeed with Cursor, users should develop a "taste for what the models can do" and understand their capabilities and limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:39">[00:46:39]</a>. Two specific tips:
1.  **Chop up tasks:** Instead of giving the model one large, complex task, break it into smaller bits. Specify a little, get a little work, specify a little more, and so on. This "chopping things up" approach is more successful than relying on a single large prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:28">[00:47:28]</a>.
2.  **Discover limits in a safe environment:** Experiment with pushing the AI's capabilities in a low-stakes environment like a side project. Developers, especially those used to traditional workflows, should "explicitly try to fall on their face" to discover what the models can and cannot do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:05">[00:48:05]</a>. Many users underestimate AI's abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:25">[00:48:25]</a>.

This process builds a "gut feeling" for the model's capabilities, which may need to be "rebuilt" with each new model launch due to slight differences in their "quirks and personalities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:48">[00:48:48]</a>.

### Impact on Engineers
AI tools like Cursor benefit both junior and senior engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:40">[00:49:40]</a>:
*   **Junior engineers:** Tend to rely "a little too wholesale" on AI for everything, which is not yet feasible for professional, collaborative work on large codebases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:55">[00:49:55]</a>.
*   **Senior engineers:** Often "underrate what AI can do for them" and stick to existing workflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:46">[00:50:46]</a>. However, some senior engineers, especially those on [[improving_developer_experience | developer experience]] teams, are "boundary pushing" in their adoption of the technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:22">[00:50:22]</a>.

Ultimately, both cohorts receive "big benefits" despite falling into different "anti-patterns" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:56">[00:50:56]</a>.

### The Future of Engineering Roles
The demand for software is "very lasting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:27">[01:07:27]</a>. While AI will make engineers significantly more productive, it will also drastically reduce the cost of building software, enabling a vast increase in the amount of software that can be created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:35">[01:07:35]</a>. The "physics of working on computers are so great" that there should be far less friction in bringing ideas to life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:27">[01:08:27]</a>. Tru believes that long into the future, there will actually be *more* demand for engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:49">[01:08:49]</a>.

## Building and Growing Cursor

### Hiring Philosophy
Cursor has been intentionally patient with hiring, prioritizing a "world-class group of engineers and researchers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:16">[00:52:16]</a>. While many companies hire too fast, Cursor initially "hired too slow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:20">[00:53:20]</a>. Key aspects of their hiring include:
*   **Targeting world-class talent:** Recruiting individuals over many years, even if they aren't actively looking for new roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:38">[00:53:38]</a>.
*   **Focus on disposition:** Seeking candidates who are intellectually curious, experimental, intellectually honest, level-headed, and less focused on external validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:54">[00:59:54]</a>.
*   **Evolved interview loop:** They use hand-rolled interview questions and a distinctive two-day, on-site work test where candidates complete a real mini-project, often in Cursor's codebase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:12">[00:55:12]</a>. This allows evaluating real work products and team fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:56">[00:55:56]</a>.
*   **Diversifying profiles:** Initially, they may have biased too much towards "high credential" young individuals from well-known schools, but later found success with "later careered" fantastic people who might not fit the "straight out of central casting" archetype <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:21">[00:54:21]</a>.

Cursor currently has about 60 people, which is small given its scale and impact, with a very high percentage of engineers, researchers, and designers compared to other functions like sales and marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:06">[00:58:06]</a>.

### Staying Focused in a Rapidly Evolving Field
In the fast-paced AI landscape, staying focused is crucial. Cursor manages this through:
*   **Hiring the right people:** Individuals who are level-headed, focused on building great products, and less swayed by external noise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:36">[00:59:36]</a>.
*   **Leading by example:** The leadership's long-term commitment to AI since 2021-2022 has built an "immune system" to the constant flux of new technologies and ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:02">[01:01:02]</a>.
*   **Understanding what truly matters:** Recognizing that out of the vast amount of chatter, only a few developments significantly impact their business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:54">[01:01:54]</a>. This mirrors the evolution of deep learning, where a few simple, elegant ideas have had lasting impact while many others haven't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:15">[01:02:15]</a>.

## Looking Ahead

Tru believes the current technological shift is "incredibly consequential," more so than the internet or any shift since the advent of computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:06">[01:03:06]</a>. However, it will be a "multi-decade thing," requiring progress on both the science side (faster, cheaper, smarter models) and the human-computer interaction side (how humans control and work with these new capabilities) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:17">[01:03:17]</a>.

He highlights that companies that focus on "automating and augmenting a particular area of knowledge work," building both the underlying technology (integrating best parts from providers and sometimes doing it in-house) and the product experience, will be highly influential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:08">[01:04:08]</a>. These companies, by achieving scale, will also be vital in pushing technology forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:41">[01:04:41]</a>.

Tru emphasizes the importance of continually improving the product and being ready for "many leap frogs" in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:09">[01:09:09]</a>, learning from past examples of greatness in technological development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:51">[01:09:51]</a>.

Managing up is a crucial skill that involves effectively collaborating with and influencing your manager or senior leaders. It's often misunderstood as a skill only for junior employees, but in reality, it becomes increasingly important as one advances in their career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>.

## Why Managing Up is Crucial

A common misconception is that you eventually "outgrow" the need to manage up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:21">[00:59:21]</a>. However, the more senior you become, the less likely your manager will provide clearly defined tasks on a "silver platter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. Instead, you'll face more ambiguity and broad mandates, requiring you to proactively manage up to ensure your leader is informed and aligned with your initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:09">[01:00:09]</a>. Investing in this skill serves you throughout your entire career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:44">[00:59:44]</a>.

## The Core Tactic: Sharing Your Point of View

The most highly leveraged way to manage up is by being vocal about [[the_importance_of_communication_in_product_management | sharing your point of view]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:17">[01:01:17]</a>. Instead of simply asking, "What should we do?" and placing the entire cognitive load on your manager to strategize solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:22">[01:01:22]</a>, proactively offer your perspective:

> "Hey manager, here's what I think we should do. How does that sound? Where do you see gaps? Am I thinking in the right direction?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:36">[01:01:36]</a>

This approach provides your manager with a starting point to build upon, significantly reducing their mental effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:46">[01:01:46]</a>.

### Backing Up Your Point of View
To effectively share your point of view, back it up with:
*   Evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:56">[01:01:56]</a>
*   Logic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:56">[01:01:56]</a>
*   First principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:56">[01:01:56]</a>
*   Examples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:56">[01:01:56]</a>
*   Data (if available) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>

It's okay if you don't have all the answers or definitive data, especially when building something new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:24">[01:02:24]</a>. You can frame your insights by saying, "My initial thinking is..." or "Based on what we know, my hunch is..." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>. The key is to [[the_importance_of_communication_in_product_management | speak accurately]] about your level of conviction and the evidence you have <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:57">[04:30:57]</a>.

When presenting reports or data, don't just hand it over expecting your manager to extract insights. Proactively point out key takeaways and observations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:37">[01:02:37]</a>. This shifts your posture from reactive to active, demonstrating that you are a strategic thinker who anticipates problems and forms hypotheses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:49">[01:02:49]</a>.

## Benefits and Impact
Sharing your point of view is not only beneficial for your manager but also for your own career growth:
*   **Accelerated Growth**: This approach is a powerful way to get promoted and seize more [[developing_leadership_skills_and_understanding_feedback | leadership opportunities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:07">[01:03:07]</a>. Leaders appreciate team members who bring solutions and well-thought-out recommendations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:22">[01:03:22]</a>.
*   **Crystallized Thinking**: Presenting a recommendation forces you to think deeply and clearly about the problem and your proposed solution. It helps you solidify your own understanding and clarifies your thoughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:36">[01:03:36]</a>. As Joan Didion put it, "I don't know what I think until I write it down" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>.
*   **Leveraging Proximity**: Junior team members often have the most direct contact with customers, support tickets, or raw data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:55">[01:03:55]</a>. By speaking up and sharing observations from these areas, you provide valuable insights that managers may not have visibility into <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:02">[01:04:02]</a>.
*   **Building Trust**: When presenting your ideas, avoid being a "single-minded martyr" who only presents evidence supporting their agenda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>. Being accurate about what is truly known versus a hunch builds trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>. If people perceive bias, they may distrust your recommendations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>.

## Connection to Overall Communication Skills

The principles of managing up are deeply intertwined with effective [[the_importance_of_communication_in_product_management | communication]] generally. All tactics that enhance clarity and impact are relevant:
*   **Clarity and Conciseness**: Be clear and concise in your communication, whether written or verbal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. This ensures your manager quickly understands your point without needing excessive back-and-forth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>.
*   **Anticipating Objections**: Utilize the "MOO" (Most Obvious Objection) framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:00">[00:53:00]</a>. Before presenting an idea, consider what objections or questions are likely to arise. By anticipating these, you can address them proactively or refine your proposal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>. This preparation is key to being concise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>.
*   **"Sales then Logistics"**: Always start by selling the "why" behind your proposal before diving into the "how" or logistics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. Briefly explain why it matters to the company or the individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. This ensures buy-in before delving into details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.
*   **Focus on Outcomes**: When providing [[importance_of_giving_and_receiving_feedback | feedback]] or making a proposal, always focus on the desired outcome, not just "venting" or expressing frustration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>. The goal is to motivate behavior change or achieve a specific result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>.

Spending a little more time upfront to ensure your communication is clear, concise, and well-supported can save tremendous time later by preventing misunderstandings, reducing follow-up questions, and increasing the likelihood of achieving your desired outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. These seemingly minor efforts compound over time, significantly impacting your work output and influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>.

From: [[lennyspodcast]] <br/> 

[[finding_productmarket_fit_in_startups | Finding product market fit]] is identified as the single most important task for a startup in its first three years, yet it remains an underexplored and underexplained topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. To address this, First Round Capital developed a [[product_market_fit_strategies | product market fit framework]] based on consistent patterns observed across hundreds of startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This framework aims to provide a practical and actionable guide for founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:37">[01:37:37]</a>.

## The Importance of Product Market Fit

[[finding_productmarket_fit_in_startups | Product market fit]] is often perceived as a mysterious art rather than a science, with common advice being "you'll know it when you see it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:03">[07:00:03]</a>. However, it is the most critical element for a startup's success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:19:19">[08:19:19]</a>. While founders face numerous tasks—like picking a market, finding co-founders, hiring, fundraising, building, and selling—[[finding_productmarket_fit_in_startups | product market fit]] is the only thing that truly matters in the first couple of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:42">[09:41:42]</a>. Achieving "extreme [[finding_productmarket_fit_in_startups | product market fit]]" creates momentum, with the market pulling the company along <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:18">[10:00:18]</a>. This makes it easier to know what to build, motivates the team, and simplifies hiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:14:15">[10:14:15]</a>. Without it, companies often get stuck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31:34">[10:31:34]</a>.

This framework is specifically designed for early B2B founders, particularly those in sales-led models, within the first six to nine months of starting their company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:07:22">[11:07:22]</a>. While success cannot be guaranteed, the framework aims to increase the odds of achieving [[finding_productmarket_fit_in_startups | product market fit]] by providing a structured way of thinking about necessary actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:16:17">[12:16:17]</a>.

## Framework Overview: Demand, Satisfaction, and Efficiency

The framework begins with the idea that [[finding_productmarket_fit_in_startups | product market fit]] is not a one-size-fits-all, overnight occurrence, especially for B2B companies, where it tends to follow a repeatable pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:02:44">[17:02:44]</a>.

The ultimate goal is to achieve "extreme [[finding_productmarket_fit_in_startups | product market fit]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:18:20">[17:18:20]</a>. This is defined as:
> "A state of widespread demand for a product that satisfies a critical need and crucially can be delivered repeatably and efficiently to each customer." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:26:44">[17:26:44]</a>

This definition highlights three key ideas:
1.  **Demand**: Widespread desire for the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:40:51">[17:40:51]</a>.
2.  **Satisfaction**: The product effectively meets a critical need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:43:08">[17:43:08]</a>.
3.  **Efficiency**: The product can be delivered repeatably and profitably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:45:10">[17:45:10]</a>.

Efficiency is crucial and often overlooked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:47:11">[17:47:11]</a>. Products like WeWork and Casper achieved demand and satisfaction but lacked efficiency, preventing business viability at scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:56:06">[17:56:06]</a>. The "marginal customer" concept suggests that as a company progresses towards [[finding_productmarket_fit_in_startups | product market fit]], acquiring and serving each incremental customer should become easier and easier, indicating increasing efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:17:45">[19:17:45]</a>.

### The Four Levels of Product Market Fit
[[the_importance_and_stages_of_productmarket_fit | Product market fit]] is achieved in sequence over multiple years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:57:04">[19:57:04]</a>, typically four to six years for the best Enterprise companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:07:37">[20:07:37]</a>. These are:
1.  **Nascent** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:16:03">[20:16:03]</a>
2.  **Developing** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:18:16">[20:18:16]</a>
3.  **Strong** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:20:41">[20:20:41]</a>
4.  **Extreme** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:22:20">[20:22:20]</a>

At each level, founders make tradeoffs between satisfaction, demand, and efficiency, optimizing for different aspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:47:35">[20:47:35]</a>.

### The Four Ps (Persona, Problem, Promise, Product)
When a startup is stuck at a particular level of [[finding_productmarket_fit_in_startups | product market fit]], the "Four Ps" provide levers for change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:56">[00:29:56]</a>:
1.  **Persona**: Who is the target customer? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:43">[00:33:43]</a>
2.  **Problem**: What critical problem are you solving for them? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:03">[00:34:03]</a>
3.  **Promise**: How do you describe the solution and its value? (Positioning) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:40">[00:34:40]</a>
4.  **Product**: What is the actual solution you've built? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:20">[00:36:20]</a>

These elements must align: the product must deliver a promise that solves the problem of the persona <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:26:00">[30:26:00]</a>.

## Levels of Product Market Fit

### Level 1: Nascent Product Market Fit
At this initial stage, typically a pre-seed or seed-stage company with fewer than 10 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:46:09">[21:46:09]</a>, the primary goal is to find three to five customers with an important and urgent problem and deliver a deeply satisfying solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:54:19">[21:54:19]</a>.

*   **Focus**: Satisfaction is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:16:09">[22:16:09]</a>. Inefficiency is acceptable if it helps uncover an immensely satisfying customer experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:24:08">[22:24:08]</a>.
*   **Benchmarks**:
    *   Team Size: Less than 10 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:48:00">[21:48:00]</a>.
    *   Customers: Aim for 3-5 paying customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:54:19">[21:54:19]</a>.
    *   Demand Source: Mostly friends, family, and network (warm intros) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:14:49">[27:14:49]</a>. It might take 20 warm intros to get one customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:30:17">[27:30:17]</a>.
    *   ARR: $0 to $500K <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:42:32">[27:42:32]</a>.
    *   Metrics (Efficiency, Retention): Not applicable; too early to worry about burn multiple, gross margin, or NRR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:52:13">[27:52:13]</a>.
*   **Timeframe**: Ideally 12-18 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:23">[01:07:23]</a>. This initial choice of persona and problem is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:30">[01:07:30]</a>.

**Example: Vanta**
Vanta, founded by Christina Copo in 2016, initially explored other ideas before focusing on security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:03:00">[23:03:00]</a>. By asking security engineers what they hated most, she discovered the pain of compliance audits and security questionnaires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:56:49">[23:56:49]</a>. Vanta's early "product" was Christina manually filling out spreadsheets to help companies like Segment, Front, and Figma get SOC 2 certified, unlocking revenue for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:42:27">[24:42:27]</a>. This exemplifies high satisfaction despite extreme inefficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:56:06">[25:56:06]</a>.

**Signs of Being Stuck at Level 1**:
*   Customers wouldn't be disappointed if the product disappeared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:27:07">[28:27:07]</a>.
*   Handful of happy customers, but each uses a different core feature (looks more like consulting) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:33:04">[28:33:04]</a>.
*   Incredibly hard to find the next customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:43:08">[28:43:08]</a>.
*   Low product usage or lack of growth after 6 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:48:06">[28:48:06]</a>.

**Example of [[identifying_and_addressing_signs_of_being_stuck_in_productmarket_fit | Getting Unstuck]]: Lattis**
Lattis, founded by Jack Altman in 2015, began as an OKR tool, but customers weren't engaged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:08:12">[29:08:12]</a>. Jack identified that while the OKR solution wasn't critical, his persona (Heads of HR) had other pressing problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:35:09">[30:35:09]</a>. Observing a pendulum swing back to Performance Management, he showed Figma mockups for a modern solution, which generated strong demand, leading to initial sales before building the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:11:42">[31:11:42]</a>. Lattis kept the **Persona** but changed the **Problem** and **Promise**, leading to a successful [[identifying_and_addressing_signs_of_being_stuck_in_productmarket_fit | pivot]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:50:09">[31:50:09]</a>.

**Example of [[identifying_and_addressing_signs_of_being_stuck_in_productmarket_fit | Getting Unstuck]]: Plaid**
Plaid initially started as a consumer budgeting app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:25:00">[32:25:00]</a>. When it wasn't gaining traction, the founders realized their internal tool for connecting to bank accounts was valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:32:00">[32:32:00]</a>. They pivoted to offer this API to other developers (e.g., Venmo, Robinhood, Coinbase), changing the **Persona**, **Problem**, and **Promise** while keeping much of the existing **Product** code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:53:00">[32:53:00]</a>.

### Level 2: Developing Product Market Fit
At this stage, the goal is to grow from 5 satisfied customers to 25 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:24:07">[39:24:07]</a>. This requires focusing on **Demand** in addition to satisfaction, as sheer willpower alone won't scale to 25 customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:31:00">[39:31:00]</a>. The product must start doing more of the heavy lifting for sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:53:00">[39:53:00]</a>.

*   **Focus**: Scaling demand through scalable channels (cold outreach, content, community events) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:10:00">[40:10:00]</a>.
*   **Benchmarks**:
    *   Team Size: Up to 20 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:04:00">[40:04:00]</a>.
    *   Customers: Aim for 25 customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:24:07">[39:24:07]</a>.
    *   Sales Conversion: Around 10% from first call to close (without warm intro) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:37:00">[40:37:00]</a>.
    *   ARR: $500K to $5M <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:44:00">[40:44:00]</a>.
    *   Efficiency/Retention Metrics: Start tracking:
        *   Magic Number: 0.5 to 0.75 (New ARR / CAC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:55:00">[40:55:00]</a>.
        *   Regretted Churn: Not higher than 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:19:00">[41:19:00]</a>.
        *   NRR: At least 100% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:21:00">[41:21:00]</a>.
        *   Gross Margin: Not worse than 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:31:00">[41:31:00]</a>.
        *   Burn Multiple: Not worse than 5x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:33:00">[41:33:00]</a>.
*   **Timeframe**: Around 1 year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:29">[01:08:29]</a>.

**Example: Looker**
Looker, founded in 2012 by Lloyd Tabb, spent a long time at Level 1, as their product required customers to see their own data modeled to understand its value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:42:00">[43:42:00]</a>. Lloyd essentially provided consulting, spending 20-40 hours modeling data for potential customers before they even became paying users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:17:00">[44:17:00]</a>. This "forward deploy process" was then made repeatable, allowing them to scale quickly from 5 to 25 customers with a high close rate (75%) and zero churn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:34:00">[44:34:00]</a>. They then focused on demand channels like SDRs, partner marketing with AWS Redshift, and customer events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:08:00">[45:08:00]</a>.

**Example: Ironclad**
Ironclad, founded by Jason Boehm in 2015, initially struggled to sell their "AI Legal Assistant" because no one was looking for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:08:00">[46:08:00]</a>. They pivoted when an inbound email asked, "Are you a CLM?" (Contract Lifecycle Management) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:51:00">[46:51:00]</a>. Jason realized that instead of creating a new category, they could position themselves in an existing one, but as a much better, AI-powered solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:04:00">[48:04:00]</a>. This shift in **Promise** and **Problem** (from "AI Legal Assistant" to "AI-powered Contract Management Software") unlocked demand, allowing them to rapidly gain customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:31:00">[48:31:00]</a>.

**Signs of Being Stuck at Level 2**:
*   Difficulty opening the demand floodgates despite current customers being happy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:34:00">[49:34:00]</a>.
*   Regretted churn is greater than 20% (satisfaction warning) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:07:00">[50:07:00]</a>.
*   Sales cycles are too long, or deals are lost late in the funnel to competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:22:00">[50:22:00]</a>.
*   Lack of urgency from customers or struggle to hit desired price points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:27:00">[50:27:00]</a>. (Customers might say "no budget" or "not the right time," which means no) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:36:00">[50:36:00]</a>.
*   Stuck for 12-18 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:58:00">[52:58:00]</a>.

If stuck, focus on pivoting using the Four Ps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:00:00">[51:00:00]</a>. Founders often need to make a "200% pivot" rather than a minor "10% pivot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:25:00">[51:25:00]</a>, being willing to let go of what they've built if it's not gaining market traction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:41:00">[51:41:00]</a>. The most common issues are that the problem isn't significant enough, or the promise isn't valuable enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:42:00">[54:42:00]</a>.

### Level 3: Strong Product Market Fit
This is where [[building_productmarket_fit_through_strategic_focus | product market fit]] starts to feel exciting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:17:00">[55:17:00]</a>. The marginal customer becomes much easier to acquire, and demand is repeatable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:43:00">[55:43:00]</a>. Founders start to feel like the "boulder went down the other side," and they have to chase it to keep up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:17:00">[56:17:00]</a>.

*   **Focus**: Repeatability of demand while maintaining satisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:00:00">[56:00:00]</a>, and beginning to focus on **Efficiency** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:51">[01:00:51]</a>.
*   **Benchmarks**:
    *   Team Size: 30-100 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:14:00">[57:14:00]</a>.
    *   Company Stage: Series B-ish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:21:00">[57:21:00]</a>.
    *   Customers: Approaching 100 customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:51:00">[57:51:00]</a>.
    *   Demand Channels: At least one scalable marketing and sales channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:29:00">[57:29:00]</a>. 10% or more inbound from referrals and word-of-mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:37:00">[57:37:00]</a>.
    *   ARR: $5M to $25M <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:03:00">[58:03:00]</a>.
    *   Efficiency Metrics:
        *   Gross Margin: Above 60%, ideally above 70% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:29:00">[58:29:00]</a>.
        *   Burn Multiple: Below 3x (ideally 1-3x) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:35:00">[58:35:00]</a>.
        *   Regretted Churn: Less than 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:43:00">[58:43:00]</a>.
        *   NRR: Greater than 110% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:47:00">[58:47:00]</a>.
*   **Timeframe**: Probably 2 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:43">[01:08:43]</a>.

**Signs of Being Stuck at Level 3**:
*   Leaky bucket: NRR below 90% or regretted churn greater than 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:34">[01:00:34]</a>.
*   Growth slowing (e.g., 2x growth after previous 3x years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:40">[01:00:40]</a>.
*   Increased competition in a tougher market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:52">[01:00:52]</a>.
*   Saturated demand channel, requiring finding new channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:12">[01:01:12]</a>.
*   Growth at the expense of efficiency (burn multiple above 3x) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:18">[01:01:18]</a>.

### Level 4: Extreme Product Market Fit
Achieving Level 4 means a company has become highly valuable, likely a unicorn and aspiring decacorn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:27">[01:02:27]</a>. This stage signifies reaching the highest levels of satisfaction, demand, and efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:37">[01:02:37]</a>.

*   **Focus**: Sustaining growth by continually doing all three (satisfaction, demand, efficiency) well, and expanding Total Addressable Market (TAM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:27">[01:03:27]</a>.
*   **Benchmarks**:
    *   Team Size: Bigger than 100 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:44">[01:02:44]</a>.
    *   Company Stage: Series C, Series D or beyond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:48">[01:02:48]</a>.
    *   Customers: More than 100, aiming for 200, 300, eventually 1000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:51">[01:02:51]</a>.
    *   ARR: Beyond $25M <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:56">[01:02:56]</a>.
    *   Efficiency Metrics:
        *   Sales Conversion: Better than 15% (first call to close) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:06">[01:03:06]</a>.
        *   Magic Number: Greater than 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:10">[01:03:10]</a>.
        *   CAC Payback: Less than 12 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:12">[01:03:12]</a>.
        *   Gross Margin: Above 80% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:15">[01:03:15]</a>.
        *   Burn Multiple: Ideally less than 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:18">[01:03:18]</a>.
        *   Churn: Less than 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:22">[01:03:22]</a>.
        *   NRR: Greater than 120% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:22">[01:03:22]</a>.
*   **Timeframe**: Typically 2 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:50">[01:08:50]</a>.

To expand TAM, companies either enter new markets with their existing product or develop multiple products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:42">[01:03:42]</a>. Legendary companies like Vanta (Trust Management Platform, Security Questionnaires), Verkada (cameras, alarms, badge readers), Stripe (Radar, Atlas), and Square (Cash App, checking, loans) exemplify this multi-product growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>. Achieving [[finding_productmarket_fit_in_startups | product market fit]] for new products requires repeating the process and maintaining that mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:46">[01:04:46]</a>.

**Rough Estimates of Companies Stuck at Each Level**
Roughly 60-70% of companies never get past Level 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>. This highlights the importance of understanding and navigating these early stages effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:01">[01:06:01]</a>.

## The Four Ps: Levers for Change

The Four Ps are crucial for [[identifying_and_addressing_signs_of_being_stuck_in_productmarket_fit | identifying and addressing signs of being stuck]]:

1.  **Persona**: This refers to the target customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:36">[01:12:36]</a>. Founders should think of the market as a collection of people (e.g., HR leaders) rather than a macroeconomic category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. Deeply understanding the persona's challenges, goals, and how to help them succeed is vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:51">[01:13:51]</a>. Founders of successful companies like Plaid, Looker, and Lattis often become close with their early customers, understanding them intimately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:28">[01:13:28]</a>.

2.  **Problem**: Identify an urgent and important problem for the chosen persona <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:03">[01:14:03]</a>. This involves "dollar-driven customer discovery" to test the potential for a solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:51">[01:14:51]</a>.

    *   **Identifying Extreme Value**: Ask open-ended questions about top goals and challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:08">[01:15:08]</a>. Avoid "happy ears" by looking for "wow statements" or demonstrated interest (e.g., asking for a follow-up meeting, sharing a deck) rather than polite "interesting" responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:15">[01:17:15]</a>.
    *   **Confirming Ability to Pay**:
        *   Are they currently looking for or building a solution internally for this problem? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:19">[01:19:19]</a> The best customers have tried and failed to solve it themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:42">[01:19:42]</a>.
        *   Where would a budget for this solution come from? Ideally, there's an existing budget, or funds are being spent on competing tools or internal development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:01">[01:20:01]</a>.
        *   How does their team make decisions on third-party tools? Look for a clear, known process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:23">[01:20:23]</a>.
    *   **Quantifying Willingness to Pay**:
        *   "What's your budget for solving this?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:59">[01:20:59]</a>
        *   "What are you paying for this other tool?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:02">[01:21:02]</a>
        *   Using the "Simon Co" pricing questions (from Mamoon Hamid):
            *   "What is a fair price you would pay for this?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:18">[01:21:18]</a>
            *   "What would be an expensive price?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:26">[01:21:26]</a> (Often the price they'd pay if the product is good) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:43">[01:21:43]</a>
            *   "What would be a prohibitively expensive price?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:31">[01:21:31]</a>

3.  **Promise**: This is how you position and pitch the solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:42">[01:13:42]</a>. It's often easier to succeed by entering an existing category with a better solution than trying to create a new category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:01">[01:10:01]</a>.

4.  **Product**: The actual solution you build to deliver on the promise and solve the problem for the persona <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:42">[01:13:42]</a>. The fidelity of the early product or demo needs to match what's required to land the sale (e.g., Figma mockups, real data demo, or manual work) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:10">[01:24:10]</a>.

**Tip: Knowing When You've Talked to Enough People**
You've talked to enough people when you can predict 70-80% of what the next person will say, having heard the patterns clearly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:50">[01:24:50]</a>.

## The Product Market Fit Method Program

First Round Capital offers a free, intensive 3-month program called "[[product_market_fit_strategies | Product Market Fit]] Method" for early B2B founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:12">[01:11:12]</a>. It's designed to increase the odds of [[finding_productmarket_fit_in_startups | PMF]] and provides structured work that aligns with what founders should already be doing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:40">[01:15:40]</a>. The program covers topics such as:

*   The levels of [[the_importance_and_stages_of_productmarket_fit | product market fit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>
*   Dollar-driven customer discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>
*   Market validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>
*   [[steps_to_develop_and_align_on_product_positioning | Product positioning]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>
*   Design partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>
*   Product iteration and pivots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>
*   Founder-led sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>

The program emphasizes experiential learning, including watching recordings of other founders' customer discovery calls to learn best practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:20">[01:22:20]</a>. It is particularly suited for technical B2B founders with a clear product idea or hypothesis who are less than 6-12 months into building their company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:04">[01:15:04]</a>.

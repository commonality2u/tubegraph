Linear, co-founded by CEO Karri Saarinen, approaches product development in a distinct and unconventional manner, which they refer to as the "Linear Method" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. This method emphasizes extreme clarity, taste, and quality over traditional metrics and large product management teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Core Tenets of the Linear Method

Linear's development philosophy aims to provide a frictionless and streamlined system for modern software development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. Key elements include:

*   **Focus on Craft and Quality**: Linear places a huge emphasis on craftsmanship and the quality of the user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. They believe that in any domain or industry, the more it matters, the more design matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. For a collaboration tool like Linear, quality is essential because friction or "paper cuts" make a product annoying to use, hindering collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.
*   **Avoiding Traditional Metrics**: The company explicitly avoids A/B tests and metric-based goals for specific features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>, instead focusing on taste and opinions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. While they might have company-level goals like increasing weekly active users, individual features are not tied to specific metric increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:41">[00:43:41]</a>.
*   **Lean Product Management**: Linear operates with only one product manager who serves as the head of product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. This structure distributes typical PM responsibilities, such as communication and scope definition, to engineers and designers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>. This fosters ownership and allows builders to identify opportunities for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>.

## Opinionated Software

A central tenet of the [[linears_approach_to_customer_feedback_and_product_iteration | Linear method]] is building "opinionated software" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. Karri Saarinen believes that productivity software, especially for companies, should be opinionated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:35">[00:39:35]</a>.

Instead of creating highly flexible software that requires users to spend time figuring out workflows, Linear provides "good defaults" or "good opinions" on how features and workflows should operate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:15">[00:40:15]</a>. This approach aims to reduce cognitive load on users, allowing them to focus on their actual work rather than managing the tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:37">[00:40:37]</a>. The design mantra is to "design something for someone," as designing "everything for everyone" often results in generalized, unoptimized solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:47">[00:40:47]</a>.

## Working in Cycles

Linear heavily utilizes "cycles" in its development process, which are optional but available for teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:35">[00:41:35]</a>. Cycles are essentially consistent time frames (e.g., one or two weeks) during which a team commits to focusing on a specific set of priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:15">[00:42:15]</a>.

This approach helps teams manage an "infinite list of things to do" and avoid distractions from new incoming tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:53">[00:41:53]</a>. If a new, urgent task arises, the team has a clear understanding of what was originally prioritized, providing a basis for explaining shifts in focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:41">[00:42:41]</a>. Cycles are similar to sprints but emphasize consistent, automated schedules to maintain focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:57">[00:42:57]</a>.

## Emphasis on Craft and Quality

Linear's success is significantly attributed to its high-quality user experience and design, which acts as a key differentiator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>, particularly in a crowded market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:04">[00:25:04]</a>. The more mature and competitive a market becomes, the more vital design becomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:48">[00:25:48]</a>. Today, a high level of design is almost a basic requirement for new products to gain attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:25">[00:26:25]</a>.

Despite the focus on quality, Linear does not aim for early "perfection" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. Instead, they prioritize quickly getting features into the app for internal testing and small customer groups (beta programs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. This allows them to gather feedback and refine the product, even if it's "janky" in early stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. The final polish and craft are applied before general release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. They often co-create features with a small number of customers, particularly larger companies, to understand real-world usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.

Design reviews are iterative, involving the CEO and other founders who act as project sponsors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:32">[00:33:32]</a>. Saarinen emphasizes using intuition and personal testing to determine when a feature is ready for general release, relying on a "gut level" feeling rather than strict metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:37">[00:36:37]</a>. The company believes that when everyone in the team understands the product and customer problems well, decisions can be made using intuition rather than solely relying on data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:11">[00:47:11]</a>.

## Unique Team Structure and Hiring

Linear's ability to execute its method is deeply tied to its [[unique_hiring_practices_and_company_culture_at_linear | unique hiring practices and company culture at Linear]]. They seek high-caliber individuals interested in a broader scope of work beyond their specific job title <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>. This means engineers are expected to have "product sensibility" and articulate reasons behind design choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:15">[00:59:15]</a>.

A key part of their hiring process is a paid work trial, where candidates work alongside the team on a vague problem statement, building a solution, and presenting their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:28">[01:02:28]</a>. This allows both the company and the candidate to assess compatibility, see the codebase, and understand the working environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:33">[01:03:33]</a>.

## Product-Market Fit and Growth

Linear views [[developing_a_product_strategy | product-market fit]] not as a binary state but as a spectrum, evolving across different customer segments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>. They initially focused on achieving strong product-market fit within the early-stage startup segment, aiming to become the default tool for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:05">[01:18:05]</a>. As they grew, they expanded their focus to cater to larger companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:43">[01:18:43]</a>.

Their initial launch involved a waitlist on Twitter, which was nurtured through a survey asking about current tools and company size. This allowed Linear to selectively invite smaller companies that aligned with their initial supported features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>. They onboarded customers in small cohorts, fixing issues and incorporating feedback before inviting the next group, optimizing early development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:39">[01:13:39]</a>.

Linear's approach to growth and product development reflects a deep commitment to quality, a lean and empowered team, and a clear vision of their ideal user experience, rather than relying on traditional growth hacking or metric-driven strategies.

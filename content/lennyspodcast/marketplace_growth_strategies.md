Growing a marketplace business is complex and requires a "very light touch," akin to a gardener tending an ecosystem, as opposed to a "construction worker" building a linear [[growth_strategies_for_saas_businesses | SaaS business]] where products and features are built and sold in a straightforward manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. Messing with the core incentives or mechanisms of a marketplace requires extreme caution, especially if the system is already performing well, as actions can have unforeseen long-term effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Dan Hockenmeyer, head of strategy and analytics at Fair, has extensive experience in scaling marketplace startups, including Thumbtack and Fair, and has helped numerous startups with their [[building_a_strong_gotomarket_strategy | growth models]] and [[expansion_strategies_for_marketplaces | growth strategies]] through his consulting business, Basis One <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Understanding Growth Models for Marketplaces

A [[building_a_strong_gotomarket_strategy | growth model]] is an analytical representation of how a business grows, typically built in a spreadsheet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. Its primary value lies in forcing a deep understanding of how the business works and in aiding opportunity assessment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. It is not a forecasting tool, but rather a way to weigh different opportunities and understand the impact of various initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

For a transactional business like a marketplace, the growth model builds upon the basic [[growth_strategies_for_saas_businesses | SaaS components]] of acquisition channels, retention, and monetization, by layering on:
*   **Transaction frequency and Average Order Value (AOV)**: How often retained customers transact and the value of each transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.
*   **Unit Economics**: Crucial for businesses with higher costs of goods sold (COGS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.
*   **Supply Acquisition and Retention**: Unlike [[growth_strategies_for_saas_businesses | SaaS businesses]], marketplaces must model both demand and supply, and understand their interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

Marketplace growth models can be complex due to the number of assumptions and the difficulty in understanding the interaction between supply and demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. It's often more practical to have a high-level conceptual model for the entire business, alongside mini-models for individual teams focusing on their specific metrics and levers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>.

### The Power of Retention
A significant lesson learned from building numerous [[building_a_strong_gotomarket_strategy | growth models]] is that growth is "much more sensitive to customer retention than you can ever intuit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>. Even small percentage gains in retention can be more valuable than larger changes in other areas, suggesting that product and growth resources may often be misallocated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>.

Retention is challenging to move because it reflects the entire product experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:06">[00:21:06]</a>. Instead of direct re-engagement tactics, focusing on the core customer experience is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:22">[00:21:22]</a>. The biggest wins often come from improving the early user experience, especially by streamlining and homogenizing it to ensure a consistent, positive first impression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>. For example, Uber and Lyft guarantee first-week earnings for drivers to prove the platform's value and improve retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>. Efforts to "resurrect" churned users are typically less effective than focusing on new user activation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:41">[00:24:41]</a>.

## [[key_performance_indicators_for_marketplaces | Key Performance Indicators for Marketplaces]]

Beyond general business health metrics, specific indicators are crucial for evaluating marketplace health:
1.  **GMV or Transactions**: The ultimate North Star metric that aggregates both supply and demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:45">[00:28:45]</a>.
2.  **Unit Economics**: Essential to understand, especially in early stages where marketplaces often incur losses per transaction (e.g., Instacart, Uber) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>.
3.  **Liquidity**: How reliable the marketplace is for both consumers seeking goods/services and suppliers looking to sell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:30">[00:29:30]</a>. This should be expressed in a way that aligns with what the customer deeply cares about, like wait times for ridesharing or search-to-fill rates for e-commerce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:44">[00:29:44]</a>. Until a marketplace is liquid, "nothing else matters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:16">[00:30:16]</a>. This is why narrowing scope (geography, category) is often advised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:27">[00:30:27]</a>.
4.  **Share of Wallet**: Measures how much of a buyer's total spend or a seller's total business is conducted on your platform versus alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:44">[00:30:44]</a>. A higher share of wallet indicates a deeper relationship, better LTV, and reduced multi-tenancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:12">[00:31:12]</a>. Achieving high share of wallet on both sides simultaneously is often difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:31">[00:31:31]</a>.

## Prioritizing Supply vs. Demand

While both sides are essential, "demand is the only thing that matters" ultimately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:41">[00:34:41]</a>. Successfully aggregating demand makes a marketplace dominant because suppliers are always eager for customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:43">[00:34:43]</a>. The goal is to acquire supply only to the extent that it incrementally improves the demand side's experience and overall liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:40">[00:35:40]</a>. Building dual-sided ROI equations that capture the interdependencies between acquiring supply and demand allows for a more informed allocation of acquisition spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:47">[00:36:47]</a>.

## [[expansion_strategies_for_marketplaces | Marketplace Expansion Strategies]]

When considering [[expansion_strategies_for_marketplaces | expanding a marketplace]] into new markets or verticals:
*   **Adjacency over TAM**: Prioritize how adjacent a new market is to the core business, as a proxy for the likelihood of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:37">[00:43:37]</a>. Instacart expanding to convenience stores made more sense than traditional retail due to similar high-frequency, speed-sensitive models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:45">[00:43:45]</a>.
*   **Accentuating Network Effects**: Focus on areas where the same supplier can serve multiple demands, or where consumers have multiple related needs, reinforcing the existing network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:17">[00:44:17]</a>. Uber adding UberEats is a prime example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:28">[00:44:28]</a>.
*   **Product over Go-to-Market**: While bootstrapping with incentives is important, ultimately, delivering an "incredible end-to-end customer experience first" is what creates genuine customer love, retention, and word-of-mouth growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:34">[00:45:34]</a>. Avoid letting go-to-market efforts get too far ahead of product quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:54">[00:45:54]</a>.

## Marketplace + SaaS Integration

Integrating a [[growth_strategies_for_saas_businesses | SaaS business]] model with a marketplace or vice-versa is a growing trend.
*   **Marketplace to SaaS is Easier**: It is generally easier for a marketplace to add [[growth_strategies_for_saas_businesses | SaaS elements]] than for a [[growth_strategies_for_saas_businesses | SaaS business]] to become a marketplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:18">[00:47:18]</a>. Marketplaces inherently generate demand, which is a high-value activity, and already have relationships with both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:25">[00:47:25]</a>. [[growth_strategies_for_saas_businesses | SaaS businesses]] lack demand-side relationships, requiring them to acquire a whole new type of demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:51">[00:47:51]</a>.
*   **Focus on Customer Pain**: Marketplaces should add [[growth_strategies_for_saas_businesses | SaaS features]] not primarily for monetization, but to create a better, stickier customer experience by solving existing pains (e.g., integrating with back office or accounting systems) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:22">[00:48:22]</a>. This boosts retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:46">[00:48:46]</a>. Before considering [[growth_strategies_for_saas_businesses | SaaS integration]], a marketplace should ensure it has a "really liquid high performance Marketplace first" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:16">[00:49:16]</a>.

## Vertical vs. Horizontal Marketplaces

The "unbundling" of large horizontal marketplaces (like eBay, Reddit, LinkedIn) into specialized vertical marketplaces is a recurring theme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:39">[00:50:39]</a>. While vertical specialization can offer a better user experience, this thesis often overestimates the benefits and underestimates the advantages of scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:58">[00:50:58]</a>.

Unbundling works effectively when:
*   **High Frequency or High Order Value**: The sub-segment is intrinsically high-frequency or high-dollar value, leading to a high customer LTV that outcompetes horizontal platforms (e.g., Airbnb unbundling from Craigslist due to massive high-value transactions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:02">[00:52:02]</a>.
*   **Self-Contained Network**: There's a "somewhat self-contained" network that doesn't significantly benefit from the broader network, and where users prefer a specialized platform (e.g., blue-collar professional networks like Workrise) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:37">[00:52:37]</a>.

Otherwise, horizontal marketplaces often win due to their ability to upsell customers across many categories and their stronger network effects, making them harder to compete against <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:46">[00:51:46]</a>.

## The Future of Marketplaces

Marketplaces are evolving towards charging higher commissions by taking on more "work" in the value chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:09">[00:59:09]</a>.
*   **Marketplace 1.0 (Lead Gen)**: Low commission, primarily aggregating demand (e.g., Zillow, HomeAdvisor) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:16">[00:59:16]</a>.
*   **Managed Marketplaces (Trust)**: Higher commission, building trust and safety into transactions (e.g., Airbnb, Etsy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:26">[00:59:26]</a>.
*   **Heavily Managed Marketplaces (Value Chain Integration)**: Even higher commission, taking on significant operational roles like logistics (DoorDash, Instacart) or underwriting transactions (Fair) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:50">[00:59:50]</a>.

This evolution raises the question of when a marketplace will "tend towards evolving out of the marketplace model altogether" and become an e-commerce or vertically integrated business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:30">[01:00:30]</a>. This happens when the company "owns the supply" or when there's no longer a direct transaction between an independent supply and demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:27">[01:02:27]</a>. OpenDoor, for example, is an e-commerce site for houses, not a marketplace, as they buy the houses directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:48">[01:00:48]</a>.

The key variable determining this consolidation is the **level of creativity needed in the space** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:10">[01:01:10]</a>:
*   If customers prioritize **commoditization** and consistent experiences (e.g., ride-sharing where a clean car on time is key), the industry will likely consolidate away from a marketplace model, especially with advancements like autonomous vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:20">[01:01:20]</a>.
*   If customers value **supplier creativity** and unique offerings (e.g., Etsy, Amazon, Fair, Steam for video games), then marketplaces will likely remain the dominant model, as large companies struggle to replicate this independent innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:49">[01:01:49]</a>.

## [[b2b_growth_strategies | B2B Marketplaces]]

While there are fewer [[b2b_growth_strategies | B2B marketplaces]] compared to consumer ones, their number is expected to rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:07">[00:55:07]</a>. The primary challenge for [[b2b_growth_strategies | B2B marketplaces]] is often a lack of **fragmentation** in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:05">[00:56:05]</a>.
*   **Fragmentation** is a measure of how many businesses exist relative to the transaction volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:47">[00:56:47]</a>.
*   In **low fragmentation** markets (e.g., few large suppliers doing most of the volume), these dominant players have less need for a marketplace, possess their own sales teams, and are less willing to pay high commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:01">[00:57:01]</a>. They are also more likely to disintermediate, going around the marketplace, especially if the commission dollars per transaction are high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:20">[00:57:20]</a>.
*   For a marketplace to work, it must bring enough value to justify its cut and prevent direct transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:30">[00:58:30]</a>.

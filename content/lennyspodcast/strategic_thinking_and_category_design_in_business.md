Jag Duggal, Chief Product Officer at [[Nubank]], emphasizes the critical role of [[The Importance of Strategy and DecisionMaking in Product Leadership | strategy]] and [[Inventiveness and innovation in business | innovation]] in achieving extraordinary business success. He highlights that successful companies are typically in the business of being "fundamentally different" rather than "incrementally better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.

## NuBank's Success Story

[[Nubank]] stands as a testament to this philosophy, demonstrating remarkable growth:
*   It is larger than Coinbase, Robinhood, Affirm, Sofi, and Lemonade combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
*   80% to 90% of its growth is driven by word-of-mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.
*   It has more customers than Bank of America, despite operating only in three Latin American countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
*   [[Nubank]] once held the Guinness World Record for the world's largest simultaneous unboxing for a credit card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>, and later set a new record for the first underwater credit card transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

This success is rooted in an obsession with building products that customers "love fanatically" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

## Defining Strategy

Jag Duggal argues that strategy is often misunderstood in the tech world, where there's a "counterveiling dogma... that strategy is easy and execution is everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:11">[00:44:11]</a>. He counters this by stating that great execution with a poor strategy is a waste of time, as it's "multiplied by zero" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:42">[00:44:42]</a>.

Drawing on Richard Rumelt's work (author of "Good Strategy Bad Strategy" and "The Crux"), Duggal clarifies what strategy *isn't*:
*   It's not an ambitious goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:07">[00:46:07]</a>.
*   It's not an aspiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:09">[00:46:09]</a>.
*   It's not a set of financial outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:12">[00:46:12]</a>.
*   It's not a broad, vague aspiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:39">[00:46:39]</a>.

Instead, strategy is defined as "a coherent plan for how you're going to apply your strengths in a leveraged way against a core important problem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:19">[00:46:19]</a>. A key component of good strategy is being "very clear" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:40">[00:45:40]</a>, even if it's not perfectly right, as this allows for clearer course correction when going off track <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:30">[00:45:30]</a>.

For [[Nubank]], their initial strategy was specific: target "Millennial middle class Urban Brazilians who hated paying credit card fees" and couldn't get credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:57">[00:46:57]</a>. Their solution was a no-fee credit card, made possible by a branchless and digital model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:22">[00:47:22]</a>. This specific problem, customer segment, solution, and advantage formed a coherent strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:27">[00:47:27]</a>.

## Developing and Operationalizing Strategy

### Culture and Values
[[Nubank]]'s culture is deeply ingrained with five core values, with the first being: "We want our customers to love us fanatically" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. This means always biasing decisions in favor of the customer's love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

Other values include:
*   We are hungry and we challenge the status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.
*   We build strong and diverse teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.
*   We pursue smart efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.
*   We think and act like owners, not renters â€“ doing what is right even when not told <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.

### Product Development Process
To ensure customer fanaticism, [[Nubank]] integrates strategic thinking into its product development:
*   **Customer Discovery**: Focus on deep pain points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a> and [[Inventiveness and innovation in business | innovating]] on customer needs, observing them to find unarticulated pain points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.
*   **Amazon Mock Press Release Technique**: Before engineering, teams write a press release explaining why the *intended customer* should care about the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>.
*   **Product and Design Reviews**: These reviews constantly ask: "Why is this great for the customer? Why is this fundamentally different for the customer?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.
*   **Measuring Success**:
    *   **Sean Ellis Score**: Products are rarely scaled until they hit a "Sean Ellis Score" of 50% "very disappointed" (adjusted from the standard 40% due to Brazilian cultural politeness) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>. This measures product-market fit.
    *   **Net Promoter Score (NPS)**: [[Nubank]] targets world-beating NPS scores, maniacally tracking and iterating if scores dip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>.
    *   **Churn**: Low churn is crucial for word-of-mouth growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>.

### Key Practices for [[Advice for improving strategic thinking in product managers | Product Managers]]
*   **Prioritize Customer Feedback**: Instead of extensive surveys, PMs are encouraged to directly call 10 customers from key segments to understand their needs and reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:28">[00:26:28]</a>. This prioritizes anecdotes over pure data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:30">[00:35:30]</a>.
*   **Formulate Clear Hypotheses**: Before research, teams must articulate a "super crisp" hypothesis to guide data collection and interpretation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:07">[00:36:07]</a>.
*   **Avoid "Lawyering" for Hypotheses**: Don't fall in love with your own hypothesis; act as a judge, not a lawyer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:41">[00:36:41]</a>.
*   **Observe More Than Ask**: In research, prioritize observing customer behavior and asking indirect questions over direct ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:08">[00:37:08]</a>.
*   **Push Back Against Pressure**: PMs, as "owners," are expected to tell senior leaders when a product isn't working or isn't ready to scale, even if it's inconvenient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:30">[00:31:30]</a>.

## Category Design and Product Line Expansion

[[Nubank]] believes in [[Developing and implementing product strategy | designing its own category]] rather than incrementally improving existing ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:10">[00:54:10]</a>. This requires making "concentrated bets" rather than hedging, especially for startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:39">[00:48:39]</a>.

[[Nubank]]'s [[developing_and_implementing_product_strategy | product line expansion]] strategy has been to move from a Brazilian credit card company to a full-solution Latin American bank, then to a global, "fundamentally different" banking experience. This involved:
*   Launching a bank account, lending, investments, and insurance products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:28">[00:58:28]</a>.
*   Expanding internationally into Mexico and Colombia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:03">[00:59:03]</a>.
*   Moving beyond financial services, with an e-commerce marketplace within the app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:25">[00:59:25]</a>.
*   Envisioning a future of banking leveraging social technologies, self-driving automation, and AI to create a "personal banker" for everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:49">[00:59:49]</a>.

This expansion is guided by a strong hypothesis that traditional banking artifacts, like the joint bank account (invented in the late 19th/early 20th century) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:37">[00:39:37]</a>, are not suited for the modern customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:24">[00:40:24]</a>. The aim is to make managing financial lives "exponentially easier" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:24">[01:07:24]</a> through automation and insights, addressing the "harshly unoptimized financial lives" people lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:49">[01:07:49]</a>.

## The Future: AI-Native Banking
[[Nubank]] is exploring what it means to build "AI-native products" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:39">[01:10:39]</a>, rather than just appending AI to existing features. The goal is to design products from the ground up with AI at their core, creating a completely different experience where a "private banker" is accessible to everyone, regardless of income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:13">[01:12:13]</a>. This vision aims to reinvent banking and potentially emerge from Latin America rather than traditional financial hubs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:09">[01:09:09]</a>.

## Key Takeaways
1.  **Perseverance and Clarity**: Be clear about what you want to achieve and be willing to fight for it, while remaining open to market feedback and knowing when to let go or pivot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:43">[01:20:43]</a>.
2.  **Disruptive Innovation**: As an insurgent, you cannot fight on the incumbent's ground. Search hard for what is "fundamentally different" to break through the noise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:34">[01:21:34]</a>. "Incrementally better" isn't enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:04">[01:22:04]</a>.
3.  **Live a Fundamentally Different Life**: This philosophy extends beyond business; don't just check boxes of others' expectations, but strive to build the life you truly want <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:56">[01:27:56]</a>.

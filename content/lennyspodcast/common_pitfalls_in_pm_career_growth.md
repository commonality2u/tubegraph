## Common Pitfalls in PM Career Growth

Career growth in product management can stall due to specific mindset shifts and behavioral patterns. Understanding and addressing these pitfalls is crucial for continuous advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:33">[00:27:33]</a>.

### Focusing on Uncontrollable Factors

Early in a Product Manager's (PM) career, there's often an obsession with personal feedback, learning, and growth, focusing on what they can directly control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:15">[00:28:15]</a>. However, as PMs become mid-senior, conversations can shift to external factors like organizational shortcomings or stakeholder behaviors, or a lack of desired projects, which are outside their direct influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:45">[00:28:45]</a>.

To avoid this pitfall, it's vital to maintain focus on what is within one's control, irrespective of career stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:08">[00:29:08]</a>. This includes areas like:
*   What you produce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:35">[00:29:35]</a>
*   What you bring to the table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:37">[00:29:37]</a>
*   Your operating model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:39">[00:29:39]</a>

There is ample opportunity to develop skills in data, technology, communication, collaboration, design, research, strategy, and community building, which can sustain growth for years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:42">[00:29:42]</a>.

### Stagnating Relationship with Change

The rate of skill development and career growth is typically very high for junior PMs, as they rapidly acquire new abilities in areas like experimentation, analysis, and stakeholder engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:07">[00:30:07]</a>. This high rate of change correlates with a high rate of growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:22">[00:30:22]</a>.

However, at mid-senior levels, PMs might become hesitant to take on new products or challenges, fearing negative impacts on their [[career_advancement_strategies | career advancement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:28">[00:30:28]</a>. This caution can slow down their rate of change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:41">[00:30:41]</a>.

To counteract this, PMs should constantly seek ways to increase their rate of change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:46">[00:30:46]</a>. This can be achieved by:
*   Benchmarking skills against the best in the industry, rather than just within their organization, to identify areas for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:09">[00:31:09]</a>.
*   Exploring new functions or teams to broaden their perspective and skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:27">[00:31:27]</a>.
*   Prioritizing which skills to develop for maximum leverage, especially if starting from a position of weakness in a particular area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:07">[00:39:07]</a>. For those transitioning into product, picking a core skill like data/tech or design/research based on their existing background can provide significant leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:22">[00:41:22]</a>.

### The Stories You Tell Yourself

A significant limiter for career growth, particularly at mid-senior levels, is a PM's self-perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a>. Categorizing oneself as a "high agency PM" or a "hyper collaborative PM" can inadvertently lead to "anti-signaling" behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:36">[00:32:36]</a>. For example:
*   A "high agency" PM might excuse being brash, cutting corners, or appearing rude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:39">[00:32:39]</a>.
*   A "hyper collaborative" PM might rationalize indecisiveness or slow movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:56">[00:32:56]</a>.

These self-told stories can fundamentally define behavior and make it difficult to correct through frameworks or structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:13">[00:33:13]</a>. To overcome this, it's essential to:
*   Identify these internal narratives, potentially by discussing with trusted individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:26">[00:33:26]</a>.
*   Correct these stories to align with desired growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:33">[00:33:33]</a>. For instance, shifting from "high agency" to "mindful agency" can encourage more context-aware and effective behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:37">[00:36:37]</a>.
*   Embrace a "learner" mindset. Constantly engaging with people smarter than oneself, reading, or consuming educational content can foster humility and a desire for continuous improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:28">[00:35:28]</a>. This approach turns potential discouragement from observing highly skilled peers into motivation for personal [[career_growth_and_strategic_positioning | career growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:38">[00:37:38]</a>.

### Lack of Clear Definition for the Product Manager Role

The ambiguity surrounding the PM role itself can pose a significant challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:31">[00:46:31]</a>. With varying definitions across companies and even within different teams of the same company, PMs and their stakeholders can be confused about expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:20">[00:47:20]</a>.

A guiding principle to overcome this is: If something is blocking product progress, the PM should work on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:06">[00:48:06]</a>. Product management is both an art and a science, improving with practice and structured learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:09">[00:49:09]</a>.

Instead of seeking a rigid definition, PMs should focus on their tangible contributions, particularly across core axes such as:
*   Data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:31">[00:49:31]</a>
*   Design and Research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:36">[00:49:36]</a>
*   Technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:41">[00:49:41]</a>
*   Strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:44">[00:49:44]</a>
*   Communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:04">[00:52:04]</a>
*   Collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:06">[00:52:06]</a>
*   Organizational skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:08">[00:52:08]</a>
*   Community skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:10">[00:52:10]</a> (being a "community enabler" within the team and organization, especially for remote or distributed teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:26">[00:52:26]</a>).

PMs are unique in their role as co-collaborators for all these disciplines, providing a holistic insight that no one else on the team possesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:06">[00:50:06]</a>. By embracing this "glue work" and focusing on their role, rather than just their title, PMs can clarify their contribution and drive progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:20">[00:51:20]</a>.

### Intent vs. Action

Relying solely on good intentions without ensuring actions and communication align can hinder a PM's effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:34">[00:57:34]</a>. The way PMs communicate and collaborate must clearly demonstrate who they are and their capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:37">[00:57:37]</a>.

### Underestimating the Value of Effort and Hours

There is a growing, "politically incorrect" notion that significant effort and long hours are not necessary for [[career_growth_framework_for_product_managers | career growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:16">[00:58:16]</a>. However, putting in consistent effort and time is crucial for personal and professional development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:38">[00:58:38]</a>. It's about finding a balance, avoiding extreme workaholism while still being serious about personal growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:51">[00:58:51]</a>.

## The Genesis of Homework for Life

"Homework for Life" (HFL) is a practice developed about 15 years ago to ensure a continuous supply of stories for public speaking engagements, countering the common storyteller's dilemma of repeating the same few narratives [01:06:07]. The initial motivation was a fear of running out of unique stories, leading to the decision to assign daily "homework" [01:14:02]. This practice aims to identify one moment from each day that would be worth telling as a story [01:07:37].

## How to Implement Homework for Life

### The Daily Practice
The core of Homework for Life involves reflecting on each day and identifying a single moment worthy of being a story, even if it doesn't immediately seem impactful [01:07:40]. This moment should be something that touches your heart or mind [01:16:23]. A guiding prompt can be: "If someone kidnapped my family and said you can't have him back until you stand on a stage and tell a story about something that happened today, what would you tell?" [01:09:51].

### Tools and Format
The practice began with a simple Excel spreadsheet, featuring two columns: one for the date and a wider second column to write down the chosen moment, typically the length of a computer screen [01:07:49]. While originally a nightly reflection, moments can also be recorded throughout the day using a laptop or phone, especially for capturing dialogue or stray thoughts [01:10:05]. When noting down memories from the past, it's helpful to mark them (e.g., "Memory") to avoid confusion about their occurrence [01:18:31].

### Evolution of Observation
Initially, the goal was to find one new story moment per month [01:08:00]. However, consistently engaging in HFL develops a "lens for [[techniques_for_better_storytelling | storytelling]]" [01:08:34]. This improves one's ability to identify and remember moments, significantly increasing the number of observations. For instance, in the first year, an average of 1.8 moments were found per day, which increased to 7.6 moments per day after more than 12 years of practice [01:08:52]. This improvement isn't due to life becoming more interesting, but rather to a better understanding of what to look for and what is worth remembering [01:08:57]. Not every recorded moment will become a full story; approximately 10% do, but the remaining 90% are still valuable for holding onto the details of one's days [01:10:31].

## Benefits of Building a Personal Story Bank

### An Abundance of Stories
The primary outcome of Homework for Life is an endless supply of story material [01:09:04]. This means that individuals, like the factory owner Boris, can consistently have new stories to tell and deploy in various contexts, including business applications [01:09:07]. This helps prevent the mediocrity of being "forgettable" in communication by providing rich, personal content [00:34:46].

### Slowing Down Time
One of the therapeutic elements of HFL is its ability to combat the feeling that "time flies" [01:19:19]. By consciously recording daily moments, you are actively "accounting for each day" [01:09:41], rather than losing them to forgetfulness. This process helps to recover and stretch out perceived time, making life feel less fleeting [01:11:41].

### Uncovering Life Patterns
HFL can reveal patterns in your life that might otherwise go unnoticed [01:12:08]. By recording daily interactions and feelings, individuals can identify recurring behaviors or underlying dynamics in their relationships [01:13:31]. For example, a personal discovery of "fighting with my wife on my own" by expressing anger through chores emerged from tracking daily moments [01:13:37].

### Recovering Past Memories
As you develop the "lens" of [[techniques_for_better_storytelling | storytelling]], your brain begins to connect current observations to past experiences [01:10:54]. For instance, witnessing a student gain confidence might trigger memories of other students or personal moments related to confidence issues [01:11:04]. This process allows for the recovery of forgotten days and adds them to your growing story bank [01:11:15]. This is a form of [[practical_exercises_for_selfdiscovery_and_accountability | self-discovery and accountability]].

## Getting Started

### Commitment and Consistency
To succeed with Homework for Life, it requires a daily commitment [01:15:54]. Even on days where "the best you have is a click out," it's crucial to write it down [01:15:56]. In the beginning, it might feel difficult, and you might not immediately identify profound moments, but consistency will lead to improvement over time [01:16:11].

### The Role of Practice and Listening
Once you begin building your story bank, it's important to practice telling these stories [01:16:50]. This also requires finding people who are willing to listen, as active listening is a valuable, yet uncommon, skill [01:16:38]. Your initial stories may not be perfect, but the act of [[techniques_for_better_storytelling | storytelling]] is about making strategic and tactical decisions before speaking, which improves with practice [01:17:12]. Ultimately, the goal is to be entertaining, as people will not listen if they are not entertained [01:17:40].

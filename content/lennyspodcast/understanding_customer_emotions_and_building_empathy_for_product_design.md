Linear, a B2B SaaS product, has gained a reputation for being beloved, beautifully designed, and fast-growing, with users often wishing they could switch to it from other tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>. Its success is attributed to its focus on user experience and a deep [[the_role_of_empathy_and_user_insights_in_product_management | understanding and identifying user needs]]. Nonan You, Head of Product at Linear, shares insights into how the company cultivates this user-centric approach, emphasizing the crucial role of [[using_empathy_as_a_communication_strategy | empathy]] in product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>.

## The Core Philosophy: Understanding Needs Through Emotion

Linear's approach to product development is deeply rooted in [[the_role_of_empathy_and_user_insights_in_product_management | understanding and identifying user needs]], particularly their emotional states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>. Nonan emphasizes that in competitive industries, obvious goal-oriented features are already built, requiring product teams to look for less apparent angles, such as emotional hooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>.

### Nonan's Approach to Customer Calls
When interacting with customers, Nonan's goal is to "feel bad in the same way that customers feel bad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>. This means digging beyond stated feature requests to uncover the underlying emotional valence motivating their needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>. By continuously asking questions and listening, a product manager can gain the customer's perspective, leading them to open up about their real pain points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>.

*   **Example**: A user who felt bad about missed marketing deadlines due to false precision in project dates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>. Instead of asking for a specific date format, the underlying emotion was the fear of miscommunication and the resulting negative feeling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>. Linear solved this by allowing flexible target dates (e.g., "Q4 project") so users don't have to promise false precision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>.

### "Schle Blindness" and Unarticulated Problems
People often become accustomed to the "schle" (Yiddish for schlepp, meaning tedious work) in their daily routines, becoming "schle blindness" to the annoyances they experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>. This is an opportunity for product teams to identify and solve problems that users might not even articulate as solvable by a tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>.

*   **Example**: Linear's triage management feature automates the process of routing issues to the correct teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>. This addresses feelings of being "underwater" from manual routing or "out of control" when tickets fall into "holes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>. The automation resolves the root cause of these widespread negative feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>.

## Prioritizing User Experience: Avoiding Bloat
A common criticism for enterprise software is that it becomes bloated over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>. Linear explicitly avoids this by having a clear policy on feature requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>.

### The "No" Policy for Customization
Linear explicitly says "no" to customization features requested by middle managers for easier reporting, especially if they make the Individual Contributor (IC) workflow worse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>. This is considered a "core promise" of Linear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.

### Aligning Incentives for Individual Contributors
The rationale behind this policy is that if the IC user experience is poor, they will disengage, leading to inaccurate or sparse data and undermining the reporting goals of managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>. By prioritizing the IC's day-to-day workflow, Linear ensures the data is naturally and accurately captured, making reporting more reliable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. This addresses misaligned incentives between different user groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>.

*   **Example**: Linear's "customer requests" feature addressed the need for tracking customer-specific feature requests without adding manual custom fields that would burden ICs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>. Instead, it integrates with support tools and CRMs to automatically tag requests with customer information, reducing manual effort for ICs and providing better context for engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>. This is an example of [[integrating_customer_feedback_into_product_development | integrating customer feedback into product development]] in a user-centric way.

## Building Product by Understanding Reality

### The Mental Model of the User
Product development at Linear involves continually informing a "mental model" of what the customer needs in their life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>. This is achieved by tying feature requests back to specific, real people and their workflows, not hypothetical users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>.

Linear maintains a backlog of 20-30 "opportunities" – problems to solve or areas to improve – rather than fully defined features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>. They continuously accumulate understanding around these, periodically re-evaluating their current understanding and potential approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>.

*   **Example**: Capacity planning for managers has been an opportunity in their backlog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>. While existing solutions are often poor (e.g., custom spreadsheets), Linear has ideas for automation based on existing data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>. They continue to gather nuances by talking to users struggling with the problem, informing their mental model until an elegant solution that Linear can realistically tackle emerges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19:00">[05:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>. This iterative approach is a key part of [[the_integration_of_user_research_in_product_development | integrating user research in product development]].

## Product as a Teacher: Instilling Best Practices
B2B software not only solves problems but also teaches users "how to work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:00">[05:29:00]</a>. When a company adopts a tool, they are adopting the practices and underlying ideas embedded within it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a>. This means software comes "equipped with a tool" that embodies "the right practices" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>. Buyers are essentially bringing a "baseline level of... competency" into their organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>.

Linear's opinionated approach to design stems from finding "actual consensus amongst a lot of different high-performing teams" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>. They then automate these best practices into a "button" that other companies can adopt, even if they don't yet realize they need it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>. This aligns with [[philosophy_of_product_design_and_human_potential | the philosophy of product design and human potential]] by enabling users to operate at a higher level.

### Summary of Key Principles
Nonan You's insights into building beloved products like Linear highlight several key principles:

1.  **Iterate Rapidly**: Get initial, workable solutions out quickly (within 10% of allotted time) to internal users and then expanding beta groups to get early, directional feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:00">[09:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:44:00">[09:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:21:00">[10:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:26:00">[10:26:00]</a>. This validates assumptions early and prevents wasted time on features nobody wants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:00">[10:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:20:00">[10:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:22:00">[10:22:00]</a>.
2.  **Prioritize the IC**: Explicitly prioritize the experience of individual contributors over middle managers' requests for customization and reporting, especially when incentives are misaligned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>.
3.  **Deeply Understand User Problems**: Get to the specific emotional pain points of individual users rather than just accepting generalized feature requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>. This is central to [[understanding_and_identifying_user_needs | understanding and identifying user needs]].
4.  **Explore Extremes for Creativity**: To foster creativity and break past mental constraints, consider the most extreme versions of a product design along specific traits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:00">[04:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:00">[04:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:00">[04:38:00]</a>. Building and testing these extremes can quickly reveal what works and what doesn't, guiding towards the optimal solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:00">[05:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a>. This is a practical method for [[crafting_a_compelling_product_vision | crafting a compelling product vision]].
5.  **Product Marketing as a PM Responsibility**: Product Managers should be heavily involved in the "go-to-market" side, collaborating closely with sales and marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:00">[05:55:00]</a>. This includes originating the messaging and language used for the product, given their deep understanding of the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:19">[01:03:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:22">[01:03:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:36">[01:03:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:42">[01:03:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:45">[01:03:45]</a>. This is key to effective [[using_qualitative_feedback_for_product_development | qualitative feedback for product development]].

By embracing these principles, Linear has built a product that not only solves problems but deeply resonates with its users, fostering loyalty and driving rapid growth.

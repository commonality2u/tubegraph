Category design, in the context of product development, involves creating offerings that are [[philosophical_approach_to_product_development | fundamentally different]] rather than incrementally better than existing solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. This approach aims to establish a new market category that an insurgent company can define and dominate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:55">[00:56:55]</a>.

## NuBank's Approach to Category Design

NuBank's success is attributed to its commitment to being [[philosophical_approach_to_product_development | fundamentally different]] and its unique approach to [[building_customercentric_products_through_design | building customer-centric products]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

### Addressing Deep Pain Points
NuBank tapped into a deep pain point in the Brazilian banking sector, where large incumbent banks were highly profitable but also widely disliked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. This resentment stemmed from experiences like excessive fees, rigid processes, and lack of access to credit for specific demographics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:06">[00:47:06]</a>. By offering a no-fee credit card and later a branchless digital bank, NuBank redefined the banking experience in Latin America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:15">[00:47:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:43">[00:54:43]</a>.

### Cultural Intent: Fanatical Love
A core value at NuBank, deeply ingrained in its employees, is the desire for customers to "love us fanatically" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. This intent guides [[decision_making_in_product_management | decision-making]], biasing choices in favor of customer love and word-of-mouth growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

### Strategic Clarity and Concentration
Jag Dugall emphasizes that strategy is not merely an ambitious goal or financial outcome, but a coherent plan for applying strengths to a core problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:15">[00:46:15]</a>. As [[Kevin Cyrm | Kevin Cyrm]] from Instagram once said, "we may not be right but at least we are clear" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:18">[00:45:18]</a>. This clarity allows for rapid assessment of whether focused bets are working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:27">[00:48:27]</a>. For startups, concentration of bets is crucial for building wealth, unlike diversification which preserves it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:39">[00:48:39]</a>.

### Disruptive Vectors
NuBank's strategy involved defining a new category by:
*   **Branchless Banking:** Leveraging the rise of smartphones in Brazil and Latin America to offer a bank in customers' pockets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:43">[00:54:43]</a>.
*   **Digital Cost Structure:** Enabling disruptive pricing by operating digitally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:08">[00:55:08]</a>.
*   **Credit First Approach:** Unlike other regions that started with bank accounts, NuBank began with credit, a harder and riskier product, demonstrating a truly [[philosophical_approach_to_product_development | fundamentally different]] approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:28">[00:55:28]</a>.

## The "Fundamentally Different" Mantra
At NuBank, the mantra "we're not trying to be incrementally better, we are trying to be [[philosophical_approach_to_product_development | fundamentally different]]" is a guiding principle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:12">[00:50:12]</a>. While not every feature launch can be revolutionary, the company constantly seeks "anchors" that are [[philosophical_approach_to_product_development | fundamentally different]] to build around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:58">[00:52:58]</a>. This approach believes that only [[philosophical_approach_to_product_development | fundamentally different]] experiences drive customers to fanatically tell their friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:40">[00:52:40]</a>.

## Measuring Success of New Categories
To ensure a product is truly loved, NuBank uses the Sean Ellis score, particularly before scaling a project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:35">[00:30:35]</a>.
*   **Sean Ellis Score**: Customers are asked, "how disappointed would you be if this product went away?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>.
*   **Threshold**: Sean Ellis suggests a 40% "very disappointed" response for product-market fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>. Due to cultural politeness in Brazil, NuBank raises this threshold to 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>.
*   **Operationalization**: This metric acts as a gate; products generally aren't scaled unless they meet this high bar, ensuring that only products with strong customer love are expanded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:18:57]</a>. This prevents scaling "small problems" into "big messes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:43">[00:29:43]</a>.

Other metrics like NPS (Net Promoter Score) and churn are also obsessively tracked post-launch to ensure customer retention and fuel viral growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:59">[00:17:59]</a>.

## Perspectives on Category Design
The discussion around category design often creates a debate: should companies create new categories or enter existing ones?
*   **Pro-Category Design**: Jag Dugall asserts that successful companies, at a company level, are typically in the new category business, citing Google, Netflix, and Salesforce as examples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:10">[00:54:10]</a>. For an insurgent, it's essential to find a disruptive vector rather than fighting incumbents on their established ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:34">[01:21:34]</a>.
*   **Against Category Design (or nuanced approach)**: Some argue for entering categories where customers are already spending money, which has its own robust logic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:54">[00:53:54]</a>.
*   **Synthesis**: Even when entering an existing market, the mindset should be to reinvent the category, not just to be incrementally better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:09">[00:57:09]</a>.

Key thinkers in strategy and category design include:
*   [[philosophical_approach_to_product_development | Richard Rumelt]] (author of "Good Strategy Bad Strategy" and "The Crux") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:47">[00:45:47]</a>.
*   [[product_management_methodologies | Christopher Lockhead]] (author of "Play to Win") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:37">[00:49:37]</a>.
*   Roger Martin (author of "Where to Play How to Win") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:47">[00:49:47]</a>.

## Future Vision: AI-Native Banking as a New Category
NuBank envisions the next phase of its growth by creating a new category of banking: a "personal banker" for everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:02">[01:00:02]</a>.
*   **Holistic Solution**: Providing a full solution across all "financial seasons" of life – spending, saving, investing, borrowing, and protecting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:30">[01:04:30]</a>.
*   **Global Bank on a Single Codebase**: Aiming to build the first global bank on a unified technology infrastructure to leverage scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:15">[01:05:15]</a>.
*   **Social Mechanics and Self-Driving Automation**: Integrating social aspects of financial life (e.g., sharing savings goals) and automating financial tasks (e.g., bill payments, savings) to make financial lives "exponentially easier" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:39">[01:06:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:20">[01:07:20]</a>.
*   **AI-Native Products**: Leveraging AI not just as an add-on, but at the heart of the product, designing as if these tools existed from the start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:16">[01:11:16]</a>. This aims to democratize access to sophisticated financial guidance, currently only available to the wealthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:06">[01:00:06]</a>. The belief is that the company that reinvents banking globally can come from places like São Paulo, Mexico City, or Bogotá <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:09">[01:09:09]</a>.

Ian McAllister, who spent 12 years at Amazon, including building Amazon Smile and leading the Alexa International team, notes that the [[Working Backwards Process at Amazon | working backwards process]] is central to how products are developed at the company. His early writings on this process on Quora became foundational for many product managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

## Core Principle: Problem Obsession

The essence of [[Working Backwards Process at Amazon | working backwards]] is starting with and obsessing over the customer's problem, allowing that problem to guide the solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:13">[00:47:13]</a>. It's about thinking: "What are we trying to accomplish for the business or accomplish for a customer?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:24">[00:50:24]</a>.

### Common Misconception and Mistakes

A frequent mistake in attempting to implement the [[Working Backwards Process at Amazon | working backwards process]] is starting with a solution and then retrofitting a problem or customer to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:22">[00:47:22]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:44">[00:47:44]</a>. If the concept is not grounded in a genuine customer problem, it isn't truly working backwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:37">[00:47:37]</a>.

*   **Symptom of doing it wrong:** When conversations focus on combining existing technologies or services ("we have these ingredients, we could put them together") rather than addressing a clear customer need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:30">[00:57:30]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a>.
*   **Example:** An early Amazon project, "ACIN to ACIN linking," was driven by an idea from Jeff Bezos to link products by subjective attributes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:28">[00:48:28]</a>. Despite enthusiasm, it wasn't successful because it originated from a technical concept rather than a customer problem, highlighting a "not working backwards idea" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:51">[00:48:51]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:01">[00:49:01]</a>.

### Core Components: Press Release and FAQ

The standard [[Working Backwards Process at Amazon | working backwards]] mechanism includes an internal press release and a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) document <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:43">[00:50:43]</a>.

*   **Press Release:** Begins with a paragraph outlining the problem, followed by the solution, and a customer quote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:57">[00:50:57]</a>. Jeff Bezos once highlighted the importance of the problem paragraph, stating, "if you don't have a problem paragraph, there's not really a problem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:56">[00:41:56]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:06">[00:42:06]</a>.
*   **FAQ:** Addresses the "legitimate plan to succeed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:05">[00:51:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:25">[00:56:25]</a>. This section demonstrates that the team has thought through internal components, finances, and key technical hurdles, earning trust and justifying resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:50">[00:56:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:56">[00:56:56]</a>.

This mechanism enforces a focus on customer problems and potential solutions, rather than just the announcement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:38">[00:51:38]</a>. While Amazon often enforces this process for significant new products, the core philosophy can be applied in various formats and is more about the "spirit of working backwards" than a rigid template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:06">[00:55:06]</a>.

## Leadership and Cultural Impact

Ian's experience at Amazon highlights how leadership reinforces the [[Working Backwards Process at Amazon | working backwards]] and other operational principles:

*   **Jeff Bezos:** Was highly encouraging and used the process to train team members. He emphasized that the "prerequisite for efficiency is knowing where you're going" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:25">[00:41:25]</a>. Bezos's criteria for investing in something new were: Is it a big idea? Is it something Amazon should be doing? Is there a legitimate plan to succeed? All three must be present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:05">[00:56:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:27">[00:56:27]</a>.
*   **Jeff Wilke (JAZ):** A "consummate operator" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:32">[00:42:32]</a> who fostered an operational mindset and rigor across the organization. His weekly business reviews (WBRs) were mechanisms that ingrained behaviors like continuous improvement and deep business understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:11">[00:44:11]</a>. This focus on operating existing products well also generated ideas for new features or improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:38">[00:44:38]</a>. Wilke also prioritized teaching the "why" behind decisions, helping leaders understand the mental models and patterns, fostering deeper learning and commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:47">[00:45:47]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:16">[00:46:16]</a>.

The culture of continuous learning, coupled with a structured approach like [[Working Backwards Process at Amazon | working backwards]], helped individuals like Ian to mold themselves to the environment and grow their product and leadership toolboxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:43">[00:38:43]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:12">[00:39:12]</a>.

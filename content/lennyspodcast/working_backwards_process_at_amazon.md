The "working backwards" process is a core methodology at [[Amazons leadership principles and culture | Amazon]] that emphasizes starting with the customer and working backward from their needs to develop a product or feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Ian McAllister, who spent 12 years at Amazon, describes it as a fundamental part of the company's approach to [[building_new_products_within_larger_companies | product development]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

## Core Principle: Obsess About the Problem

The essence of the working backwards process is to "obsess about the problem" that is being solved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:15">[00:47:15]</a>. It guides the journey towards the solution, ensuring that development is rooted in genuine customer needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:17">[00:47:17]</a>.

## Common Mistakes

A frequent error teams make when attempting to apply the working backwards process is failing to truly start with the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:22">[00:47:22]</a>. Instead, they often begin with a solution they want to build, then try to retroactively fit a problem to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:23">[00:47:23]</a>. This means they are not genuinely working backwards, but rather "retrofitting the problem" and the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:48">[00:47:48]</a>.

Ian McAllister recalls an early experience at Amazon where a project, *acin to acin linking*, had momentum due to an idea from Jeff Bezos, but it lacked a clear customer problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:13">[00:48:13]</a>. The project was not successful and was later shut down, teaching Ian a valuable lesson about the importance of truly working backwards rather than having a solution in mind first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:01">[00:49:01]</a>.

A common sign that a team is not working backwards effectively is when discussions focus on combining existing "ingredients" or technologies to make a new product, rather than addressing a compelling customer problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:24">[00:57:24]</a>.

## The Role of Press Release and FAQ

The "press release and FAQ" (PR/FAQ) document is a key mechanism [[Amazons leadership principles and culture | Amazon]] uses to enforce the working backwards principle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:06">[00:44:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:43">[00:50:43]</a>.
*   **Press Release**: This document begins with a paragraph clearly stating the problem, followed by the solution paragraph, and then a customer quote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:57">[00:50:57]</a>.
*   **FAQ**: The FAQ section addresses the "legitimate plan to succeed," outlining internal components, finances, or key technical hurdles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:04">[00:51:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:51">[00:55:51]</a>.

Jeff Bezos highlighted three criteria for investing in something new:
1.  Is it a big idea? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:10">[00:56:10]</a>
2.  Is it something [[Amazons leadership principles and culture | Amazon]] should be doing? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:12">[00:56:12]</a>
3.  Is there a legitimate plan to succeed? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:25">[00:56:25]</a>
The FAQ component of the working backwards process serves as an early-stage test for this third criterion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:29">[00:56:29]</a>.

While the PR/FAQ is an effective tool, the core concept of working backwards can be applied in various formats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:19">[00:51:19]</a>. The most important aspect is to avoid starting with "what we could build" and instead focus on the problem and the solution that addresses it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:27">[00:51:27]</a>.

## Learning from Leadership

Ian McAllister's experience at [[Amazons leadership principles and culture | Amazon]] provided direct insights into the working backwards process from leaders like Jeff Bezos and Jeff Wilke.

*   **Jeff Bezos**: Bezos was encouraging and taught Ian about the process during the development of Amazon Smile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:13">[00:41:13]</a>. He emphasized that the process "doesn't have to be efficient" if you don't yet know where you are going <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:30">[00:41:30]</a>. Bezos also highlighted the importance of a clear "problem paragraph" in a press release, stating that without one, there might not be a real problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:53">[00:41:53]</a>.
*   **Jeff Wilke**: Wilke, described as the "consummate operator," instilled a mindset of continuous improvement and operational rigor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:22">[00:43:22]</a>. His leadership of the Weekly Business Review (WBR) meetings pushed leaders to understand their metrics and businesses deeply, fostering a cascading effect of preparedness and insight throughout the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:41">[00:43:41]</a>. This operational mindset reinforces that being a product leader is not just about [[building_0_to_1_products_within_a_company | building new things]], but also about effectively running what has already been built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:36">[00:44:36]</a>.

## Application

The working backwards process, particularly the PR/FAQ mechanism, is highly beneficial for significant new product initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:40">[00:54:40]</a>. It provides a structured way to ensure a legitimate plan for success and to educate others about the customer problem and proposed solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:51">[00:55:51]</a>. Even without strict adherence to the Amazon-specific mechanism, the *spirit* of working backwards – starting with customer problems – is crucial for any product development effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:06">[00:55:06]</a>.

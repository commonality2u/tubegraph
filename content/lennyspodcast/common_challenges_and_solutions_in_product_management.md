Product management expert Melissa Perri has observed numerous product organizations across various industries, from high-growth SaaS companies to banks and pharmaceutical companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. Through her extensive experience, she identifies several [[challenges_and_frustrations_in_product_management | common problems]] faced by product teams and offers strategies to overcome them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Strategy Deployment and Goal Setting

Many organizations mistakenly believe their issues stem primarily from a lack of training for their people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. However, 99% of the time, the real problem lies in how goals are set and strategy is deployed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Training individuals without providing context on what to work towards proves ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. A holistic approach is necessary when transforming or setting up a product organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

### Signs of Missing or Undermined Strategy
*   **Overworked Teams, Stagnant Metrics:** Teams work excessive hours, constantly releasing features, but key business metrics remain unchanged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>. This leads executives to question the output and value of product and tech teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:08">[00:22:08]</a>.
*   **Lack of Executive Visibility:** Executives and board members express not knowing what's happening in tech or product, or if goals are being met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.
*   **Disconnected Work:** There's a "missing middle" where individual team efforts (e.g., feature enhancements, bug fixes) are not clearly connected to overarching business value, vision, or objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a>.
*   **Differing Understandings of Goals:** When asked, various leaders and teams provide different answers about the company's vision, objectives, or what "good" looks like <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:40">[00:23:40]</a>.
*   **Internal Infighting:** Stakeholders and executives have different, unaligned goals, leading to conflict rather than unified teamwork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:51">[00:28:51]</a>.
*   **Lack of "Why":** Product managers and teams frequently ask "why are we building this?" indicating a failure in leadership to clearly explain the purpose and objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:28">[00:28:28]</a>.
*   **Spreading Teams Too Thin:** Without clear priorities, teams are often spread across too many initiatives, diluting their impact on business metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>.

### Solutions for Effective Strategy
*   **Unified Narrative:** Every product team should be able to articulate what they are working on, why it's important, how it contributes to a specific initiative, the value it creates for customers, and its impact on business value and new market entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:54">[00:27:54]</a>.
*   **Executive Alignment:** Ensure all executives share the same goals for the company, fostering a culture where they work as one team with calm, objective trade-off discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:20">[00:29:20]</a>.
*   **Formalized Strategy Documentation:** Write down the strategy explicitly, even if it exists in people's heads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:04">[00:23:04]</a>.
    *   **Two-Pager Memo:** CEOs can write a two-page memo detailing:
        *   Company origin and current state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:39">[00:39:39]</a>.
        *   External market threats and competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:41">[00:24:41]</a>.
        *   What the company will and will not do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>.
        *   Prioritized strategic intents (big business movers for the next 2-3 years, e.g., market expansion, new innovation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:53">[00:24:53]</a>.
    *   **Layered Strategy:**
        *   **Executive Team:** Defines strategic intents at the business level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:35">[00:31:35]</a>.
        *   [[product_management_and_leadership_insights | Product Leadership]] (Directors, VPs, CPOs): Defines product initiatives, which are problem-oriented and often comprise multiple epics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:40">[00:31:40]</a>.
        *   **Product Teams:** Develop solutions (epics/options) to address product initiatives, contributing to strategic intents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a>.
    *   Documents should be linked, allowing a reader to trace connections all the way up the strategy tree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:44">[00:32:44]</a>.
*   **Clear Vision:** A vision should be:
    *   **Concrete:** People can clearly picture what it will be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:14">[00:36:14]</a>.
    *   **Lofty:** Far enough away that it's not a single-feature goal, requiring iteration and exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:37">[00:36:37]</a>.
    *   **Future-Oriented:** Not merely what the company is today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:52">[00:36:52]</a>.
    *   **Differentiating:** Explains how the company will be different and better than competitors, outlining winning strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:09">[00:37:09]</a>.
    *   **Decisive:** States what the company will *not* do or be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:16">[00:38:16]</a>.
*   **Visuals in Vision:** Combine written vision with visual elements like prototypes, diagrams, or customer interaction flows to enhance understanding and alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:46">[00:34:46]</a>.

## Product Leadership and Org Design

Scaling product organizations often requires strong [[coaching_and_leadership_in_product_management | leadership]].

### When to Hire a Chief Product Officer (CPO)
*   **Transition from Single to Multi-Product:** When a company moves from focusing on one product to managing a complex portfolio and scaling rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.
*   **Executive/Board Disconnect:** If executives and board members feel out of the loop on product and tech progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.
*   **Lack of Strategic Formulation & Deployment:** If there's no clear strategy being formulated at the top and deployed downwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>.
*   **Frustrated or Untrained PMs:** Product managers are frustrated by a lack of direction, or there are many junior PMs without clear training paths or processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.
*   **Hiring Difficulties:** Trouble attracting and retaining product managers can indicate a need for senior product leadership that can offer learning opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.
*   **Company Growth Milestones:** Around \$20-30 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR) for high-growth companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>.
*   **Increased Complexity:** Expanding into more complex portfolios, new geographies, or drastically new markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.
*   **Major Business Events:** Undergoing a major transformation, pivot, or merger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>.
*   **Scope and Span of Control:** A CPO typically oversees multiple functions beyond just product, such as design, product operations, analytics, and sometimes engineering, to bring all these areas together under one leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.

### Role of a CPO vs. VP/Head of Product
A VP or Head of Product is a functional leader, skilled at implementing smooth processes, compiling roadmaps, and training junior team members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>. The shift to an executive (CPO) role involves:
*   **Board and Financial Acumen:** Interfacing with the board, understanding financials deeply to create revenue projections from product strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>.
*   **Executive Navigation:** Confidently projecting to the board and acting as a strong executive navigator, aligning with other executives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>.
*   **Multi-Product/Platform Strategies:** Overseeing more complex multi-product or platform strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>.

### When to Bring in External Help (Consultants/Interim CPOs)
External consultants or interim CPOs are valuable when a CEO is unsure who to hire or if a product person is even needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>. They help diagnose [[challenges_and_responsibilities_in_product_management | problems]] and explain how a strong product partner can alleviate CEO responsibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>.

> "You can hire a consultant but if you don't listen to the consultant, nothing's going to change and that does happen more often than you think" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>.

*   **Temporary Gaps:** An interim CPO can keep a company on track, delivering and growing, while a full-time CPO is sought and onboarded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>.
*   **Information Gathering:** Interim roles or consultants can help gather background information on customers, strategy, and roadmaps, preparing the ground for a permanent leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>.
*   **Readiness for Change:** Companies must be ready to take action and embrace drastic changes, potentially involving organizational restructuring or hiring senior talent, for external help to be effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>.

## [[Product management skills and best practices | Improving Product Management Skills]]

### Getting Better at Strategy
*   **"Pretend You're the CPO":** Even without the formal role, imagine what you would do if you were the CPO. Ask questions, dig into data, and consider alternative approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:18">[00:39:18]</a>. This provides valuable practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:32">[00:39:32]</a>.
*   **Talk to Market and Financial Experts:** Engage with people who deeply understand the market and company financials, including your CPO. Ask about their process for setting priorities and what data they review <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:43">[00:39:43]</a>.
*   **Cross-Departmental Conversations:** Talk to other departments, like sales, to understand customer buying behaviors, win/loss analyses, and market insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:24">[00:40:24]</a>.
*   **Leverage Data:** Leaders need data from everywhere to set strategy. Hire data analysts or use internal data from financial systems and user analytics. This data, combined with customer research and company goals, informs strategic decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:06">[00:41:06]</a>.
*   **Make Decisions, Be Willing to Pivot:** Strategy involves making the best-informed decision possible at the time, even without 100% certainty. Be willing to re-evaluate and correct course if new information suggests a different direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:13">[00:42:13]</a>.
*   **Analyze Other Companies' Strategies:** Study how successful companies have developed and executed their strategies, noting that various frameworks can work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:22">[00:43:22]</a>.

### Managing Information Overload
*   **Prioritize Execution:** Focus on doing your job first. Learning comes most effectively from practical execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:34">[00:49:34]</a>.
*   **Self-Retrospective:** Regularly analyze your work: what's effective, what's not? Identify specific areas for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:40">[00:49:40]</a>.
*   **Deep Dive into Specific Gaps:** Once an area for improvement is identified (e.g., user research, data analytics), deep dive into that specific topic rather than trying to absorb all available information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:26">[00:50:26]</a>.
*   **Adapt Frameworks:** While basic product principles (talking to users, iterative development, measuring success) are consistent, frameworks and processes should be adapted to what works for your specific company and culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:14">[00:51:14]</a>. If a process doesn't serve you, change it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:43">[00:51:43]</a>.

## Product Operations

[[Product operations]] is an emerging role vital for scaling product management, addressing issues that arise when product management processes don't scale efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>.

### Core Functions of Product Operations
1.  **Internal Data and Insights:** Collects and surfaces internal data (financial systems, user analytics) in an accessible way to monitor strategy, track OKRs, and inform decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:34">[00:45:34]</a>.
2.  **Customer Research and User Insights:** Manages external data, market research, and standardizes customer research approaches. This ensures product managers can talk to customers without over-saturating specific individuals and that interviews are recorded and searchable for broader team use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:02">[00:46:02]</a>. The goal is to scale, not centralize, user research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:46">[00:46:46]</a>.
3.  **Process Standardization and Cadences:** Standardizes processes and meeting cadences that interact with other divisions (e.g., roadmap check-ins with sales, quarterly planning sessions with executives). This ensures consistency and efficient collaboration across the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:31">[00:47:31]</a>. However, it does not standardize internal team processes like stand-ups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:10">[00:48:10]</a>.

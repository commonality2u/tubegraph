The future of product development is being reshaped by the rise of AI, making AI synonymous with software itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:29">[01:29:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:31">[01:31:31]</a>. This shift empowers more individuals to participate in building software, fundamentally changing roles and required skill sets within product and engineering teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:32">[01:32:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:07">[02:07:07]</a>.

## Transformation of Roles

### Product Managers & Designers
Product managers and designers are becoming more "full-stack," capable of prototyping and even shipping products to production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:43">[00:23:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:09">[01:41:09]</a>. This [[empowering_engineers_in_leadership_roles | empowerment]] allows them to directly build and refine ideas, making conversations about products more concrete and interactive through "artifacts" like VZero links <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:28">[01:28:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:10">[01:34:10]</a>. This means a product manager can now build a live Product Requirements Document (PRD) that is interactive and animated, demonstrating various states of a product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:13">[03:41:13]</a>.

### Engineers
While many programming "jobs to be done" that were once specializations, particularly "translation tasks" (e.g., converting a Figma design into CSS), are diminishing due to AI's capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:19">[00:41:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:07">[02:07:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:11">[02:11:11]</a>. The core engineering skill of understanding "how things work under the hood" remains paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:45">[00:44:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:01">[02:01:01]</a>. AI models excel at following web standards and accessibility guidelines better than human engineers in certain translation tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:40">[02:40:40]</a>.

Instead of deep specialization in every technical detail, engineers will need to understand the underlying symbolic systems (like CSS or database concepts) to effectively "influence the model" and guide it to their desired outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:13">[02:13:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:30">[02:30:30]</a>. This means less depth in individual subjects but a broader understanding of how systems interoperate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:35">[02:33:35]</a>.

Engineers focused on "foundational infrastructure" — like building cloud platforms, frameworks, or compilers — will continue to be extremely valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:23">[03:23:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:32">[03:32:32]</a>. AI agents orchestrate existing tools and infrastructure; they don't build entire systems from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:28">[03:28:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:59">[03:59:59]</a>.

## Essential Skills for the Future

### 1. Understanding Fundamental Logic & Systems Thinking
Knowing how things work fundamentally, like the logic behind software, math, and the symbolic systems of programming languages (e.g., JavaScript), is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:23">[02:23:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:46">[02:44:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:19">[03:19:19]</a>. This allows individuals to effectively communicate with and steer AI tools.

### 2. Eloquence and Communication
Developing strong linguistic ability and eloquence is vital for effective prompting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:48">[02:48:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:51">[02:51:51]</a>. Knowing precise "tokens" or terms (e.g., "turbulence" for an animation effect, or "neo-brutalist" for a design style) enables better control and customization of AI outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:27">[02:27:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:47">[02:47:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:53">[02:53:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:55">[02:55:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:59">[02:59:59]</a>.

### 3. [[product_management_skills_and_best_practices | Developing Taste]] ("Exposure Hours")
Taste is a skill that can be developed through extensive exposure to products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:04">[01:04:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:08">[01:08:08]</a>. Increasing "exposure hours" by actively using many products and observing how users interact with products (both your own and others') helps build this "muscle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:14">[01:14:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:16">[01:16:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:18">[01:18:18]</a>. This practice also helps overcome the bias of thinking one's own products work perfectly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:18">[01:18:18]</a>.

### 4. Problem-Solving and "Getting Unstuck"
The ability to iterate and guide AI tools, even when they get "stuck," is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:07">[03:07:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:42">[03:42:42]</a>. This might involve trying different prompts, or leveraging "escape hatches" where the user can directly edit the generated code or even consult other AI tools to find solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:22">[04:22:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:40">[04:40:40]</a>. This aligns with the principle of "don't get blocked" in software development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:49">[04:49:49]</a>.

### 5. Sharing and Building an Audience
With the marginal cost of producing software decreasing, the ability to present what you've built, put yourself out there, and build an audience becomes increasingly important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:51">[02:51:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:55">[02:55:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:58">[02:58:58]</a>. Cultivating a "signature brand and style" will differentiate creators in a world where everyone can "cook" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:02">[03:02:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:05">[03:05:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:08">[03:08:08]</a>.

## A New [[building_a_productoriented_engineering_culture | Culture of Building]]
Companies like Vercel foster a culture where "everyone can ship" and build with AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:33">[03:33:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:54">[03:54:54]</a>. This means marketing, sales, and product management teams are actively creating functional products and demos using AI tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:59">[03:59:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:07">[04:07:07]</a>. This shift transforms individuals into powerful generalists, stepping out of traditional comfort zones to create <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:10">[04:10:10]</a>. The rapid feedback loop enabled by AI products, where user input constantly refines the model, makes it challenging for traditional software development to compete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:27">[04:27:27]</a>.

The vision is a future where "everybody can get their ideas out there. If you can dream it, you can ship it," leading to faster, higher-quality, and more robust digital experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:27">[04:27:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:29">[04:29:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:30">[04:30:30]</a>.

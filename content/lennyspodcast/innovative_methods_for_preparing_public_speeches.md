Tristan Deont Bello, co-creator of Ultra Speaking, offers a unique approach to [[strategies_for_public_speaking_and_reducing_stage_fright | public speaking]] that helps individuals quickly build skills and become more comfortable speaking, especially on the spot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. His methods delve into tactics and [[misconceptions_about_public_speaking | misconceptions about how to become a better speaker]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.

## Core Philosophy of Ultra Speaking

### Embrace Conversational Speaking
Many people adopt a "public speaking voice" that feels different and less natural than their normal conversational tone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Speaking conversationally is described as being "so much more freeing, powerful, connecting, and effective" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>. The cue often given is to "just think out loud" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:27">[01:18:27]</a>.

### Speaking as a Meta-Skill
Improving speaking is not just a specialized skill but a "meta skill," meaning that getting better at it improves many aspects of your life, including professional interactions, friendships, and family relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:00">[06:06:00]</a>. Humans are evolved to speak naturally, and much of the challenge comes from "bugs in the software" (bad habits and overthinking) acquired over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:17:00">[08:17:00]</a>. The goal is to "debug" and "upgrade" this software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:43:00">[08:43:00]</a>.

### Enjoyment as a Barometer
If you don't enjoy speaking, you might be doing it wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:13:00">[09:13:00]</a>. Since speaking is a naturally evolved human function, it should be rewarding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:00">[09:41:00]</a>. When speaking becomes unenjoyable, it's a sign of overthinking, and a need to relax and "feel a little bit more like myself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:14:00">[10:14:00]</a>. This also applies to practice; it must be enjoyable to be sustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:41:00">[11:41:00]</a>.

### Achieving a Subconscious Flow State
The biggest shift in approach is realizing that speaking is a "subconscious flow-oriented process" rather than a conscious one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:27:00">[12:27:00]</a>. When speaking best, one is not thinking about the act of speaking, but is "completely in tune with whatever it is I'm trying to convey" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:59:00">[12:59:00]</a>. This means focusing on root causes of speaking issues (e.g., struggling to slow down) rather than symptoms (e.g., filler words) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:32:00">[13:32:00]</a>.

## Practical Tactics for Improvement

### Look Up When Thinking
Instead of looking down when gathering thoughts, which can appear unconfident, try looking up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:31:00">[16:31:00]</a>. Looking up makes you appear thoughtful and confident, reducing the likelihood of interruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:04:00">[17:04:00]</a>.

### End Strong
People often "end weak" by slowing down or expressing doubts at the conclusion of their statements, much like freestyle rappers who lose flow at the end of a performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:05:00">[18:05:00]</a>. This leaves the audience with a negative impression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:03:00">[19:03:03]</a>. Anticipate this tendency and "land the plane" by consciously making your ending sound like an ending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:06:00">[20:06:00]</a>. Using "summary prompts" like "so to wrap up" or "in summary" can help the brain naturally conclude thoughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:25:00">[20:25:00]</a>.

### Stay in Character
Avoid "leaking" insecurities by verbalizing doubts or nervous laughter during a speech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:38:00">[22:38:00]</a>. The audience usually cannot perceive internal nervousness unless it's explicitly revealed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:18:00">[22:18:00]</a>. Maintaining a composed exterior, even when feeling uncertain, reinforces a confident image for the audience and builds self-confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:37:00">[24:37:00]</a>.

## Practice Through Games
Ultra Speaking emphasizes [[improving_public_speaking_through_interactive_exercises | interactive exercises]] and games as the primary means of practice, acknowledging that one "can't get better at speaking without speaking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:27:00">[29:27:00]</a>. Games are fun, provide intrinsic reward, and offer "short, deliberate practice" followed by immediate feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:06:00">[31:06:00]</a>. They create "turbulence" to highlight areas for improvement and build resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:13:00">[42:13:00]</a>.

### Conductor Game
The Conductor game involves speaking on a random topic while adjusting one's energy level to match a series of randomly appearing numbers (1-10) or pauses ("breathe") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:00:00">[35:00:00]</a>.
*   **Purpose:** To tap into different emotional states and energies, understanding that "energy leads, emotions follow, and words fill in the gap" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:37:00">[47:37:00]</a>. This helps speakers access different insights and stories based on their emotional state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:35:00">[44:35:00]</a>.
*   **Insight:** Players often discover whether they are more comfortable with high-energy or low-energy speaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:13:00">[49:13:00]</a>.

### Triple Step Game
In Triple Step, the speaker integrates randomly appearing words or phrases into an impromptu speech on a given topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:45:00">[51:45:00]</a>. The goal is to make the integration as seamless as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:07:00">[52:07:00]</a>.
*   **Purpose:** To build resiliency and maintain composure amidst distractions or unexpected elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:19:00">[55:19:00]</a>. It helps the speaker stay grounded in a clear direction while adapting to external inputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:41:00">[54:41:00]</a>.
*   **Warm-up:** This game is also useful as a warm-up for the brain before important meetings or presentations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:55:00">[55:55:00]</a>.

## Innovative Speech Preparation Methods

### The Accordion Method
The Accordion Method is a revolutionary way to [[crafting_compelling_presentations | prepare speeches]] by speaking rather than writing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:26">[01:26:26]</a>.
*   **The "Old Way" (Problems):** Traditional preparation involves dumping ideas, rearranging them, creating exhaustive scripts, and then painfully memorizing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:01">[01:25:01]</a>. Memorization is linear and fragile, prone to failure if one part is forgotten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:06">[01:26:06]</a>.
*   **The Method:**
    1.  Start by getting all ideas out, potentially on paper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:13">[01:28:13]</a>.
    2.  Set a timer (e.g., 3 minutes) and speak on the topic, adhering to "stay in character" and "end strong" rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:44">[01:28:44]</a>. The goal is to get ideas into spoken word <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:04">[01:29:04]</a>.
    3.  "Go down the accordion": Repeat the speech with progressively shorter time limits (e.g., 2 minutes, 1 minute, 30 seconds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:19">[01:29:19]</a>. This forces the speaker to cut out noise and focus on the essential core of the message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:33">[01:29:33]</a>.
    4.  "Go back up the accordion": Once the core message is clear (at 30 seconds), repeat the speech with increasing time limits (e.g., 1 minute, 2 minutes, 3 minutes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:06">[01:30:06]</a>. This allows for intentional expansion, adding supporting details and examples that align with the refined core message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:26">[01:30:26]</a>.
*   **Benefits:** The speech becomes "internalized" rather than memorized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:51">[01:30:51]</a>. This provides a deep sense of what the speech is about, allowing for flexibility across different time frames and resilience against mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:27">[01:31:27]</a>. It's applicable for both macro (entire talk) and micro (specific sections) levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:11">[01:36:11]</a>.

### The Bow and Arrow Technique
This technique offers an [[effective_communication_structures_for_speaking | effective communication structure]] by shifting focus from what the speaker wants to say to what the audience should remember <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:35">[01:38:35]</a>.
*   **The Arrow (One Thing):** Identify the single, most important sentence or idea that the audience should remember from the talk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:08">[01:39:08]</a>. This acts as a "North star" or compass, providing clarity for the speaker and the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:42">[01:39:42]</a>.
*   **The Bow (Weight/Impact):** To give the "arrow" impact, add supporting "weight" in the form of anecdotes, data points, or stories that illustrate and add emotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:02">[01:40:02]</a>.
*   **Application:** This framework can be applied to an entire talk or even individual slides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:26">[01:42:26]</a>. For each slide, ask: "What is my one thing?" If a slide doesn't have a clear "one thing," it might be too cluttered or unnecessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:46">[01:42:46]</a>. A useful tip is to make the title of each slide the one thing you want the audience to take away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:23">[01:43:23]</a>.

## Conclusion
The journey to becoming a better speaker can be transformative, addictive, and energizing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:02">[01:05:02]</a>. It's often "much much much more enjoyable than you think it will be" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:26">[01:44:26]</a>. The more constrained one feels with speaking, the more transformational the journey can be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:19">[01:44:19]</a>. By taking the first step and engaging in purposeful practice, anyone can unlock their inherent capacity to communicate effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:40">[01:44:40]</a>.

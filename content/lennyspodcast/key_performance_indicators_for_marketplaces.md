Understanding the health and growth of a marketplace business requires a distinct set of key performance indicators (KPIs) compared to a typical Software as a Service (SaaS) business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. While SaaS businesses might focus on acquisition channels, retention, and monetization, transactional businesses like marketplaces require additional considerations like unit economics and the interaction between supply and demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.

Working with a marketplace business is akin to being a gardener, requiring a very light touch, as actions taken can have long-term, unforeseen consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>. It's crucial to "tread lightly" when altering core incentives or mechanisms, especially if the marketplace is already performing well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a>.

## Core Business Health Metrics

Two foundational metrics for any marketplace business are:

*   **Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV) or Transactions**: This represents the total value of goods or services sold through the marketplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:45">[00:28:45]</a>. It is typically the ultimate North Star metric, as everything else feeds into it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:50">[00:28:50]</a>.
*   **Unit Economics**: Understanding the profitability of each transaction is vital, especially since many marketplaces, like Instacart or Uber, may initially operate at a loss per order or ride <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:56">[00:28:56]</a>. This metric helps in comprehending the costs associated with each transaction, which are often higher in transactional businesses compared to SaaS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

## Marketplace-Specific Health Metrics

Beyond general business metrics, marketplaces have unique KPIs that reflect the delicate balance between supply and demand:

### Liquidity

Liquidity is a broad term but refers to how reliable the marketplace is for both consumers seeking something and suppliers looking to sell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:27">[00:29:27]</a>. Ideally, this metric should be expressed in a way that aligns with what the customer deeply cares about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:39">[00:29:39]</a>.

*   **Examples**:
    *   For ride-sharing services like Uber or Lyft, **wait time** is a classic example of a liquidity metric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:45">[00:29:45]</a>. As more supply (drivers) is added, the average wait time decreases, reaching a "magic moment" where the service becomes significantly better than alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:50">[00:29:50]</a>.
    *   For e-commerce marketplaces like Amazon, **conversion rate** or **search-to-fill metric** indicates how often a customer can find and purchase what they're looking for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:02">[00:30:02]</a>.
*   **Strategic Importance**: Defining and achieving liquidity should be the primary focus, as "nothing else matters" until a marketplace is liquid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:15">[00:30:15]</a>. This is why advice often centers on narrowing the scope to a specific geography or category to generate liquidity before scaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:27">[00:30:27]</a>.

### Share of Wallet

Share of wallet measures the proportion of a customer's total spend within a problem space that occurs on your marketplace, relative to alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:43">[00:30:43]</a>. This applies to both buyers and sellers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:50">[00:30:50]</a>.

*   **Examples**:
    *   For Uber drivers, it's the percentage of their total driving hours spent on Uber versus Lyft or DoorDash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:54">[00:30:54]</a>.
    *   For retailers on Fair, it's the percentage of their store's product inventory sourced from Fair versus other channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:02">[00:31:02]</a>.
*   **Importance**: Higher share of wallet leads to increased [[effective_metrics_for_longterm_business_outcomes | LTVs]] and a better business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:12">[00:31:12]</a>. Crucially, it reduces the likelihood of customers "multi-tenanting" (using multiple marketplaces or services) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:17">[00:31:17]</a>. Prioritizing depth (share of wallet) over breadth (just acquiring more customers) often yields a more resilient business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:43">[00:32:43]</a>.
*   **Application**: Share of wallet is almost always measurable on the supply side of any marketplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:12">[00:33:12]</a>. In B2B marketplaces, a cleaner share of wallet metric is typically available on the consumer side as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:19">[00:33:19]</a>.

## Important Underlying Metrics

While not exclusively "marketplace KPIs," these metrics are critical for the sustained success and understanding of any business, including marketplaces:

*   **Retention**: Customer retention is a highly sensitive metric for growth, often more valuable than achieving larger percentage gains in other areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>. It is the culmination of the entire product experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:06">[00:21:06]</a>.
    *   **Focus on Early User Experience**: The biggest wins in retention typically come from improving the early user experience (first week or month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>. This period offers a significant opportunity to educate users on the product's value and prove its utility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:05">[00:22:05]</a>.
    *   **Avoid Resurrection Efforts Early On**: Attempting to reactivate churned users is generally less impactful than focusing on new users, as churned users have already decided the product isn't for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:46">[00:24:46]</a>. It's advisable to exhaust earlier funnel efforts before investing heavily in resurrection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:58">[00:24:58]</a>.
    *   **Core Product Levers**: To improve retention, focus on core product improvements that address customer pain points and enhance the overall experience, rather than just sending more communications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:13">[00:21:13]</a>. In a marketplace, this often means improving the depth of supply or the quality of interaction with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:27">[00:21:27]</a>.

**Tip for Founders:** Instead of solely focusing on Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV) and growth rates early on, concentrate on initiating a strong flywheel by ensuring customer satisfaction and fulfilling demand, even if on a small scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:05">[00:46:05]</a>. This focus on customer experience creates the "flame" necessary for future growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:37">[00:45:37]</a>.

Brian Chesky, CEO and co-founder of Airbnb, offers a unique perspective on leadership, distinguishing between micromanagement and a deep involvement in the details of a company's operations and product [00:00:29]. For Chesky, the key lies in providing clarity and ensuring everyone is aligned and working efficiently towards a common goal [00:00:14].

## The Problem with Apology and Delegation

Chesky observes that many founders apologize for how they want to run their company, often finding a "midpoint" between their vision and what their employees desire [00:00:04]. This approach, he argues, leads to widespread misery because what everyone truly desires is clarity and the ability to "row in the same direction really quickly" [00:00:14].

He experienced a cycle common among founders:
*   **Initial Control** Founders start by running the show and directing product development [00:15:44].
*   **Delegation Phase** They are then encouraged to delegate and empower teams, often leading to a focus on optimization work and "small thinking" [00:15:48]. This delegation, Chesky notes, can result in founders giving away the very thing they are best at and that is hardest to replace: their product leadership [00:16:26].
*   **Consequences of Delegation** At Airbnb, Chesky found that as he became less involved in projects, there was more "spin," less clear goals, less team advocacy, fewer resources, and slower progress [00:17:43]. This led to a rise in [[managing_up_in_professional_settings | politics]] (advocating for individual interests over company-wide goals), bureaucracy (meetings about meetings), and dependencies between teams [00:20:41]. This environment could make employees feel that they were working 80 hours a week but only getting 20 hours of productive work done [00:20:53].
*   **Reclaiming Control** Eventually, founders realize the need to "take the oars again" and drive the ship with more direct involvement [00:16:01]. Chesky believes the CEO of a product or tech company should essentially serve as the chief product officer [00:16:38].

## The Shift Towards Detailed Leadership at Airbnb

The turning point for Airbnb came during the COVID-19 pandemic, when the company lost 80% of its business in eight weeks [00:24:20]. This "near-death business experience" provided immense clarity [00:24:39]. During this crisis, people within the company actually wanted Chesky to be more involved [00:24:59].

Inspired by Apple's functional model under Steve Jobs, Chesky implemented significant changes to move away from a divisional structure that had subdivided the company into multiple "mini general managers" [00:22:05].

Key changes implemented included:
*   **Centralized Project Management** Everything the company was doing had to be documented, and only about 20% of the initially identified projects were retained [00:25:08]. The focus shifted from one team doing five things to five teams doing one thing together [00:25:40].
*   **Streamlined Structure** Layers of management were removed, and the company returned to a functional model, emphasizing core functions like design, engineering, product marketing, marketing, communications, sales, and operations [00:25:46].
*   **Seniority and Expertise** The workforce was streamlined to fewer, more senior employees [00:26:05]. Executives were required to be experts in their functional domains, managing their domain first and people second [00:26:29].
*   **Unified Decision-Making** Decision-making was pulled in, creating "one shared consciousness" among the top 30-40 leaders [00:27:10].
*   **Calendar-Driven Roadmap** Metrics became subordinate to the calendar, with a rolling two-year product roadmap updated every month [00:27:21]. The company committed to two major product launches per year (May and November/October) [00:14:18], with every single product feature needing to be on the roadmap [00:28:21].
*   **CEO Product Reviews** Chesky initiated a CEO review schedule, personally reviewing all product and marketing work on a regular cadence (weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly) [00:28:29]. These reviews allowed him to identify bottlenecks and ensure collaboration, dictating the pace of work [00:29:49]. This hands-on approach meant he could track progress effectively, regardless of whether employees were in the office [00:30:06].
*   **Integrated Functions** The traditional product management function was evolved. What was once "inbound product development" was combined with "outbound or marketing responsibilities" [00:07:03]. Some program management tasks were offloaded to dedicated program managers [00:07:16]. This new [[selective_micromanagement_as_a_leadership_approach | product marketing]] function emphasized that one cannot build a product without knowing how to talk about it and understand its market [00:07:42]. Marketing and engineering became deeply interconnected [00:11:55]. UX writing was combined with marketing writing to ensure a single, consistent brand voice across all touchpoints [00:30:41].
*   **Product-Led Growth** Airbnb shifted away from heavy reliance on traditional growth channels like paid performance marketing, instead betting that building the best possible product and effectively communicating about it would drive growth [00:40:07]. Chesky views marketing as education, focusing on teaching people about new features rather than just running ads [00:13:18].

## Micromanagement vs. Being in the Details

Chesky directly addresses the term "micromanagement":
*   **Micromanagement** is defined as "telling people exactly what to do" [00:29:31].
*   **Being in the details** means knowing enough about the work to assess if people are doing a good job [00:32:40]. It's akin to a company's board being in the details of the CEO's work without telling the CEO what to do [00:32:36].

For Chesky, leaders being "in the details" is crucial [00:32:20]. He initially found this approach required more work for one to two years, but once the company "turned the corner," it led to greater efficiency, fewer conflicts, less turnover, and a more aligned culture where people understood the direction even without constant intervention [00:51:13]. This ultimately resulted in him having *more* time because issues were addressed proactively rather than reactively [00:52:27].

## Principles for all Companies

Chesky believes this methodology can work for most organizations, though not necessarily with the same "idealistic" approach [00:34:51]. His checklist for leaders includes:
*   The CEO, if a product person, should be the chief product officer and deeply involved in the product [00:35:36].
*   Product managers should be interconnected and aware of each other's work [00:35:50].
*   Every leader should be an expert in what they lead, not just a "people manager" [00:36:02].
*   Teams should strive for fewer people, growing slowly and deliberately [00:36:25].
*   Embrace launches as a way to package and tell a coherent story about product releases [00:36:42].
*   Balance data with research and intuition, ensuring deep understanding [00:36:51].
*   Ideally, engineering and design should report directly to the founder/product-led CEO, with design not subordinate to product [00:37:12].
*   Product management roles should expand to include distribution, customer understanding, and storytelling [00:37:28].
*   Marketing and engineering must be interconnected [00:37:55].
*   Minimize layers between the CEO and other employees [00:37:59].
*   Think of each release as a chapter in a story and the company's journey as a long-term narrative [00:38:18].
*   Most importantly, ensure everyone is "rowing in the same direction" [00:38:33].

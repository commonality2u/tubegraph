The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into search results has brought about a significant [[shifts_in_seo_strategies_in_the_age_of_ai | shift in SEO strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. Initially, there were concerns about an "apocalypse" for traditional SEO, as AI answers directly address user queries at the top of search results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:52">[00:55:52]</a>. However, this evolution necessitates thinking of SEO as a product question, focusing on the user journey and experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:13">[00:19:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:23">[00:23:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:26">[00:24:26]</a>.

## Why Google and Others Integrated AI

The emergence of OpenAI and ChatGPT at the end of 2022 forced Google's hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. ChatGPT's ability to provide written answers to almost any question led to a narrative that Google and traditional search were no longer necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. Google, concerned about its standing with Wall Street, responded by launching Bard (now Gemini) and the Search Generative Experience (SGE), later renamed AI Overviews, essentially putting ChatGPT capabilities directly into search results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:13">[01:15:13]</a>.

However, this integration brought challenges for Google:
*   **Monetization** The difficulty of showing AI answers alongside ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.
*   **Liability** Google becomes the publisher, raising concerns about legal responsibility for generated content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.
*   **Plagiarism** Concerns about extracting too much content from sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>.

After a year of testing, AI Overviews are now rolling out more broadly, affecting an increasing number of searches for both logged-in and incognito users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:14">[01:11:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:29">[01:28:29]</a>.

## Impact on Search Results and User Journey

The primary impact of [[integrating_ai_in_search_results | integrating AI in search results]] is that AI Overviews push traditional search results down the page, providing direct answers that may eliminate the need for users to click on external links <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. This shift differentiates between "top-of-funnel" and "mid-funnel" searches:

*   **Top-of-Funnel (Discovery)**: These are broad queries where users are curious about something, like "best podcast tools" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:05">[00:43:05]</a>. AI Overviews excel at providing summarized answers for these, potentially "swallowing up" the discovery phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:56">[00:43:56]</a>. For example, a search for medical symptoms might receive a direct answer from Google, negating the need to click through WebMD articles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>. This also affects sites like G2 or Capterra, which traditionally provided lists of software tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:52">[00:20:52]</a>.
*   **Mid-Funnel (Intent/Buyer Journey)**: Once a user has narrowed down their options (e.g., chosen a specific podcasting tool like Riverside), they move to more specific searches like "Riverside price" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a>. This is where SEO continues to matter significantly, as users have clear intent and are looking to take action or make a purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:08">[00:22:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:08">[00:22:08]</a>.

This transformation means SEO needs to focus on the latter part of the user journey, where conversions are more likely to happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:08">[00:22:08]</a>.

## SEO as a Product Question

Eli Schwarz, a growth advisor specializing in SEO, emphasizes that SEO should be viewed as a product question, not just a marketing challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:23">[00:23:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:26">[00:24:26]</a>. Product managers are best suited to think about how to position a product to users who are on a self-discovery journey via search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>.

**Key Steps for Success:**
1.  **Be the user**: Understand who your user is and what problem they are trying to solve that would lead them to a search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:58">[00:31:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:41">[00:32:41]</a>. If you can't answer what someone will search for, don't do SEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:10">[00:33:10]</a>.
2.  **Think about the asset to create**: Determine what kind of "product" (page, feature, content) you need to build for that user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:34">[00:33:34]</a>. For example, Zapier created specific pages to showcase how different apps could connect (e.g., Gmail and Salesforce), addressing a user need that wasn't being directly searched for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:54">[00:26:54]</a>. Tinder focused on solving "loneliness" in new cities, creating location-specific pages for online dating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:50">[00:29:50]</a>.
3.  **Build the product for the SEO user**: This involves design, engineering, product management, and user research, rather than just content creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:34">[00:34:34]</a>. Your SEO efforts must feed directly into your company's monetization strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:06">[00:56:06]</a>.

## When Not to Invest in SEO

Not every business, especially B2B SaaS companies, is a good fit for SEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:41">[00:36:41]</a>.
*   **Complex sales cycles**: If a product requires committee decisions, sales calls, or significant integration (like Mixpanel or Google Cloud), an SEO-driven conversion is unlikely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:17">[00:36:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>. The problem might exist, but the solution isn't found or purchased through a simple search journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:50">[00:36:50]</a>.
*   **High friction to purchase**: If the product is expensive or can't be purchased directly online, SEO may not be the most effective channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:29">[00:36:29]</a>.
*   **Better alternative channels**: For local businesses like restaurants, platforms like Google Maps, DoorDash, or Uber Eats are more relevant than a website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:05">[00:45:05]</a>. For a gardening SaaS, attending trade shows might yield better leads than investing in SEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:50">[00:42:50]</a>.

Investment in SEO should be a strategic decision, weighing the cost against potential returns and comparing it to other marketing channels like paid ads or influencer campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:22">[00:41:22]</a>. SEO is not free; it requires investment in time, resources, and direct expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:30">[00:39:30]</a>.

## Measuring SEO Success

The common mistake in SEO is measuring success by rankings or overall traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:43">[00:43:43]</a>. Instead, SEO success should be tied to business-relevant conversion metrics, such as:
*   **Marketing Qualified Leads (MQLs)**: For SaaS tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:53">[00:49:53]</a>.
*   **Page views**: For media companies monetizing through advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:51">[00:51:51]</a>.
*   **Dollar conversions**: Direct sales from SEO traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:56">[00:49:56]</a>.
*   **Links/Social shares**: As a form of brand building or for pitch decks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:08">[00:50:08]</a>.

Driving traffic that doesn't convert is worthless for the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:43">[00:49:43]</a>. Forecasts should be top-down, estimating market penetration from the total addressable market, rather than relying on often inaccurate keyword research tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:46">[01:38:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:51">[01:41:51]</a>.

## Using AI in SEO

[[how_ai_tools_are_simplifying_web_design_and_development | AI is a tool]], not a complete solution for SEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:51">[00:59:51]</a>.
*   **Generating useful content**: AI can be used to create product descriptions for e-commerce sites or to summarize useful information, as long as the content is valuable to the user and supports the product journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:53">[01:00:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:47">[01:01:47]</a>.
*   **Avoid "fluff"**: Using AI to generate large quantities of irrelevant or low-quality blog posts solely for SEO purposes is a waste of time and can negatively impact Google's perception of your site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:23">[01:00:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:42">[01:04:42]</a>. Google's documentation states that AI itself is not the problem; the helpfulness and usefulness of the content are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:27">[01:02:27]</a>.

## Google's Dominance and AI Overviews

A detailed analysis of Google's antitrust verdict reveals insights into its dominance:
*   **Market Share**: Google holds a staggering 98% of mobile searches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:55">[01:17:55]</a>.
*   **Default Agreements**: Google's success is heavily driven by its default partnerships with companies like Apple, and its ownership of Chrome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:53">[01:18:53]</a>. Competitors like Bing and Neva have struggled to gain traction even with superior products due to these distribution agreements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:21">[01:19:21]</a>.
*   **Brand and Habit**: Users are accustomed to Google, and even if defaults were to change, the force of habit and brand strength would likely keep them on Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:29">[01:19:29]</a>.

Google implements AI Overviews not out of fear of being unseated, but to appease Wall Street and prevent even small percentage losses to competitors like ChatGPT, which can translate to significant revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:26">[01:20:26]</a>.

AI Overviews are a [[building_a_brand_with_ai | branding exercise]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:44">[01:05:44]</a>. If a brand is mentioned in an AI overview, it indicates successful branding efforts. However, if content is merely summarized with a link, it suggests Google may be "stealing" content without ensuring clicks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:29">[01:07:29]</a>.

## SEO Myths

*   **You always need to do SEO**: This is the biggest myth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:43">[01:26:43]</a>. Businesses should critically evaluate if SEO aligns with their user journey and conversion model, just as they would any other marketing channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:57">[01:26:57]</a>.
*   **Link building is a secret sauce**: True link building is [[building_a_brand_with_ai | brand building]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:31">[01:27:31]</a>. It's about creating an awesome product that people want to use and mention, leading to organic mentions and links from relevant sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:55">[01:08:55]</a>. Buying low-quality guest posts or irrelevant links is ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:09">[01:09:09]</a>. Google is smart enough to detect irrelevant links <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:20">[01:28:20]</a>.
*   **Google is a blackbox**: The basic principles of SEO are simple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:07">[01:28:07]</a>. Google provides best practices: build an understandable website, link pages logically, and create helpful content that users want to read <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:27">[01:28:27]</a>. Most SEO success can be achieved by adhering to these best practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:01">[01:29:01]</a>.
*   **Technical SEO is a quick fix**: Technical SEO is crucial for large websites with millions of pages (e.g., Zillow, Airbnb) to ensure crawlability and indexation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:11">[01:35:11]</a>. However, for smaller websites, spending excessive time and money on technical SEO (like page speed optimization) may not yield significant results compared to focusing on user value and product fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:24">[01:35:24]</a>.

## Programmatic vs. Editorial SEO

*   **Programmatic SEO**: Involves taking multiple data sources and automatically generating comprehensive pages. Examples include Trip Advisor (hotels, cities, UGC) and Zillow (property values, government data, photos, neighborhood info) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:25">[01:10:25]</a>. This is suitable for scalable efforts where a consistent page structure can serve a specific user need across many variations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:28">[01:14:28]</a>. The key is to ensure there's a user use case for each generated page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:18">[01:15:18]</a>.
*   **Editorial SEO**: Involves manually writing long-form content for each topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:39">[01:13:39]</a>. This is often cost-prohibitive for large-scale content needs and less efficient for queries where users need direct, structured information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:58">[01:13:58]</a>.

Generally, programmatic SEO is the more common and successful path when scale and a clear user solution are present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:07">[01:14:07]</a>.

## The Future of SEO

Despite changes, SEO is not dying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:06">[01:24:06]</a>. Users will always seek specific information and desire choice beyond a single AI-generated answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:34">[01:24:34]</a>. Google, despite its AI advancements, acknowledges the need for real user data to understand intent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:46">[01:24:46]</a>.

While platforms like TikTok and Instagram are gaining popularity for top-of-funnel discovery, especially among Gen Z <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:01">[01:31:01]</a>, Google Search remains critical for mid-funnel queries where users are ready to take action (e.g., booking flights, making purchases) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:13">[01:32:13]</a>. The fundamental need for people to take actions and buy products does not change, even if search volumes for initial discovery queries are impacted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:52">[01:25:52]</a>.

The demand for SEO expertise is expected to grow as companies navigate these [[the_evolving_capabilities_and_future_potential_of_ai | evolving search landscapes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>.

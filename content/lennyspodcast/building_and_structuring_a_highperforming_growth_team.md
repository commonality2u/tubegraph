Melton Coron Berkowitz, Head of Growth at Deel, shares insights into how she built and structured a high-performing growth team that contributed to Deel's rapid expansion. Deel went from less than \$1 million in ARR to \$300 million in three years while remaining EBITDA positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. Melton joined Deel as the second marketing hire and around the 19th or 20th overall employee, leading all their growth efforts from the early days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

## Early Growth Team Prioritization

When prioritizing resources in the early days, it's crucial to go "back to the basics" and build the "skeleton before you put on the makeup" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:01">[00:27:01]</a>.

Key steps for early-stage growth team investment:
1.  **Website Presence & Performance**: Ensure you have a website that is fast and recognized by search engines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a>. A slow website (loading in four-plus seconds) can hinder even successful paid ad programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:37">[00:27:37]</a>. Deel's first website change was moving from hard-coded to an editable platform for A/B testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:57">[00:28:57]</a>.
2.  **Discoverability (Content & SEO)**: Focus on how people can find your product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:16">[00:27:16]</a>. This involves creating content that answers user questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.
3.  **Paid Acquisition**: Only after addressing the fundamental questions of website performance and organic discoverability should paid ads be considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:24">[00:27:24]</a>.
4.  **Clear Messaging**: Ensure your website copy clearly explains what your company does, avoiding generic statements that could apply to any business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:09">[00:28:09]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Product as Core
> Acquisition channels are ineffective if the product doesn't meet expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:29">[00:42:29]</a>. In the B2B world, users will not tolerate "crappy products" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:25">[00:43:25]</a>. When joining a young company, it's advised to check the team breakdown; a strong core indicates a solid business foundation (e.g., more product and engineers than sales at an early stage) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:47">[00:43:47]</a>.

## Hiring Philosophy for Growth Teams

Melton emphasizes specific qualities and metrics when [[hiring_and_developing_a_growth_team | hiring and developing a growth team]]:

*   **Commitment to Revenue KPIs**: Growth team members should be willing to commit to "closed-won revenue KPIs," not just lead numbers, demonstrating a focus on the business's bottom line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:32">[00:47:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:48">[00:50:48]</a>. This can be assessed by asking about past KPI commitments and what metrics they *think* they should be responsible for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:41">[00:49:41]</a>.
*   **"Little Hands" Mentality**: A crucial concept at Deel, "little hands" means that regardless of seniority, every team member must be willing to engage in the "nitty-gritty" work and not shy away from the smallest tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:36">[00:48:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:49">[00:48:49]</a>. This ensures operational effectiveness with limited resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:28">[00:48:28]</a>.
*   **Experience in Resource-Constrained Environments**: When hiring from larger companies, it's important to assess if candidates have experience operating with "ten percent of the resources" they previously had <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:08">[00:48:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:30">[00:48:30]</a>.
*   **Strategic Thinking Across Spend Levels**: During the interview process, asking candidates to devise strategies for different budget levels (e.g., \$0, \$10k, \$100k) reveals their comfort with varying resources and commitment to bottom-of-funnel metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:11">[00:50:11]</a>.

## Growth Team Structure and Evolution

Deel's growth team has evolved in its structure:

*   **Early Stages**: Deel opted for a "one leader" approach to manage a segment of the organization, allowing them to grow their own teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:22">[00:51:22]</a>.
    *   The first hire was a product marketing person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:44">[00:51:44]</a>.
    *   The second was a talented copywriter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:02">[00:52:02]</a>.
    *   The third was a data analyst, reflecting a strong commitment to understanding where every dollar was spent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:10">[00:52:10]</a>.
    *   A content person was already part of the team when Melton joined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:35">[00:52:35]</a>.
*   **Current Structure**: The team is now structured into two main types:
    *   **Functional Teams**: These consist of "subject matter experts" whose location is not a concern. Examples include product marketing, content, community, events, paid advertisements, and brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:50">[00:52:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:01">[00:53:01]</a>. Keeping technical roles together promotes learning and skill development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:42">[00:53:42]</a>.
    *   **Regional Teams**: These are marketing managers for different key regions, providing local expertise and working with functional teams to execute strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:17">[00:53:17]</a>. Regional investment decisions are based on total addressable market, opportunities, and competitive landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:33">[00:54:33]</a>.

## Cultural Aspects for a High-Performing Team

Deel's culture, crucial for [[building_a_strong_company_culture_in_a_fastgrowing_company | building a strong company culture in a fast-growing company]] and its rapid growth, is built on two main components: what team members bring and what the company gives back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:13">[00:55:13]</a>.

**What Deel Expects from Team Members:**
*   **"Deel Speed" (Urgency)**: Act with urgency, whether solving customer problems (within 24 hours) or building new products (one-tenth the time of competitors) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:27">[00:55:27]</a>. This means constantly pushing to find the quickest way to solve problems properly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:51">[00:55:51]</a>.
*   **Default Optimism**: Maintain a positive outlook, asking "how can this be done" rather than focusing on why something won't work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:09">[00:56:09]</a>. Pessimism can slow things down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:15">[00:56:15]</a>.
*   **Customer-Centricity**: A deep commitment to the customer, recognizing that the product deals with human livelihoods, payroll, and legal compliance, making it incredibly personal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:37">[00:56:37]</a>.

**What Deel Gives Back:**
*   **Flexibility**: Employees have the freedom to choose how and when they work, including location and hours, as long as they deliver on expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:23">[00:57:23]</a>. This remote-first approach fostered a unique team culture, with authenticity and camaraderie built from people showing up as their true selves from their homes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:32">[01:04:32]</a>. Melton herself worked for a year and a half remotely before meeting co-workers in person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:35">[01:03:35]</a>.

Deel's values were formalized about a year into the company's existence, crystallizing existing cultural elements like "Deal Speed" that were already frequently used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:08">[00:58:08]</a>. The culture happened well before these values were explicitly defined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:47">[00:58:47]</a>.

A clear and compelling product vision is essential for aligning teams and fostering success in product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. It serves as a powerful tool to unite efforts and ensure everyone is working towards a shared future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

## What is a Product Vision?

A product vision provides a vivid image of the future state of the product or company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. It's the destination, a picture of what the world will look like once the problem is solved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:03">[01:12:03]</a>.

### Vision vs. Mission

The vision is distinct from the mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.
*   **Vision:** Describes the future state or destination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:14">[01:12:14]</a>. For example, Uber's vision was "a world where you get to this continuous trip so that you do not need parking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. Microsoft's vision was "a computer on every desk and in every home" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:12">[01:14:12]</a>.
*   **Mission:** Defines the purpose or "why" the company/team exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:20">[01:13:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:40">[01:13:40]</a>. For example, Uber's mission was "reliable transport sanitation everywhere and for everyone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. TED's mission is "to spread ideas" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:56">[01:13:56]</a>.

### Elements of a Good Vision

A compelling product vision should possess four key elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>:
1.  **Lofty:** It should be inspiring and feel almost scary in an exciting way, something worth getting up for every morning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
2.  **Realistic and Attainable:** While ambitious, it shouldn't be so "pie in the sky" that it feels out of reach for most people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
3.  **Devoid of Current Limitations:** It should be conceived in a vacuum from today's technological or resource constraints, as these might change in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:26">[00:30:26]</a>.
4.  [[developing_and_implementing_product_strategy | Grounded in a Potent Problem]]: The vision must clearly address a significant and exciting problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.

### Examples

*   **Good Vision (Uber):** "A world where you get to this continuous trip so that you do not need parking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. This is lofty (reclaiming 25% of city space), but also realistic and attainable (seen in Amsterdam's conversion of parking to gardens) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.
*   **Controversial Vision (Elon Musk):** "We're going to get to Mars" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:52">[01:10:52]</a>. This is lofty, and while it might feel impossible to some, a strong leader can inspire belief in its possibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:31">[01:11:31]</a>.

## Developing a Product Vision: The 3-Step Approach

The process of [[developing_a_compelling_vision_and_securing_team_buyin | developing a compelling vision and securing team buy-in]] can be broken down into three main steps: empathize, create, and evangelize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:59">[00:28:59]</a>.

### 1. Empathize (Understand Work)

This initial phase focuses on deeply understanding the customer and the problems they face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:16">[00:29:16]</a>.
*   **Dogfooding and Catfooding:** Actively use your own product (dogfooding) and your competitors' products (catfooding) to build intuition and identify issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:23">[00:31:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:32">[00:31:32]</a>.
*   **Question Intuition:** Continuously ask yourself what makes the products you love effective and try to articulate it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:38">[00:32:38]</a>.
*   **The "Top 10 Things You Should Know" Document:** Create a living document that lists the top 10 most potent problems of the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:06">[00:54:06]</a>. This document should be updated quarterly and can include qualitative, quantitative, or even technical debt issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:10">[00:33:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:27">[00:33:27]</a>.
    *   **Involve Stakeholders:** Bring in stakeholders (marketing, operations, support, research, content strategy) and ask them to contribute their "Top 10 problems" using this framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:51">[00:38:51]</a>. This fosters buy-in and provides a multifaceted view of the problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:39">[00:39:39]</a>.
*   **Strategy Sessions:** Dedicate time for strategy sessions (e.g., three-day workshops) where product, engineering, design, and research leaders deeply analyze and align on the core problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:48">[00:40:48]</a>. The "insights day" focuses on understanding the problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:51">[00:41:51]</a>.

### 2. Create

Once problems are clear, focus on crafting the vision of what the world looks like if those problems are solved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:30">[00:29:30]</a>. [[product_management_and_storytelling | Storytelling]] is a crucial skill in this phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>.

*   **Narrative Structure (Mad Libs Framework):** A simple yet powerful way to articulate a vision as a story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>:
    *   "Once Upon a Time, [problem/current state] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>.
    *   ...and because of that, [consequence] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>.
    *   One day, [solution/big change happened] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>.
    *   As a result, [new state of the world/dent in the universe] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>."
    *   *Example (YouTube Shorts):* "Once Upon a Time, YouTube became very polished, and creators felt they couldn't create <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>. One day, we launched Shorts (60 seconds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>. As a result, anyone can now express themselves again and bring back the joy and magic of YouTube" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>.
*   **Write a News Article/Press Release:** Imagine the vision has come to pass and write a headline and subtitle for a major tech publication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>. This forces clarity on the impact and core message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>.
*   **Visualize the Future:** Use sketches, mockups, or even simple drawn rectangles to depict the future state of the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>. This makes the vision tangible and exciting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:23">[00:19:23]</a>.
    *   *Example:* Sketching a Bodega with an Uber top-up kiosk to visualize cash payments for Uber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>.
    *   *Tip:* Don't wait for a designer; draw it yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:06">[00:27:06]</a>. Often, a designer will want to refine your initial sketch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:44">[00:27:44]</a>.

### 3. Evangelize

[[developing_a_compelling_vision_and_securing_team_buyin | Securing team buy-in]] for the vision requires consistent communication and patience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:35">[00:29:35]</a>.

*   **Concentric Circles of Communication:**
    1.  **Core Team:** Start with the immediate product team (PM, engineering, design, research leads) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:54">[00:43:54]</a>. They must be bought in and convinced to "sail on the boat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:12">[00:44:12]</a>.
    2.  **Stakeholders:** Share the vision with relevant cross-functional teams (marketing, operations, support, adjacent product teams) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:08">[00:46:08]</a>. Address their feedback and show that their input was heard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:42">[00:42:42]</a>.
    3.  **Leadership:** Present the vision to leadership, aiming as high as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:44">[00:46:44]</a>. Encourage them to amplify the story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:22">[00:47:22]</a>.
*   **Living Documents:** Create written outputs of workshops and vision documents that are open for comments (not view-only) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:07">[00:45:07]</a>. This allows for friction and polishing of ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:44">[00:45:44]</a>.
*   **Patience:** Long-term visions (3-5 years out) require patience, as it can take time for them to be integrated into planning cycles and funded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:55">[00:29:55]</a>.
*   **Benefits:** A well-evangelized vision leads to greater team velocity, helps attract talent, and influences broader company initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:30">[00:48:30]</a>.

## The Craft of Product Management: Clarity and Conviction

The core of [[the_art_and_role_of_product_management | product management]] is bringing [[coaching_and_leadership_in_product_management | clarity]] and conviction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:01">[00:57:01]</a>.

### Clarity

*   **Definition:** Clarity is about transparency and simplicity of understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:28">[00:58:28]</a>. It means sifting out distracting information to reveal the core problem or idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:34">[00:58:34]</a>.
*   **Tools for Clarity:**
    *   **The Narrative Framework:** "Insights, Strategy, Big Rocks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:44">[00:58:44]</a>. This brings clarity to *why* you're doing something, *how* you'll do it, and *what* you'll deliver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:52">[00:58:52]</a>.
    *   **Concise Writing:** Encourage writing short, focused documents (e.g., two-page documents) that outline insights, strategy/approach, and a few "big rocks" (key deliverables) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:16">[00:59:16]</a>. Avoid endless roadmaps with too many items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:42">[00:59:42]</a>.
    *   **Evergreen Narrative:** Maintain a concise, easily accessible narrative document that explains why your team exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:05">[01:01:05]</a>.

### Conviction

*   **Definition:** Conviction is a strong feeling about what the world should be like; it's a belief, not absolute certainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:15">[01:05:15]</a>. It's tied to [[product_management_and_leadership_insights | product sense]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:32">[01:05:32]</a>.
*   **Building Conviction:**
    *   **Pick a Lane:** Don't be afraid to make a definitive choice, even if it's uncomfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:51">[01:06:51]</a>. Focus resources on what you believe is the single most important problem to solve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:57">[01:06:57]</a>.
    *   **Informed Captain:** Clearly identify who is on the hook for a decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:01">[01:21:01]</a>. That person should gather context and input but ultimately make the decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:22">[01:21:22]</a>.

## Product Culture and Vision

Company culture significantly shapes how products are built and how visions are adopted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:38">[01:08:38]</a>.

*   **Uber's Culture:** Characterized by "super hands-on" work, "boardroom to streets" mentality, and "complete autonomy" for employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:14">[01:09:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:55">[01:09:55]</a>. Values like "principled confrontation" and "toe-stepping" encouraged challenging the status quo for the business's benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:31">[01:11:31]</a>.
*   **Netflix's Culture:** Evolved intentionally over time, moving from a monolithic structure to a "no rules rules" framework emphasizing "freedom of responsibility" and "highly aligned, loosely coupled" teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:31">[01:12:31]</a>. Debates were encouraged, with clear decision-makers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:54">[01:13:54]</a>.
*   **Google's Culture:** More decentralized, with "microcultures" existing within different product areas (e.g., Search, Assistant, YouTube, Cloud) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:51">[01:15:51]</a>. This allows for flexibility in product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:02">[01:17:02]</a>.

### Fostering a Positive Team Culture

PM leaders play a crucial role in shaping their team's culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:58">[01:19:58]</a>.
*   **Freedom of Responsibility:** Grant team members autonomy but expect them to take ownership, acting like an "owner, not a renter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:34">[01:20:34]</a>.
*   **Informed Captain:** Ensure there's a single person accountable for each decision, empowered to gather input but ultimately decide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:55">[01:20:55]</a>.
*   **Vulnerability as Strength:** Embrace human flaws and foster a culture where empathy and genuine care for "the human behind the role" are prioritized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:43">[01:21:43]</a>.
    *   Being "loved" (extending yourself for another's spiritual growth) is more important than being "liked" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:02">[01:22:02]</a>. This means having hard conversations rooted in care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:40">[01:22:40]</a>.
*   **Internal Collaboration:** Encourage open sharing of work (e.g., PRDs) within the team before sharing externally, fostering a supportive environment where teammates help refine ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:20">[01:23:20]</a>.
*   **Personal Connection:** Build genuine relationships with colleagues, such as knowing their birthdays or career aspirations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:35">[01:24:35]</a>.

## Tips for Aspiring Product Managers

*   **Practice Product Management Before Being a PM:** Start by deeply engaging with your favorite apps, identifying their top problems, and envisioning solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:08">[01:30:08]</a>. This builds your [[product_management_and_leadership_insights | product sense]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:20">[01:30:20]</a>.
*   **Emphasize Problem Clarity:** Be able to articulate the top problems of your product with clarity and conviction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>.

## Recent YouTube Features Driven by Vision

YouTube's product vision for creators is to be their "creative partner" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:53">[01:26:53]</a>. This means offering tools that make creators' lives easier, allowing them to focus on storytelling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:10">[01:27:10]</a>.

*   **AI Inspiration:** This feature uses AI to generate content ideas for creators based on what their audience is watching and searching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:47">[01:27:47]</a>.
*   **Thumbnail Test and Compare:** A new tool that allows creators to A/B test multiple thumbnails to see which performs best, streamlining a previously time-consuming process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:20">[01:28:20]</a>.

Developing a clear and compelling product vision is essential for success, regardless of one's level within a company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. A product vision serves as the ultimate destination, guiding teams and aligning efforts towards a shared future state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

## Defining Product Vision

A product vision is akin to describing the destination of an airplane or the view from Mount Everest, painting a clear picture of what the future looks like once the product has achieved its goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. It is distinct from a company's mission, which defines the purpose or "why" a company exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.

**Key Elements of a Good Vision:**
*   **Lofty** It should be inspiring and exciting, almost scaring you in an exciting way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
*   **Realistic and Attainable** While ambitious, it cannot feel so "pie in the sky" that it's out of reach for most people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.
*   **Vacuum from Current Limitations** It should be conceived without being constrained by today's technological or resource limitations, as these may change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:26">[00:30:26]</a>.
*   **Grounded in a Potent Problem** The vision must address a clear and compelling problem that people are excited to solve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

### Vision vs. Mission Examples

| Concept | Definition | Example (Uber) | Example (Microsoft) | Example (Lyft) |
| :------ | :--------- | :------------- | :------------------ | :------------- |
| **Mission** | The purpose; why the company/team exists. | To make transportation reliable everywhere for everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. | To spread ideas (TED) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>; Increase the GDP of the internet (Stripe) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>. | |
| **Vision** | The future state; what it looks like when the mission is achieved. | A world of continuous trips where parking is obsolete, freeing up city spaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. | A computer on every desk and in every home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>. | A world where cities feel small again, where transportation and tech bring people together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>. |

## The Three-Step Process for Developing a Vision

The process for [[creating_and_communicating_a_vision | developing a vision]] involves three main phases: Empathize, Create, and Evangelize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a>.

### 1. Empathize: Understand the Problem

This initial phase focuses on deeply understanding the customer and the problems they face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:16">[00:29:16]</a>.
*   **"Understand Work"**: Product managers must actively use their own products (dogfooding) and competitor products (catfooding) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:42">[00:30:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:23">[00:31:23]</a>. This hands-on experience builds intuition about what works well and what problems exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:18">[00:32:18]</a>.
*   **Foundational Research**: While quick research is useful, focus on foundational research that uncovers problems a few cycles out, informing strategic direction rather than immediate actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:46">[00:31:46]</a>.
*   **"Top 10 Things You Should Know" Document**: Maintain a living document listing the top 10 known problems with the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:02">[00:33:02]</a>. This document should be reviewed and updated regularly (e.g., quarterly) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:13">[00:33:13]</a>. Problems can be qualitative, quantitative, or even relate to technical debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:21">[00:33:21]</a>.
*   **Stakeholder Input**: Gather input from various stakeholders (marketing, operations, support, research) using the "top 10 problems" framework. This ensures a multifaceted view of problems and fosters early buy-in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:57">[00:38:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:06">[00:40:06]</a>.

### 2. Create: Craft the Vision

Once the problem is clear, the next step is to create the vision, which describes what the world looks like after the problem is solved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:30">[00:29:30]</a>.
*   **Storytelling**: Product managers must be skilled storytellers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>. Stories are more memorable and impactful than mere numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>.
*   **"Once Upon a Time" Framework (Mad Libs)**:
    *   "Once Upon a Time [describe the old world/problem]..." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>
    *   "...and because of that [describe the negative consequences]..." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>
    *   "...then one day [describe the big change/solution introduced]..." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>
    *   "...and as a result of that [describe the new, improved state of the world/the dent made in the universe]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>.
    *   *Example (YouTube Shorts)*: "Once Upon a Time, YouTube became very polished, making it hard for many to create. Because of that, people consumed instead of creating. Then one day, we launched Shorts (60 seconds). As a result, anyone can now express themselves again, bringing back the joy and magic of YouTube." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>
*   **News Article/Press Release**: Write a headline and subtitle for a future news article (e.g., TechCrunch, Verve) as if the vision has already been realized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>. This forces clarity and focus on the ultimate impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>.
    *   *Example (Uber)*: "Uber is now replacing your Clipper card: All you need is your phone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a>.
*   **Visualize the Future**: Sketch or mock up what the product will look like in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>. This can be as simple as hand-drawn Post-it notes or mock-ups of app store screenshots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:10">[00:27:10]</a>. Don't wait for designers; low-fidelity visuals are sufficient to tell the story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:05">[00:27:05]</a>.

### 3. Evangelize: Share and Gain Buy-in

Once crafted, the vision must be continually evangelized to ensure everyone is aligned and working towards the same goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:12">[00:29:12]</a>.
*   **Concentric Circles of Communication**:
    1.  **Core Team**: Ensure your immediate product, engineering, and design teams deeply understand and are bought into the vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:54">[00:43:54]</a>. Present it multiple times, allowing for questions and stress-testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:51">[00:44:51]</a>. Maintain a living document of the vision, open for comments from the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:25">[00:45:25]</a>.
    2.  **Stakeholders & Adjacent Teams**: Share the vision with other relevant departments and teams that need to be bought in for success, as they will also offer valuable perspectives and identify potential challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:08">[00:46:08]</a>.
    3.  **Leadership**: Present the vision to leadership at the highest possible level. Encourage them to amplify the story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:44">[00:46:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:23">[00:47:23]</a>. "Go big; let people tell you to pull back" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:13">[00:47:13]</a>.
*   **Patience**: Realizing a vision can take time. For example, a "Vision 2026" plan might take a year and a half before significant funding and planning cycles begin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:51">[00:29:51]</a>. Be prepared for naysayers and continuously reinforce the vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:09">[00:30:09]</a>.

## Scale and Lifespan of a Vision

A true product vision is a long-term aspiration, lasting typically three to five years, or even longer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:25">[00:48:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:29">[00:50:29]</a>. If a vision needs to be repeated or fundamentally changed every year, it likely wasn't well-defined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:46">[00:49:46]</a>. Over time, more fidelity can be added to the vision, but the core remains consistent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:54">[00:49:54]</a>.

While a "macro vision" guides the overall direction, teams can also create "micro visions" for smaller problems or features, describing what a specific solution will look like within a shorter timeframe (e.g., next year) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:46">[00:50:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:13">[00:51:13]</a>.

## Craft of Product Management: Clarity and Conviction

The craft of product management is fundamentally about bringing Clarity and Conviction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:58">[00:56:58]</a>.
*   **Clarity**: Involves transparency and simplicity of understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:28">[00:58:28]</a>. This means sifting out distracting information to focus on the core problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:34">[00:58:34]</a>. The "insights, strategy, big rocks" framework helps create this clarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:47">[00:58:47]</a>. Product managers should write concise documents (e.g., two-pagers) outlining insights, strategy/approach, and a few "big rocks" (prioritized initiatives) that will drive the most impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:16">[00:59:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:48">[00:59:48]</a>.
*   **Conviction**: A feeling of what the world should be; it's not absolute certainty but a strong belief in the right path forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:15">[01:05:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:25">[01:05:25]</a>. To build conviction, product managers must be willing to "pick a lane" and stand by their proposed solutions, even if uncomfortable, and seek higher certainty through focused effort rather than spreading resources thin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:32">[01:06:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:51">[01:06:51]</a>. They should guide their teams to make difficult decisions and present a unified recommendation to leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:22">[01:07:22]</a>.

By mastering the ability to bring clarity to complex problems and cultivate strong conviction in a future vision, product managers can effectively lead their teams to build impactful products.

Ramp, a finance automation platform and corporate card solution, has achieved historical growth, becoming the fastest-growing SaaS business to reach over $100 million in annual run rate in two years, and later, $200 million [00:00:54](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">00:00:54</a>), [00:01:06](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">00:01:06</a>), [00:05:44](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">00:05:44</a>), [00:57:51](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:51">00:57:51</a>). This rapid expansion, achieved with a lean R&D team (under 50 people at $100M ARR) [00:01:04](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">00:01:04</a>), [00:09:27](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">00:09:27</a>), is attributed to a unique product approach that optimizes for speed, [[understanding_work_for_product_development | thinking from first principles]], and [[empowerment_and_organizational_culture_at_ramp | empowering individual team members]] [00:00:48](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">00:00:48</a>), [00:01:49](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">00:01:49</a>).

## The Importance of Velocity

[[ramps_rapid_growth_strategy | Velocity]] is paramount at Ramp, influencing every aspect of their product development process, team incentives, hiring, promotion, decision-making, and organizational structure [00:07:30](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">00:07:30</a>). This emphasis emerged during the pandemic when a small team faced a large market opportunity, making execution speed critical [00:07:45](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">00:07:45</a>).

### Benefits of High Velocity
*   **Faster Iteration and Impact**: Teams with high velocity can iterate quickly, leading to greater impact over time [00:08:12](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">00:08:12</a>).
*   **Positive Talent Selection**: It attracts top talent who want to build and ship products rapidly [00:08:18](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">00:08:18</a>).
*   **De-risking Decisions**: If the cost of a decision is low due to quick iteration, it simplifies decision-making [00:08:36](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">00:08:36</a>).

Ramp has demonstrated this velocity by building:
*   A competitor to American Express in three months with about 8 engineers [00:00:03](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">00:00:03</a>), [00:09:14](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">00:09:14</a>).
*   A competitor to Expensify six months later [00:00:05](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">00:00:05</a>), [00:09:18](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">00:09:18</a>).
*   An accounts payable product (competitor to Bill.com) in three months with a team of three engineers, one designer, and one PM [00:00:19](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">00:00:19</a>), [00:09:35](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">00:09:35</a>).

## Operationalizing Velocity

The recipe for Ramp's velocity involves several key elements:

### Small, Single-Threaded Teams
Teams are kept small and focused on a single goal or "thread" [00:09:54](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">00:09:54</a>), [00:10:57](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">00:10:57</a>). This prevents individual contributors from being pulled in multiple directions, allowing them to concentrate solely on their primary objective [00:11:01](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">00:11:01</a>). An example is the "Flex" product team, which was purely focused on e-commerce companies' cash flow needs [00:11:40](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">00:11:40</a>).

### Lofty Goals
Ramp sets ambitious goals, often inspired by publicly traded competitors like Bill.com and Expensify [00:13:55](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">00:13:55</a>).
*   **Market Comparables**: Existing large players provide motivation and de-risk business decisions [00:13:50](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">00:13:50</a>).
*   **Design Vision**: Designers create "visionary prototypes" and "Loom walkthroughs of Figma prototypes" to inspire and motivate teams about the future of the product [00:14:26](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">00:14:26</a>), [01:13:51](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:51">01:13:51</a>).
*   **Revenue-Driven**: The company is "very revenue driven," with clear market and revenue goals anchoring motivation [00:15:03](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:03">01:15:03</a>).

### Context Over Control (Empowerment)
Ramp fosters a culture of [[empowerment_and_organizational_culture_at_ramp | empowerment]] by providing teams with context rather than micromanaging solutions [00:15:25](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">00:15:25</a>).
*   **Alignment on Fundamentals**: Leaders focus on aligning teams on the *goals*, *hypotheses*, and *data*, rather than debating specific solutions [00:15:56](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">00:15:56</a>). Solutions are often better determined by teams closer to the ground [00:16:53](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">00:16:53</a>).
*   **"Repeater in Chief"**: Leaders, like the VP of Product, constantly repeat and share context that teams might be missing from high-level meetings [00:17:10](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">00:17:10</a>).
*   **Asynchronous Updates**: Status meetings are avoided; updates are done asynchronously in the systems teams operate in [00:26:32](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:32">00:26:32</a>). Meetings are reserved for collaboration, ideation, and decision-making [00:26:44](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:44">00:26:44</a>).

### Shielding Teams
Core teams are protected from external distractions and chaos:
*   **Production Engineers**: A rotational program ensures engineers protect core teams from escalations, bugs, and issues [00:12:30](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">00:12:30</a>), [00:21:49](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">00:21:49</a>).
*   **Product Operators**: This team shields PMs from documentation, escalations, release management, enablement, and customer requests [00:12:42](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">00:12:42</a>), [00:59:01](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:01">00:59:01</a>).
*   **New Product Teams**: For big bets, sub-teams are formed from different groups, specifically without responsibility for existing products, to ensure focus [00:12:58](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">00:12:58</a>).

### Minimal Planning
Ramp's philosophy is "any second you spend planning is a second you don't spend doing" [00:32:25](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:25">00:32:25</a>).
*   **Controlled Chaos**: New hires are explicitly told to expect "somewhat chaotic" conditions, with products changing and constant adjustments, as this is the trade-off for innovation and growth [00:33:09](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:09">00:33:09</a>).
*   **Strategic Planning**: Detailed planning is reserved for "large market moments" like major product launches that involve cross-functional coordination (marketing, sales) [00:33:59](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:59">00:33:59</a>). This is a low percentage of overall R&D focus [00:34:17](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:17">00:34:17</a>).
*   **Prioritizing Velocity over Accuracy**: It's more beneficial to spend time creating velocity than on precise, time-consuming planning for features that don't require it [00:34:42](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:42">00:34:42</a>).

### Quality with Speed
Ramp operates on the principle that [[speed_vs_quality_in_product_development | quality can increase with velocity]] because issues can be identified and fixed quickly [00:21:21](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">00:21:21</a>), [00:21:33](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:33">00:21:33</a>).
*   **Control Mechanisms**: Systems are in place to ensure high velocity doesn't tank the business [00:21:51](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">00:21:51</a>).
    *   **Voice of Customer**: Negative reviews are shared monthly with the relevant tech lead, PM, and designer [00:22:01](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">00:22:01</a>).
    *   **Metrics**: NPS, CSAT, and "operational overhead" (percentage of tickets from a product area normalized by users) are regularly reported [00:22:16](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:16">00:22:16</a>).
    *   **Bug Management**: Bugs are fixed immediately, with direct assignment to engineers on call [00:23:06](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">00:23:06</a>), [00:23:37](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:37">00:23:37</a>). There is no "bug backlog" [00:23:06](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">00:23:06</a>).
    *   **User Confusion**: If support tickets due to customer confusion are elevated, teams are halted from shipping new features until these issues are resolved [00:23:30](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:30">00:23:30</a>).

## Key Ingredients for Velocity

### A-Plus Talent
A crucial factor is the "quality of the engineering and design talent" [00:25:09](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:09">00:25:09</a>). Ramp invests in R&D, pays competitive salaries, and cultivates a strong tech brand to attract top talent who want to be empowered [00:25:21](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">00:25:21</a>).
*   **Empowered Engineers**: Engineers are expected to care about winning in the market, understand business context, execute independently, set their own pace, and proactively help resolve issues in Slack channels [01:02:11](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:11">01:02:11</a>). They are also accountable for their product's performance and feedback [01:04:02](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:02">01:04:02</a>).
*   **Founders' Engagement**: Leaders, including founders, stay engaged by commenting on project channels and attending design critiques, amplifying a culture of excitement around building [00:28:44](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:44">00:28:44</a>).

### Lean Product Team
With a ratio of about 1 PM to 8-15 engineers, Ramp operates with fewer PMs than many companies [00:57:20](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:20">00:57:20</a>).
*   **Shared PM Responsibilities**: By having a lean PM team, other roles (engineers, designers, data scientists) are compelled to "think like PMs," taking on responsibilities like defining specs, priorities, and scopes [00:58:11](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:11">00:58:11</a>).
*   **Product Operations**: A dedicated product operations team handles project management, issue management, release management, enablement, content, beta programs, and customer research [00:59:01](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:01">00:59:01</a>).
*   **Reduced Low-Leverage Work**: PMs avoid low-leverage tasks like writing extensive tickets [00:59:31](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:31">00:59:31</a>). Their "contract" with engineering teams is a high-level vision and priority, with engineers accountable for breaking down work and creating their own tickets [00:59:51](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:51">00:59:51</a>).

The core PM job at Ramp involves:
*   Team building and fostering pod culture [01:00:31](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:31">01:00:31</a>).
*   Ensuring the team stays focused on key areas [01:01:04](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:04">01:01:04</a>).
*   Protecting the team from external stakeholders and acting as a central point of contact [01:01:10](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:10">01:01:10</a>).

## Avoiding Burnout

Ramp believes that velocity can actually help avoid burnout [00:30:04](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:04">00:30:04</a>).
*   **Impact as Motivation**: Burnout often occurs when effort doesn't lead to impact [00:29:53](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:53">00:29:53</a>). High velocity ensures that work is constantly moving and creating tangible results, fostering a "flow state" and making work thrilling [00:30:13](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:13">00:30:13</a>).
*   **Meaningful Work**: When individuals feel ownership over their work and it's meaningful to *them*, rather than simply being pushed onto them, burnout is radically avoided [00:31:44](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:44">00:31:44</a>).

## Strategy and Planning

Ramp's [[product_management_insights | strategy]] is a "contract" with its teams, positioned between a vision and a roadmap [00:37:59](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:59">00:37:59</a>). A strategy document typically includes:
*   Goals [00:38:10](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:10">00:38:10</a>)
*   Hypothesis [00:38:13](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:13">00:38:13</a>)
*   Unique positioning as a company [00:38:19](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:19">00:38:19</a>)
*   Metrics [00:38:23](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:23">00:38:23</a>)
*   Initiatives [00:38:27](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:27">00:38:27</a>)
*   Risks [00:38:29](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:29">00:38:29</a>)
*   Long-term outcomes [00:38:31](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:31">00:38:31</a>)

Each "pod" (team) writes its own strategy document, aligned with the overall high-level product and financial strategy [00:38:37](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:37">00:38:37</a>).

### Planning Process
*   Ramp moved from a quarterly OKR system that took too long (33% of the time) to a bi-annual, one-pager company priorities document [00:39:56](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:56">00:39:56</a>).
*   [[delta_4_framework_for_product_development | OKRs]] are primarily used for cross-functional initiatives or financial goals rather than detailed product planning [00:42:50](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:50">00:42:50</a>). The product roadmap is considered the core contract for product teams [00:44:07](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:07">00:44:07</a>).

### "Right to Win"
A critical aspect of strategy is understanding "why we're uniquely positioned" to succeed in a market [00:40:44](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:44">00:40:44</a>). For instance, Ramp entered bill payments because it leveraged existing components from its corporate card platform: money movement, liability processing, accounting system integrations, and a robust risk process [00:41:09](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:09">00:41:09</a>).

## Thinking from First Principles

Given Ramp's unique business model (a credit card company, payments company, and software company for both SMBs and Enterprise) [00:45:12](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:12">00:45:12</a>), [[understanding_work_for_product_development | thinking from first principles]] is essential. This means avoiding "pattern matching" from past experiences and instead returning to the fundamental aspects of what the company is trying to achieve [00:45:47](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:47">00:45:47</a>).
*   **Hiring**: Ramp hires people who can set aside prior experience and think deeply from first principles [00:46:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">00:46:00</a>).
*   **Support Team Example**: The support team at Ramp reports directly to product [00:47:02](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:02">00:47:02</a>). The first principle applied was: "every support ticket is a failure of our product" [00:47:07](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:07">00:47:07</a>). This structure holds the product team accountable for support issues. Instead of focusing on resolving tickets, the support team is incentivized to decrease the *number* of tickets and increase deflection [00:47:50](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:50">00:47:50</a>). This led to hiring a "different breed of people" and an extremely low contact rate (under 30 agents for over 400,000 users) [00:47:56](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:56">00:47:56</a>).

## Personal Productivity & Writing

Ramp's leadership, including Jeff Charles, emphasizes the importance of focused, deep work and effective communication.
*   **Writing for Clarity**: Writing is used as a tool to clarify thinking, especially when facing complex, unsolved problems [00:49:02](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:02">00:49:02</a>), [00:50:47](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:47">00:50:47</a>). The process involves taking out paper, writing a simple question, and thinking deeply before seeking external answers [00:49:40](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:40">00:49:40</a>).
*   **Deep Work**: Jeff blocks out specific time for deep work, often during early mornings, late afternoons, or even on weekends, to avoid being in the "critical path" and to think without interruption [00:53:22](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:22">00:53:22</a>).
*   **Task Management**: A robust, simple task management system is used to track owed tasks from meetings, group them logically (tactical vs. strategic, important vs. less important), and follow up asynchronously [00:54:59](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:59">00:54:59</a>).
*   **Minimizing Distractions**: Best practices include turning off notifications, quitting Slack during deep work, checking emails only once a day, and checking Slack only at the top of the hour [01:14:29](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:29">01:14:29</a>).
*   **Tool Proficiency**: Teams are encouraged to be highly proficient with their core tools (e.g., calendar, Slack, email) [01:15:07](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:07">01:15:07</a>).

## Hiring Philosophy

When interviewing, Ramp seeks candidates with:
*   **Strong Desire for Impact**: Evidenced by past achievements or the reasons for seeking new roles (e.g., leaving a slow, bureaucratic environment) [01:06:08](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:08">01:06:08</a>).
*   **Ability to Think Deeply**: Assessed by probing candidates on past decisions and trade-offs [01:06:44](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:44">01:06:44</a>).
*   **Less Emphasis on Experience**: While experience is valued, Ramp prioritizes a candidate's hunger and deep thinking capacity, as their unique business may render some past experiences less directly applicable [01:07:02](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:02">01:07:02</a>).

To break into [[customer_engagement_and_product_development | product development]], Jeff recommends finding adjacent roles that allow for deep customer and product understanding, such as product operations, business operations, sales engineering, or solutions engineering [01:08:16](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:16">01:08:16</a>).

Bengali Kaba, with a career spanning early growth PM at Facebook, Head of Growth at Instagram, VP of Product at Instacart, and Director of Product Management at YouTube, emphasizes the critical role of coaching and mentoring in [[building a successful product management team | product management]]. His diverse background, including six years in education as a teacher and a dean, heavily influences his leadership philosophy [00:45:48].

## Product Management as a Team Sport: The Coach Mentality

Bengali views leading product teams not as a "CEO" role, but as being a coach [00:52:01]. In this analogy, not everyone needs to be a "star player"; strong "role players" are essential and need to feel valued [00:52:23]. The coach's responsibility is to identify roles, groom these role players, and ensure they have the right position within the team [00:52:30].

### The Coaching Tree

Inspired by college basketball, Bengali promotes the concept of a "coaching tree" or "leadership tree" [00:52:51]. This means product leaders should take pride in developing their team members, nurturing them to grow into their next roles, and seeing their success as their own [00:53:30]. He cites former team members now leading growth at Stripe or serving as CPOs as examples of his own coaching tree [00:53:45]. This mentality reinforces the responsibility to coach people to greatness [00:54:01] and helps leaders delegate tasks to focus on "bigger things" [00:54:41].

## Cultivating Skills and Addressing Gaps

Bengali's educational background has shaped his approach to skill development within teams. He notes strong parallels between managing a classroom of 27 seven-year-olds and managing a product team: in both scenarios, no one owes you anything, requiring strong communication, a clear vision, and effective influence to achieve goals [00:46:40].

### Bloom's Taxonomy for Product Managers

Bengali applies Bloom's Taxonomy, an educational framework for critical thinking, to product management [00:47:59]. This pyramid-like framework helps identify where team members are struggling in their thinking:
*   **Knowledge:** Do they have the core information needed?
*   **Comprehension:** Do they understand it?
*   **Application:** Can they apply it?
*   **Analysis:** Can they analyze it across different business segments?
*   **Synthesis:** Can they synthesize information?
*   **Evaluation:** Can they evaluate and prioritize?

This framework helps leaders meet people where they are, providing targeted support instead of simply telling them to "figure things out" [00:49:05]. Common challenges include:
*   **Lack of application opportunity:** Understanding a concept but not having diverse scenarios to apply it [00:49:44].
*   **Inability to synthesize:** Knowing what to do but struggling to connect it to business context or overall strategy [00:50:12].

Managers of managers, in particular, need to operate at the top of this pyramid, synthesizing and evaluating information across their product teams to connect to the bigger picture [00:50:45].

## Practical Strategies for Team Development and Impact

### The "Impact = Environment x Skills" Framework

This personal framework, detailed in Bengali's blog post "How to Choose Where to Work and What to Work On," highlights that "impact" is the key output to optimize for in one's career [00:08:00]. Compensation and leveling are derivatives of impact [00:09:00]. For product managers, impact means:
1.  Driving extreme clarity about product problems, opportunities, focus, and prioritization [00:09:54].
2.  Delivering on that impact, showing progress quickly, and consistently delivering "wins" [00:10:34].

The framework breaks down impact into two main variables:
1.  **Environment:** Your manager, resources, scope, team, compensation, and company culture [00:11:08]. Bengali scores these annually [00:12:10]. Your manager is the "most important variable" as they have the power to influence and fix other environmental factors [00:16:25].
2.  **Skills:** Communication, influence, leadership, strategic thinking, and execution [00:18:46]. Communication is often the most impactful [00:18:59].

### Building Skills

To build skills, Bengali recommends:
*   **Being a voracious reader:** Consuming blog posts, podcasts, and thought leaders to build a toolkit of frameworks and mental models [00:19:55].
*   **Having a "stable of mentors":** Instead of one mentor, aim for three or four, meeting each monthly on different weeks to ensure consistent support and diverse perspectives [00:20:18]. To find a mentor, ask trusted colleagues for recommendations based on specific challenges or skills you want to learn [00:24:03].
*   **Observing and learning from others:** Product management has an "art and a science" [00:21:13]. Observe how others hone their craft, deliver, and lead teams, and "steal" their effective techniques [00:21:29]. An example shared is learning active listening, recasting, and crystallizing action items from a colleague at Instagram [00:22:32].

### The Power of "Understand Work"

Bengali champions "understand work" as a crucial, intentional phase in product development, especially at scale [00:25:50]. This counter-intuitive approach slows down initial execution to accelerate long-term impact [00:34:26].

*   **Anti-Pattern:** The common "identify, justify, execute" cycle where a team builds something they *think* is a good idea, pulls data to justify it, and then realizes it doesn't succeed due to a lack of deep understanding [00:26:51].
*   **Preferred Approach:** "Understand, identify, execute" [00:27:39].
*   **Operationalizing Understand Work:**
    *   It's an "intentional affordance" on the roadmap [00:27:54]. Dedicated time is allocated for roles like PMs writing strategy, designers prototyping, data scientists pulling funnels, and engineers instrumenting logging [00:28:06].
    *   Initially, teams may dedicate a higher percentage (e.g., 40%) to understand work, shifting to higher execution (e.g., 80%) as understanding grows [00:31:52].
    *   It clarifies root causes, "jobs to be done," and use cases, allowing teams to push back on immediate build requests if understanding is lacking [00:29:16].
    *   It creates "parallel paths of work" â€“ executing on high-conviction items while simultaneously doing understand work for future sprints [00:29:56]. This "velocity multiplier" leads to a higher win rate for shipped products [00:30:32].
*   **Examples:**
    *   At Instagram, initial understand work involved instrumenting the signup flow to identify drop-off points, then running experiments based on that data [00:39:51].
    *   At YouTube, a team working on paid virtual goods for live experiences needed to map out the entire live ecosystem funnel, which involved understand work from engineering, data science, and PMs dogfooding the experience [00:33:17].
    *   At Instacart, understand work revealed that while people were buying groceries to "make a meal," the product was organized by individual ingredients, making it hard to find items for a specific meal like "taco Tuesday" [00:59:00]. Similarly, the difficult reordering process, despite 90% of repeat orders being the same, was a critical area for improvement [01:00:59].

### Initial Approach to New Teams

When joining a new team, Bengali focuses on deep listening and building relationships [01:36:11]. He attends team meetings, listens to PMs, designers, engineers, and others, aiming to learn their names and stories [01:36:11]. This investment in understanding individuals and their perspectives makes them more receptive to his ideas later [01:37:00].

### Addressing Challenges

*   **"Managing Complex Change" Framework:** Bengali uses a five-component framework (Vision, Skills, Incentives, Resources, Action Plan) to diagnose team issues [00:42:02]. Each missing component leads to a different negative outcome (e.g., missing vision causes confusion, missing incentives causes resistance, missing action plan causes false starts) [00:42:43]. This helps him pinpoint where to intervene.
*   **Addressing Skills Gaps:** He brings a "deck" of different skills and frameworks to "uplevel teams fast" by providing a shared language and mental models [00:43:49]. For example, he introduced a mental model for "product craft" at YouTube, which Instagram had previously excelled at [00:44:08].
*   **Learning from Past Failures:** His time as VP of Product at Instacart, while successful for the company, was a personal "failure corner" for him [01:29:38]. He realized he had a vision for the product but wasn't aligned with the company's DNA, which was heavily operations-focused and needed a more tactical, hands-on leader at that time [01:30:00]. The lesson learned: when considering a new role, engage in "understand work" not only with current employees but also with former employees, who can provide a "raw and different" perspective [01:31:18].

## The Adjacent User Theory

A concept popularized by Bengali during his time at Instagram, the "adjacent user" theory is crucial for [[the future of product management | growth]] in hypergrowth products [01:03:21].
*   **Problem:** In rapidly growing products, the users acquired in one period can be completely different from those acquired a few months later [01:03:36]. If the product isn't adapted, retention curves can decline [01:04:50].
*   **Solution:** Product teams must:
    *   Understand who is using the product today and why [01:04:44].
    *   Anticipate and understand who the *next* user is (the "adjacent user") and why the current product might not work for them [01:05:05]. This involves understanding their tech savviness, phone type, cultural context, and "jobs to be done" [01:05:12].
    *   Dogfood the product *as* that adjacent user, literally using it from their perspective to identify broken or missing experiences [01:06:04].
    *   Engage in user research by talking to and visiting these users in real-time [01:06:49].
*   **Impact:** This focus helps tailor the product experience to continue attracting and retaining new cohorts, even if they differ significantly from early adopters [01:05:59]. While essential for hypergrowth, it's also helpful for companies seeking to capture more market share by identifying and serving the needs of those just outside their current user base [01:07:29].

## Notable Growth Insights from Experience

*   **Focus on Core Value and Habit Building:** Most growth opportunities lie in the onboarding-to-habit-building experience, ensuring users understand the product's "aha moment" and build consistent usage [01:09:02]. Retention is key for compounding growth over time [01:09:47].
*   **Compounding Growth Loops:** Successful growth comes from building multiple, reinforcing acquisition channels [01:10:05].
    *   **Instagram Example:** Beyond core invitations, strategic partnerships with celebrities were crucial [01:10:49]. These celebrities not only set norms for platform usage but also generated media coverage that drove [[SEO]] (Search Engine Optimization) [01:11:23]. The launch of Instagram Web also significantly boosted [[SEO]] and international growth [01:13:36].
    *   **Connections Pivot:** Initially, Instagram's system treated all follows equally, leading to users following many celebrities but few friends [01:16:30]. When these users made their first post, they lacked engagement from friends, leading to churn [01:17:52]. A "connections pivot" prioritized helping new users connect with their friends early on, which "literally doubled" retention and led to the discovery of multi-account usage patterns, spawning a new team dedicated to seamless account navigation [01:18:21].
*   **Facebook India Example:** In India, Facebook's "People You May Know" feature was underperforming because profile pages, designed for Western paradigms (school, job title), lacked relevant information for local users, where names were common (e.g., "Amit Kumar") and professions differed [01:26:11]. Users resorted to looking at photos to identify friends' cars or animals [01:28:25]. This highlights the need for deep "understand work" in specific cultural contexts [01:29:06].

By focusing on understanding user needs, fostering a coaching environment, and continuously developing skills, Bengali Kaba demonstrates a holistic approach to [[building a successful product management team | product management]] and [[the future of product management | growth]].

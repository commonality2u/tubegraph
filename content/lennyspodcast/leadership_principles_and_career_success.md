Ethan Evans, a former Vice President at Amazon, executive coach, and course creator, focuses on helping individuals grow into executive roles and build [[leadership_and_career_advancement | leadership skills]] for senior positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. Throughout his 15-year tenure at Amazon, he was involved in developing and managing significant products like Prime Video, the Amazon App Store, Prime Gaming, and Twitch Commerce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. He also contributed to drafting one of Amazon's 14 core [[leadership_and_career_advancement | leadership principles]] and holds over 70 patents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## The Magic Loop for Career Advancement

The "Magic Loop" is a five-step framework designed to [[leadership_and_career_advancement | grow your career]] in almost any circumstance, even with a challenging manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.

### Steps of the Magic Loop
1.  **Do your current job well** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>: You must be performing at a solid level, ensuring your manager doesn't wish for you to be different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. This means addressing any problems your manager identifies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
2.  **Ask your boss how you can help** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>: Few people do this, and it immediately sets you apart, building a relationship based on teamwork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.
3.  **Do whatever they ask** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>: Even if the task isn't glamorous, fulfilling what's asked builds trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.
4.  **Propose a mutually beneficial goal** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>: After helping, ask your manager how you can assist them in a way that also helps you achieve your personal career goals (e.g., changing roles, getting a raise, learning a new skill) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. Managers are generally open to meeting halfway with those who help them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.
5.  **Repeat** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>: Continuously engage in this loop to build a partnership with your leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

### Why the Magic Loop Works
The Magic Loop is so effective because managers are rarely offered help and often feel overwhelmed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>. It leverages the human tendency to help those who help us, fostering an alliance rather than an adversarial relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>. Many managers, even with good intentions, are too busy to focus on their employees' [[building_a_meaningful_career | career development]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>. This process puts you in control of your situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.

It also implicitly forces the identification of skill gaps needed for the next level and encourages sharing your career goals with your manager, which they may not know <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>.

### Applicability and Success Stories
The Magic Loop can be applied from entry-level positions to very senior roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>. One entry-level person applied it and received a $30,000 raise and a bigger job offer, eventually moving to another company for an even greater increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>. Another individual, following this process, advanced from a mid-level engineer to an executive managing 800 people at Amazon over eight years, later founding his own startup and becoming an Executive Vice President at an online bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>.

At the executive level, the explicit conversation of the Magic Loop may peter out, as leaders are expected to be proactive, anticipate needs, and keep their managers informed of problems solved and opportunities seized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>. This "advanced mode" requires a high level of rapport and trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>.

Managers can also initiate the Magic Loop from their side by asking employees about their career goals and proposing partnerships to help them grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.

## [[advice_for_career_advancement_at_senior_management_levels | Advice for Career Advancement at Senior Management Levels]]

It is common for senior managers (e.g., L7, M1, M2 levels) to get stuck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:37">[00:23:37]</a>. This is due to:
*   **Choke Points:** There are fewer director and VP positions than senior manager roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a>.
*   **Economic Conditions:** In lean economic environments, companies flatten organizations, leading to fewer open roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:53">[00:27:53]</a>.
*   **Shift in Skills:** While being strong in your function and execution can get you to senior manager, director and VP roles require more influence, coordination, and strategic thinking, necessitating a change in behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>. As Marshall Goldsmith's book states, "What Got You Here Won't Get You There" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:04">[00:25:04]</a>.

To advance, patience is required, as opportunities may be limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:43">[00:25:43]</a>. However, much is still in your control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:11">[00:26:11]</a>. Start practicing next-level skills, take on strategic projects, and cultivate inventiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:13">[00:26:13]</a>. The goal is to make yourself the indispensable person who will be chosen when an opportunity arises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:44">[00:26:44]</a>.

## Inventiveness as a Leadership Trait

Jeff Bezos often described himself primarily as an inventor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a>, aiming for Amazon to be the most inventive company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:33">[00:29:33]</a>.

Ethan Evans, who now holds over 70 patents, learned to be systematically inventive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:10">[00:30:10]</a>:
1.  **Be an expert:** You need a foundational understanding of the area you wish to innovate in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>.
2.  **Dedicate time to thinking:** Set aside focused time, free from distractions, to concentrate on problems and potential solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:57">[00:30:57]</a>. Two hours once a month can be sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:40">[00:33:40]</a>.
3.  **Combine existing ideas:** Invention often comes from putting two existing concepts together rather than creating something entirely new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:19">[00:31:19]</a>. For example, combining the concept of aircraft carriers with drone delivery led to an idea for a truck-based drone system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:05">[00:32:05]</a>.

While generating a good idea is important, the expression and optimization of that idea often take years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:47">[00:33:47]</a>. Bezos also emphasized that much of Amazon's innovation comes from the optimizing phaseâ€”making products cheaper, better, and faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:37">[00:34:37]</a>.

## Standing Out in Interviews

Based on interviewing over 2,200 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:14">[00:36:14]</a>, Ethan Evans highlights key factors for standing out:
*   **Appearance and Enthusiasm:** These are consistently the top two factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:35">[00:36:35]</a>. Show genuine interest in the job; interviewers want to work with enthusiastic candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:49">[00:36:49]</a>.
*   **Focus on Impact, Not Just Tasks:** Candidates, especially at higher levels, often describe *what* they did but not *why it mattered* or the impact it had <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:24">[00:37:24]</a>. Leaders hire to solve problems, so demonstrate how your past actions made a difference for previous employers or customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:34">[00:37:34]</a>.
*   **Virtual Interview Presence:** Show full dedication by avoiding interviews from a car, having your camera on, and maintaining eye contact. Project excitement and appreciation through the camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:39">[00:38:39]</a>. Being fully engaged and energetic is a significant advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:14">[00:39:14]</a>.

## [[overcoming_failures_and_setbacks_in_career | Overcoming Failures and Setbacks in Career]]

Ethan Evans shared a pivotal experience where he "failed" Jeff Bezos on the launch of the Amazon App Store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:02">[00:41:02]</a>. The launch was delayed, and a key feature highlighted in Bezos's introduction letter wasn't working due to database issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:50">[00:41:50]</a>.

### Lessons from Failure
1.  **Own the mistake:** Immediately take ownership and state that you will deal with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:28">[00:44:28]</a>.
2.  **Proactive and consistent communication:** Continuously update stakeholders (e.g., hourly updates) on the status, actions being taken, and next steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:39">[00:43:39]</a>. This builds trust one hour at a time and prevents micromanagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:12">[00:51:12]</a>.
3.  **Seek support:** Leverage internal networks and allies. In Ethan's case, AWS provided principal engineers to help fix the database issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:39">[00:45:39]</a>.
4.  **Face the challenge in person:** It's harder for people to be angry or accusatory face-to-face than via email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:13">[00:49:13]</a>. Ethan intentionally sat next to Jeff Bezos at a meeting, which led to a human conversation and eventual forgiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:14">[00:48:14]</a>.
5.  **Don't quit or live in shame:** Even after a significant public failure, it's possible to recover and advance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:53">[00:52:53]</a>. Ethan's persistence and bullheadedness helped him re-earn trust and get promoted to VP two years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:44">[00:49:44]</a>.
6.  **"Fear the New York Times headline":** As a senior leader, consider the broader impact of your decisions. At Amazon's scale, a mistake can become front-page news, necessitating extreme caution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:51">[00:56:51]</a>.
7.  **Prioritize quality and user experience over surprise launches:** Avoid promising launch dates that might compromise the product's reliability. Beta testing, even with potential leaks, is preferable to a flawed public launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:19">[00:58:19]</a>.
8.  **Support your team members:** Acknowledge and reassure team members who make mistakes, especially junior ones. Ensure they don't feel undue responsibility for systemic failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:55">[00:59:55]</a>.

## Amazon Leadership Principles

Amazon has 14 core [[leadership_and_career_advancement | leadership principles]], which have evolved over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:09">[01:01:09]</a>. Ethan Evans helped craft the language for the "Ownership" principle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:47">[01:00:47]</a>, specifically the phrase, "An owner never says, 'That's not my job'" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:27">[01:02:27]</a>. This phrase became a fundamental part of the principle and is one of Ethan's most impactful contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:55">[01:02:55]</a>.

Other significant principles include:
*   **Bias for Action:** This principle emphasizes that speed matters in business, and many decisions are reversible, so it's important to move quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:30">[01:03:30]</a>. In a competitive environment, being quick is necessary, even if it involves some risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:46">[01:03:46]</a>.
*   **Leaders are Right, a Lot:** This principle, later refined to "Leaders actively work to disconfirm their beliefs" and "seek diverse perspectives," stresses the importance of being open to new evidence and questioning your own assumptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:42">[01:07:42]</a>. This also subtly encourages diversity, equity, and inclusion, recognizing that a variety of perspectives leads to better decisions for a broad customer base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:19">[01:08:19]</a>.
*   **Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit:** This principle, also referred to as "disagreeing and committing," encourages leaders to challenge decisions respectfully but commit fully once a decision is made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:22">[01:07:22]</a>.

## Contrarian Opinions

Ethan Evans holds several contrarian views:
*   **Return to Office Movement:** He is contrarian about the push to return to the office, arguing that offices (dating back to 1726) have reached their peak improvement, while remote work, a relatively new practice, has vast unexplored potential for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:12">[01:09:12]</a>.
*   **Business on a Handshake:** He believes too much of the world is contract-driven, leading to a loss of trust. He prefers doing business based on a handshake and mutual trust, even if it occasionally means getting burned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:42">[01:10:42]</a>.
*   **Trust and Faith:** Echoing Sam Altman, Ethan advocates for trusting people and assuming things will work out, believing that on balance, this approach leads to better outcomes for everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:32">[01:11:32]</a>.

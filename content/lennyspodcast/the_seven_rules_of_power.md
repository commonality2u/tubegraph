Jeffrey Pfeffer, a professor of organizational behavior at Stanford's Graduate School of Business, teaches a highly popular and oversubscribed course called "The Paths to Power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. His recent book, *The Seven Rules of Power*, summarizes principles for building and wielding influence and advancing in one's career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>. The class is known for being "the cod liver oil of The Graduate School of Business" – something that's good for you, but makes you feel a little nervous about it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>.

## Why Power is Important
Acquiring power is crucial for career advancement, leading to promotions, happiness, and reduced stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. Research by Gerald Ferris and his colleagues demonstrates that political skill is associated with positive outcomes, including higher salary, promotions, and job satisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>.

Many people feel uncomfortable with the idea of power because its realities often do not align with conventional upbringing or societal ideals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>. However, just as a hammer can be used for good or bad, power is a tool whose utility is separate from how it has been used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>. If good people want power to be used for good, then more good people need to acquire power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>.

It is particularly important for individuals from underrepresented backgrounds to learn power skills, as the world may be "stacked against them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>.

## The Seven Rules of Power
Jeffrey Pfeffer outlines seven core rules for acquiring and maintaining power:

1.  **Get out of your own way** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>
2.  **Break The Rules** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>
3.  **Show up in a powerful fashion** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>
4.  **Create a powerful brand** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>
5.  **Network relentlessly** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>
6.  **Use your power** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>
7.  **Understand that once you've acquired power, what you did to get there will be forgiven, forgotten, or both** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>

### Rule 1: Get Out of Your Own Way
This rule addresses the [[the_psychology_of_power_and_selfpromotion | psychological barriers]] people create for themselves. If one views power as "dirty" or "evil," they will shy away from the actions necessary for career success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>.

Another common barrier is impostor syndrome, where individuals believe they don't deserve their position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>. This can manifest as preemptory apologies ("I don't know if this comment is going to be useful") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. It's crucial not to use self-disempowering descriptors or harbor attitudes that suggest you don't deserve your job, as this will leak out and affect how others perceive you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.

One must prioritize competence and respect over being liked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>. As the saying goes, "if you want to be liked, get a dog" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>. While not actively trying to be disliked, focusing on performance and getting the job done is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.

### Rule 2: Break The Rules
Breaking rules helps one stand out and become memorable, which is vital for visibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>. Rules are often established by those who benefit from the existing system, and disrupting them is akin to disrupting an industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>. To be successful, one must do what plays to their strengths and helps them stand out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.

A common rule to break is "don't ask for help" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>. Research shows that people overestimate how many times they'll have to ask for help, and asking for help makes people uncomfortable, but it's often necessary to get what you want <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.

### Rule 3: Show Up in a Powerful Fashion
Appearance and demeanor significantly impact how others perceive one's power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. Studies suggest that people respond mostly to how others look, secondarily to how they sound, and least to the content of what they say <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>.

Skills related to "showing up powerful" include:
*   Not reading from notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>
*   Making eye contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>
*   Keeping statements brief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>
*   Not apologizing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>
*   Using more gestures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>
*   Adopting open body posture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>
*   Using a louder voice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:00">[04:19:00]</a>
*   Invading personal space (e.g., gentle touching, standing close) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>
*   Disinhibited laughter and humor, as "if you can give people to laugh, you can tell them anything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>

These are learned skills, not innate personality traits, and can be mastered through practice and coaching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>.

### Rule 4: Create a Powerful Brand
With fewer positions at the top, one's job is to figure out how to get promoted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>. This requires differentiation; people need to know who you are and that you are capable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>. A powerful personal brand creates value for both the individual and their organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>.

Examples of [[building_and_wielding_influence | building a brand]] include:
*   Starting a podcast or newsletter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>
*   Writing and contributing to books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>
*   Hosting networking dinners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>
*   Strategically dressing and presenting oneself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>

While visibility is important, it must be backed by substance. However, substance without visibility will go unnoticed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>. The idea of self-promotion can be reframed as amplifying the team's impact or scaling oneself by sharing knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.

### Rule 5: Network Relentlessly
Many find networking uncomfortable, often viewing it as "dirty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>. However, the first principle of networking is generosity – focusing on how you can help others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>. The broader your social network, the more people and knowledge you will acquire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>.

Networking is a crucial [[role_of_power_in_strategy | strategy]] for gaining knowledge about people and ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>. Success stories like Omid Kordestani, who became Google's 11th employee by networking and demonstrating value rather than strictly "doing his job," highlight the power of this rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>.

A key aspect of effective networking is pursuing "weak ties." Strong ties (family, close friends, immediate colleagues) often share the same information and connections. Weak ties, or people more different from you, are more likely to provide non-redundant information and introduce you to new people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>. Becoming a "broker" by connecting people and groups that benefit from being connected is a powerful way to leverage one's network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>.

### Rule 6: Use Your Power
When in a position of power, using one's resources to achieve outcomes is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>. The more you achieve, the more resources you will be given, and the more opportunities and promotions will follow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>. Success attracts more success, creating a self-perpetuating cycle of growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>.

Moreover, simply demonstrating that one possesses power can lead others to follow their lead more readily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>. People are naturally attracted to power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>.

### Rule 7: Success Excuses Almost Everything
This rule highlights that life is not homeostatic; it is self-fulfilling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:01">[01:00:01]</a>. If people perceive you as powerful, you will become more powerful. If they believe you have no power, you will likely end up with little power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:22">[01:00:22]</a>.

Once power is acquired, past actions are often "forgiven, forgotten, or both" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>. People often overlook flaws in order to associate with money, power, and success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. This rule reflects a pragmatic understanding of how the world operates, based on social science and logic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>.

## Learning and [[overcoming_discomfort_in_acquiring_power | Overcoming Discomfort]]
The discomfort associated with learning about power is a common initial reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>. Students in the "Paths to Power" course typically go through four stages:
1.  **Denial**: "It doesn't work in my culture/organization/religion." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>
2.  **Anger**: "How can you teach us this stuff?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:00">[05:02:00]</a>
3.  **Sadness/Depression**: Accepting the reality of power can be disheartening. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>
4.  **Acceptance**: Embracing the material to benefit from it. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>

These power rules are skills that can be mastered, much like playing an instrument or a sport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>. The key is consistent practice and coaching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:00">[05:55:00]</a>. This approach addresses the "knowing-doing gap," emphasizing that learning sticks when applied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>.

Pfeffer's course incorporates "doing power" assignments, where students actively apply the principles learned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>. Examples include:
*   Setting personal career goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>
*   Identifying and developing key attributes of power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>
*   Creating resources to gain leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>
*   Practicing powerful communication through video assignments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>
*   Developing a personal brand statement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:12:00">[06:12:00]</a>

The approach involves gradually pushing beyond one's comfort zone, similar to the 15% rule where one pushes themselves slightly beyond their current capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>. Getting help, such as engaging a coach or establishing a personal board of directors, is highly recommended to provide advice, social support, and accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.

## The Price of Power
While pursuing power offers significant benefits, it comes with considerable downsides:
*   **Loss of Autonomy**: Powerful individuals often have heavily scheduled lives, with little control over their own time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>. Pfeffer himself chooses autonomy over power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.
*   **Increased Scrutiny and No Privacy**: Holding powerful positions leads to intense public scrutiny of one's personal life, finances, and associations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>.
*   **Trust Dilemma**: When rich and powerful, one may question whether people associate with them because of who they are or because of their position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>.
*   **Impact on Family**: The pursuit of power can come at a significant personal cost, affecting family members and relationships, as evidenced by high divorce rates among powerful individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>.

The class also explores the "price of power," bringing in speakers who have experienced these costs firsthand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>.

## Conclusion
The seven rules of power provide a realistic framework for understanding and operating within the existing social and organizational landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>. By understanding and applying these skills, individuals can increase their effectiveness and achieve their goals, even if the process feels uncomfortable at first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>. Jeffrey Pfeffer's work is ultimately about education, providing resources and tools for individuals to learn and implement these strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>.

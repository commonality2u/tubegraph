Whiz, a rapidly growing software company, achieved unprecedented success by hitting $100 million ARR just 18 months after founding, and later rumored to be exploring an acquisition for over $23 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>. However, this success was not without an initial misstep and a crucial pivot early in its history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>.

## The Initial Idea: A False Start

When Ros Herberg joined Whiz as the first product manager, it was employee number seven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>. The company was initially named "Beyond Networks" with an idea to focus on network security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>. Despite the founding team's strong background in cloud security, they initially decided against it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>.

During this early phase, which coincided with the global shutdown in March, the team conducted 10 to 15 meetings daily with potential B2B customers, primarily CISOs (Chief Information Security Officers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:07:00">[08:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:00">[08:35:00]</a>. They would present their idea using a deck, and customers would often respond with polite affirmations like "Oh, it sounds interesting" or "Would love to hear more" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:00">[09:16:00]</a>.

However, Ros, as the product manager, found herself confused about what they were actually going to build, even after weeks of calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:00">[09:41:00]</a>. She felt like an imposter, believing she was the only one who didn't understand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:38:00">[15:38:00]</a>. Her candid question, "What exactly are we doing here?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:29:00">[10:29:00]</a>, opened a deep discussion within the team.

This revealed a crucial insight: customers were being polite, not genuinely enthusiastic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:00:00">[11:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:20:00">[11:20:00]</a>. The team realized they had a natural human bias to seek affirmation rather than listening for what they *didn't* want to hear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:51:00">[13:51:00]</a>.

## The Pivotal Shift: Cloud Security

Approximately six weeks after Ros joined, the company made a significant pivot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. A five-hour discussion led to the decision to move into cloud security, an area the founding team knew best from their previous roles at Microsoft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:14:00">[18:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:53:00">[08:53:00]</a>.

## Signals of [[productmarket_fit|Product-Market Fit]]

Once the pivot to cloud security was made, the conversations with potential customers drastically changed, indicating true [[productmarket_fit|product-market fit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:37:00">[18:37:00]</a>. The key signals that showed the new idea was working included:

*   **Explicit Purchase Intent**: Customers began asking practical questions like, "How are you pricing this?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>, "How much will this cost?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:22:00">[13:22:00]</a>, and "When can we start doing a PO (purchase order)?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:27:00">[13:27:00]</a>.
*   **Active Engagement and Referrals**: Customers offered to connect the Whiz team to other relevant people within their organization, such as a contact in their team, or pushed for a Proof of Value (POV) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:31:00">[13:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:02:00">[19:02:00]</a>.
*   **Commitment Through "Friction"**: The team learned to test genuine interest by introducing friction. For instance, a Fortune 10 company eagerly completed a long list of technical questions and requirements for a POV, which was initially sent to buy time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:22:00">[19:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:08:00">[20:08:00]</a>. This showed strong commitment and "pull" from the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:56:00">[20:56:00]</a>.

## Lessons from the Pivot

The journey to finding [[productmarket_fit|product-market fit]] provided several valuable lessons:

*   **Volume of Customer Interaction**: Conducting a high volume of customer calls (10-15 daily) is essential to quickly gather feedback and identify patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:39:00">[11:39:00]</a>.
*   **Distinguishing Politeness from Passion**: Founders should not be swayed by polite "this sounds interesting" comments. Instead, they should actively seek signals of deep enthusiasm and concrete intent to purchase or commit time and resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:51:00">[13:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:16:00">[14:16:00]</a>.
*   **Embracing Vulnerability**: Being brave enough to admit "I don't understand" as an internal team member can be the catalyst for crucial discussions and pivots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:49:00">[15:49:00]</a>. This requires an organizational culture where it's safe to be vulnerable and questions are encouraged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:06:00">[16:06:00]</a>.
*   **Founder-Led Sales**: In the early stages, founders should directly engage in sales and close deals, even if it's outside their traditional roles. This hands-on experience provides invaluable learning and builds confidence for future sales hires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:49:00">[21:49:00]</a>.
*   **"Heat" in the Organization**: As a startup evolves, the "heat" or primary focus shifts. Initially, it's in product development, then engineering, then sales, and eventually marketing, as each area becomes the primary bottleneck for growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:21:00">[28:21:00]</a>. This indicates where leadership attention and resources should be directed.

The successful pivot allowed Whiz to achieve its rapid growth, demonstrating the critical role of iterating on ideas and keenly listening to customer signals to find the right [[productmarket_fit|product-market fit]].

Linear, a company co-founded by Ki Sarin, focuses on building its product and company in a distinctive way, emphasizing craft and quality over traditional metrics and structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09">[01:09]</a>. This approach extends significantly to its [[Hiring and team management philosophy in tech startups | hiring]] and team management practices.

## Core Principles

Linear operates on a belief that better products can be built with fewer, highly skilled people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47">[07:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:47">[57:47]</a>. This philosophy shapes their decisions from team size to individual roles and responsibilities.

### Emphasis on Quality and Craft
Linear instills a culture where everyone deeply cares about product quality and craft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:56">[07:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:31">[13:31]</a>. This value is paramount for business success, as collaboration only happens if people genuinely use and enjoy the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06">[08:06]</a>. The founders, including the engineers, have a shared "DNA" for focusing on details and quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:52">[12:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:06">[13:06]</a>.

### Lean Team Structure
Linear maintains a lean team, aiming to have fewer employees who take on broader scopes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:55">[01:00:55]</a>. This contrasts with traditional companies that often create highly specialized roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:05">[01:01:05]</a>.
*   **Limited Product Managers (PMs):** Linear has only one Product Manager, who serves as the Head of Product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27">[01:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47">[01:47]</a>. This individual focuses on defining the overall product direction and aligning teams, rather than managing every meeting or writing every spec <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22">[01:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31">[01:31]</a>.
*   **Distributed PM Responsibilities:** The tasks typically performed by PMs are distributed among engineers and designers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58">[01:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01">[02:01]</a>. For every project, a Project Lead (who can be an engineer or a designer) is assigned, responsible for starting the project, collaborating with the team, and communicating progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04">[01:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07">[01:07]</a>.
*   **Hiring for Broader Scope:** When [[Hiring and team management philosophy in tech startups | hiring]], Linear seeks individuals interested in a broader scope of work than just their specific skill set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28">[02:28]</a>. They look for people who possess product sensibility, strong opinions about products, good judgment, and effective communication skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15">[02:15]</a>. This allows for greater autonomy and efficiency within smaller, more effective units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24">[01:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31">[01:31]</a>.
*   **Slow, Deliberate Growth:** The company has intentionally grown slowly, never more than doubling its size in a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58">[07:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06">[08:06]</a>.

### Unique Hiring Approach: Paid Work Trial
Linear employs a paid work trial as the final step in its [[Hiring and team management philosophy in tech startups | hiring]] process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54">[01:54]</a>.
*   **Purpose:** The trial allows both the company and the candidate to assess their compatibility. Candidates work as mini-contractors, solving a vague problem statement (e.g., building a feature) within a given timeframe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51">[02:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57">[02:57]</a>.
*   **Benefits:**
    *   Candidates gain a realistic understanding of Linear's operational environment, including access to their codebase, Slack, Notion, and team meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42">[04:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32">[05:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34">[05:34]</a>.
    *   Linear observes how candidates operate in their environment, approach problems, think, and make progress quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50">[05:50]</a>.
*   **Feasibility:** While unique, Linear has found this approach highly successful, with very few candidates declining the trial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18">[05:18]</a>. They accommodate candidates' schedules by suggesting weekends or holidays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00">[05:00]</a>.

### Team Management Practices
*   **No AB Tests or Metric-Based Goals:** Linear generally avoids AB testing and specific metric-based goals for features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15">[01:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48">[03:48]</a>. Instead, they focus on understanding the problem and delivering a solution that customers will enjoy, rather than optimizing a specific number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56">[04:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00">[05:00]</a>.
*   **User Understanding and Intuition:** The entire team is encouraged to engage with users frequently through calls, shared Slack channels, and internal discussions to develop a deep understanding of customer problems and product usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59">[04:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01">[06:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04">[06:04]</a>. This collective understanding allows for intuition-driven decisions without heavy reliance on data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41">[07:41]</a>.
*   **Iterative Release with Early Feedback:** Features are launched early to a select, opt-in group of customers (e.g., 1 to 10 companies) to gather feedback and refine the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03">[09:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12">[09:12]</a>. This allows for rapid iteration and refinement before a general public release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06">[10:06]</a>.
*   **"Go Slow to Go Fast" Mentality:** Linear embraces the motto "go slow to go fast," encouraging thoughtful decision-making and avoiding rushed work that might require rework later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:04">[01:36:04]</a>.
*   **Avoiding "Side Quests":** The company emphasizes focusing on the "main quest line" of building the product and making it awesome for customers, avoiding distractions like non-essential internal projects or external requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46">[05:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49">[05:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55">[05:55]</a>.

### Unique Company Culture
Linear, as a fully remote and distributed company, fosters its culture through unique activities:
*   **Baking/Cooking Competitions:** Inspired by "The Great British Baking Show," the company hosts quarterly baking or cooking competitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:44">[01:25:44]</a>. Employees receive a company card to buy ingredients and join a Zoom call to cook together, ask questions, and share results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:12">[01:26:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:44">[01:26:44]</a>. This is a way to maintain connections and friendly competition while emphasizing the "craft" aspect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:10">[01:27:10]</a>.

This [[unique_company_culture_and_business_practices_at_linear | unique company culture]] and approach to team management allows Linear to build a high-quality product efficiently with a highly engaged and product-minded team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:22">[01:24:22]</a>.

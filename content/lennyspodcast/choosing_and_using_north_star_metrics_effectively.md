A North Star Metric (NSM) is a key metric that captures the "units of value being delivered" to customers [00:49:53]. It serves as a primary indicator of product-market fit and guides a company's growth strategy [01:17:58].

## What is a North Star Metric?
A North Star Metric is designed to help a business understand if anyone considers their product a "must have" [03:20:53]. It reflects how many people are experiencing the product's core value [00:50:07]. The purpose of establishing an NSM is to focus the team on a unified goal, especially after achieving initial [[framework_for_improving_productmarket_fit | product-market fit]] [01:17:58].

## How to Choose an Effective North Star Metric

Choosing an NSM is a critical strategic decision that aligns the entire team [01:20:20].

1.  **Start with Core Value**
    The process begins by understanding the "must-have value" of the product, often uncovered through tools like the [[framework_for_improving_productmarket_fit | Sean Ellis Test]] [01:19:51]. The NSM should directly reflect the delivery of this core value to customers [01:20:06].

2.  **Team Alignment and Decision**
    The NSM should be a metric that the entire team decides on together [01:20:20]. This collective decision-making process should be time-capped to ensure efficiency, as a team can often identify a suitable NSM within about 30 minutes if provided with the right "raw ingredients" and a checklist of important criteria [01:20:27].

3.  **Key Characteristics of a Good NSM**
    *   **Not a Ratio:** It should be a standalone metric, not a ratio [01:20:37].
    *   **Up and to the Right:** The metric should naturally trend upwards over time as the business grows, allowing the team to consistently manage and feel positive about its progress [01:20:40].
    *   **Correlates to Revenue, but Isn't Revenue:** While the NSM should correlate with revenue growth, it should not *be* revenue itself [01:20:46]. Revenue is seen as a byproduct of delivering value, not the primary focus of daily actions [01:22:23].
    *   **Reflects Customer Value:** The most important aspect is that it reflects the "units of value from the customer perspective" [01:21:58].

4.  **Importance of Timeframes**
    Including a timeframe (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly) in the NSM is crucial. This helps measure engagement and can significantly influence team behavior [01:23:21]. For instance, Facebook famously shifted its North Star Metric from monthly active users (MAU) to daily active users (DAU), which made the product "way more addictive" because the team's incentives changed to focus on daily engagement [01:17:51].

## Examples of North Star Metrics

Here are some examples of effective North Star Metrics from well-known companies:

*   **Airbnb:** Nights booked [01:22:41]
*   **Uber:** Weekly rides [01:23:00]
*   **Amazon:** Monthly purchases [01:21:25] (focuses on units of value for the customer)
*   **Facebook:** Daily active users (DAU) [01:17:55]
*   **Dropbox:** "Files accessed" (suggested as potentially better than "files hosted," focusing on active value) [01:24:06]
*   **Eventbrite:** Weekly tickets sold (reflects customer success more directly than "weekly events") [01:24:17]

## Impact of North Star Metrics

Establishing and focusing on a North Star Metric can have a profound impact on a company:

*   **Focuses Incentives:** A clear NSM directs the efforts of cross-functional teams, ensuring everyone is working towards a common goal [01:19:13].
*   **Drives Strategy and Experimentation:** It provides a basis for diagramming all the ways to grow that metric and identifies high-leverage opportunities for improvement [00:50:27]. This then leads to running targeted experiments to optimize different parts of the growth engine [00:50:57].
*   **"What Gets Measured Gets Managed":** This adage highlights how a chosen metric directly influences behavior and priorities within the organization [01:17:58].

Effective customer interviewing is a crucial skill for understanding user needs and informing product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>. It enables product teams to make better "bets" on what to build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. Teresa Torres, author of *Continuous Discovery Habits*, emphasizes the importance of making [[effective_customer_interaction_and_feedback_gathering | customer interaction]] a regular, continuous habit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>.

## The Core Purpose of Customer Interviews

All backlog items are considered "bets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. [[Effective Customer Engagement and Validation | Discovery]] helps teams make better bets by continuously gathering feedback loops from customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>. This means constantly delivering and constantly discovering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:00">[00:53:00]</a>.

> "Everything in our backlog is a bet... Discovery is helping us make a better bet." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>

The goal is to understand [[Importance of Customer and User Research | what customers want, why they want it, and how to give it to them]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>.

## Common Mistakes in Customer Interviewing

Many product teams make mistakes that hinder their ability to gather valuable insights:

*   **Asking Direct, Out-of-Context Questions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:38:00">[14:38:00]</a>: Questions like "What do you like to watch on Netflix?" or "How do you decide what to watch?" lead to fast answers that don't reflect actual behavior or capture context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:51:00">[14:51:00]</a>. These "facts" miss the nuanced experiences of the user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:10:00">[15:10:00]</a>.
*   **Focusing on Hypotheticals** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:46:00">[40:46:00]</a>: Teams often focus on what people *would do*, what they *think*, or *why* they think they do something. This information is unreliable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:52:00">[40:52:00]</a>.
*   **Sticking to a Rigid Protocol** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:38:00">[36:38:00]</a>: Using a long list of "who, what, why, how" questions creates an unnatural, non-conversational interview cadence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:41:00">[36:41:00]</a>.
*   **Staying Shallow** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:26:00">[39:26:00]</a>: Interviewers often move on too quickly without digging deeper into moments of friction or opportunity, losing valuable context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:37:00">[39:37:00]</a>.

## Best Practices for [[how_to_effectively_interview_customers | Customer Interviewing]]

To gather rich, actionable insights, consider the following [[how_to_effectively_interview_customers | strategies for conducting effective referral calls and performance reviews | best practices]]:

### 1. Collect Stories, Not Just Facts

Opportunities arise from customer stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:23:00">[14:23:00]</a>. Instead of asking for opinions or predictions, ask users to describe past experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:14:00">[15:14:00]</a>.

*   **Example**: Instead of "What do you like to watch on Netflix?", ask: "Tell me about the last time you watched a movie on a streaming entertainment service." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:14:00">[15:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:40:00">[37:40:00]</a>

This approach yields more reliable information, grounded in specific instances, and reveals unmet needs, pain points, and desires that customers might not even be aware of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:30:00">[15:30:00]</a>.

### 2. Foster a Conversational Cadence

An interview should feel like a natural conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:50:00">[36:50:00]</a>.

*   **Be Curious**: Continuously ask "What happened next?" or "Tell me about that" to help the interviewee recount their story in a timeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:28:00">[38:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:46:00">[39:46:00]</a>.
*   **Active Listening**: Avoid worrying about the next question. Listen intently to the interviewee to identify moments of friction or opportunity to dig deeper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:00:00">[39:00:00]</a>.
*   **Summarize**: Briefly summarize what you've heard to show you're listening and to guide the conversation to areas for more detail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:49:00">[39:49:00]</a>.

### 3. Focus on Behavior

The real measure is understanding what people *actually did* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:58:00">[40:58:00]</a>. Product teams are in the business of understanding and changing behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:37:00">[40:37:00]</a>.

### 4. Develop a Continuous Discovery Habit

Integrate [[effective_customer_engagement_and_validation | continuous discovery]] into your regular workflow, even with limited time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:46:00">[24:46:00]</a>.

*   **One Interview a Week**: This can be as little as one interview a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:49:00">[24:49:00]</a>.
*   **Automate Recruiting**:
    *   **In-Product Opt-in**: Allow customers to opt-in for an interview while using your product or service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:52:00">[27:52:00]</a>. Similar to an NPS survey, but asking "Do you have 20 minutes to talk to us?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:06:00">[28:06:00]</a>. Use scheduling software to let them pick a time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:09:00">[28:09:00]</a>. Tools like Qualaroo, Ethnio, Intercom, Usabilla, and Chameleon can facilitate this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:39:00">[29:39:00]</a>.
    *   **Leverage Internal Teams**: For B2B or decision-makers, use sales, account managers, or support staff who are already in contact with customers to recruit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:34:00">[28:34:00]</a>. Define a weekly trigger (e.g., "looking to talk to someone experiencing X pain point") and have them use scheduling software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:50:00">[28:50:00]</a>.
*   **Minimize Product Team Involvement**: The goal is for the product team to simply show up and conduct the interview, with minimal effort in scheduling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:06:00">[29:06:00]</a>.

### 5. Overcome Pushback

If leaders claim "no time for [[effective_customer_interaction_and_feedback_gathering | discovery]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:11:00">[24:11:00]</a>, it often means they don't have time for project-based research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:19:00">[25:19:00]</a>.

*   **Do it Yourself**: Individual contributors can start by developing these habits personally, even if the organization isn't fully on board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:49:00">[18:49:00]</a>. Find customers through personal networks if formal channels are difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:14:00">[19:14:00]</a>.
*   **Improve Decisions**: Even with a prescribed roadmap, understanding customer and business outcomes through [[Importance of Customer and User Research | user research]] allows for better daily decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:01:00">[20:01:00]</a>.
*   **Small Data is Better Than None**: When criticized for making decisions based on few interviews, remember that often, decisions are made with zero customer data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:51:00">[42:51:00]</a>.
*   **Focus on Behavior Change**: Product teams aim to change behavior, not just seek new knowledge. Small experiments and feedback loops, combined with live production prototyping, can provide reliable data over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:28:00">[43:28:00]</a>.

### 6. Managing Multiple Solutions

To guard against bias towards an "obvious" solution, work with multiple solutions for the same opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:41:00">[31:41:00]</a>. Compare and contrast options to make better decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:45:00">[31:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:01:00">[32:01:00]</a>.

### 7. Team Collaboration

Effective product development relies on collaboration between the product manager, designer, and software engineer (the "trio") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:36:00">[34:36:00]</a>. A well-functioning trio works from a shared understanding, reducing disagreements and continuously seeking better options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:55:00">[34:55:00]</a>.

*   **Practical Example**: Kindergartners often outperform MBA students in collaborative tasks because they "just start doing" and iterate through trial and error, rather than getting caught in politics or extensive planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:50:00">[33:50:00]</a>.

By adopting these practices, teams can achieve a deeper understanding of customer needs and build better products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:54:00">[17:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:56:00">[17:56:00]</a>.

Uri Levine, co-founder of Waze and nine other companies, emphasizes that the core lesson from his extensive experience in building startups, including two unicorns sold for over a billion dollars, is to "fall in love with the problem, not the solution" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. This philosophy underpins the entire startup journey, which he describes as value creation through problem-solving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>.

Levine's book, "Fall in Love with the Problem Not the Solution: A Handbook for Entrepreneurs," summarizes his advice, covering everything from ideation to exiting a company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>.

## The Entrepreneurship Journey

The path of an entrepreneur is characterized by three main dimensions:
*   **A Rollercoaster Journey** Startups experience frequent and dramatic ups and downs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:36:00">[15:36:00]</a>. Ben Horowitz of Andreessen Horowitz famously described sleeping "like a baby," waking up every two hours and crying, to illustrate the intense reality of a startup CEO's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:51:00">[15:51:00]</a>.
*   **A Journey of Failures** Building something new inevitably involves trial and error. Entrepreneurs must be willing to fail fast to have enough time for multiple attempts and iterations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:19:00">[16:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:11:00">[17:11:00]</a>. As Albert Einstein noted, failure indicates trying new things, and Michael Jordan highlighted failure as a path to success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:47:00">[16:47:00]</a>. The goal is to be "good enough," achieved through continuous iteration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:51:00">[17:51:00]</a>.
*   **A Long Journey** Startups take significantly longer than anticipated, especially the period until achieving product-market fit (PMF) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:11:00">[18:11:00]</a>.

Compared to established corporations, which have defined value propositions, products, pricing, and target audiences, startups begin with many unknowns, requiring them to figure out their product, business model, and growth strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:29:00">[18:29:00]</a>.

## Phase 1: Finding Product-Market Fit (PMF)

The initial and longest phase of a startup is dedicated to figuring out Product-Market Fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:10:00">[19:10:00]</a>.

### Definition and Importance
PMF means creating value for customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:17:00">[19:17:00]</a>. Without it, a startup will fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:23:00">[19:23:00]</a>. Once PMF is achieved, the core product typically doesn't change significantly, as it already delivers established value to users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:06:00">[20:06:00]</a>.

### Key Metric: Retention
The single most important metric for PMF is retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:01:00">[21:01:00]</a>. If users return, it indicates value creation; if they don't, value is likely missing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:06:00">[21:06:00]</a>. For high-frequency use products, a 3-month retention rate of 30-50% is a good indicator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:50:00">[26:50:00]</a>. Users often convert and demonstrate retention after their third or fourth use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:03:00">[27:03:00]</a>.

### Waze's Product-Market Fit Journey
Waze, initially successful in Israel, struggled when it expanded globally in late 2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:09:00">[22:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:39:00">[22:39:00]</a>. The product was "not good enough" in major markets like the US and Western Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:44:00">[22:44:00]</a>. Through a year of iterative development based on user feedback, Waze eventually achieved PMF in specific metropolitan areas and countries starting in early 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:58:00">[23:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:00:00">[24:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:06:00">[24:06:00]</a>. However, some markets, like Japan, proved incompatible with Waze's crowdsourcing model due to unique geographical addressing systems requiring "perfect information" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:44:00">[24:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:47:00">[25:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:09:00">[26:09:00]</a>.

## Phase 2: Growth and Business Model

Once PMF is established, the company must shift its focus to growth and figuring out a business model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:04:00">[31:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:08:00">[31:08:00]</a>.

### Shifting Focus
Levine stresses the importance of focusing on one thing at a time. In the PMF phase, sales, business development, and extensive marketing are not priorities; the focus should be on product development to achieve a "good enough" state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:02:00">[33:02:00]</a>. After PMF, the entire company must "shift gears" to focus on growth or business model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:32:00">[33:32:00]</a>. Failing to shift focus can lead to stagnation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:39:00">[34:39:00]</a>. "Focus is not about what we're doing; it's about what we are not doing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:43:00">[34:43:00]</a>.

### High vs. Low Frequency of Use
The sequence of focusing on growth versus business model depends on the product's frequency of use:
*   **High Frequency of Use**: Products like Waze, used daily, naturally generate word-of-mouth growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:30:00">[32:30:00]</a>. In such cases, focus on growth first, and the business model can be figured out later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:06:00">[35:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:15:00">[35:15:00]</a>.
*   **Low Frequency of Use**: For products used infrequently (e.g., tax return software used once a year), growth will not be driven by word-of-mouth as easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:39:00">[32:39:00]</a>. Therefore, it's crucial to figure out the business model first, as user acquisition will likely be a continuous effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:28:00">[35:28:00]</a>.

Waze pivoted its business model from selling map and traffic data to governments to an advertising model, realizing the former involved long sales cycles incompatible with their dynamic mobile internet company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:40:00">[31:40:00]</a>.

## Understanding Users Across Phases

Understanding users is critical for both achieving PMF and driving subsequent growth.

### Watching User Behavior
Entrepreneurs often assume users will use their product as intended, but this is a mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:07:12:00">[1:07:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:07:19:00">[1:07:19:00]</a>. It's crucial to:
*   **Watch new users** and observe their actual behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:07:21:00">[1:07:21:00]</a>.
*   **Ask "why"** if users don't behave as expected. Understanding their reasons is key to making the product successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:07:29:00">[1:07:29:00]</a>.

### User Adoption Groups
Users can be grouped by their ability to adopt new things or behaviors, which typically follows a normal distribution:
*   **Innovators (2%)**: Use new products simply because they are new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:08:20:00">[1:08:20:00]</a>.
*   **Early Adopters**: Try a new product if they perceive value and will continue if it works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:08:41:00">[1:08:41:00]</a>.
*   **Early Majority (1/3 of population)**: This group defines market leaders. They are resistant to change and new behaviors, often asking "what's wrong with what I'm already doing?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:09:00:00">[1:09:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:09:10:00">[1:09:10:00]</a>. They avoid trying new things due to fear of complexity or embarrassment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:09:39:00">[1:09:39:00]</a>.

### Importance of Simplicity
To bridge the gap to the early majority, **simplicity** is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:10:03:00">[1:10:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:10:06:00">[1:10:06:00]</a>. Product development often involves adding features, but once core value is found, unnecessary features should be removed to reduce complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:10:22:00">[1:10:22:00]</a>.

### Learning from Unsuccessful Users
Instead of solely focusing on successful users (those at the "bottom of the funnel"), it's vital to speak with users who failed at different stages (e.g., downloaded but didn't register, registered but didn't use, used but didn't return) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:12:48:00">[1:12:48:00]</a>. Their "why" provides crucial insights to improve the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:13:07:00">[1:13:07:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

[[The role of storytelling and movements in startup success | Storytelling]] and engaging others to "fall in love with the problem" is central to leading people on the startup journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. Entrepreneurs should embrace the reality of a difficult, long, and failure-prone journey, focusing intensely on one key objective at a time, especially [[Navigating zero to one product development within established companies | achieving product-market fit]]. Success depends on understanding user behavior, adapting, and making hard decisions, including in [[Onboarding and decisionmaking at startups | hiring and firing]], to ensure the right team is in place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:27:00">[55:27:00]</a>.

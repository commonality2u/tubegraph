Jason Lemkin, founder of SaaSter, shares insights into building and scaling successful conferences, emphasizing their role in fostering community and driving business growth, particularly in the B2B sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## About SaaSter

SaaSter is described as the world's largest community for SaaS and B2B founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. Jason also runs two of the biggest conferences annually: one in the Bay Area, attracting over 15,000 people, and another in Europe with over 3,000 SaaS executives, founders, and entrepreneurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. Before founding SaaSter, Jason was the CEO and co-founder of EchoSign, which grew to over $100 million ARR before being sold to Adobe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

## The Evolution of SaaSter Events

SaaSter started with the intention of fostering a B2B founder community through content and meetups, rather than large-scale events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:09">[01:50:09]</a>. In 2012 and 2013, early meetups saw attendance in the thousands, which was surprising for the B2B space at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:52">[01:50:52]</a>. This success led to the first one-day SaaS Annual event in 2015, drawing 3,000 attendees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:06">[01:51:06]</a>. The events then continued to grow organically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:11">[01:51:11]</a>.

A key surprise for Jason was the significant international attendance, with founders flying from distant places like Perth, Australia, seeking community and connections that weren't available locally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:47">[01:51:47]</a>.

## Costs and Financial Realities of Running Conferences

Running large-scale events is "extremely expensive" and follows a unique cost curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:15">[01:52:15]</a>:
*   **Small Events:** Very cheap, like a back room at a steakhouse or using a tech company's free office space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:56">[01:52:56]</a>.
*   **Mid-Scale Events:** Hotel ballrooms are "pretty expensive" (e.g., $500,000-$800,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:35">[01:53:35]</a>, but offer a "turnkey" solution allowing marketing managers to easily organize them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:41">[01:53:41]</a>. Customers often don't care about the venue as much as the opportunity to connect and discuss the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.
*   **Large-Scale Events (SaaSter size):**
    *   SaaSter Europa in London costs $2 million to "turn the lights on" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:19">[01:54:19]</a>.
    *   The Bay Area event, hosting 12,000 people, costs $10 million to "turn the lights on" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:26">[01:54:26]</a>.
    *   Costs can approach $1,000 per attendee for mass-scale, multi-day events in locations like the Bay Area or Las Vegas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:41">[01:54:41]</a>. This includes significant expenses for AV ($1.5 million), food and beverage ($1.5 million), and tenting ($800,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:50">[01:54:50]</a>.
    *   Before reaching $20-$30 million in revenue, event margins are "brutal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:08">[01:55:08]</a>. Many large tech companies that once ran their own events (e.g., Twilio, Marketo) often lost money (around $2 million per event) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:13">[01:55:13]</a>.
    *   The business model for large conferences exhibits "diseconomies of scale," where per-person costs increase at larger scales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:42">[01:55:42]</a>.
    *   The first major event canceled by COVID-19 in March 2020 was a SaaSter event, resulting in a $10 million loss in one day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:43">[01:56:43]</a>.

## Benefits of Events for B2B Businesses

Despite the high costs, events are crucial for B2B businesses:
*   **Customer Engagement:** Getting customers and prospects together helps increase sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:28">[01:52:28]</a>. Customers will often "sell your prospects for you" when gathered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:48">[01:52:48]</a>.
*   **Community Building:** Events serve as vital meeting places, especially for founders outside of major tech hubs like Silicon Valley, who might lack a local community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:42">[01:51:42]</a>.

## Advice for Founders on Attending Events

*   **Prioritize Top-Tier Events:** Most founders attend only two events a year on average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:27">[01:57:27]</a>. Focus on attending the one or two best events in your industry, as these attract the top executives, vendors, and attendees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>.
*   **Avoid Sub-Scale Events:** Attending lower-tier events is generally a "waste of time" for meeting and marketing, as they don't attract the best people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:17">[01:57:17]</a>.
*   **Invest in Customer Gatherings:** Even if not a large conference, hosting steak dinners or small meetups for your customers can be highly valuable for lead generation and retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:26">[01:52:26]</a>.

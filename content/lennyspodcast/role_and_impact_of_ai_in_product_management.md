Aman Khan, Director of Product at Arise AI, discusses the [[impact_of_ai_on_product_management | impact of AI on product management]], highlighting how the [[the_role_and_evolution_of_ai_models_in_product_development | role and evolution of AI models in product development]] is shaping the profession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:01">[01:05:01]</a>. Khan has focused his career on building products in the AI space, including at Spotify on the ML platform team, and is known for intentionally staying an individual contributor (IC), a trend influenced by the rise of AI tooling making Product Managers (PMs) more productive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:04">[01:09:04]</a>.

## The AI Product Manager

A traditional Product Manager is responsible for bringing together design, engineering, business development, operations, and sales to ship impactful products, representing the customer and ultimately solving their problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:07">[06:33:07]</a>. The [[changing_role_of_product_management_with_ai | changing role of product management with AI]] introduces three main "flavors" of AI PMs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:06">[06:56:06]</a>:

1.  **AI Platform PMs**: These PMs build tools for AI Engineers, focusing on platforms that help understand the impact of AI applications. An example is an observability and evaluation platform for artificial intelligence models, including large language models (LLMs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:02:02">[07:02:02]</a>.
2.  **AI Product PMs**: This type of PM focuses on products where AI is at the core. The entire product experience is enabled by the underlying AI model, which serves as the "secret sauce." The PM's job is to package this cutting-edge technology to be consumable by businesses, enterprises, or consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:28:09">[08:28:09]</a>. Examples include ChatGPT and NotebookLM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40:02">[08:40:02]</a>.
3.  **AI-Powered PMs**: These are traditional PMs whose roles are enhanced by AI technology across their entire stack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:02">[09:32:02]</a>. They utilize LLMs or other models to build better experiences for their customers, even if they aren't responsible for building the core models from the ground up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:52:02">[09:52:02]</a>. This role is expected to become pervasive, making most PMs some form of an AI PM in the near future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31:09">[10:31:09]</a>.

## AI's Impact on Product Management Productivity

AI significantly enhances productivity for product managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. It makes it feasible for a PM to arrive at a meeting with already mocked-up ideas or even functional prototypes, elevating the starting point for discussions with design and engineering teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This [[applications_of_ai_in_enhancing_productivity_for_product_managers | application of AI in enhancing productivity for product managers]] is a key aspect of the [[the_role_of_ai_in_transforming_product_management | role of AI in transforming product management]].

### Using AI Tools for Product Management and Development

Several tools are proving invaluable for PMs:
*   **Cursor** and **Replit**: Used for quickly building prototypes and understanding what's possible with code, allowing PMs to show up with functional (though not production-ready) prototypes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:07:02">[11:07:02]</a>. Replit, for instance, can build and host a website from a prompt in seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:45:00">[24:45:00]</a>.
*   **Vercel's v0**: Enables users to type a prompt and generate a beautiful landing page, or even a working UI with correct prompting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:36:00">[11:36:00]</a>.
*   **Midjourney** and **DALL-E**: Powerful for graphic design, logo creation, or visual storytelling for user stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:02:04">[12:02:04]</a>.
*   **Gong**: AI-powered call analysis tools can extract insights from customer conversations, helping PMs understand pain points and identify common problems without attending every meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:15">[01:02:15]</a>.

These [[using_ai_tools_for_product_management and development | AI tools for product management and development]] mean that PMs are well-positioned to thrive as AI's capabilities grow, becoming more focused on identifying problems and clearly articulating solutions to AI tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:08:00">[26:08:00]</a>.

## Becoming an AI Product Manager

It is "probably easier now to break into [[ai_in_product_management | AI product management]] than it was before" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:04">[00:30:04]</a>. Previously, a deeper background in machine learning was often required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>. Now, with the proliferation of tools that allow app building in an hour, the focus shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>.

### Key Learnings and Recommendations
*   **Focus on the Problem**: The most crucial aspect for an AI PM is to care about the end customer and be "in love with the problem" they are trying to solve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:29:00">[14:29:00]</a>. AI is a tool to solve problems, not a solution to be forced into every scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:06:00">[36:06:00]</a>.
*   **Fundamental Knowledge**: Start with a foundation of understanding "what is machine learning, what is AI" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:10:00">[19:10:00]</a>. Resources like Andrej Karpathy's videos on the foundations of LLMs are a good starting point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:43:00">[19:43:00]</a>.
*   **Hands-On Experience**: Utilize tools to experiment and push the boundaries of what's possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:06:00">[20:06:00]</a>.
*   **Build a Portfolio**: Since there's no specific degree for AI product management, building a portfolio of prototypes and products that demonstrate your thinking and interests is essential to stand out to hiring managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:30:00">[20:30:00]</a>.
*   **Avoid Replication**: A common pitfall is simply building another internal chatbot or replicating existing foundational models' products just because it feels intuitive or familiar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:53:00">[30:53:00]</a>. Successful AI products often feature interfaces that look "really different" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:03:00">[32:03:03]</a>.
*   **Balance Automation with Control**: Inspired by the "Betty Crocker effect," successful AI products don't necessarily automate everything away. Users often want "some knobs and levers" to feel in control of the experience, similar to the "IKEA effect" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:04:00">[40:04:00]</a>. AI should make products easier to use and lower the barrier to creation, not just fully automate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:34:00">[42:34:00]</a>.

## Thriving as an AI Product Manager

The [[future_of_product_management_with_ai | future of product management with AI]] demands a new approach to thriving.

### Key Strategies
*   **Measure "Shots Taken"**: Companies often lack metrics for the impact of AI within their business beyond direct revenue. AI PMs should consider measuring "how many shots are you taking" or the number of prototypes built to gauge experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:05:00">[37:05:00]</a>.
*   **Embrace Hackathons**: Hackathons are excellent for getting people hands-on with AI, removing the feeling that the technology is unapproachable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:32:00">[37:32:00]</a>. They help identify which AI applications "stick" and which don't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:17:00">[39:17:00]</a>.
*   **Obsess over User Experience**: Successful AI PMs deeply analyze successful AI products to understand what makes them "magical," often finding that the best AI experiences don't always resemble chatbots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:31:00">[39:31:00]</a>.
*   **"Walk and Chew Gum"**: An AI PM must continuously deliver customer value and move business metrics while also creating space for prototyping, experimentation, and learning from failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:22:00">[43:22:00]</a>. This means accepting that the technology changes fast, and some experiments may not work, but the process drives improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:52:00">[44:52:00]</a>.
*   **Be a "Wanderer"**: Rather than "waiting" for clear direction or new AI models, PMs should be "wanderers" â€“ actively exploring the unknown, trying to find signals, and pushing the boundaries of what the company believes is possible with AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:59:00">[58:59:00]</a>. This can feel "squishy" and uncertain, but it's essential for innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:43">[01:00:43]</a>.
*   **Amplify Signal Through Noise**: Use AI tools (like Gong for sales transcripts) to process vast amounts of information and extract valuable insights, scaling individual capacity and giving PMs a "superpower" in decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:05">[01:02:05]</a>.

Ultimately, the [[impact of ai on product development roles | impact of AI on product development roles]] means PMs must focus on deeply understanding customer problems, leveraging AI as a powerful tool, and maintaining curiosity and adaptability in a rapidly evolving space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:26">[01:00:26]</a>.

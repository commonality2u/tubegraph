Tension is a fundamental element at the core of every art form and every [[inventiveness_and_innovation_in_business | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. It is distinct from stress; while stress is generally negative (e.g., conflicting desires like wanting to leave a job but needing to stay), tension is productive and essential for forward movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:54">[02:47:54]</a>.

## Defining Tension in Strategy

In the context of [[the_importance_of_strategy_and_decisionmaking_in_product_leadership | strategy]], tension embodies the "it might not work" factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:10">[02:48:10]</a>. It represents the space between a promise made and its fulfillment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:16">[02:48:16]</a>. When a new product is launched, a promise is made about what it can do, leading the user to imagine an improved life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:24">[02:48:24]</a>. If users "fall in love with that possibility," tension arises from the question of whether the promise will be kept and if it will work for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:40">[02:48:40]</a>. A great [[the_importance_of_strategy_and_decisionmaking_in_product_leadership | strategy]] inherently possesses tension at its center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:14">[02:11:14]</a>.

### Examples of Tension

*   **PF Flyers**: These sneakers promised to make a child "fast enough to run away from the bully," creating real tension and an expectation of the promise being kept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:42">[02:48:42]</a>.
*   **Google's Homepage**: Marissa Mayer's decision to limit Google's homepage to two buttons, contrasting with Yahoo's 183 links, built a powerful promise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:30">[03:00:30]</a>. This promise, "we are smart enough to take you where you want to go without you spending a lot of time browsing," created tension, as users wondered if Google could indeed deliver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:20">[03:01:20]</a>. This tension was resolved by Google's efficacy, leading to word-of-mouth promotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:51">[03:01:51]</a>.
*   **Salesforce's "No Software"**: The declaration "no software, it's all in the cloud" created tension against the established system of on-premise software, demonstrating a willingness to challenge the status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:17">[03:46:17]</a>.

## The Role of Tension in Challenging Systems

Tension is crucial for challenging existing systems and cultures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:01">[03:33:01]</a>. Systems protect themselves by inventing culture â€“ "the way things are around here" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:42">[03:33:42]</a>. If something feels scary to do, it's often because the system wants you to perceive it that way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:51">[03:33:51]</a>. To drive [[the_role_of_innovation_and_dissatisfaction_with_the_status_quo | innovation]], one must consider why an action is scary, which system it offends, and whether there's leverage to change that system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:04">[03:34:04]</a>.

For instance, early downloadable software faced skepticism about piracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:19">[03:41:19]</a>. However, experimenting with this new distribution model challenged the dominant system of software distribution and could lead to significant change if successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:25">[03:34:25]</a>.

## Strategic Decision-Making and Tension

When [[developing_and_implementing_product_strategy | developing a product strategy]], choices are made that create inherent tension. These choices, which often go overlooked, include:

*   **Choosing Your Customers**: Deciding on the "smallest viable audience" dictates the product's features, pricing, and the future of the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:59">[02:39:59]</a>. Targeting specific customer types (e.g., Raspberry Pi enthusiasts versus mainstream Apple buyers) defines the expected quality and interaction, creating tension if expectations are misaligned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:28">[02:44:28]</a>.
*   **Choosing Your Competition**: The chosen competitive landscape imposes boundaries on actions. Competing against a low-cost leader like Walmart, for example, means facing constant price pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-25:21>[02:51:21]</a>.
*   **Choosing Your Source of Validation**: Deciding whether to please a boss or the agreed-upon target customers fundamentally alters team dynamics and product direction, introducing tension if internal and external validation goals conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:57">[02:53:57]</a>.
*   **Choosing Your Distribution**: The distribution strategy significantly impacts product design and market reception, as seen with video games sold in mass merchants versus those sold through online platforms like Steam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:06">[03:04:06]</a>.

Ignoring these choices out of fear represents a significant [[challenges_in_business_strategy | challenge in business strategy]], as they are intertwined and define the nature of the product and the life of its creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:46">[03:32:46]</a>.

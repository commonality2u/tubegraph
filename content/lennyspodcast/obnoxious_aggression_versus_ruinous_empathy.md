[[Challenging leadership styles and seeking feedback | Radical Candor]] is a framework defined by two axes: "Care Personally" and "Challenge Directly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>. While the goal is to operate in the quadrant where both are present, failures often occur when one or both dimensions are missed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>. Two common pitfalls are **Obnoxious Aggression** and **Ruinous Empathy**.

## Obnoxious Aggression

Obnoxious aggression occurs when an individual remembers to [[Challenging leadership styles and seeking feedback | challenge directly]] but forgets to show that they [[Using empathy as a communication strategy | care personally]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>. This behavior is characterized by acting like a "garden variety jerk" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>.

### Impact of Obnoxious Aggression

*   **Harm to Others**: It directly hurts other people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>.
*   **Inefficiency**: When someone acts obnoxiously aggressive, the recipient enters a "fight or flight" mode, rendering them unable to hear what is being said. This makes the feedback ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>.
*   **Cycle of Avoidance**: Realizing one has acted like a jerk can lead to an instinct to overcorrect by avoiding direct challenge, resulting in [[Usercentered performance and performative customer obsession | manipulative insincerity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>.
*   **Misinterpretation**: While less common than ruinous empathy, individuals may sometimes be unjustly accused of obnoxious aggression, particularly if they are perceived differently due to societal biases, like the "likability-competence bias" faced by women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>.

### Examples

*   **Bridgewater Associates' "Dots" System**: While not explicitly labeled as obnoxious aggression, the description of Bridgewater's culture, where employees are encouraged to give public, recorded, often personal criticism, even to the point of making colleagues cry, is highlighted as "deep dark obnoxious aggression" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:25">[01:01:25]</a>.
*   **Personal Anecdote**: A manager, in a long-standing relationship with a colleague, called him a "dumbass" for repeatedly confusing Slovakia and Slovenia. While this was accepted in their specific relationship, it silenced others present who feared making mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:32">[01:05:32]</a>. This illustrates how even within a caring relationship, the public display of aggressive language can have negative cultural repercussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:49">[01:05:49]</a>.

## Ruinous Empathy

[[Understanding customer emotions and building empathy for product design | Ruinous empathy]] occurs when an individual remembers to [[Using empathy as a communication strategy | care personally]] but fails to [[Challenging leadership styles and seeking feedback | challenge directly]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>. This happens when people are so worried about hurting someone's feelings or offending them that they neglect to share information that would ultimately benefit the other person in the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:00">[06:25:00]</a>. This is considered the most common problem, accounting for approximately 90% of mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:00">[07:12:00]</a>.

### Impact of Ruinous Empathy

*   **False Harmony**: It creates an illusion of harmony that is ultimately detrimental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>.
*   **Missed Opportunity for Growth**: The recipient of ruinous empathy is not given the chance to improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.
*   **Detrimental to Team Performance**:
    *   Team deliverables may be delayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>.
    *   Team members may have to spend time redoing the work of the underperforming individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>.
    *   High-performing team members may quit due to frustration and an inability to do their best work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>.
*   **Painful Outcome**: The lack of direct feedback ultimately leads to more painful outcomes, such as termination, which could have been avoided with timely, candid communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.
*   **Poor Business Results**: It negatively impacts overall business results and investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.

### Connection to People-Pleasing

Ruinous empathy often stems from a leader's inherent desire to be liked, a common trait especially for "people-pleasers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>. Overcoming this requires prioritizing genuine care for the other person's growth and success over one's own discomfort or desire for immediate approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>. It's about realizing that in the long run, it is unkind *not* to provide corrective feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>.

### Example: The Bob Story

Kim Scott recounted a significant experience with an employee named Bob <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>:
*   **Initial Situation**: Bob was charismatic, popular, and a pleasure to work with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>. However, his work was consistently terrible, riddled with sloppy mistakes, a fact he seemed to acknowledge with "shame in his eyes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>.
*   **Kim's Reaction**: Instead of giving direct feedback, Kim would offer vague praise like, "Oh Bob, this is such a great start! You're so awesome, we all love working with you. Maybe you can make it just a little bit better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>. This was driven by a desire not to hurt his feelings (ruinous empathy) and a fear of being seen as a "big you know what" due to Bob's popularity (manipulative insincerity) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>.
*   **The Outcome**: After ten months of Bob's poor performance impacting the team, Kim realized she would lose her best performers if Bob remained. She had to fire him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>. Bob's poignant question, "Why didn't you tell me? I thought you all cared about me," highlighted the profound impact of her ruinous empathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. The failure to challenge directly, despite caring personally, led to Bob's termination and significant negative consequences for the entire team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.

### Overcoming Ruinous Empathy

To overcome ruinous empathy, it's essential to:
1.  **Prioritize Others' Growth**: Shift focus from a desire to be liked to a genuine commitment to helping others succeed and grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>.
2.  **Understand the Long-Term Impact**: Recognize that withholding feedback is ultimately unkind and detrimental in the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>.
3.  **Frame Feedback with Care**: Begin by showing care and stating the intention to be helpful, and then be specific about the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>. For example, instead of vague statements, clearly outline observations and results.
4.  **Embrace Discomfort**: Giving and receiving feedback is inherently uncomfortable. Embrace this discomfort, as it is a necessary part of the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>.

By understanding the distinct characteristics and severe consequences of both obnoxious aggression and ruinous empathy, leaders can navigate communication more effectively, fostering a culture of [[the role of empathy and user insights in product management | genuine care]] and [[Challenging leadership styles and seeking feedback | direct challenge]] for improved relationships and better work.

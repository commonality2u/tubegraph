Anuka Gupta, Chief Product Officer at Rubrik and a lecturer on [[product_management_career_advice | product management]] at Stanford University's Graduate School of Business, shares advice on navigating the journey into the product management field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

## Anuka's Own Path
Anuka herself transitioned into product management from an engineering role within the same company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:20">[00:51:20]</a>. She considers this one of the "simplest ways" to break into the field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:28">[00:51:28]</a>. When she joined LiveRamp, a 20-person startup, as a software engineer, she explicitly stated her interest in growing into a product manager role during the interview process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:54">[00:53:54]</a>.

## Strategies for Breaking In

Anuka recommends several approaches for aspiring product managers:

*   **Internal Transition (Within the Same Company)**:
    *   This is often easier than switching companies and jobs simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:42">[00:51:42]</a>.
    *   **Build Credibility:** First, "crush it at your job" to build credibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:54">[00:51:54]</a>.
    *   **Engage with Product Teams:** Start interacting with the product team, taking on projects, and gaining some experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:59">[00:51:59]</a>.
    *   **Build Relationships:** Cultivate a relationship with a product leader who might be willing to take a chance on you despite a lack of direct product experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:07">[00:52:07]</a>.
    *   **Leverage Existing Knowledge:** Transitioning internally allows you to bring valuable existing knowledge to the product team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:16">[00:52:16]</a>:
        *   **Customer Support:** Deep understanding of customer problems and frequently asked questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:20">[00:52:20]</a>.
        *   **Sales:** Knowledge of how to sell the product, what resonates, and objection handling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:35">[00:52:35]</a>.
        *   **Engineering:** Understanding of how the product is built and its technical nuances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:42">[00:52:42]</a>.
    *   **Strategic Disclosure:** Deciding whether to express interest in product management during an interview depends on the company's size and stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:52">[00:53:52]</a>. For a 20-person startup, it might be beneficial; for a 5,000-person company, it might not be well-received if applying for a non-product role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:17">[00:54:17]</a>.
    *   **Post-Hire Strategy:** Once inside a company, find ways to build relationships with product leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:36">[00:54:36]</a>. In very small startups without existing product management, take initiative on product-related projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:41">[00:54:41]</a>.

*   **Joining Product-Adjacent Roles:**
    *   Seek roles in functions that regularly interact with product teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:21">[00:53:21]</a>.
    *   Most functions are product-adjacent due to product's broad engagement within a company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:25">[00:53:25]</a>.

*   **Starting at Small Startups:**
    *   Many new product managers join small startups where they might be the first PM or take on a "Product Management Plus+" role (e.g., Chief of Staff with PM responsibilities) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:22">[00:59:22]</a>. This allows for hands-on product management experience in a very small company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:31">[00:59:31]</a>.

## Misconceptions for New Product Managers

Anuka notes a mismatch between what aspiring PMs think they need to learn and what is truly essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:56">[00:55:56]</a>.
*   **Tools vs. Mindset:** Students often want to learn specific tools like Figma or processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:31">[00:55:31]</a>. However, Anuka believes that [[becoming_a_successful_product_manager | being successful]] as a PM requires learning how to take ambiguous situations and consistently drive more clarity over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:46">[00:55:46]</a>. This emphasizes the importance of mindset and skills over mere tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:21">[00:56:21]</a>.

Daresh Shaw, co-founder and CTO of HubSpot, is known for his fascinating and first-principled thinking, which extends to his unique approach to putting together presentations, including humor and keynote preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>. This systematic methodology aims to transform public speaking from a talent into an acquirable skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:55:00">[07:55:00]</a>.

## Public Speaking as an Acquirable Skill

Shaw believes that while talent might influence the learning curve's slope, most abilities are acquirable skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:00">[08:04:00]</a>. He views public speaking as a skill that can be learned, even if it doesn't come naturally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:00">[06:56:00]</a>. His approach involves functionally decomposing the skill of public speaking into sub-skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:28:00">[08:28:00]</a>. For instance, a basic requirement is being able to stand on stage without passing out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:39:00">[08:39:00]</a>. He emphasizes the need to hold the audience's attention, especially in today's short-attention-span society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:55:00">[08:55:00]</a>.

Each year, Shaw focuses on improving a different aspect of public speaking, such as slide design or visual expression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:00">[09:06:00]</a>. His most impactful area of study has been humor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:00">[09:16:00]</a>. He asserts that anyone can learn just about anything through practice and measurement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:35:00">[11:35:00]</a>, providing valuable [[tips_for_improving_public_speaking_and_overcoming_fear | tips for improving public speaking and overcoming fear]].

## A Systematic Approach to Keynote Preparation

Shaw's preparation for high-stakes keynotes involves rigorous practice runs with increasingly larger live audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:00">[09:50:00]</a>. These talks are recorded and transcribed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:00">[10:04:00]</a>, and he uses custom software to analyze audience engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:10:00">[10:10:00]</a>. This systematic method helps in [[managing_presentation_nerves_and_stage_presence | managing presentation nerves and stage presence]].

### Measuring Humor: Laughs Per Minute (LPM)

Inspired by stand-up comedians, Shaw uses a metric called Laughs Per Minute (LPM) to quantify the effectiveness of humor in his talks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:22:00">[10:22:00]</a>. His custom software identifies moments where the audience audibly laughs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:17:00">[10:17:19]</a> and calculates the LPM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:44:00">[10:44:00]</a>.

*   **Benchmarks**: Stand-up comedians have very high LPMs, while typical business talks have low LPMs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33:00">[10:33:00]</a>. Popular TED Talks show a strong correlation with high LPMs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:37:00">[10:37:00]</a>.
*   **Goals**: Shaw aims for a minimum LPM and seeks continuous improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:40:00">[10:40:00]</a>. For most normal circumstances, an LPM above 1.25 is considered top decile for talks given by non-professionals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:09:00">[14:09:00]</a>.
*   **Improvement Strategies**: To increase LPM, one can either add more laughs or decrease the number of words between laughs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:57:00">[10:57:00]</a>. The software provides a visual map of the talk, highlighting segments where no laughs occurred, prompting Shaw to either shorten those segments or inject new humor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:05:00">[11:05:00]</a>.

### Tactical Tips for Humor

When incorporating humor into presentations, particularly for those who aren't traditional comedians, Shaw offers two key tactical pieces of advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:57:00">[11:57:00]</a>:

1.  **Punchline Placement**: The funny part of a story should literally be the last words of that segment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:26:00">[12:26:00]</a>. After delivering the punchline, stop talking. This allows the audience about half a second to react and gives them "permission" to laugh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:34:00">[12:34:00]</a>. Continuing to speak will make the audience feel awkward and diminish the humor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:44:00">[12:44:00]</a>. Even if it sounds awkward to phrase a sentence this way, it works better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:50:00">[12:50:00]</a>. This contributes to [[crafting_compelling_presentations | crafting compelling presentations]] by ensuring comedic timing.
2.  **Maximize Investment**: When setting up a story, have multiple funny bits or punchlines within that single narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:06:00">[13:06:00]</a>. Once the context is established, leverage that investment by squeezing more humor into the end of the story in a punctuated fashion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:20:00">[13:20:00]</a>.

## The "SoloWare" Concept for Personal Improvement Tools

Shaw's custom LPM software is an example of what he calls "SoloWare" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:31:00">[14:31:00]</a>. This is software built for exactly one person â€“ himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:34:00">[14:34:00]</a>. He has been building such tools for 30 years, creating things he personally finds useful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:41:00">[14:41:00]</a>. The advantages of SoloWare include a UI designed for one user, minimal testing requirements, and the ability to discontinue use without disappointing others if it loses utility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:47:00">[14:47:00]</a>. This concept highlights a personalized approach to [[exercises_to_improve_public_speaking_skills | improving public speaking skills]].

## Learning in Public

Shaw advocates for [[tips_for_improving_public_speaking_and_overcoming_fear | learning in public]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:35:00">[18:35:00]</a>. He suggests that rather than learning for the sake of it, individuals should identify a real problem they care about and try to solve it using new tools or skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:45:00">[17:45:00]</a>. This practical, problem-driven approach makes learning more tangible and effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:50:00">[17:50:00]</a>. He recommends documenting the learning process through writing, especially in public, as the internet is "exactly good at telling you why you're an idiot," which provides valuable feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:51:00">[18:51:00]</a>.

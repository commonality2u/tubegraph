Stripe has a long history of [[leveraging_ai_in_product_development | leveraging AI]] and machine learning (ML) within its core products. For instance, Stripe's Radar, a solution for payment fraud, has utilized machine learning since its inception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:20">[01:01:20]</a>. The company employs various ML techniques to identify and counter bad actors, such as fraudsters and fraudulent businesses, considering them essential to its operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:35">[01:01:35]</a>.

## Evolution with Large Language Models (LLMs)
The recent advancements in AI, particularly with large language models (LLMs) and Transformer technology, have opened new avenues for Stripe to enhance its products and internal operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:49">[01:01:49]</a>. Stripe adopted Transformer technology into its systems over a year ago, noting its profound impact on solving problems for users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:59">[01:01:59]</a>.

## AI's Dual Impact: Powering Businesses and Enhancing Internal Efficiency

### Supporting AI Startups
Stripe recognizes its role in supporting the burgeoning AI industry. Operating an AI startup can be financially demanding due to the high compute resources required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:30">[01:02:30]</a>. Many AI companies, including OpenAI, utilize Stripe for monetization, subscriptions, revenue tracking, and financial operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:47">[01:02:47]</a>. By handling these complex financial operations, Stripe enables AI businesses to focus their valuable engineering resources on innovation within their core domain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:22">[01:03:22]</a>.

### Enhancing Stripe's Products
Stripe is actively applying AI techniques to improve its own services for users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:34">[01:03:34]</a>.

*   **Documentation and Support**: Stripe is leveraging GPT-4 to allow its documentation to be read and stored as embeddings, enabling developers to ask questions in natural language and receive answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:09">[01:04:09]</a>. This feature is in an early-stage release within Stripe's documentation and has proven valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:18">[01:04:18]</a>.
*   **Sigma (SQL Query Generation)**: For its Sigma product, which allows users to write SQL queries across their Stripe data for detailed business insights, AI is being used to enable natural language queries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:35">[01:04:35]</a>. The AI engine can write the SQL query for users, making the powerful product more accessible to non-developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:03">[01:05:03]</a>. This has required significant tuning for reliability and understandability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:13">[01:05:13]</a>.

### Internal Efficiency and [[Impact of AI on Software Development and Engineering Roles | Engineering Productivity]]
AI also plays a role in internal efficiency at Stripe, helping answer user questions faster and improving collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:21">[01:05:21]</a>.

*   **Internal GPT-4 Integration**: Recognizing the sensitivity of its data, Stripe built its own internal integration to GPT-4 rather than allowing direct use of public tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:46">[01:05:46]</a>.
*   **Prompt Engineering Presets**: This internal tool includes shareable "presets" for prompt engineering, allowing users across different job functions, including marketing and user support, to effectively use the models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:10">[01:06:10]</a>.
*   **GitHub Copilot**: Stripe has made GitHub Copilot broadly available to its engineers after a rigorous trial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:11">[01:07:11]</a>. Copilot has shown effectiveness in improving productivity and helping engineers focus on larger architectural problems rather than micro-level tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:35">[01:07:35]</a>. Specifically, it has proven valuable in generating test cases, automating boilerplate code, and allowing engineers to concentrate on critical reasoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:16">[01:08:16]</a>.

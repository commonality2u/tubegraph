[[coaching_and_leadership_in_product_management | Building effective product teams]] involves a blend of interpersonal skills, strategic thinking, clear communication, and a focus on execution. Amy Vora, Chief Product Officer at Fair, shares insights from her extensive experience at Meta and Fair on fostering productive and innovative product environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>.

## Sublimating Ego and Embracing Disagreement

A crucial aspect of effective teamwork is managing one's ego <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Amy emphasizes that it's more important to achieve the desired outcome than to be right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Her former CTO at Meta, Bos, noted her ability to respond to profound disagreement with genuine curiosity, saying, "Fascinating, you have to tell me more why you think that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This approach tears down walls and fosters profound curiosity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.

Amy admits this skill wasn't natural for her, as she used to "enjoy being right" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. However, she learned that her ego was often hindering the pursuit of the best outcome, as others often held valuable information she lacked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.

Key takeaways for embracing disagreement:
*   **Prioritize Outcome** The goal is to reach the best possible outcome, not to prove one's own correctness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>.
*   **Cultivate Curiosity** Assume others have information you don't and approach disagreements as opportunities to learn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.
*   **Observe and Reframe** Visceral reactions to disagreement can be reframed as chances to learn, rather than signals to shut down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. Taking a pause can help calm the body and mind, leading to a better response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>.

## Effective Communication through Metaphors and Imagery

Amy is known for using metaphors and imagery to rally teams and convey complex ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:27">[00:26:27]</a>.

### Key Metaphors:

*   **"Dinosaur Brain"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26">[00:17:26]</a>: When presenting to executives, assume they have a "little tiny dinosaur brain" that can only hold about three facts at a time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>. This emphasizes the need for clear, concise recommendations in product reviews, rather than overwhelming with information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>.
*   **"Putting on the Coat of the Job"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>: Before joining a new role, visualize the day-to-day experience—what you'd think about, who you'd have lunch with, what problems you'd solve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. This emotional response can be more telling than a spreadsheet analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.
*   **"Hill Climb"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>: This metaphor describes the difference between a local optimum (being on top of a small hill) and a global optimum (seeing a distant, higher mountain) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:19">[00:30:19]</a>. It's about deciding whether to risk going down into a valley (a "slog") to pursue a potentially much greater outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:47">[00:28:47]</a>. The key is remembering what the "summit feels like" to get through the difficult "valley" phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:03">[00:29:03]</a>.

### Tactical Advice for Metaphor Use:
When creating a metaphor or analogy, think about what you want your users to feel when using the product, and when they've felt that same way in real life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:21">[00:22:21]</a>. For example, for WhatsApp, the core metaphor was "face-to-face communication" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>, inspiring features that created intimacy and ease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:17">[00:33:17]</a>.

## Streamlining Product Reviews

Product reviews should focus on calibrating principles, not just getting individual decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:49">[00:20:49]</a>. The goal is to establish principles that empower teams to make consistent decisions in the future, reducing the need for constant review <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>.

Tips for effective product reviews:
*   **Keep it Simple**: Present the minimal amount of information needed to make a clear recommendation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>. This forces the presenter to be opinionated and deeply understand the material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>.
*   **Focus on Recommendation**: As a team member, your role is to make a recommendation, allowing leaders to provide broader context and pattern matching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a>.
*   **Define Problem and Timeline**: Clearly state the problem being solved and the relevant timeline at the outset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:39">[00:22:39]</a>.
*   **Smaller, Cross-Functional Groups**: Fewer people generally lead to more informal and faster conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>. Ensure cross-functional representation at both leadership and presenting levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:14">[00:24:14]</a>.

## Prioritizing Execution Over Strategy

Amy firmly believes that "execution eats strategy for breakfast" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:06">[00:38:06]</a>, a lesson she learned at Meta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:09">[00:38:09]</a>.

*   **Customer Focus**: Customers don't care about fancy strategies; they care about the product in their hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:37">[00:38:37]</a>.
*   **Learning and Iteration**: A perfect strategy with poor execution yields no learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:16">[00:39:16]</a>. A good enough strategy with perfect execution allows for learning, iteration, and continuous improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:24">[00:39:24]</a>.
*   **Glamour vs. Grind**: While strategy can be "glamorous," execution involves the "nuts and bolts" work of fixing bugs, looking at dashboards, and rewriting specs, which directly impacts customer outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:04">[00:40:04]</a>.
*   **Strategy's Purpose**: For strategy to be useful, it must change team behavior to create better customer outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:01">[00:44:01]</a>. It should align people through a story, narrative, and sequence, leading to tangible changes like prioritizing different products or reallocating resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:02">[00:45:02]</a>.

Even at senior levels, the focus should remain heavily on execution, understanding what slows people down, unblocking issues, and constantly improving the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:49">[00:42:49]</a>.

## Setting Goals and Aligning Incentives

To avoid "toddler soccer" – where everyone runs after the same metric and trips over each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:56">[00:56:56]</a> – Amy recommends decoupling goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:23">[00:57:23]</a>.

*   **Metrics Tree**: Instead of everyone focusing on a single output metric like GMV, break down the overall customer journey and assign different input metrics to various teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:37">[00:57:37]</a>. This allows each team to have a distinct, measurable goal that ladders up to the company's overall success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:01">[00:59:01]</a>.
*   **Acknowledge Different Incentives**: Cross-functional teams will naturally have different incentives and information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:03">[01:00:03]</a>. This "healthy tension" is normal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:31">[01:00:31]</a>. The key is to agree on the ultimate customer outcome, turning disagreements into rational discussions about the best way to achieve that shared goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:54">[01:00:54]</a>.

## Working with Founders and CEOs

Building an effective product team, especially as a CPO, requires a strong, complementary relationship with the CEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:10">[01:09:10]</a>.

*   **Mind Meld**: A CPO should spend time with a CEO to understand how they think and operate, ensuring a high-fidelity, high-trust working relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:34">[01:11:34]</a>.
*   **Hiring the Right Level**: Founders should ensure they truly need the level of seniority they are hiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:03">[01:12:03]</a>. Often, a founder has the vision and needs someone to build the product, not necessarily to scale the team or build systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:14">[01:12:14]</a>.

## Customer Advocacy as a Shortcut to Success

For product teams, especially as an organization scales, the most important thing is to "think about the customer" and "talk to the customer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:34">[01:15:34]</a>. Being a customer advocate is a shortcut to everything else needed for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:39">[01:15:39]</a>.

*   **Aligning Value**: It's rare for customer value and company value to diverge over a long enough time horizon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:41">[01:16:41]</a>. Company metrics should ultimately be about long-term customer impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:18">[01:17:18]</a>.

Ultimately, [[building_highfunctioning_design_teams | building high-functioning design teams]] and product teams requires a leader who can cultivate authenticity, manage imperfect outcomes, and continuously learn while empowering their team to do the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. Amy Vora's journey exemplifies that success can be achieved even with a "messy and imperfect" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>.

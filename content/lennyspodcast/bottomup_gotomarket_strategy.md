Figma's remarkable growth has been largely attributed to its distinctive bottom-up go-to-market (GTM) strategy, which prioritizes empowering individual users to become internal champions within their organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:58">[01:13:58]</a>. This approach diverges from traditional top-down sales models and emphasizes building deep user love and enabling organic product spread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:02">[01:15:02]</a>.

## Defining Bottom-Up GTM

A bottom-up GTM motion focuses on individual contributors (ICs) who are practitioners using a tool daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:12">[01:14:12]</a>. The core idea is to foster such strong affection for the product that these users are willing to risk their social capital to advocate for its adoption throughout their organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:32">[01:14:32]</a>.

This strategy differs from traditional top-down GTM, where sales teams typically target executives or buyers to secure a company-wide adoption decision, which then trickles down to employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:05">[01:15:05]</a>. For technical tools, user love among practitioners is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:16">[01:15:16]</a>.

Figma's bottom-up strategy is efficient because it initially required no sales team for its first three years; all revenue was self-served <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:33">[01:15:33]</a>. Even after establishing a sales team, a significant portion of marketing qualified leads (MQLs) came from users already on free or Pro tiers who actively sought to upgrade their entire company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:11">[01:16:11]</a>. These users essentially drove the sale from within <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:01">[01:17:01]</a>.

## Figma's Two-Part Go-to-Market Strategy

Figma's bottom-up GTM strategy can be broken down into two main parts:
1.  Getting individual contributors (ICs) at a company to love the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:03">[01:14:03]</a>.
2.  Enabling them to spread the product within their organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:51">[01:14:51]</a>.

### Part 1: Getting ICs to Love the Product

This initial phase focuses on building a strong relationship with the target audience even before they fully commit to using the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:30">[01:31:30]</a>.

#### 1. Build Credibility

In the early days, with a technical audience like designers, traditional marketing tactics (e.g., using buzzwords like "efficiency" or "collaboration") were ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:31">[01:32:31]</a>. Figma focused on authenticity by:
*   **Creating Technical Content:** Engineers wrote articles about the product's technical feats (e.g., using WebGL to bring design to the internet) and how specific features (like grids or Vector networks) were built, often requiring marketers to Google terms to ensure the content was deep enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:11">[01:33:11]</a>. This technical content aimed for quality over quantity, with only around 10 posts in the first six months, focusing on platforms like Hacker News and Designer News <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:16">[01:36:16]</a>.
*   **Hiring Designer Advocates:** Figma's first marketing hire was a designer advocateâ€”a designer who was passionate about the product and whose full-time job was to meet with users, gather feedback, create content, and represent the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:55">[01:34:55]</a>. This role, distinct from marketing, is considered "magic dust" for their GTM, as designers trust feedback from other designers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:37">[01:35:37]</a>. This mirrors the [[productled_growth_strategies | product-led growth]] approach of hiring engineers to write blog posts at companies like Data Dog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:55">[01:35:55]</a>.

#### 2. Build with Your Users (Customer Obsession)

Figma adopted extreme [[growth_strategies_and_achieving_productmarket_fit_in_startups | customer obsession]], treating every user as critical in the early stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:42">[01:37:42]</a>.
*   **Hyper-responsiveness:** When their first user, Koda, had a file opening issue due to a MacBook problem, co-founder Dylan Field had an engineer drive to Palo Alto to fix it immediately, despite Koda not yet paying for the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>. This extreme focus on solving user problems, even small ones, ensured initial users could succeed and feel valued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:10">[00:38:10]</a>.
*   **Direct Support:** In early days, everyone, including engineers and the CEO, was on Intercom, chatting directly with users and often debugging issues live <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:02">[00:40:02]</a>. This direct feedback loop allowed for immediate fixes and fostered a sense of co-ownership, as users saw their feedback directly influencing product improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:06">[00:41:06]</a>.

#### 3. Focus Where Users Already Are

Instead of making users come to Figma, the strategy was to go where the design community already existed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:01">[01:45:01]</a>.
*   **Twitter as a Key Channel:** Dylan Field identified Twitter as the primary hub for the design community, which had a large network of influencers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:18">[01:45:18]</a>.
*   **Influencer Mapping:** Field built a scraper tool to identify key influencers and their followers within different design topics (e.g., iconography, graphic design) to understand the network structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. This "node graph" allowed them to identify influential individuals to approach for feedback and to push out technical content directly into user feeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:21">[01:46:21]</a>.
*   **Personalized Interaction:** Co-founders and engineers actively engaged with users on Twitter, answering questions and building personal connections, rather than just relying on the brand handle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:31">[01:47:31]</a>. This allowed users to passively follow Figma's journey and build confidence in the product over time, even if they weren't ready to switch immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:05">[01:48:05]</a>.

#### 4. Be Transparent and Authentic

Transparency was crucial for building trust, especially with a skeptical audience that had recently migrated to other tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:04">[01:51:04]</a>.
*   **Honesty in Communication:** In early days, this meant direct, one-on-one communication about issues like downtime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:17">[01:49:17]</a>. At scale, this translated to public post-mortems for major outages, taking full accountability and explaining technical reasons for problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:18">[01:55:18]</a>.
*   **Humanizing the Brand:** During challenging times, such as the acquisition announcement, Figma chose not to hide behind its brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:57">[01:55:57]</a>. They held an open Twitter Space with co-founders and leaders, allowing users to ask any questions directly, fostering trust and giving the community a chance to understand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:22">[01:56:22]</a>. This transparency is deeply embedded in Figma's culture, with leaders like the CTO still actively engaging with users on social media to address bugs and gather feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:44">[01:57:44]</a>.

### Part 2: Enabling Spread within Organizations

Once ICs love the product, the next step is to equip them to champion its adoption throughout their companies. This involves making it easy for the product to spread organically.

#### 1. Make it Easy to Try and Share

Figma strategically designed its product and pricing to facilitate organic spread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>.
*   **Robust Free Tier:** Signing up for a free account is simple, allowing users to build confidence over time without immediate financial commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:54">[02:01:54]</a>.
*   **Optimized Starter Team:** Initially, Figma's starter team limited collaborators, hindering viral growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:24">[02:02:24]</a>. A pivotal decision was made to switch this to allowing *unlimited collaborators* on up to three files, even if it meant fewer files <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:44">[02:02:44]</a>. This change significantly boosted sharing and confidence building within teams before they needed to pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:51">[02:02:51]</a>.
*   **Free Viewers:** Crucially, only editors are charged for, while viewers are free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:56">[02:05:56]</a>. This allows product managers, engineers, and other stakeholders to comment and interact with designs without incurring costs, driving wider adoption within an organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>.

#### 2. Leverage Designer Advocates in Sales

Figma integrated its designer advocates directly into the sales process, creating what was informally known as "The Tom Factor" (named after Tom Lowry, a key advocate) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:48">[02:08:48]</a>.
*   **Credibility & Expertise:** These advocates, who were passionate users and often former product designers themselves, possessed deep technical understanding and credibility that salespeople could not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:08">[02:09:08]</a>. They could genuinely understand and address designers' specific problems and offer best practices, making sales conversations much more effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:23">[02:09:23]</a>.
*   **No Quota, Product-Centric:** Advocates did not have sales quotas, ensuring their focus remained on helping users and bringing valuable product feedback back to the engineering team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>. This model allowed Figma to scale [[scaling_gotomarket_efforts_with_internal_champions | go-to-market efforts with internal champions]] and build credibility simultaneously in marketing, product, and sales functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:37">[02:10:37]</a>.

#### 3. Target Operational Blockers as Opportunities

Figma identified a key blocker to enterprise adoptionâ€”Design Systemsâ€”and transformed it into a core advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.
*   **Understanding the Need:** Design Systems are libraries of reusable components (like buttons, headers) that ensure consistency and efficiency in design and engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:15">[02:11:15]</a>. Figma initially lacked robust support for shared Design Systems, making it a "huge blocker" for large organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:25">[02:12:25]</a>.
*   **Community-Led Development:** Figma engaged directly with the Design Systems community through informal meetups to learn their needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:10">[01:13:10]</a>. They then built features specifically for Design Systems, leaning into the technical aspects of how companies use and scale them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:24">[02:13:24]</a>.
*   **Content and Events:** This focus led to dedicated content (like `designsystems.com`, a Figma property) and conferences (e.g., Schema) bringing together advanced practitioners to share their workflows in Figma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>. Design Systems became a major driver for upgrading from Pro to Org/Enterprise tiers, winning over critical internal champions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:13">[02:14:13]</a>.

#### 4. Shine a Light on Champions

Maintaining the relationship with internal champions is crucial, even when they express dissatisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:22">[02:16:22]</a>.
*   **Direct Engagement:** If a champion tweets a complaint, Figma immediately engages to understand and address their concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:34">[02:16:34]</a>.
*   **Mutual Growth:** Figma actively supports the career growth and public profiles of its champions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:51">[02:16:51]</a>. By offering them opportunities to speak at events (like Config), amplifying them on social media, and promoting them as thought leaders, Figma provides value beyond the tool itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:15">[02:17:15]</a>. This strategy not only benefits the individuals but also reinforces Figma's credibility and expands its reach through a network of trusted voices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:41">[02:17:41]</a>.

## Scaling the Bottom-Up Motion

As Figma grew, protecting and continuously advocating for the bottom-up model became a key focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:03">[02:18:03]</a>. While layering on traditional top-down methods is necessary, the core GTM pillars are maintained:
*   **Quality Weeks/Little Big Updates:** Engineers dedicate time to fixing small user annoyances, often identified through Twitter or support channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. These "Little Big Updates" are packaged and launched annually, celebrated by users for improving daily quality of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:51">[02:52:51]</a>.
*   **Config Conference:** Config, Figma's annual conference, is a prime example of scaling community engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:14">[02:58:14]</a>. Its content is largely driven by a call for proposals from users, focusing on deep technical discussions for practitioners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:02">[02:59:02]</a>. Figma's advocates help speakers shape their talks, further amplifying their profiles and reinforcing connections within the design community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:22">[02:59:22]</a>.
*   **Scaling Advocate Teams:** The designer advocacy function has expanded to include developer advocates, FigJam advocates, and regional advocates (e.g., Japan) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:48">[02:10:48]</a>. These "magic dust" teams ensure that Figma can maintain authentic relationships and credibility across new products and regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:11">[02:11:11]</a>.

## Prerequisites for Applying This Approach

This bottom-up GTM strategy is particularly effective under specific conditions:
*   **Technical, Craft-Focused Audience:** The target individual contributors should be technical users who deeply care about their craft and derive significant value from using the tool independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:54">[02:19:54]</a>. This allows for meaningful technical discussions, which is often more compelling than discussing "collaboration" for its own sake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:09">[02:20:09]</a>.
*   **Existing Community:** It helps if the target audience already has a strong, self-organized community (e.g., on Twitter) where they share knowledge and best practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:57">[02:20:57]</a>. This provides a pre-existing distribution channel for the product to tap into <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:14">[02:21:14]</a>.
*   **Collaborative Roles:** The core IC audience should have roles that naturally involve collaboration with many other individuals within their organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:24">[02:21:24]</a>. Designers, for instance, constantly seek feedback from product managers and engineers, making them natural "super spreaders" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:28">[02:21:28]</a>.
*   **Leadership Buy-in and Intuition:** A key prerequisite is an executive leader who profoundly believes in this approach and can trust their intuition over immediate, small-scale metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:58">[02:22:58]</a>. Early-stage metrics are often too small to provide clear signals, making anecdotal evidence and direct user feedback more valuable indicators of [[framework_for_finding_productmarket_fit | product-market fit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:25">[02:23:25]</a>. This "signal over metrics" philosophy is crucial for navigating the early, uncertain phases of [[growth_strategies_and_achieving_productmarket_fit_in_startups | startup growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:06">[02:24:06]</a>.

While Figma benefited from having a product that is useful both as a single-player tool and gains utility with more users, the core lessons on building deep user love and leveraging [[contrarian_approaches_in_business_strategy | contrarian]] GTM methods are broadly applicable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:02">[02:15:02]</a>.

A compelling product vision is essential for guiding product development, aligning teams, and achieving long-term success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. It serves as a powerful tool for product managers to align teams and foster greater success in their products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

## Vision vs. Mission

While often confused, vision and mission are distinct concepts:
*   **Mission** is the purpose of why a company or team exists, focusing on the "why" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>. It's the reason for getting up every day to work for a company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.
    *   **Examples of Missions:**
        *   TED: "To spread ideas" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>
        *   Stripe: "Increased the GDP of the internet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>
        *   Ikea: "Create a better everyday life for many people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>
        *   Uber (early): "Transportation as reliable as running water" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>, later adapted to "reliable transport sanitation everywhere and for everyone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.
*   **Vision** is a picture of the desired future state; what it looks like when you get there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. It's like fast-forwarding to the future and describing the image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>.
    *   **Examples of Visions:**
        *   Microsoft: "A computer on every desk and in every home" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>
        *   Tesla: "Create the most compelling car company of the 21st century" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>
        *   Lyft: "A world where cities feel small again, where transportation and tech bring people together instead of apart" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>
        *   Uber: A world with continuous trips that eliminates the need for parking, freeing up vast city spaces for other uses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

### Elements of a Good Vision
A strong vision embodies four key elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>:
1.  **Lofty:** It should feel ambitious, almost scary, but in an exciting way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
2.  **Realistic and Attainable:** It cannot feel so "pie in the sky" that it's out of reach for most people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
3.  **Devoid of Current Limitations:** Imagine the future without being constrained by today's technical or resource limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. This allows for imagining what needs to be fixed or put in place to get there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.
4.  **Grounded in a Clear Problem:** The vision must address a potent and exciting problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

## Communicating a Product Vision
Storytelling is one of the most powerful skills for a product manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>. Stories, especially when blended with numbers, are far more effective than just stats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>.

Here are three tactical ways to communicate a vision:

### 1. The "Once Upon a Time" Framework (Mad Libs Approach)
This simple yet powerful framework helps structure a compelling narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>. It should be put in product documentation to remind teams of their original vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>.

*   "Once upon a time, [describe the initial problem/state] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>.
*   Because of that, [describe the consequences or negative impacts] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>.
*   One day, [describe the key event or solution that occurred] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>.
*   As a result, [describe the new, improved state of the world / the "dent in the universe" you made] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:02">[00:20:02]</a>.
*   And finally, [describe the lasting impact or feeling left with the world] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:28">[00:20:28]</a>.

> *Example (YouTube Shorts):* "Once Upon a Time, YouTube was fun with cat videos, but it became very polished, making many feel they couldn't create <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>. Because of that, people mostly consumed and didn't create <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>. One day, we launched Shorts, allowing 60-second creations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>. As a result, anyone can now express themselves again, bringing back the joy and magic of YouTube" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>.

### 2. The News Article Approach
Write a news article from the future, imagining that the vision has come to pass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>.
*   Start with a compelling headline and subtitle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>. Mock it into a well-known publication (e.g., TechCrunch, The Verge, New York Times) to make it feel realistic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>.
*   This approach forces clarity on the core problem solved and the resulting "painkiller" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>.
*   Optionally, write the full article to go deeper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>.

> *Example (Uber):* Ab Atod used this method to visualize a future where Uber could replace public transport cards like San Francisco's Clipper card, showcasing Uber as a multimodal trip platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>. This helped build out the commerce infrastructure for future payment scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a>.

### 3. Visualizing the Vision
"A picture tells a thousand words" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>.
*   **Sketches/Mocks:** Work with a design partner to draw the future state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>. If no designer is available, sketch it yourself using Post-it notes or simple shapes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:10">[00:27:10]</a>.
    *   *Example (Uber):* A designer sketched a Bodega kiosk where users could top up their Uber balance with cash, even without a credit card, allowing the Uber experience to scale globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>. This vision took four years to build but excited people about its possibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>.
*   **App Store Screenshots:** For products with an app presence, imagine what the App Store screenshots would look like if the vision were realized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:02">[00:25:02]</a>. This forces clarity on the key features and benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:45">[00:25:45]</a>.

## Developing a Product Vision: The 3-Step Process
Ab Atod proposes a three-part framework for developing a vision: **Empathize, Create, Evangelize** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:59">[00:28:59]</a>.

### 1. Empathize: Understand the Problem
This crucial step involves deeply understanding the customer and the problems they face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:16">[00:29:16]</a>. The clarity of the problem acts as the North Star that doesn't move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:01">[00:35:01]</a>.

*   **"Understand Work":**
    *   **Dogfooding:** Regularly use your own product, including going through the onboarding flow as a new user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:52">[00:30:52]</a>.
    *   **Catfooding:** Use competitors' products to understand the broader landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:32">[00:31:32]</a>.
    *   Build intuition by exposing yourself to well-designed products and reflecting on what makes them great <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:22">[00:32:22]</a>.
*   **Leverage Research (Wisely):** Research is valuable for uncovering foundational problems that are a few cycles out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:46">[00:31:46]</a>. Instead of telling you *what* to do, research should update your mental model of the customer, informing your decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:46">[00:35:46]</a>.
*   **"Top 10 Things You Should Know" Document:** Maintain a living document of the top 10 most pressing problems for your product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>. This document is updated quarterly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:13">[00:33:13]</a> and can include qualitative, quantitative, and even technical debt issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:21">[00:33:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:30">[00:55:30]</a>.
    *   Collaborate with data scientists, product analysts, UX, UXR, and engineering to populate and prioritize this list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:53">[00:33:53]</a>.
    *   Use this framework to gather input from stakeholders (e.g., marketing, operations, support) by asking them to provide their "top 10 problems" stack-ranked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:57">[00:38:57]</a>.

### 2. Create: Envision the Solution
Once problems are clearly defined, articulate what the world would look like if those problems were solved. This is the vision itself, as described in the "Communicating a Product Vision" section above <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:30">[00:29:30]</a>.

### 3. Evangelize: Share and Gain Buy-in
Patience is required for this stage, as it can take time for a vision to move from concept to planning and funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:09">[00:30:09]</a>.

*   **Concentric Circles of Influence:**
    1.  **Core Team:** Start by presenting the vision repeatedly to your immediate team (PMs, engineers, designers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:20">[00:44:20]</a>. The output of strategy workshops should be living documents with open comments, allowing for debate and polishing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:25">[00:45:25]</a>.
    2.  **Stakeholders & Adjacent Teams:** Share the vision with marketing, sales, operations, and other relevant teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:08">[00:46:08]</a>. Listen to their perspectives and feedback, even if it highlights challenges or concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:34">[00:46:34]</a>. The early engagement helps build [[creating_vision_and_gaining_buyin_for_new_product_ideas | buy-in]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:56">[00:42:56]</a>.
    3.  **Leadership:** Present the vision to the highest possible leadership levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:44">[00:46:44]</a>. Encourage them to amplify the story, as their support will greatly increase velocity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:22">[00:47:22]</a>.

## Vision Scope and Cadence
A true vision should be a long-term aspiration, typically evergreen and lasting at least three to five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:19">[00:48:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:25">[00:50:25]</a>. If a vision needs to be repeated annually, it likely wasn't a good one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:46">[00:49:46]</a>. Instead of creating new visions, add fidelity to existing ones over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:54">[00:49:54]</a>.

This macro vision (3-5 years) should be a consistent North Star. However, product managers can also develop "micro visions" for smaller problems that might be solved in the next year, using quick mocks or headlines to illustrate the immediate future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:46">[00:50:46]</a>.

## Product Management Craft: Clarity and Conviction
The essence of product management is bringing [[product_management_insights_and_extreme_clarity | clarity]] and conviction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:01">[00:57:01]</a>.
*   **Clarity:** This involves simplifying understanding and removing pollution from the core problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:30">[00:58:30]</a>. It's achieved through a narrative structure of insights, strategy, and big rocks, explaining *why* you're doing something, *how* you'll do it, and *what* you'll do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:44">[00:58:44]</a>.
    *   This is often articulated in a concise document (e.g., two pages) that includes insights, strategic approach, and a few "big rocks" (3-5 major initiatives) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:17">[00:59:17]</a>. This document forms the narrative for the team and stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:05">[01:01:05]</a>.
*   **Conviction:** This is a strong feeling about what the world *should* be like <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:15">[01:05:15]</a>. It requires PMs to pick a lane and stand by their proposed solutions, even if uncomfortable, and invest in higher certainty if needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:14">[01:06:14]</a>.

## Creating a Strong Product Culture
Company culture significantly impacts how products are built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:22">[01:08:22]</a>.

*   **Uber:** Characterized by "super hands-on, zoom out/zoom in" mentality, where teams would go from the "boardroom to the streets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:14">[01:09:14]</a>. Values like "principal confrontation" and "toe-stepping" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:31">[01:11:31]</a> allowed for testing bold ideas like cash payments, even against leadership's initial beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:42">[01:11:42]</a>.
*   **Netflix:** Evolved from a monolithic culture that embraced "no rules rules," "freedom and responsibility," and "highly aligned, loosely coupled" principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:31">[01:12:31]</a>. This culture fostered intentional debate and allowed for significant product shifts (e.g., introducing advertising) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:54">[01:14:54]</a>. The "informed captain" model empowers individuals to make decisions after gathering context and input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:57">[01:20:57]</a>.
*   **Google:** Has a looser macro culture allowing for diverse "micro-cultures" within different product areas (e.g., YouTube, Cloud, Search, Assistant) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:48">[01:15:48]</a>. This flexibility allows for varied approaches to product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:02">[01:17:02]</a>.

### Fostering Team Culture
PMs and PM leaders play a crucial role in [[creating_a_strong_product_culture | creating a strong product culture]] within their teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:55">[01:18:55]</a>.
*   **Freedom and Responsibility:** Grant autonomy while holding individuals accountable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:34">[01:20:34]</a>.
*   **Humanity First:** Prioritize understanding the "human behind the role" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:54">[01:21:54]</a>. This includes knowing personal details like birthdays and career aspirations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:35">[01:24:35]</a>.
*   **Love, Not Just Like:** Seek to be "loved" (extending yourself for another's growth) rather than just "liked" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:07">[01:22:07]</a>. This allows for tough feedback delivered from a place of genuine care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:56">[01:22:56]</a>.

## Advice for Aspiring Product Managers
To develop product sense and become a PM, especially if not from a traditional background:
*   **Immersion:** Start practicing product management before officially becoming a PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:08">[01:30:08]</a>.
*   **Problem Identification:** Open your favorite apps and list the top 10 problems you see <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:13">[01:30:13]</a>.
*   **Sketch Solutions:** Design in your head or sketch what the world would look like if those problems were fixed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:17">[01:30:17]</a>.
*   **10,000 Hours:** Consistently train your product sense through these exercises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>. Opportunity meets preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:27">[01:30:27]</a>.

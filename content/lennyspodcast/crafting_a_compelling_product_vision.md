Ab Attoh, Director of Product Management at YouTube, emphasizes that a compelling product vision is essential, regardless of one's level in a company [01:05:26]. It serves as a guiding star, much like a pilot announcing their destination before takeoff [00:06:01].

## Defining Vision

A product vision is a clear, vivid image of the future state once a problem is solved [00:06:10]. It is distinct from a mission.

*   **Vision:** Describes what the world will *look like* when you achieve your goal [01:12:01]. It is the "picture" of the destination [00:06:10].
    *   *Example:* Uber's vision was a world of continuous trips that eliminates the need for parking, freeing up 25% of average city space for other uses [00:09:22].
    *   *Example:* Microsoft's vision: "A computer on every desk and in every home" [01:14:10].
*   **Mission:** Articulates the purpose or "why" you exist [01:13:24]. It is the underlying reason for the effort [01:12:35].
    *   *Example:* Uber's mission: "make Transportation reliable everywhere for everyone" [00:09:08].
    *   *Example:* Ted's mission: "spread ideas" [01:13:54].

### Key Elements of a Good Vision
Ab Attoh outlines four core elements for a strong vision:
1.  **Lofty:** It should inspire and feel excitingly ambitious [00:06:31].
2.  **Realistic and Attainable:** While lofty, it shouldn't feel completely out of reach for most people [00:06:46].
3.  **Devoid of Current Limitations:** It should be conceived "in a vacuum" from today's technological or resource constraints, as these may change [00:07:08].
4.  **Grounded in a Potent Problem:** The vision must stem from a clear, compelling problem that people are excited to solve [00:07:29].

## Communicating the Vision

Once a vision is established, effective communication is crucial. Ab Attoh suggests several concrete methods for communicating a vision to teammates and executives:

### 1. The Mad Libs Approach (Storytelling Framework)
This simplistic yet powerful tool leverages [[Product management and storytelling | storytelling]]. It frames the vision as a narrative, allowing anyone to articulate it [01:15:59].
*   **Template:**
    *   "Once Upon a Time, \[describe the past state or problem]." [01:16:01]
    *   "And then, \[describe something that happened or a challenge]." [01:16:03]
    *   "Because of that, \[describe the negative consequence]." [01:16:07]
    *   "One day, \[describe the big change you are creating/the vision]." [01:16:10]
    *   "As a result, \[describe the new, better state of the world/the dent made in the universe]." [01:16:13]
*   **Example (YouTube Shorts):**
    *   Once Upon a Time, YouTube was fun but became very polished, making some feel unable to create [01:16:36].
    *   One day, we launched YouTube Shorts, a 60-second format [01:17:02].
    *   As a result, anyone can now express themselves and bring back the joy and magic of YouTube [01:17:06].

### 2. The News Article Approach
This method involves imagining the future impact of your product by writing a news article about its success [01:17:39].
*   **Process:**
    1.  Write a compelling headline, imagining it appearing on a major tech publication (e.g., TechCrunch, The Verge) [01:17:41].
    2.  Write a subtitle.
    3.  (Optional) Write the full article if you want to go deeper [01:18:10].
*   **Benefit:** Forces clarity and focus on the key impact and "painkiller" solution [01:23:42]. It helps to socialize the idea and gain conviction [01:24:27].
*   **Real-life Example:** Ab Attoh wrote a headline for Uber: "Uber is now replacing your Clipper card; all you need is your phone and the app" [01:22:37]. This helped inform the development of payment and commerce infrastructure for a future where Uber could support various transportation modes beyond just cars [01:22:47].

### 3. The Visualization/Sketching Approach
A picture can tell a thousand words, making visual representation a powerful communication tool [01:18:26].
*   **Process:**
    1.  Work with a designer if possible to create high-fidelity mocks [01:26:46].
    2.  If not, simply sketch it out yourself using Post-it notes or simple drawings [01:27:08]. Don't let the lack of a designer be an excuse not to visualize [01:27:37].
    3.  Think about where people would see the product (e.g., App Store screenshots, product interfaces) and mock those [01:25:02].
*   **Example:** At Uber, a design partner literally drew a Bodega with a person topping up their Uber balance with cash to visualize a cashless experience for those without credit cards [01:18:58].

## Developing and Implementing Product Strategy

Ab Attoh proposes a three-step process for [[Developing and implementing product strategy | developing and implementing product strategy]]:

### 1. Empathize (Understand the Problem)
This foundational step involves deeply understanding customer problems and the current state [01:29:01].
*   **"Understand Work":** Actively use your own product ("dogfooding") and competitor products ("catfooding") [01:30:39]. Explore the entire user journey, especially the onboarding flow [01:30:50].
*   **Leverage Research:** Use user research to update your mental model of the customer and their needs, rather than as a direct instruction manual [01:35:46].
*   **"Top 10 Things You Should Know":** Create a living document (e.g., Google Doc) listing the top 10 most pressing problems for your product area [01:32:51].
    *   This list should be revised quarterly and can include qualitative, quantitative, or even technical debt issues [01:33:10].
    *   Involve stakeholders (e.g., marketing, operations, support, data science) by asking them to contribute their top 10 problems, ranked by pain point [01:38:57]. This ensures their input is heard and helps to crystallize key opportunities [01:40:28].
    *   The goal is for everyone on the team to have the same understanding of the core problems [01:34:21].

### 2. Create (Formulate the Vision)
Once problems are clearly understood, the vision is created [01:29:07]. This is where the communication methods discussed above are used to articulate "what the world looks like" if the problems are solved [01:29:30].

### 3. Evangelize (Secure Buy-in)
[[Developing a compelling vision and securing team buyin | Evangelizing the vision]] is critical for alignment and requires patience [01:30:09].
*   **Concentric Circles of Influence:**
    1.  **Core Team:** Start with your immediate team. Present the vision multiple times to allow for percolation and stress testing. Share the output of vision workshops as living documents with open comments, encouraging friction as a way to refine ideas [01:43:52].
    2.  **Stakeholders:** Engage cross-functional partners and their teams. Address their feedback, acknowledge their concerns (e.g., "we heard you, but this is why we focused here"), and reinforce the shared understanding of problems [01:46:06].
    3.  **Leadership:** Present the vision to the highest possible leadership. Encourage them to amplify the story [01:46:42].
*   **Long-term Outlook:** A product vision should be "evergreen," lasting at least 3-5 years, not changing annually [01:50:22]. It provides a consistent "North Star" for all efforts [01:35:04].
*   **Micro-Visions:** While a macro vision defines the long-term, individual PMs can also create "micro-visions" for specific problems or next-year projects. These can be simple mocks or quick sketches [01:50:46].

## The Craft of Product Management: Clarity and Conviction

Ab Attoh defines the fundamental craft of product management as bringing [[Focusing on craft and quality in product development | Clarity and Conviction]] [01:57:01].

### Clarity
Clarity is about removing clutter, defining transparency, and simplifying understanding [01:58:28].
*   **Tactical Tool: The Narrative Document:** Write a concise 2-4 page document outlining:
    *   **Insights:** The core problems identified [01:59:16].
    *   **Strategy/Approach:** How you plan to address those problems [01:59:25].
    *   **Big Rocks:** 3-5 key initiatives that, if delivered, will solve the biggest problems and move you closer to the vision [01:59:45]. This prevents endless roadmaps by focusing on core impact [01:59:42].
*   This narrative serves as an onboarding document and a quick reference for stakeholders to understand the team's purpose [02:01:32].

### Conviction
Conviction is a strong belief or "feeling" about what the world should be [02:05:15].
*   It requires the ability to "pick a lane" and stand by a decision, even if uncomfortable, rather than spreading resources thin ("peanut buttering") [02:06:51].
*   A PM with conviction leads their team to make clear recommendations, rather than presenting multiple options and asking leadership to choose [02:07:04].

## Influence of Company and Team Culture

Company culture significantly shapes how product is built [02:08:36].
*   **Uber:** Initially monolithic and aggressive ("principal confrontation," "toe-stepping," "find your red line") [02:11:31], Uber's culture also had values like "celebrate cities" and "customer obsessed," allowing for regional product adaptations [02:18:12].
*   **Netflix:** Evolved with intentionality from a "no rules rules" philosophy (freedom and responsibility, highly aligned loosely coupled) [02:13:11]. This culture encouraged structured debates and writing down arguments, ultimately allowing for product evolution (e.g., introducing advertising) [02:14:54]. Decision-making involved an "informed captain" where one person was empowered to make the final call [02:20:57].
*   **Google:** Has a looser macro-culture, fostering diverse "micro-cultures" across different product areas (e.g., Search, Assistant, YouTube, Cloud) [02:15:51]. This flexibility allows for varied product development approaches [02:17:02].

### Building Team Culture
As a leader, building a strong team culture is essential [02:19:58]. Ab Attoh focuses on:
*   **Freedom with Responsibility:** Empowering team members with autonomy, but holding them accountable as owners, not renters [02:20:33].
*   **Informed Captain:** Clearly defining who owns each decision, ensuring one person is accountable after gathering context and input [02:20:57].
*   **Vulnerability as Strength:** Fostering an environment where "vulnerability is your strength" [02:21:43]. This means caring deeply about the "human behind the role" [02:21:54].
    *   Ab Attoh believes in being "loved" rather than just "liked," which means extending oneself for others' spiritual growth, even if it requires hard conversations and raw feedback [02:22:02].
    *   This foundation of trust and care allows teams to collaborate openly, such as sharing in-progress documents for feedback and improvement [02:23:14].

## Advice for Aspiring Product Managers

Ab Attoh, who transitioned into product management without a traditional background, advises aspiring PMs to proactively develop their skills [02:29:35]:
*   **Practice "10,000 Hours":** Start practicing [[Product management and storytelling | product management]] before you have the title [02:30:00].
*   **Analyze Apps:** Open your favorite applications and identify their "top 10 problems" [02:30:11].
*   **Sketch Solutions:** Design in your head or sketch out what the world would look like if those problems were solved [02:30:17].
*   This constant practice builds and refines your "product sense," preparing you for opportunities when they arise [02:30:20].

## YouTube Product Innovations (Examples)

YouTube is actively developing features aligned with their vision of being a creative partner for creators [02:26:52]:
*   **AI Inspiration:** This feature uses AI to generate content ideas for creators based on what their community of subscribers and viewers is watching [02:27:15].
*   **Thumbnail Test & Compare:** A/B tests different video thumbnails to determine which performs best, helping creators optimize their content presentation [02:28:20].

## Final Thoughts

Ab Attoh emphasizes the importance of mindfulness and presence, advocating for a deeper connection with oneself and others to foster a better world [02:38:49]. She also shares her life motto from the poem "Invictus": "I am the master of my fate: I am the captain of my soul" [02:35:12], highlighting the importance of agency and responsibility in all aspects of life, including product management [02:35:40].

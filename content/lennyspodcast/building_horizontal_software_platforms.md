Notion, co-founded and led by Ivan Zhao, exemplifies the complex journey of [[building_and_evolving_a_software_product | building and evolving a software product]], particularly a horizontal platform. The company's vision, challenges, and strategies offer valuable insights into creating tools that serve diverse user needs while maintaining a core philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

## Notion's Vision and Early Challenges: The "Lost Years"

Notion's initial concept was ambitious: to enable "everybody can make and create their software" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The first three to four years of Notion were characterized as the "Lost Years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>, marked by trial and error in finding product-market fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.

The initial product was a developer tool, aiming for simplicity to allow more people to create software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. However, this approach failed because "most people just don't care" about creating software; they simply need to get their jobs done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This led to a crucial realization: Notion needed to "hide our vision" of universal software creation "in the form factor that people do care" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This form factor turned out to be productivity software, a realization that took two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. Zhao likens this strategy to "sugar and broccoli": people prefer sugar, so you "give them the sugar that hide your broccoli inside of it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

Another significant challenge during these early years was the technical foundation. Notion rebuilt its codebase multiple times, discarding previous versions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>. A key instance involved betting on Google's Web Component technology, which proved unstable, forcing a complete rebuild on a more stable foundation to avoid running out of time and money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>.

### Sustaining Through the "Lost Years"
Financially, Notion survived with the help of Zhao's mother, who provided initial funding and later a bridge loan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>. During a period of rebuilding, Notion laid off all employees, reducing the team to just Zhao and co-founder Simon Last, who moved to Japan to restart the codebase. This period of intense, focused [[design_and_innovation_in_software_development | design and innovation in software development]] was described as some of the happiest moments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>.

Key advice for founders enduring similar struggles includes:
*   **Belief in the vision:** A conviction that the product *needs* to exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>.
*   **Staying lean:** Operating with minimal resources to prolong runway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>.
*   **Courage to reset:** Not being afraid to discard work and start over, as "progress through better abstractions" can lead to faster compounding growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>.
*   **Balancing vision and business:** A product business needs users and revenue, but also needs to align with the founders' values and aesthetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>. Too much self-focus becomes an "art project" with no users; too much business focus creates a "commodity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:54">[00:21:54]</a>.

## Achieving Product-Market Fit

For Notion, product-market fit was not a "binary state" or a single milestone, but a gradual realization. It was characterized by users actively caring about the product and beginning to pay for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:24">[00:25:24]</a>. External validation, such as venture capitalists showing interest, also signaled traction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:48">[00:26:48]</a>.

## Strategies for Building Horizontal Platforms

Notion's journey offers several strategies for [[building_horizontal_software_platforms | building horizontal software platforms]]:

### Vision vs. User Needs ("Sugar and Broccoli" Metaphor)
The core insight was to package Notion's complex underlying "Lego for software" vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a> within a familiar and immediately useful "productivity software" wrapper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. Users want the "sugar" (a functional tool for daily tasks) with the "broccoli" (the underlying, customizable "no-code developer power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>) hidden inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.

### Technical Foundation and Resets
Notion was willing to "reset a codebase, reset a company" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a> multiple times to build on a "worthier technology foundation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>. This courage to discard sunk costs and embrace "better abstractions" allows for faster compounding growth, which can quickly recover lost time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>.

### Segmentation and "Lego Boxes"
While Notion's core is "Lego bricks" (its modular components) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:23">[00:52:23]</a>, the company learned the importance of "segmentation" and offering "Lego boxes" for customers, particularly in the enterprise market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:31">[00:52:31]</a>. This means presenting the product as a "solution" that addresses specific business needs, rather than just a collection of building blocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:47">[00:52:47]</a>. This "solution" mindset helps clarify the value proposition for sales and marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:57">[00:53:57]</a>.

### Distribution Strategy (B2C2B)
Notion stumbled upon document and notes as a widely used horizontal use case, providing a "large top of funnel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:56">[00:56:56]</a>. This led to a "B2C2B" (business-to-consumer-to-business) strategy, where personal users adopted Notion for simple tasks like note-taking, then brought it to their workplaces to address broader needs like project management or CRM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:03">[00:57:03]</a>.

### [[design_and_innovation_in_software_development | Craft]] and Balance
Zhao emphasizes "craft" as a core philosophy, applying "value to some technical know-how" to make "clever tradeoffs" and create something "new and useful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:54">[00:37:54]</a>. This involves a continuous balance between what the founders want to build and what users need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:51">[00:38:51]</a>. For instance, Notion briefly deviated by hardcoding features like "Sprints" for project management, rather than building them as modular "Lego pieces," leading to product and user dissatisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:04">[00:46:04]</a>. The company course-corrected to align with its core value of modularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:39">[00:47:39]</a>.

## Leveraging AI for Horizontal Platforms

The advent of AI, particularly large language models, has been a "gift" for Notion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:19">[00:58:19]</a>.
1.  **AI Writing/Assistance:** Notion's extensive surface area for writing and task management made it easy to integrate AI capabilities for writing and search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:32">[00:58:32]</a>.
2.  **Data Consolidation:** AI performs best when all information is consolidated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:02">[00:59:02]</a>. Notion's horizontal nature means it already holds vast amounts of user data, making it uniquely positioned for AI Q&A and knowledge retrieval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:05">[00:59:05]</a>.
3.  **"AI Coding Agent" for Lego Blocks:** Most fascinatingly, AI models are skilled at "piecing things together," including writing code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:54">[00:59:54]</a>. This means Notion's existing "Lego blocks for knowledge work" can be assembled by an AI coding agent to create any kind of specialized software, fulfilling the original vision of enabling more people to build tools without being software engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:08">[01:00:08]</a>.

## Market Dynamics: Bundling and Unbundling

Zhao notes the cyclical nature of market trends: "Empires long united must divide, long divided must unite" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:10">[01:01:10]</a>. This applies to software, which has seen phases of unbundling (e.g., early PC applications, current SaaS sprawl) followed by bundling (e.g., Microsoft Office Suite) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:57">[01:01:57]</a>. Currently, with the proliferation of tools (companies using ~100 SaaS tools) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:12">[01:02:12]</a>, the market is shifting back towards "a bundling approach" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:20">[01:02:20]</a>, especially with AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:23">[01:02:23]</a>. Understanding this trend helps determine whether to build a vertical or horizontal solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:32">[01:02:32]</a>.

## Key Takeaways for Founders

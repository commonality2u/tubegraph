Vikr Draman, Head of Product at Gojek, emphasizes that an effective operating model is crucial for product managers, especially for career advancement from mid-senior to senior levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:59">[00:18:59]</a>. This model focuses on how a product manager works with others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>.

## Key Components of an Operating Model

An effective operating model for a product manager encompasses:
*   **Communication** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>
*   **Collaboration** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>
*   **Organizational skills** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:13">[00:19:13]</a>
*   **Community skills** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a>

## Three Tenets for Working Effectively with Others

Vikr outlines three core tenets for product managers to work well with stakeholders:
1.  **Raise difficult issues without being difficult to work with** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a>. This means bringing up important topics without becoming an obstacle or hindrance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:47">[00:24:47]</a>. It's about ensuring your team is unblocked and not working on "stupid" or volatile tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:14">[00:25:14]</a>. Successful pushing back involves shifting the conversation from an emotional space to a logical one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:57">[00:25:57]</a>.
2.  **Bring out important topics without drawing importance to yourself** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>.
3.  **Be in charge of getting decisions made, not making all decisions yourself** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>. The role is to facilitate decisions, not dictate them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:06">[00:50:06]</a>.

These tenets are easy to state but challenging to embody daily, and they represent a continuous struggle for product managers at any career level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>.

### The Role of a Product Manager in Collaboration

Product managers act as the "community enabler" within their teams and organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:26">[00:52:26]</a>. This "community" aspect is the "software" that binds everyone together towards a common mission of delivering an output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:32">[00:52:32]</a>. This is especially vital for remote or distributed teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:50">[00:52:50]</a>.

Product managers are unique because they are the only discipline that co-collaborates and ties together all other disciplines: strategy, technology, design, and data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:52">[00:49:52]</a>. Their role is to pair with everyone else, gaining unique insights that no one else on the team possesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:04">[00:50:04]</a>.

### Addressing Confusion in the PM Role

The ambiguity surrounding the [[challenges_and_strategies_in_product_management | product management]] role can be a hurdle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:42">[00:46:42]</a>. Since there's no single concrete definition, product managers and other stakeholders often remain unsure of expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:07">[00:47:07]</a>.

The guiding principle is: if something is blocking product progress, a product manager should work on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:06">[00:48:06]</a>. While product management has an "artistic" side, it also involves "method and frameworks" that can be learned and practiced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:55">[00:48:55]</a>. It's about using the "science" to understand the "art" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:10">[00:49:10]</a>.

Instead of obsessing over what product management *is*, focus on your contribution and output across key areas: data, design, technology, and strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:21">[00:49:21]</a>. The goal is to always elevate the team's overall contribution, energy, and output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:30">[00:50:30]</a>. It is important to view yourself as playing a role rather than being defined by your title or function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:20">[00:51:20]</a>.

### Core Skills for Product Managers

Beyond the operating model, product managers should continually develop skills in eight key areas to foster [[improving_product_management_skills | career growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:31">[00:38:31]</a>:
*   Data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:34">[00:38:34]</a>
*   Design and Research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:34">[00:38:34]</a>
*   Technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:36">[00:38:36]</a>
*   Strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:36">[00:38:36]</a>
*   Communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:39">[00:38:39]</a>
*   Collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:41">[00:38:41]</a>
*   Organizational Skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:41">[00:38:41]</a>
*   Community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:43">[00:38:43]</a>

When starting out, it's recommended to pick one area from data or technology and one from design and research to focus on, as these often provide the maximum leverage for [[improving_product_management_skills | skill development]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:10">[00:41:10]</a>. Soft skills like communication, collaboration, and community are lifelong learning journeys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>.

Venture capital (VC) funding is often presented as the default or ideal path for startups, encouraging a "go big or go home" mentality to achieve "unicorn status" and rapid growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. However, this approach comes with significant [[challenges_of_managing_a_startup | pitfalls]] and is rarely the successful outcome for most businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## The Venture Capital Default

Most founders, by default, pursue the venture route, raising money from VCs and angel investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. While this can be necessary for certain capital-intensive companies, like those building cars or opening restaurants that require significant upfront investment in physical assets and staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>, it's not ideal for all businesses, especially software companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.

Historically, software businesses should have incredibly healthy margins, often close to 80% or 90%, due to minimal physical costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. Yet, the Silicon Valley model has found a way to make this most profitable type of business the least profitable, with many barely breaking even or remaining unprofitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. This often stems from hiring too many people and overspending on customer acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.

## Key Pitfalls of Venture Funding

### Pressure for Growth Over Profitability
Venture-backed companies typically operate with the understanding that they will lose money for a long time to achieve massive future revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. The goal is to "grow as fast as possible, as big as possible," with profitability as a distant future goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.

This intense focus on growth leads to a singular outcome: "go huge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. If a venture-backed company fails to achieve this exponential growth, it often "withers on the vine and die[s]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. This contrasts sharply with the vast "room to make it and to build a successful business" that exists between a small operation and a massive unicorn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

### Loss of Independence and Control
Accepting venture capital often means giving up significant control and independence. Founders become "beholden to someone else's time frame and expectations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:08">[01:06:08]</a>. This can force founders to deviate from their desired [[entrepreneurial_journey_and_startup_founding | entrepreneurial journey]] and eventually stop doing what they enjoy to sell the business for an investor's return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:03">[01:07:03]</a>.

### Encourages Sloppiness and Poor Financial Discipline
A large influx of capital, while seemingly beneficial, can lead to "sloppiness" because there's no immediate pressure to be efficient or profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:53">[01:16:53]</a>. Investors provide money to be spent, not saved, primarily on people and marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:28">[01:17:28]</a>.

Companies that are "pumped full of money by somebody else" don't get practice in the "fundamental skill" of making money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:29">[01:18:29]</a>. Instead, they become good at spending money, which is a less valuable skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:01">[01:19:01]</a>. This lack of financial discipline can become a major liability when economic cycles shift and money becomes harder to find <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:07">[01:21:07]</a>.

### Limited Optionality
VC funding narrows a company's potential outcomes. Instead of having multiple paths to success, a venture-backed company is locked into pursuing massive scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. This eliminates the possibility of building a smaller, sustainable, and highly profitable business that might be more fulfilling for the founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:58">[01:05:58]</a>.

## The Alternative: Bootstrapping

Bootstrapping, or self-funding, offers a different option that can be more fulfilling, fun, and even more lucrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. Most businesses globally are bootstrapped, operating on the principle of making more money than they spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:13">[00:28:13]</a>.

[[tactical_advice_for_earlystage_founders | For early-stage founders]], the advice for bootstrapping is to:
*   **Stay as small as possible for as long as possible** to control costs, which is the only thing truly within a founder's control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:11">[01:12:11]</a>.
*   **Do as much as possible on your own** before hiring the first person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:41">[01:12:41]</a>.
*   **Avoid unnecessary expenses** like branding or office space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:11">[01:13:11]</a>.
*   **Embrace constraints**, as they can lead to better outcomes and foster resourcefulness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:35">[01:19:35]</a>.

> "The reason I think it's great for entrepreneurs to to start bootstrapping is because they just have more practice making money they get better and better and better at the fundamental skill you need to have ultimately to a successful business which is to make money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:47">[01:18:47]</a>

Bootstrapping fosters a "scrappiness" that large cash reserves often diminish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:37">[01:20:37]</a>. This approach encourages focusing on what can be done immediately and making money, rather than pursuing grand, potentially unachievable, venture-scale goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:28">[01:20:28]</a>.

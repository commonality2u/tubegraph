From: [[lennyspodcast]] <br/> 

The rise of AI has brought a significant shift in how search engine optimization (SEO) operates, particularly with [[integrating_ai_in_search_results | AI answers being integrated into search results]] transparently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. Initially, there were fears of an "apocalypse" for SEO, where AI overviews would provide direct answers, eliminating the need for users to click on long-form content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. However, while the landscape is shifting, SEO is not dying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:06">[01:24:06]</a>.

Eli Schwarz, a growth advisor specializing in SEO who has worked with companies like Quora, Coinbase, Tinder, LinkedIn, WordPress, and Zapier, emphasizes a refreshing take on how to approach and succeed in SEO in this new paradigm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.

## The Impact of AI Overviews on Search

Google is now greatly increasing the number of searches that include an AI-generated answer at the top of the search results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>. This means things are changing rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>.

Historically, Google monetizes through ads, and the introduction of AI answers creates [[integrating_ai_in_search_results | monetization issues]] as users might not click on ads if the answer is provided directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:00">[09:05:00]</a>. There are also [[integrating_ai_in_search_results | liability concerns]] if AI generates harmful or incorrect advice, as Google becomes the publisher rather than just a search engine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:24:00">[09:24:00]</a>. Plagiarism is another issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:48:00">[09:48:00]</a>.

The primary impact of AI overviews is that they push organic search results down, meaning people get answers directly and might not click on links <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>. This changes the user journey significantly.

### Top-Funnel vs. Mid-Funnel Searches

The "discovery" step of search is being increasingly "swallowed up" by large language models (LLMs) and AI overviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>. These AI-generated answers provide a direct answer for top-of-funnel queries, reducing the need for users to click through multiple links <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>.

*   **Top-Funnel (Discovery):** Queries where users are curious or seeking general information (e.g., "best podcasting tools," "what is a CRM," "best beach vacation") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>. AI overviews excel at providing summarized answers for these.
    *   For example, if you search "When is Hanukkah," Google now provides the answer directly, similar to how it previously handled structured data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>.
    *   WebMD, which provides generic content about the human body, will be significantly impacted because AI overviews can give direct answers to questions like "I have a headache, should I take Advil?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.
*   **Mid-Funnel (Intent/Action):** Queries where users have a more specific need or are ready to take action. This is where SEO opportunities continue to remain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>.
    *   After an AI overview suggests Cancun for a beach vacation, the user moves to the mid-funnel by searching for "Cancun hotels" or "flights to Cancun" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>.
    *   Similarly, after learning about podcasting tools, a user might search "Riverside price" or "Riverside capacity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>. This demonstrates user intent to buy or use a specific product.

The shift means that websites that previously ranked for broad, top-of-funnel keywords through long-form content may find their content less relevant as AI directly answers these questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>.

## New Paradigm for SEO Success

Eli Schwarz advocates thinking of SEO as a product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>. [[Adapting to AI driven changes in organizations | Product managers]] should be at the forefront of this, considering how to position their offering to users who are on a self-discovery journey through search, rather than those influenced by social media or ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>.

SEO should focus on the mid-funnel, where conversions can potentially happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>. This requires understanding the user's specific problem and how the product can provide a solution.

### Examples of Product-Led SEO:

*   **Zapier:** Instead of waiting for users to search for "Zapier," they identified that users were looking to connect specific apps (e.g., "Gmail and Salesforce") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. They built programmatic pages showcasing how Zapier could bridge these connections, creating a flywheel effect by solving a known user need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. This is a legendary success in [[types_and_implementation_of_seo_programmatic_vs_editorial | programmatic SEO]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.
*   **Tinder:** Tinder recognized that many users searched for "online dating in [city]" not just for dating, but to solve a "loneliness problem" when in a new city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. They built local pages that suggested date locations and positioned Tinder as the solution to loneliness, tapping into a mid- or bottom-of-funnel problem that AI overviews cannot fully solve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.

## Key Elements of an Effective SEO Strategy

[[Key elements of an effective SEO strategy | Step one]] for any company is to **be the user** and develop customer empathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>. If you cannot answer what problem a user will search for that your product solves, then you should not invest in SEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.

[[Key elements of an effective SEO strategy | Step two]] involves **thinking about the asset to create** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>. This requires deciding if the solution needs to be global, and if it warrants a programmatic approach (e.g., generating pages for every city for local dating) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>.

[[Key elements of an effective SEO strategy | The third step]] is **building the product for the SEO user** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>. This isn't just about content; it requires design, [[transformations_in_engineering_roles_with_ai | engineering]], product management, and user research resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>. The content pages should solve problems and guide users towards your product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>.

## When and How to Invest in SEO

[[When and how to invest in SEO as a company | SEO is not free]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>. Companies must evaluate the cost in time, resources, and direct expenses against potential returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>.

*   **Good Fit:** Companies with a clear SEO journey where users search for a problem and the product directly provides a self-serve solution that converts (e.g., SurveyMonkey, where users searched for survey templates, found a free tool, and upgraded) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>.
*   **Poor Fit (Often B2B SaaS):** Many B2B SaaS tools are not a good fit for SEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. If a product requires a sales process, committee decision, or significant integration, users won't convert directly from a search result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>. The user may discover the product, but it won't lead to an online conversion, making the ROI on SEO low compared to sales or [[building_a_brand_with_ai | brand]] efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>. Google Cloud, for example, competes with Amazon and Microsoft, and no one makes a multi-million dollar decision from a Google search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>.

**Measuring Success:**
The most important metric for SEO success is conversion, not just rankings or traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>. Define what "conversion" means for your business:
*   Media companies: Page views or ad revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>.
*   SaaS tools: Marketing Qualified Leads (MQLs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>.
*   E-commerce: Dollar conversions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>.

Don't drive traffic to content that doesn't convert, as it doesn't help the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>.

## Leveraging AI in SEO Strategy

AI is a tool, not a solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.
*   **Content Generation:** Don't use AI to create "worthless content" just for the sake of having content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>. However, if the content is useful and part of the user's journey, AI can create it more cheaply and efficiently (e.g., product descriptions for e-commerce sites) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>. Google's documentation states that AI itself is not the problem; the helpfulness and usefulness of the content are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>.
*   **AI Overviews:** Showing up in an AI overview is more of a [[building_a_brand_with_ai | branding exercise]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a>. If your brand is mentioned, it means your brand efforts are working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>. If your link appears, it means Google has summarized your content, and users may or may not click off of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>.

## Programmatic vs. Editorial SEO

There are two main approaches to content creation for SEO:
*   **[[Types and implementation of SEO Programmatic vs Editorial | Programmatic SEO]]:** Takes various data sources and combines them into comprehensive pages at scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.
    *   **TripAdvisor:** Combines hotel data with city information and user-generated content (UGC) to create unique pages for each property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.
    *   **Zillow:** Integrates government data, comparison data, photos, and neighborhood/school data to provide property values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>. This only works through SEO because it's impossible to pay for traffic for every single property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>.
*   **[[Types and implementation of SEO Programmatic vs Editorial | Editorial SEO]]:** Involves writing long-form content for specific topics or keywords, often used by media companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>.

Programmatic SEO is generally the preferred path when there's scale and a clear user use case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. Don't use programmatic just to generate content if there's no actual user need or solution provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>.

## Insights from the Google Antitrust Verdict

A recent antitrust verdict against Google revealed significant details about their search dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>.
*   **Market Share:** Google holds 98% of mobile searches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>.
*   **Default Partnerships:** Google's success is heavily influenced by its default agreements with Apple and its ownership of Chrome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>. For example, Bing tried to offer itself to Apple for free, but Apple refused to take it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>.
*   **Competitor Challenges:** Startups like Neva, perplexity, and Claude, and even established players like DuckDuckGo, struggle to unseat Google despite offering good search experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>. DuckDuckGo, after 12 years and significant investment, only grew from 1% to 2% market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>. This highlights the power of habit, brand, and distribution agreements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>.

## SEO Myths Debunked

1.  **"You need to do SEO":** Not every company or product should invest in SEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>. Evaluate the user journey and conversion path to determine if it's the right channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>.
2.  **"Link building is the secret sauce":** Link building is actually [[building_a_brand_with_ai | brand building]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>. Paying for guest posts or low-authority links doesn't work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>. The right way is to build an awesome product that people want to use and mention naturally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>. Mentions can now be as valuable as traditional HTML links <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>.
3.  **"Google is a black box":** While there are nuances to ranking, the basics of SEO are simple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>. Google provides best practices: build a website Google can understand, link to pages, and write helpful content users want to read <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.
4.  **"Technical SEO solves all problems":** Technical SEO is important for very large websites with millions of pages (like Zillow or Airbnb) for crawling and understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>. For smaller websites (e.g., 100-page SaaS site), investing heavily in technical SEO or page speed optimization is often a waste of time and money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>.
5.  **"TikTok/Instagram are replacing search":** While Gen Z uses these platforms for top-of-funnel discovery (e.g., travel inspiration), Google remains dominant for mid-funnel queries with intent (e.g., booking flights or hotels) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>. Different platforms serve different parts of the user journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>.

## Tools and Techniques for SEO Analysis and Growth

When forecasting SEO potential, avoid relying solely on "bottoms-up" keyword research tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>. These [[Tools and techniques for SEO analysis and growth | keyword research tools]] often provide inaccurate search volumes, sometimes off by many factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>. They are useful for understanding relative search trends or variations (e.g., "WordPress" with vs. without a space) but not for exact numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>.

Instead, consider a "top-down" or Total Addressable Market (TAM) forecast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>. For example, to estimate shoe sales in Japan, start with the total population, narrow down to demographics (e.g., men), then refine by purchasing habits (e.g., buying online), and finally apply an expected market penetration percentage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>. This provides a more realistic and adjustable forecast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>.

SEO is not a dark art; it is simple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>. Even product managers without a traditional SEO background can implement effective strategies and drive significant results by focusing on user needs and measurable conversions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>.

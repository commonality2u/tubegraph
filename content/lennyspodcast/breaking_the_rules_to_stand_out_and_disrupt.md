The concept of "breaking the rules" is one of the seven rules of power, a set of principles taught by Jeffrey Pfeffer at Stanford's Graduate School of Business to help individuals grow their influence and advance their careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">[00:26:05]</a>. While the idea of gaining power may make some uncomfortable due to the realities of what it takes often not aligning with conventional moral teachings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>, understanding and applying these skills can lead to positive outcomes such as higher salaries, promotions, increased career satisfaction, and reduced stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

## Why Break the Rules?

Breaking the rules is a strategy for gaining power and influence for several key reasons:

*   **Standing Out and Memorability** When you do something unexpected or different, you become memorable and stand out from the crowd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:19">[00:26:19]</a>.
*   **Challenging the Status Quo** Rules are often established by those who benefit most from the existing system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:34">[00:26:34]</a>. To advance, it's necessary to challenge these established norms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:34">[00:26:34]</a>. This aligns with the concept of being a [[the_role_of_innovation_and_dissatisfaction_with_the_status_quo | disruptor]] in business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:40">[00:26:40]</a>.
*   **Playing to Strengths** Successful rule-breaking involves doing what plays to your unique strengths and enables you to stand out, ultimately leading to greater success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:15">[00:27:15]</a>.

## Examples of Rule Breaking

The principle of breaking rules can be observed both in business strategy and individual career advancement.

### Business Disruption
Companies that break industry rules often become disruptors:
*   **Southwest Airlines** did not follow the "Hub and spoke" model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:53">[00:26:53]</a>.
*   **Amazon** provided an "incredible level of customer service," diverging from traditional retail norms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:58">[00:26:58]</a>.
*   **Whole Foods** optimized for local taste rather than just the lowest cost of goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:02">[00:27:02]</a>.

### Individual Advancement
Applying the "Break the Rules" principle personally can lead to significant career shifts:

*   **Challenging Conventional Wisdom** A common rule to break is "don't ask for help" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:34">[00:27:34]</a>. Research suggests that people overestimate the number of times they'll need to ask for help and that asking for help, while uncomfortable, is beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:47">[00:27:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:54">[00:27:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:58">[00:27:58]</a>. If you ask and receive a "no," you are no worse off than if you hadn't asked at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:45">[00:28:45]</a>.
*   **Jason Calacanis** is cited as someone who consistently breaks rules in the venture capital industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:19">[00:29:19]</a>. He defies conventional wisdom by making "a lot of little bets not a few big bets" and runs a "very lean operation" without many partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:43">[00:29:43]</a>. His background in journalism allowed him to ask many questions and gain significant insights, which contributed to his powerful position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:59">[00:29:59]</a>.

## The Learning Process

Adopting rule-breaking strategies can be uncomfortable, often involving stages of denial, anger, and sadness before reaching acceptance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:50">[00:51:50]</a>. To master these skills, practice and coaching are essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:55">[00:52:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:59">[00:52:59]</a>. This involves starting with small, manageable steps that push you slightly out of your comfort zone, rather than attempting drastic changes immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:33">[00:53:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:04">[00:54:04]</a>. Staying within your comfort zone will not lead to different or better outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:14">[00:54:14]</a>. This approach mirrors the "15% rule," where one pushes themselves just 15% beyond their comfort zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:58">[00:54:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:07">[00:55:07]</a>.

For individuals seeking to apply these principles, it is recommended to get a coach or establish a "personal board of directors" to provide advice, social support, and accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:03">[01:18:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:12">[01:18:12]</a>. Doing things with help makes them significantly more achievable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:41">[01:18:41]</a>.

## The Broader Implications

The ability to effectively wield power and influence is not merely about personal gain; it can also be a catalyst for positive change. As stated in the book, "if you want power to be used for good, more good people need to have power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:23">[01:08:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:28">[01:08:28]</a>. Dr. Laura Esserman, a breast cancer surgeon and a close friend of Jeffrey Pfeffer, exemplifies this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:44">[01:04:44]</a>. Despite initial reluctance to engage in "networking" and other power behaviors, her willingness to learn and apply these principles allowed her to overcome "friction" and achieve "profound changes" in drug development and healthcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:46">[01:05:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:31">[01:06:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:37">[01:06:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:29">[01:07:29]</a>. Her efforts earned her recognition, including being named one of Time Magazine's 100 most influential people in the world in 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:05">[01:07:05]</a>. She even fought with organizations like the American Cancer Society and the Susan G. Komen Foundation to implement necessary changes in screening and treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:11">[01:08:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:16">[01:08:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:52">[01:08:52]</a>.

However, the pursuit of power comes with trade-offs. Individuals must decide if they prioritize power or autonomy, as "you can have power or you can have autonomy but you cannot have both" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:14">[01:11:14]</a>. High-power positions often involve significant loss of control over one's schedule, intense public scrutiny, and a lack of privacy, impacting personal life and relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:05">[01:14:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:23">[01:14:23]</a>.

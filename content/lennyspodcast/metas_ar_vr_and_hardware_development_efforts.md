Andrew Bosworth, widely known as "Boz," currently serves as Meta's Chief Technology Officer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. He joined Facebook in early 2006 as one of its first engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:57">[00:56:57]</a>. Over his 18-year tenure, he has been instrumental in creating significant products, including the Facebook News Feed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:10">[01:08:10]</a> and the original Facebook mobile ads platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:17">[01:17:17]</a>. In 2017, he established the company's AR/VR organization, now known as Reality Labs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:38">[01:37:38]</a>. Today, Boz spearheads Meta's initiatives in augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and mixed reality, alongside consumer hardware such as Quest and Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:01">[01:42:01]</a>.

## Reality Labs and Product Focus

Meta's Reality Labs focuses on developing immersive technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:38">[01:37:38]</a>. Key hardware products include the Quest series and the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:49">[01:47:49]</a>. Boz has been particularly adamant about integrating features like hand tracking and mixed reality into headsets, believing them critical for mainstream adoption due to ease of use and accessibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:40">[02:41:40]</a>. Despite initial team resistance, he held high performance benchmarks for hand tracking, which were ultimately met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:01">[02:42:01]</a>.

## Comparison with Apple Vision Pro

Boz and Mark Zuckerberg collectively tried the Apple Vision Pro headset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:57">[01:57:57]</a>. They found that the internal technology did not represent a fundamental breakthrough, with the exception of Apple Silicon, which is a "2X Marvel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:01">[02:04:01]</a>. However, this linear scaling advantage doesn't significantly impact quadratic resolution scaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:01">[02:04:01]</a>.

While acknowledging the Vision Pro's strengths in high-resolution movie watching and its tuned pass-through for stationary use, as well as its polished UI, Boz asserts that Meta believes their Quest 3 headset is the "actual best headset" overall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:04">[02:59:04]</a>.

Key points of comparison:
*   **Resolution:** Vision Pro excels for stationary, high-resolution media consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:05">[03:09:05]</a>.
*   **Pass-through:** Vision Pro's pass-through shines when stationary and looking straight ahead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:08">[03:16:08]</a>.
*   **Eye Tracking:** Apple's eye tracking requires prescription inserts, as cameras shoot through the lens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:08">[03:06:08]</a>. Meta's Quest Pro allows corrective lenses by tracking from the side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:08">[03:06:08]</a>.
*   **Hand Tracking:** Meta's hand tracking is considered superior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:32">[03:30:32]</a>.
*   **App Library:** Quest currently has a better app library <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:32">[03:30:32]</a>.
*   **Comfort & Field of View:** Vision Pro's field of view is significantly smaller, which Boz finds distracting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:42">[03:41:42]</a>.
*   **Display Brightness & Motion Blur:** Quest 3 displays are brighter, and have less motion blur in mixed reality use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:04">[03:59:04]</a>.
*   **Controllers:** Quest 3 includes controllers, which Boz believes expands user capabilities, akin to using a mouse with a keyboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:06">[04:16:06]</a>.
*   **Price:** The Quest 3 is significantly more affordable, leading Boz to ask people to consider if they'd rather have seven Quest 3s or one Apple Vision Pro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>.

Boz encourages consumers to try the Quest 3 themselves to form an informed opinion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:49">[04:47:47]</a>. He also highlighted that Quest 3 supports remote desktop, allowing users to have up to three virtual monitors streamed from their machine in Meta's "work rooms" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:06">[05:05:06]</a>.

Regarding Mark Zuckerberg's public video comparing the two headsets, Boz states it was simply an expression of what Mark genuinely thought of the product, not a "four-dimensional chess" strategic move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:28:30">[08:28:30]</a>.

## Future AR Capabilities and Devices

Meta is actively playing with glasses that possess full AR capabilities, with a rumored internal device expected soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:00">[07:31:00]</a>. These "time machines" offer exciting potential, such as delivering speeches with notes visible on the glasses and controlling slides with gestures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:00">[07:54:00]</a>.

The Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses are lauded as a favorite AR device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:09">[06:09:09]</a>. They enable users to record their surroundings naturally, without a camera in their face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>. A future multimodal capability will allow users to ask the [[ai_and_software_development|Meta AI]] assistant questions using the camera, providing real-time information about their environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>. Boz described a personal experience where the glasses identified amenities in a ski village <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>. This capability is currently in a closed beta but will eventually be available for all Ray-Ban Meta glasses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03:00">[08:03:00]</a>.

## Long-Term Investments

Meta has made significant long-term investments in two primary areas over the past decade: [[ai_and_software_development|AI]] and Reality Labs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:17:00">[11:17:00]</a>. Boz believes their [[ai_and_software_development|AI]] efforts, particularly with Llama 2 and the breakthroughs from their [[the_role_of_ai_in_software_development|AI research lab (FAIR)]], are "looking pretty good today" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:24:00">[11:24:00]</a>. FAIR is the second most cited [[the_role_of_ai_in_software_development|AI research lab]] globally, behind Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:33:00">[11:33:00]</a>.

He acknowledges that Meta did not effectively communicate these long-term investments to the market previously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:46:00">[11:46:00]</a>. This became apparent when economic "tide went out" due to global events, leading to external pressure to cut investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:59:00">[11:59:00]</a>. Boz emphasizes that a company should maintain a balanced portfolio of investments to avoid committing itself to "dying at some point" by only shoring up the core business during tough times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:21:00">[12:21:00]</a>. The recent positive turnaround in Meta's stock price and public perception is attributed to better communication of these long-term bets and the core business's recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:35:00">[11:35:00]</a>.

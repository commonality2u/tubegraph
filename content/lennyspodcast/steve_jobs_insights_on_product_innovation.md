Steve Jobs, a legendary figure in the product management community, rarely spoke about the nature of building products directly, preferring to discuss the products themselves. However, a 1995 interview, "The Lost Interview," provides a rare glimpse into his philosophical views on product innovation and the challenges companies face in maintaining their "mojo" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:30">[03:30:30]</a>.

## Why Companies Lose Their "Mojo"

Jobs' theory from 1995 explains why many companies lose their ability to innovate and become "bad product companies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:47:33">[18:47:33]</a>. His argument, described as better and more relevant than even contemporary theories, centers on the shifting priorities within growing organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:29:29">[18:29:29]</a>.

Jobs believed that as companies grow, the importance of product historically diminishes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:27:30">[19:27:30]</a>. Instead, the focus shifts to celebrating and promoting individuals in marketing, sales, and finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:39:42">[19:39:42]</a>. While these roles are crucial for growth and cost-cutting, their prominence leads to a decline in the value placed on product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:46:04">[19:46:04]</a>. Consequently, skilled product people become disillusioned and leave for companies that genuinely value product, creating a cycle where the best talent migrates away from less product-focused organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:06:08">[20:06:08]</a>. This explains why many companies don't operate like the best in the industry, despite strong incentives like profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:07">[04:39:07]</a>.

This phenomenon is viewed as a "disease of a company" where possessing significant market share leads to a complacency that stifles [[inventiveness_and_innovation_in_business | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:43:52">[20:43:52]</a>. When founders depart, companies often become fearful, focusing solely on [[building_and_scaling_product_innovations | value capture activities]] (optimization, A/B testing) rather than [[building_and_scaling_product_innovations | value creation activities]] (discovery, risk-taking) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:19:47">[21:19:47]</a>. This fear stems from not knowing what is essential versus incidental to the business, leading to low-risk tweaking instead of major improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:50:18">[21:50:18]</a>.

## The "Diseases" Threatening Product Success

Beyond the shift in internal priorities, Jobs highlighted specific "diseases" that undermine effective product development:

### The Disease of Managers (Ideas vs. Craftsmanship)
Jobs emphasized that managers often believe an idea constitutes 90% of the work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:23:44">[23:23:44]</a>. However, he stressed that the idea is merely the starting point; the true challenge lies in the "craftsmanship of going from an idea to a product" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:42:07">[23:42:07]</a>. This process involves [[building_and_scaling_product_innovations | product discovery]], constant iteration, and making trade-offs, often leading to a final product vastly different from the initial concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:48:47">[23:48:47]</a>. Many executives lack appreciation for this iterative process, mistakenly believing that a prioritized list of features from a meeting will result in a great product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:00:27">[24:00:27]</a>. Research suggests that only about 20% of such feature-driven initiatives yield positive returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:18:03">[24:18:03]</a>.

[!INFO] **Key Takeaway on Ideas:**
"An idea is just sort of the very sparkle in the eye; it's just the start. Getting to a product is what matters, and that's work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:44:03">[24:44:03]</a>.

### The Disease of Process People
Jobs also warned against the "disease of processed people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:46:17">[55:46:17]</a>. Scaling is inherently difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:58:19">[55:58:19]</a>, and while some attempt to scale primarily through process, Jobs advocated for scaling with leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:06:17">[56:06:17]</a>. Over-reliance on rigid processes (like "Safe," which is described as repackaged waterfall) can lead to stagnation and destroy a company's ability to innovate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:28:38">[56:28:38]</a>. True product companies understand that process is not the ultimate answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:15:28">[57:15:28]</a>.

## Focus on Solution Discovery

Jobs was keenly focused on solution discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:16:03">[27:16:03]</a>. While understanding the problem is foundational, companies should prioritize the unique solution they offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:47:35">[26:47:35]</a>. People don't buy a problem; they buy a solution that is better than existing alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Therefore, product teams should dedicate ample time to developing a winning solution rather than excessively validating a problem that may already be well-understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:06:05">[27:06:05]</a>. This emphasis on solution discovery aligns with modern [[leveraging_first_principles_thinking_in_product_management | product management]] philosophies.

Marketing concepts like [[segmentation_and_productizing_for_different_customer_needs | segmentation]] and personas are often confused due to poorly defined terms and historical biases towards consumer marketing models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:50">[00:54:50]</a>.

## Understanding [[segmentation_and_productizing_for_different_customer_needs | Segmentation]]

[[segmentation_and_productizing_for_different_customer_needs | Segmentation]] defines how a market is divided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:22">[00:55:22]</a>. In B2B, this typically involves firmographics such as:
*   Company size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:29">[00:56:29]</a>
*   Number of employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:30">[00:56:30]</a>
*   Revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:31">[00:56:31]</a>
*   Geography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:31">[00:56:31]</a>

However, [[segmentation_and_productizing_for_different_customer_needs | segmentation]] can also be based on characteristics not directly related to firmographics, such as a company having a creative team with more than three people, a specific budget, or using a particular software package <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:33">[00:56:33]</a>. The goal is to create an "actionable [[segmentation_and_productizing_for_different_customer_needs | segmentation]]" that allows sales and marketing teams to identify and target specific companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:59">[00:56:59]</a>.

It's crucial to identify patterns in the *companies* that show appreciation for a product to inform [[segmentation_and_productizing_for_different_customer_needs | segmentation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:18">[00:57:18]</a>. This deep understanding is essential for building a comprehensive go-to-market strategy, effective marketing campaigns, and targeted account lists for sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:40">[00:57:40]</a>.

## Understanding Personas

Personas are about *people* and capture the characteristics of a particular buyer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:52">[00:55:52]</a>. They aim to provide a deep understanding of who the buyer is, what they care about, their hopes, dreams, fears, and goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:57">[00:55:57]</a>.

### The Role of the Champion Persona in B2B

In a typical B2B purchase process for enterprise software, often between five and seven people are involved in the decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:11">[00:58:11]</a>. For example, a VP of sales might decide a CRM is needed, assigning "poor John" to find one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:34">[00:58:34]</a>. John, as a sales ops manager, would have a specific persona capturing his characteristics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:46">[00:58:46]</a>. Other personas involved might include sales reps (end-users), the IT department, purchasing, legal, or the Chief Security Officer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:58">[00:58:58]</a>.

However, the most important persona is the "champion" in the account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:57">[01:00:57]</a>. This person's job is to gain consensus and champion the deal across all stakeholders, including the economic buyer (the person who writes the check) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:02">[01:01:02]</a>. If the [[Product positioning and its importance | positioning]] doesn't resonate with this champion, the product won't even make it onto a shortlist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:12">[01:01:12]</a>. The champion acts as a gatekeeper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:23">[01:01:23]</a>, and the focus should be on arming them to sell to other constituents within the deal cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:01">[01:02:01]</a>. Creating multiple detailed personas for every involved party is considered a "waste of time" if it distracts from the champion persona, who matters "times a thousand" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:12">[01:02:12]</a>.

## Key Differences

The fundamental difference lies in their focus:
*   **[[segmentation_and_productizing_for_different_customer_needs | Segmentation]]** is about dividing the *market* based on company characteristics or problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:18">[00:56:18]</a>. It's about *what companies* are ideal targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:24">[00:57:24]</a>.
*   **Personas** are about the *people* within those companies, detailing their motivations and needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:52">[00:55:52]</a>.

In B2B, while a consumer market might be segmented based on demographics that coincidentally resemble a persona <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:30">[00:55:30]</a>, B2B [[segmentation_and_productizing_for_different_customer_needs | segmentation]] is much more complex and focuses on the *company* as the target, enabling actionable sales and marketing strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:12">[00:56:12]</a>.

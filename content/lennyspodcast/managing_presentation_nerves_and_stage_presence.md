Many people, including seasoned speakers and leaders, experience nerves before giving a presentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:50">[00:54:50]</a>. These feelings can stem from a "fight or flight" instinct, where the body and mind perceive stepping onto a stage as a threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:45">[00:56:45]</a>. However, individuals who are more thoughtful and contemplative about speaking often have better content to share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:07">[00:56:07]</a>.

## Strategies for [[overcoming_public_speaking_anxiety | Overcoming Nerves]]

### Visualize Your Audience Positively
Before a talk, sit in the audience and look at the stage and setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>. Then, picture yourself on stage looking back at the audience, imagining friendly faces who are happy and delighted to see you speak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:11">[00:57:11]</a>. This [[visualization_techniques_for_speaking_anxiety | technique]] helps change the mental model that audience members might be scowling, judging, or doubting you, which are typically only thoughts in your head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:23">[00:57:23]</a>.

### Pre-Talk Rituals
Every speaker has a different ritual to prepare. Some might play heavy metal music and skip around to get energized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:58">[00:57:58]</a>. Others, like Nancy Duarte, find a dark, quiet corner backstage to sit and breathe, focusing on calming themselves down, especially if they naturally have high energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:07">[00:58:07]</a>.

A specific breathing pattern involves taking a deep breath, then another gulp of air while the lungs are full, and slowly exhaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:49">[00:59:49]</a>.

### Chemically Shift Your State
To combat nerves, try to chemically shift your body's state from nervousness to laughter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:34">[00:58:34]</a>. This can be achieved by having a small playlist of funny videos or things that make you laugh, watched right before walking on stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:26">[00:58:26]</a>. This [[public_speaking_and_humor_in_presentations | technique]] helps transport you away from the fear of the stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:29">[00:59:29]</a>.

### Focus on Passion
One of the most impactful [[tips_for_improving_public_speaking_and_overcoming_fear | tips for improving]] as a presenter is to choose a topic you are deeply passionate about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:20">[01:15:20]</a>. Work on that specific talk or volunteer opportunity where you feel compelled to see something happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:26">[01:15:26]</a>. This experience of presenting from your soul, from a place of passion, will teach you valuable lessons that can be applied to business presentations where you might not feel as passionate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:35">[01:15:35]</a>. Great presenters tap into this deep passion point and draw from it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:48">[01:15:48]</a>.

## Cultivating Stage Presence

### Visual Communication
Your body is a visual tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:24">[00:24:24]</a>. In certain moments, having slides off allows the audience to be 100% focused on your body, presence, and the words coming out of your mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>. This verbal "seeing" of what you're saying can be very powerful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:55">[00:40:55]</a>.

### Remote Presentation Presence
When presenting remotely, it's crucial to focus on maintaining eye contact by looking directly into the camera lens, not at the faces on the screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:30">[00:53:30]</a>. This practice, while initially unnatural, helps convey presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:57">[00:53:57]</a>. Remote settings limit visibility of hand gestures, body language, and the space a speaker occupies, which are common characteristics of in-person communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:09">[00:54:09]</a>. Coaching often focuses on how to project presence in this limited visual environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:20">[00:54:20]</a>.

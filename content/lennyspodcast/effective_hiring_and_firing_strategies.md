Uri Levine, co-founder of Waze and other successful companies, emphasizes the critical importance of effective hiring and firing decisions for startup success. He challenges the conventional "hiring and firing" order, asserting that "firing is hard decision, hiring is easy decisions," and thus, leaders must first master making the difficult choices involved in letting people go <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:26">[00:54:26]</a>. This perspective is crucial for [[optimizing_hiring_and_team_management_for_tech_startups | optimizing hiring and team management for tech startups]].

## The Importance of Decisive Firing

A significant number of startup failures are attributed to issues with the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:45">[00:54:45]</a>. Often, founders realize within the first month that a team member is not the right fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:14">[00:55:14]</a>. The core problem is not necessarily the team member, but the CEO's inability to make hard decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:27">[00:55:27]</a>.

In a small startup, hard decisions inevitably fall to the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:40">[00:55:40]</a>. If a CEO avoids these tough decisions, top-performing employees will leave because they do not want to be in an organization unable to make necessary changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:50">[00:55:50]</a>. When an individual shouldn't be in a small organization, everyone knows it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:27">[00:56:27]</a>, and this negatively impacts the entire team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:45">[00:56:45]</a>. This relates directly to [[managing_different_types_of_problematic_behavior_at_work | managing different types of problematic behavior at work]].

### The 30-Day Rule for New Hires

To counter this common pitfall, Levine proposes a tactical strategy for new hires:
*   **Mark your calendar**: Every time you hire someone new, mark your calendar for 30 days later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:02">[00:57:02]</a>.
*   **Ask a direct question**: At the 30-day mark, ask yourself: "Knowing what I know today, would I hire this person?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:08">[00:57:08]</a>.
*   **Act decisively**:
    *   **If 'Yes'**: Go to the person, express excitement about their contributions, tell them they are exceeding expectations, and consider giving them more equity to secure their loyalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:26">[00:57:26]</a>. This helps in [[hiring_and_retaining_top_talent_in_tech | hiring and retaining top talent]].
    *   **If 'No'**: Fire them immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:41">[00:57:41]</a>. Such individuals are already on a trajectory of not being successful and are causing damage to themselves, the team, and the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:46">[00:57:46]</a>.

> "Making hard decisions is hard, making easy decisions is easy. This is why no one likes to make the hard decisions because you need to leave with the consequences." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:30">[00:55:30]</a>

This proactive approach mirrors Netflix's "keeper test," where managers constantly ask if they would fight to retain an employee if they announced their departure; if not, they should be let go <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:41">[00:58:41]</a>.

## Hiring Strategies

### The Importance of References

In the hiring process, while interviews are common, it's crucial to speak with references who truly know the candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:51">[01:02:51]</a>. The most direct question to ask a reference is: "Would you hire him or would you hire her?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:11">[01:03:11]</a> This simple yes/no question helps ascertain true fit and potential. If the answer is "yes," a follow-up question could be, "Then why didn't you?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:32">[01:03:32]</a>.

### Applying Decision-Making to Career Paths

The principle of asking "Knowing what you know today, would you do something different?" extends beyond just hiring and firing to personal career decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:07">[01:00:07]</a>. If the answer is yes, then act on it today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:17">[01:00:17]</a>. For those struggling with their [[career_development_and_growth_strategies | career path]], Levine advises:
*   **Identify the problem**: If you dislike your job, ask why <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:01">[01:01:01]</a>.
*   **Assess change potential**: Determine if there's anything you can change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:03">[01:01:03]</a>.
*   **Set a timeline**: Revisit the question in 90 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:07">[01:01:07]</a>. If the situation hasn't improved, quit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:13">[01:01:13]</a>. This provides a framework for [[job_search_strategies_and_negotiation_tactics | job search strategies and negotiation tactics]] and personal career decisions.

Setting a timeline for decisions ensures action, as "if you don't set a timeline, it will never happen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:27">[01:01:27]</a>. This philosophy supports the idea that most decisions are "two-way doors," meaning they can be reversed, allowing for flexibility and change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:30">[01:01:30]</a>.

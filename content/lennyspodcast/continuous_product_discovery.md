[[the_role_of_discovery_in_product_management | Discovery]] refers to the work involved in deciding what to build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:24">[00:22:24]</a>. Every item in a product backlog is considered a "bet," and [[the_role_of_discovery_in_product_management | discovery]] helps make those bets better and more informed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While sometimes it makes sense to take a risky bet in business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, doing zero [[the_role_of_discovery_in_product_management | discovery]] means all bets are inherently risky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

The definition of [[continuous_product_discovery | continuous discovery]] involves building in continuous feedback loops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a>. This approach acknowledges that digital products are never truly "done" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>. There is a shift from a project mindset (where a product is "finished" once delivered) to a continuous mindset, where products are continuously evolving and improving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:15">[00:23:15]</a>. This means teams are continuously making decisions about what to build and should therefore continuously include the customer in that process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:35">[00:23:35]</a>.

## Discovery as a Continuous Habit

Instead of viewing [[the_role_of_discovery_in_product_management | discovery]] and delivery as separate, sequential phases (e.g., first discover, then deliver), they should be seen as parallel, ongoing activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Teams should always be [[balancing_discovery_and_delivery_in_product_management | delivering and discovering]] simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Cultivating a "discovery habit" leads to increasingly better bets over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. If an organization is making only risky bets due to a lack of [[the_role_of_discovery_in_product_management | discovery]], the solution is not to halt product development, but to start doing some [[the_role_of_discovery_in_product_management | discovery]] in parallel to improve future bets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Teresa Torres and Continuous Discovery Habits

Teresa Torres, author of *Continuous Discovery Habits*, is a speaker, teacher, consultant, and product coach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Her book is highly recommended within the product community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. Torres has worked with, taught, and impacted a significant number of [[product_management_skills_and_best_practices | product managers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

Key topics covered by Torres include:
*   The Opportunity Solution Tree framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
*   Creating a system for regular customer engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
*   Making a case for more customer conversations and user research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
*   Common mistakes and best practices in customer interviewing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
*   Automating the customer conversation process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

Torres's website, producttalk.org, hosts her blog and courses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

## The Opportunity Solution Tree Framework

This framework is a simple but powerful visual tool for visualizing product strategy, identifying levers, prioritizing, and gaining alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. It's designed to help product teams manage the complex problem of starting from an outcome and determining what to build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. It provides a scaffolding for teams to shift from simply building features to working towards outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

The tree visual starts with:
1.  **An Outcome** at the root <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.
2.  Branches into the **Opportunity Space** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.
3.  Further branches into **Solutions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.
4.  And potentially **Assumption Tests** from there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

### Distinguishing Opportunities from Solutions

A common challenge is differentiating between the problem space (opportunities) and the solution space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. An opportunity is an unmet need, pain point, or desire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. Many people mistakenly frame solutions as opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. Good product development involves getting comfortable in the problem/opportunity space and taking time to frame problems before jumping to solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.

*   **Example (Streaming Entertainment):**
    *   **Outcome:** Increase engagement with Netflix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.
    *   **Opportunity Space (structured by user experience steps):** Deciding what to watch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.
    *   **Specific Pain Point/Opportunity:** "I can't tell if this show is good or not" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.
    *   **More Specific Opportunity:** "It's hard to enter my password/search with the Apple TV remote" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>. This is a specific, solvable opportunity, unlike a vague "I wish this was easier to use" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>.

As one moves vertically down the tree, opportunities should become smaller and more specific, allowing for actionable solutions while still contributing to a larger problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. This approach allows for strategic decisions about where to focus efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.

### Building an Opportunity Solution Tree

Opportunities emerge from customer stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>. This requires skilled interviewing, where the interviewer collects narratives rather than just facts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>.

#### Challenges in Building the Tree:
*   **Interviewing Well:** Many teams ask direct, out-of-context questions that elicit unreliable answers. Instead, asking "Tell me about the last time you X" collects rich, contextual stories that reveal unmet needs and desires users might not even be aware of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>. Interviewing is a grossly underestimated skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>.
*   **Identifying Opportunities:** Distinguishing opportunities from solutions is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>.
*   **Framing Opportunities:** Opportunities should be specific and solvable, not vague <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>.
*   **Structuring the Opportunity Space:** Ability to extract common experience map structures from unique customer stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>.

### Applying the Framework in Feature Factories

Even in companies that act as "feature factories" (where [[product_management_and_leadership_insights | product managers]] are treated more like project managers, told what to build rather than focusing on outcomes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:19">[00:31:19]</a>, individual product managers can still adopt the principles of [[continuous_product_discovery | continuous discovery]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>. Instead of trying to force organizational change, product managers can individually find customers to talk to, even if it means leveraging personal networks for B2B or B2C contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>. By understanding business outcomes and how their work contributes to them, product managers can make better daily decisions, even when prescribed solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>.

## Implementing Continuous Discovery

### Overcoming "No Time for Discovery"

The common objection "no time for [[the_role_of_discovery_in_product_management | discovery]]" often stems from outdated, project-based research methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:11">[00:24:11]</a>. Modern digital product environments require continuous value delivery, so [[the_role_of_discovery_in_product_management | discovery]] needs to match that cadence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>. [[continuous_product_discovery | Continuous discovery]] can be done with as little as one customer interview per week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:49">[00:24:49]</a>.

It's a mistake to believe that nothing should be in the backlog until it's "properly discovered" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:34">[00:25:34]</a>. Every item in the backlog is a bet, whether or not [[the_role_of_discovery_in_product_management | discovery]] has occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:41">[00:25:41]</a>. [[the_role_of_discovery_in_product_management | Discovery]] improves the quality of these bets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:46">[00:25:46]</a>. If a company has been making risky bets without [[the_role_of_discovery_in_product_management | discovery]], the solution is to keep making bets *in parallel* with starting [[the_role_of_discovery_in_product_management | discovery]] to gradually improve the quality of those bets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:16">[00:26:16]</a>.

### Automating Customer Recruitment

To sustain [[continuous_product_discovery | continuous discovery]], automating the customer recruiting process is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a>. The goal is to make it easier for product teams to interview regularly than not to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:21">[00:27:21]</a>.

*   **Opt-in via Product:** Embed a simple question in the product (similar to an NPS survey) asking if users have 20 minutes to talk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:52">[00:27:52]</a>. If they agree, scheduling software can automatically book a time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:09">[00:28:09]</a>. This works well for consumers and B2B end-users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:27">[00:28:27]</a>.
*   **Leverage Internal Teams (for B2B buyers/decision makers):** Sales, account managers, or support teams who are already in contact with these customers can recruit for interviews. The product team defines a weekly "trigger" (e.g., looking to talk to someone experiencing a specific pain point), and the internal teams use scheduling software to book meetings directly onto the product team's calendar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:30">[00:28:30]</a>.

Tools like Calendly (and its many alternatives) for scheduling, and Qualaroo, Ethnio, Intercom, Usabilla, Chameleon, or Hotjar for in-product intercepts can facilitate this automation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:13">[00:29:13]</a>.

### Interviewing Best Practices

*   **Focus on Stories, Not Just Answers:** Avoid long lists of direct questions ("What do you like to watch on Netflix?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:36">[00:36:36]</a>. Instead, aim for a natural, casual conversation, like "having a beer with a buddy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:56">[00:36:56]</a>.
*   **Elicit Timelines and Behavior:** Start with a broad question like "Tell me about the last time you [performed an action related to your product]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:40">[00:37:40]</a>. Then, use follow-up questions (e.g., "What happened next?", "Tell me about that?") to probe deeper into the user's actual behavior and experience, setting the scene and uncovering friction points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:12">[00:38:12]</a>.
*   **Listen Actively:** Interviewers often get so caught up in planning the next question that they stop listening. By slowing down and being genuinely curious about the interviewee's experience, interviewers can uncover invaluable insights that they wouldn't have thought to ask about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>.
*   **Focus on "Did Do" vs. "Would Do":** Product teams are in the business of changing behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:09">[00:38:09]</a>. Therefore, focus on what customers *actually did* in the past, not what they *think they would do* or *should do* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:41">[00:40:41]</a>. Hypothetical answers are often unreliable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:52">[00:40:52]</a>.
*   **Customers Enjoy Sharing:** Many customers enjoy sharing their stories, especially when the interviewer is genuinely engaged. A sign of a good interview is when the customer asks, "When can we do this again?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:19">[00:40:19]</a>.

### Managing Risk and Assumptions

Not all solutions require extensive [[the_role_of_discovery_in_product_management | discovery]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:13">[00:30:13]</a>. Robust [[the_role_of_discovery_in_product_management | discovery]] should be prioritized for core product experiences or differentiators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:23">[00:30:23]</a>. Teams should assess the amount of risk involved in each bet and how much of that risk needs to be mitigated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:51">[00:30:51]</a>.

To avoid overcommitting to an obvious solution, work with multiple solutions for the same opportunity, comparing and contrasting them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:43">[00:31:43]</a>. Just as one wouldn't choose a home or a job without options, good decisions require options and evaluating their pros and cons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:54">[00:31:54]</a>.

#### Qualitative Interviewing vs. Assumption Testing

[[the_role_of_discovery_in_product_management | Discovery]] involves two core activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:17">[00:44:17]</a>:
1.  **Qualitative Interviewing:** Used to learn about the opportunity space—identifying unmet needs, pain points, and desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:22">[00:44:22]</a>.
2.  **Assumption Testing:** Evaluating a solution by starting with a specific assumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:43">[00:44:43]</a>. An experiment is a form of user research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:11">[00:44:11]</a>.

The goal is to break down ideas into underlying assumptions, prioritize them, and run small, focused tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:10">[00:45:10]</a>. This approach makes [[continuous_product_discovery | continuous discovery]] sustainable, allowing teams to run many assumption tests (e.g., half a dozen to a dozen per week) across multiple ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:46">[00:45:46]</a>. This allows teams to compare and contrast solutions based on rapid feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:56">[00:45:56]</a>.

### Addressing Cynicism About Small Data

When challenged about making decisions based on a small number of interviews, it's important to recognize that all business decisions are often made with limited or zero data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:51">[00:42:51]</a>. One interview is better than zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:02">[00:43:02]</a>. The criticism often stems from differing opinions rather than a genuine concern about data validity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:09">[00:43:09]</a>.

Product teams can make decisions based on small experiments because:
*   They are in the business of changing behavior, not seeking new knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:28">[00:43:28]</a>.
*   They have strong feedback loops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:32">[00:43:32]</a>.
*   They continuously get more reliable data over time, especially through live production prototyping and large-scale data analysis after release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:37">[00:43:37]</a>.

### Scaling Continuous Discovery

Ideally, the fundamental process of [[continuous_product_discovery | continuous discovery]] should not change as a company grows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:14">[00:41:14]</a>. A successful team, whether three people or 100,000, should be:
*   Empowered with an outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:18">[00:41:18]</a>.
*   Interviewing weekly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:22">[00:41:22]</a>.
*   Assumption testing solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:24">[00:41:24]</a>.
*   Finding what to build to drive their outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:28">[00:41:28]</a>.

The main difference in larger companies is the presence of adjacent teams and increased dependencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:40]</a>. This requires more lateral collaboration, relying on design patterns and libraries for coherent user experience, and sharing [[the_role_of_discovery_in_product_management | discovery]] work to ensure a unified product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:56">[00:41:56]</a>. The core unit of effective product development remains the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:20">[00:42:20]</a>.

### Collaboration and the Product Trio

Torres argues against the "product manager as decider" or "CEO of the product" mentality, which she views as stemming from a "toxic business culture" that fosters internal politics and siloes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:41">[00:32:41]</a>. Effective product development thrives on collaboration, much like how children spontaneously collaborate without fixed roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:01">[00:33:01]</a>.

The "product trio" (product manager, designer, and software engineer) should collectively decide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:33">[00:34:33]</a>. In a well-functioning trio, disagreements are less frequent because they operate from a shared understanding. When disagreements arise, they recognize it means they haven't found the best option yet and continue to explore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:49">[00:34:49]</a>. While this model may seem "crazy" to those accustomed to dysfunctional, siloed teams, it leads to a deeper understanding of customer needs and better product outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:18">[00:35:18]</a>.

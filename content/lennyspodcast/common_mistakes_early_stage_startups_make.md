Gustav Alstromer, a Group Partner at Y Combinator, has worked with over 600 startups, providing a unique insight into the most common pitfalls early-stage companies face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:55">[01:21:55]</a>. The core reason companies fail is simple: they don't talk to users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This leads directly to a failure to find product-market fit, rendering all other efforts irrelevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. The fundamental principle for success is to "make things people want," a timeless truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Failure to Engage with Customers

One of the most frequent mistakes startups make is not [[importance_of_talking_to_customers_in_startups|talking to customers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>. Without direct engagement, founders cannot truly understand what is important to their potential users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>. This means they build solutions without validating the actual problem or demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:13">[00:23:13]</a>.

> [!quote] "If you don't talk to customers or users, you don't actually know what's important and if you don't know what's important it doesn't matter what you build it doesn't matter kind of what ideas you have in your head if you don't actually know what it is that you you need to build and you don't validate with customers, that's where a lot of the failure stems from." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>

A significant barrier to this essential activity is fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:52">[00:23:52]</a>. Founders are often afraid of rejection or hearing "no" from potential users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:16">[00:24:16]</a>. However, the reality is that most people are simply indifferent, not actively hateful, towards new products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:11">[00:30:11]</a>. They have busy lives and their time is already allocated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:25">[00:32:25]</a>. The goal is to find the 10% who are "early adopters" and willing to take risks on new solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:47">[00:24:47]</a>.

To truly understand customer pain points, founders should not just ask questions but actively observe users' workflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:58">[00:32:58]</a>. This firsthand observation reveals the intensity of problems that users might not even articulate as difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:22">[00:33:22]</a>.

## Lack of Technical Expertise

Another common problem for startups, especially outside of the Y Combinator program, is not being technical or not understanding what it takes to build a successful technology company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:24">[00:25:24]</a>. YC actively screens for founders who can build their first prototype themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:40">[00:25:40]</a>.

This issue often stems from not valuing the engineering aspect of a company sufficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:34">[00:35:34]</a>. The engineering part is often the most challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:18">[00:35:18]</a>. Founders need to understand that many crucial decisions and iterations in a startup's journey are technical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:35">[00:36:35]</a>. Relying solely on a hired engineer or a contracting firm for core product development rarely works, as it disconnects the founders from the necessary iterative process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:20">[00:38:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:30">[00:38:30]</a>.

## Misguided Motivations and Priorities

Some individuals approach starting a company as merely a "career step," which Gustav advises against <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>. If successful, a startup often becomes a decade-long commitment, and if unsuccessful, it's not generally something people aspire to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>. Startups are significantly harder than a normal job, regardless of success or failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>. Personal constraints like finances, family, or relationships that might overshadow the startup's demands are also reasons to reconsider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>.

Another common mistake is confusing external validation (e.g., being accepted into YC, receiving investor interest) with actual product-market fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:54">[00:26:54]</a>. Founders need to be continuously focused on customer needs rather than what investors or others might want <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:27">[00:42:27]</a>.

## Focusing on Strategy Over Execution

Early-stage startups often fall into the trap of prioritizing strategy over execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:06">[00:53:06]</a>. Unlike large corporations where strategy is vital, small startups can only effectively do one thing at a time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:43">[00:53:43]</a>. Therefore, execution is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:48">[00:53:48]</a>. Good founders are "execution-oriented" and maintain a clear, single priority, continually working to achieve it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:10">[00:54:10]</a>. Thinking about "company strategy" at this stage often indicates a lack of understanding of priorities, especially before achieving product-market fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:27">[00:54:27]</a>.

> [!tip] Preventing Failure
> Y Combinator's approach is not to predict which companies will be massive hits, but rather to identify and prevent common failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:23">[00:45:23]</a>. Founders are encouraged to "fail in some new exciting way, not one that we've seen a hundred times" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:31">[00:45:31]</a>. The goal is to provide direct feedback on actions likely to lead to failure, ensuring that talented teams avoid basic, repetitive mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:52">[00:45:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:11">[00:49:11]</a>.

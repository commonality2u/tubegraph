Linear, a fast-growing B2B SaaS product, actively works to avoid the feature bloat that often plagues enterprise software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:08">[01:46:08]</a>. Their strategy is rooted in specific principles and practices that prioritize user experience and efficient workflows over unchecked expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.

## Saying No to "Bloated" Features

Linear's primary method for [[staying_lean_and_efficient_in_company_growth | avoiding feature bloat]] is a strict policy of declining certain types of feature requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>. Specifically, they refuse:
> "Customization features requested by middle managers in order to make reporting a little bit easier at the cost of making IC workflow is worse. Right like it's like if it fits that description we're just saying no there's there's there's no debate because we've already thought about it and this is this is the thing that we can't we can't take a single step down this path." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:05">[01:07:05]</a>

This commitment is considered a core promise of Linear, ensuring the product remains fast and enjoyable for individual contributors (ICs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. They believe that if the IC user experience deteriorates, users will disengage, leading to inaccurate data and undermining the entire reporting system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:19">[01:18:19]</a>.

## Prioritizing the Individual Contributor (IC)

Linear firmly prioritizes the experience of the individual contributor over the needs of middle managers who often request customization for reporting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>. This means:
*   **Rejecting manual, data-entry burdens:** Features that require engineers or other ICs to spend excessive time manually filling in fields for reporting, even if it makes a manager's job easier, are declined. Such tasks often lead to inaccurate or sparse data because ICs will prioritize their core work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>.
*   **Focusing on workflow effectiveness:** The buying decision for B2B software often hinges on making teams more effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>. Linear aims to solve core problems that genuinely enhance productivity rather than simply adding checkboxes for management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>.

### Example: Customer Requests Feature
Linear received numerous requests for fully customized fields, often from middle managers wanting to track customer requests for reporting. Instead of adding generic custom fields that would burden ICs, Linear developed a "customer requests" feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:05">[02:23:05]</a>. This feature:
*   Adds a "customer" concept to Linear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>.
*   Integrates with customer support tools and CRMs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>.
*   Automatically tags escalated feature requests with the customer who asked for it, eliminating manual tagging by ICs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.
*   Allows for reporting without making ICs' lives harder, and even makes them more confident by understanding who is asking for features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.

### Example: Triage Management
Another feature, triage management, systematizes the process of routing issues to different teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>. This addresses feelings of being "underwater" from manual routing or feeling "out of control" when tickets are thrown "over the wall" without clear accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>. By automating this, it solves a widespread emotional pain point without adding complexity for the user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>.

## Deep User Discovery and Problem-Solving

To avoid feature bloat, Linear focuses on understanding the root cause of user problems, not just the requested solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>.
*   **Digging for emotional pain points:** When customers request features, Linear product managers "keep digging and digging until you get to something that is is an insight" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>. The goal is to "feel bad in the same way that customers feel bad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>, uncovering the underlying emotional valence motivating the request <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>. This helps identify the true problem to solve, often leading to non-obvious, elegant solutions rather than superficial additions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>.
*   **Focusing on specific, real-life use cases:** When debating new features, they connect them back to "real people" and specific workflows, rather than hypothetical scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>. This prevents building general features that don't address concentrated pools of specific user needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.

## Opinionated Software that Teaches How to Work

Linear believes that [[B2B growth dynamics and changes | B2B software]] not only solves problems but also teaches users "how to work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:29">[00:54:29]</a>. When a company adopts a tool, they are buying into a specific set of practices and a baseline level of competency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>.

Linear leverages this by:
*   **Avoiding excessive customization:** They resist adding features that would allow users to customize the tool away from what they believe are high-performing practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>.
*   **Automating best practices:** They identify practices common among high-performing teams, automate them, and integrate them into the tool. This allows companies who don't yet follow these practices to adopt them simply by using Linear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>.

This approach ensures that every new feature serves to reinforce an effective workflow, rather than simply adding options that could dilute the product's core value or make it harder to use.

## Strategic Product Development and Backlog Management

To prevent features from accumulating indiscriminately, Linear manages its product backlog with a clear focus on [[simplification_and_prioritization_in_product_management | strategic development]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:22">[04:21:22]</a>:
*   **Accumulating understanding, not just requests:** They have a backlog of 20-30 "product opportunities" or problems to solve, but they only tackle them when they have enough conviction about the best approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>. This involves continuously gathering information to inform a "mental model" of the user and their needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>.
*   **Capacity planning as an example:** They have a long-standing item for "capacity planning" in their backlog, a common pain point for managers. While aware of the problem and its current inadequate solutions (e.g., custom spreadsheets), they haven't "cracked it yet" to find an elegant solution that aligns with Linear's principles and solves a focused part of the problem well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>.
*   **Small team size as a constraint:** Linear intentionally keeps its team small, which acts as a natural constraint, preventing them from trying to act on every potential feature too early <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>. This forces rigorous prioritization and ensures they are "set up for success" when they do take on a new feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:00">[04:38:00]</a>.

By adhering to these principles, Linear aims to expand its capabilities strategically, ensuring that each new feature adds substantial value without contributing to the overall bloat of the software.

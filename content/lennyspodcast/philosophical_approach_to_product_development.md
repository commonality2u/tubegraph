From: [[lennyspodcast]] <br/> 

Ivan Zhao, co-founder and CEO of Notion, approaches product development with a deeply philosophical mindset, viewing tools as extensions of human potential and emphasizing the balance between personal values, aesthetics, and market needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:09">[01:13:09]</a>. This approach has shaped Notion's journey from its "Lost Years" to its current success.

## Early Vision and the "Lost Years"

Notion was founded in 2013 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:57">[01:09:57]</a>. The first three to four years are described by Zhao as the "Lost Years" because the initial versions did not resonate with users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:45">[01:04:45]</a>. The initial vision was to build a developer tool so easy that more people could create their own software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. However, after a couple of years, it became clear that most people did not care about creating software; they simply wanted to get their jobs done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

### Hiding Vision in User Needs

The realization was to "hide the vision" – that everybody can create their own software – within a form factor people already cared about: productivity software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. Zhao uses the metaphor: "People don't want to eat the broccoli, but people like sugar, so give them the sugar that hides your broccoli inside of it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. This shift took two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

Zhao admits the first version of Notion was more about what he wanted than what people wanted, reflecting a sense of maturation in understanding the world from perspectives beyond one's own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

During these challenging years, Notion also rebuilt its codebase multiple times, realizing they were on the wrong technical foundation with web components, which were unstable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>. They had to lay off their entire team, returning to just two people (Zhao and co-founder Simon Last) to rebuild <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>. They even moved to Japan and traveled the world to change their scenario, finding joy in non-stop coding and design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>.

## Balancing Vision and Business

Zhao emphasizes a balance between building for revenue and users (a "product business") and building for something one wants the world to have (reflecting personal values and aesthetics) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:45">[00:44:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:09">[00:49:09]</a>.

> "Too much of yourself then there's no user, you're just doing art project... and too much for a business, you're building a commodity." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:54">[00:21:54]</a>

Building for value is seen as a more lasting and fulfilling energy source, especially during difficult times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:59">[00:20:59]</a>. The ultimate goal is to create something authentic to oneself that also happens to be useful for others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>.

### Staying Lean and Resetting

Notion's lean and efficient operations were partly born out of necessity from its early struggles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:28">[00:32:28]</a>. They remained profitable for years and still retain most of the money they raised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:11">[00:30:11]</a>. They did not hire a salesperson until $10 million in ARR, and their first product manager was hired at 50 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:23">[00:30:23]</a>.

Zhao's advice for staying lean and sticking with an idea includes:
*   **Believing the product needs to exist** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>.
*   **Staying lean** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>.
*   **Disconnecting and resetting** (e.g., moving to Japan) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>.
*   **Getting sleep** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>.
*   **Don't be afraid to reset:** Progress can be achieved through better abstractions that compound faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>. This allows for quick recovery of "sunk costs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>.

## Tools and Human Potential

Zhao believes tools are extensions of us <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Once we shape them and bring them to the world, they can, in turn, shape us <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. He cites Douglas Engelbart's original paper, "Augmenting Human Intellect," as a major influence, highlighting the vision where computing could augment human problem-solving ability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

Zhao also points out that early computing pioneers like Engelbart and Alan Kay envisioned no separation between builders and users, where everything was malleable, unlike the application framework popularized by Steve Jobs and Bill Gates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.

## Craftsmanship and Values in Building

Notion's internal philosophy is "craft and values" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:41">[00:37:41]</a>. Craft is about applying skill and technical know-how with taste to make clever trade-offs and create something new and useful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:54">[00:37:54]</a>. Values represent one's personal worldview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:48">[00:37:48]</a>.

This philosophy extends to the physical workspace. Notion's office is designed to be cozy and feel like an artist's studio or home, using home furniture and avoiding harsh lighting to foster creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:01">[00:35:01]</a>. Conference rooms are named after "Timeless Tools" like the iPhone or original Macintosh, to inspire the team to create software products that last for decades, challenging the typical short cycles of tech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:12">[00:36:12]</a>.

### Decision Making and Trade-offs

The concept of trade-offs is crucial in [[decision_making_in_product_management | product management]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:12">[00:39:12]</a>. Zhao states, "there's no free lunch, you don't get something for free, you have to give up something" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:22">[00:39:22]</a>. The challenge is to give up the *right* thing that the market and users want at a given time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:34">[00:39:34]</a>.

New technologies, like AI language models, are seen as new materials, similar to how aluminum enabled mass air travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:55">[00:39:55]</a>. Product makers must balance technological trade-offs with human behavior trade-offs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:29">[00:40:29]</a>.

## Building Horizontal Products: The Lego Metaphor

Notion's core vision is to be a "Lego for software" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. This entails creating a meta-tool where people can build their own software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:02">[00:46:02]</a>. Building a horizontal platform like this is notoriously difficult and often takes a long time to find [[developing_and_deploying_a_product_strategy | product-market fit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:21">[00:51:21]</a>.

### Joy and Pain of Horizontal Products

While Zhao would not recommend building a horizontal product due to its complexity, he has no regrets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:57">[00:51:57]</a>. A key [[understanding_work_for_product_development | learning]] has been the importance of segmentation: while hardcore Notion users appreciate the "Lego bricks," most people prefer "Lego boxes," meaning ready-made solutions, especially for Enterprise customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:20">[00:52:20]</a>. This requires a shift in mindset from focusing on individual bricks to providing complete solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:02">[00:53:02]</a>.

> "If you're building vertical software naturally your vertical is the box... The advantage building horizontal there's no wall... you need to create a wall yourself so to make your go-to-market distribution to create the spot in people's mind your customer mind more clearly for them and for your go-to-market teams." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:29">[00:53:29]</a>

Notion's initial success came from stumbling upon document/notes as a primary use case, providing a large "top of funnel" with over a billion users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:49">[00:56:49]</a>. This "B2C2B" strategy allowed personal users to bring Notion into their workplaces, leading to growth in verticalized Enterprise use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:03">[00:57:03]</a>.

### Impact of AI

AI, particularly language models, has been a "gift" that fundamentally changes the material one can work with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:19">[00:58:19]</a>. AI is especially good with bundled offerings and horizontal tools because it can reason, understand, and search across all information in one place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:02">[00:59:02]</a>.

The most fascinating aspect of AI for Notion is its ability to piece things together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:54">[00:59:54]</a>. After years of building Lego blocks for knowledge work, AI coding agents can now be placed on top to create any kind of knowledge or customer software/agent for various vertical use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:08">[01:00:08]</a>. This was an unexpected development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:28">[01:00:28]</a>.

### Bundling and Unbundling

Zhao sees the market as moving in waves of bundling and unbundling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:46">[01:00:46]</a>. He references the Chinese novel *Romance of the Three Kingdoms*: "Empires long united must divide, long divided must unite" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:10">[01:01:10]</a>. This cycle applies to business as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:24">[01:01:24]</a>.

The first unbundling of software occurred with early PC applications in the 80s, followed by Microsoft bundling everything into one suite in the 90s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:57">[01:01:57]</a>. SaaS then unbundled it, leading to companies using almost 100 different tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:05">[01:02:05]</a>. Now, with AI and macro trends, the market is shifting back towards a bundling approach, where more value can be created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:18">[01:02:18]</a>.

## Conclusion

Ivan Zhao's [[understanding_company_cultures_impact_on_product_development | leadership]] and product philosophy emphasize:
*   **Craft:** Making things better with technical skill and taste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:41">[01:10:41]</a>.
*   **Uniqueness:** Building something unique for oneself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:45">[01:10:45]</a>.
*   **Usefulness:** Ensuring it is useful for others, as "success will follow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:47">[01:10:47]</a>.

He encourages looking beyond typical tech sources for inspiration, advocating for studying history and other industries to find clever patterns and shapes that can be applied to current [[challenges_and_pitfalls_in_product_management | product development challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:32">[01:06:32]</a>. His focus on complex systems and emergent properties (like life itself, or Lego creations) informs his approach to building tools that, with few primitives, can create something much larger than its parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:10">[01:08:10]</a>.

Notion's success, in part, stems from its alignment with Zhao's vision to amplify creativity and beauty in software, allowing non-programmers to build and sell "Notion apps and templates," creating new economic opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:41">[01:04:41]</a>.

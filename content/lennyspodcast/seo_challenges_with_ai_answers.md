The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has significantly reshaped the landscape of Search Engine Optimization (SEO), particularly with [[integration_of_ai_in_search_results | AI answers]] being integrated transparently into search results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. This shift, often referred to as AI Overviews or Search Generative Experience (SGE), forces companies to re-evaluate their [[SEO strategies in the age of AI | SEO strategies]] and how they drive business from search channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

## The Evolving Search Landscape
Google and other tech companies were prompted to accelerate their AI integration by the emergence of ChatGPT in late 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. ChatGPT's ability to provide written answers to any question led to concerns that users would no longer need to click through search results, potentially rendering Google and traditional SEO obsolete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. Google responded by launching SGE (now called AI Overviews) at Google I/O in May <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.

The primary impact of [[integration_of_ai_in_search_results | AI answers]] is that they push traditional search results further down the page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. Users receive answers directly from the AI, reducing the need to click on external links <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. Initially, some feared an "apocalypse" for SEO, but actual traffic impacts have only recently begun to manifest as AI Overviews are rolled out more broadly to non-logged-in users and in new regions like the UK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>.

### Impact on the User Journey
The [[impact of AI on SEO | main impact of AI on SEO]] lies in how it changes the user's discovery journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>.
*   **Top-of-Funnel (Discovery)**: AI Overviews are well-suited for general, informational queries where users seek quick answers or summaries. For example, asking about a vacation destination, a CRM definition, or basic medical information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>. Websites that traditionally ranked for these broad, top-of-funnel keywords (e.g., WebMD, G2, Capterra) may see their content summarized by AI, reducing clicks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:52">[00:20:52]</a>. This means content previously created solely for SEO purposes (e.g., long-form articles by freelancers) is becoming less relevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>.
*   **Mid-to-Bottom-of-Funnel (Intent/Action)**: The opportunity for SEO remains strong in the mid and bottom funnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>. These are queries where users have specific intent or are ready to take action. For instance, once a user learns about Cancun from an AI Overview, they might search for "hotels in Cancun with XYZ amenities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>. Similarly, after learning about different podcasting tools, a user might search for "Riverside price" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a>. This is where [[SEO as a growth strategy | SEO]] can still drive conversions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:06">[00:22:06]</a>.

## Adapting: Product-Led SEO
To succeed in this new paradigm, SEO must be treated as a product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:29">[00:23:29]</a>. This approach, advocated by growth advisor Eli Schwarz, emphasizes understanding the user's self-discovery journey and creating a product experience tailored to their needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>.

Key steps for [[SEO strategies in the age of AI | product-led SEO]]:
1.  **Be the User**: Understand who your user is and what problem they are trying to solve that would lead them to search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:58">[00:31:58]</a>. If you can't identify what someone would search for, SEO might not be the right channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:10">[00:33:10]</a>.
2.  **Decide on the Asset**: Determine what kind of product or content asset needs to be created for that user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:49">[00:34:49]</a>.
3.  **Build the Product**: Envision and build the product for the SEO user, requiring collaboration across design, engineering, product management, and user research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:49">[00:34:49]</a>.

Examples of successful product-led SEO:
*   **Zapier**: Instead of generic keywords, Zapier focused on specific integration queries like "Gmail to Salesforce." They built programmatic pages that showcased how their product solved the problem of connecting two specific apps, driving users to create new "zaps" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:54">[00:26:54]</a>.
*   **Tinder**: Recognizing that users often searched for solutions to loneliness in new cities (e.g., "online dating in Dubai"), Tinder created programmatic pages that offered local date ideas and positioned their app as a solution to this problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>. This mid-funnel solution remained relevant even with AI overviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:13">[00:31:13]</a>.

## Programmatic vs. Editorial SEO
The choice between programmatic and editorial SEO depends on the user's needs and the potential for scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:20">[01:10:20]</a>.
*   **Programmatic SEO**: Involves taking various data sources and algorithmically generating comprehensive pages tailored to specific queries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:25">[01:10:25]</a>.
    *   **Examples**: Trip Advisor (combining hotel data with user-generated content for individual property pages) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:51">[01:10:51]</a>, Zillow (aggregating government data, real estate comparisons, photos, and neighborhood information for individual property valuations) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:45">[01:11:45]</a>, Zapier (connecting different apps) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:54">[00:26:54]</a>.
    *   **Fit**: Best when there's a clear user use case at scale, providing a direct solution or piece of information (e.g., home value, hotel rating) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:10">[01:13:10]</a>. This approach often leads to the most common [[AI and programmatic SEO | SEO successes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:10">[01:14:10]</a>.
*   **Editorial SEO**: Involves manually creating long-form content, typically blog posts or articles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:42">[01:13:42]</a>.
    *   **Fit**: Less suitable for direct problem-solving if the answer can be summarized by AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:13">[01:13:13]</a>. Many companies generate thousands of blog posts that don't directly feed into a product journey, especially with AI, making them less effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:20">[00:25:20]</a>.

## Investment and Evaluation of SEO
SEO is not free; it requires significant investment in time, resources, and direct expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:30">[00:39:30]</a>.
*   **When to Invest**: Consider SEO if there's a clear user journey where people search for a solution that your product provides, and that search leads to a conversion that benefits the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:17">[00:40:17]</a>. For example, SurveyMonkey generated hundreds of millions from organic traffic because users could find a survey problem solution, use the free tool, and then pay for advanced features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:02">[00:40:02]</a>.
*   **When Not to Invest**: Many B2B SaaS companies, especially early-stage ones, may find SEO less effective. If the path to conversion involves a sales motion (e.g., talking to a salesperson, committee decisions, high price point, complex integration) rather than a direct online purchase, other marketing channels (e.g., brand building, paid ads, trade shows) might offer a better return on investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:55">[00:38:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:08">[00:43:08]</a>.
*   **Measuring Success**: The primary metric for SEO success should align with business objectives, not just rankings or traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:39">[00:48:39]</a>. This could be Marketing Qualified Leads (MQLs) for B2B, direct sales, or page views for media companies monetizing through ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:50">[00:49:50]</a>. Traffic alone is often a "total waste of time" if it doesn't convert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:48">[00:51:48]</a>.
*   **Time to Results**: SEO results can take months or even years, especially for smaller companies or entirely new solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:37">[00:47:37]</a>. For well-known brands, new SEO initiatives can show results much faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:21">[00:47:21]</a>. Setting clear product roadmap milestones (e.g., pages indexed, features shipped) helps track progress and decide whether to continue investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:30">[00:52:30]</a>. Quora, for instance, quadrupled traffic in three months by showing answers and improving site navigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>.

## [[Tools and techniques for effective SEO | Using AI in SEO]]
AI serves as a tool, not a complete solution, for content creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:49">[00:59:49]</a>.
*   **Effective Use**: AI can be useful for generating product descriptions for e-commerce sites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:59">[01:00:59]</a> or summarizing factual information in a useful way, much like how earnings reports were previously generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:34">[01:03:34]</a>. Google's documentation states that AI itself isn't the problem, but rather the *helpfulness* or *usefulness* of the content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:27">[01:02:27]</a>.
*   **Ineffective Use**: Using AI to generate "fluff" content or thousands of blog posts for the sake of content, especially if they don't serve a clear user journey, is a "waste of time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:23">[01:00:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:40">[01:01:40]</a>. Google is actively trying to "clean the index" to save costs and protect users from poor content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>.

## Google's Dominance and the Antitrust Trial
Insights from the Google antitrust verdict reveal Google's substantial market share, particularly 98% of mobile searches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:55">[01:17:55]</a>. The verdict highlighted that Google's default partnerships (e.g., with Apple) and its strong brand are major contributors to its success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:51">[01:18:51]</a>. Despite the emergence of new LLM (Large Language Model) startups like OpenAI, Perplexity, or Claude, it is unlikely they will unseat Google due to its established distribution and user habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:23">[01:19:23]</a>. Even competitors like Bing offered Apple free search, but Apple refused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:40">[01:19:40]</a>.

While AI Overviews are Google's response to Wall Street concerns and a way to retain small percentage points of search volume, Google likely doesn't fear losing its dominant position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:26">[01:20:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:30">[01:32:30]</a>.

Social media platforms like TikTok are increasingly used by Gen Z for top-of-funnel discovery (e.g., travel inspiration) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:56">[01:31:56]</a>. However, for mid-funnel actions like booking flights or hotels, users still turn to Google search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:13">[01:32:13]</a>.

## Common SEO Myths
Several misconceptions persist about SEO:
*   **Every company needs SEO**: This is a myth. SEO should be a thoughtful, strategic decision, like any other marketing channel, based on potential ROI and user journey alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:45">[01:26:45]</a>.
*   **Link building is about acquiring HTML links**: Modern link building is increasingly about brand building and gaining mentions, as Google's LLMs can now understand context beyond just a direct HTML link <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:08">[01:09:08]</a>. Paid guest posts on low-authority sites are generally ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:10">[01:08:10]</a>.
*   **Google's algorithm is a blackbox**: While nuances exist, the basics of SEO are simple: build an understandable website, link pages correctly, and create helpful content that users want to read <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:21">[01:28:21]</a>. Doing the best practices can get you most of the way to success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:08">[01:29:08]</a>.
*   **Technical SEO is a panacea**: Technical SEO is crucial for very large websites (tens of millions of pages) like Zillow or Airbnb for crawlability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:11">[01:35:11]</a>. However, for smaller websites (e.g., 100 pages), spending significant money on technical SEO (e.g., page speed optimizations) is often a waste of time unless competing in an extremely fast-paced niche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:28">[01:35:28]</a>.

## Forecasting SEO Upside
Traditional "bottoms-up" SEO forecasting, which relies on keyword research tools, can be highly inaccurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:55">[01:39:55]</a>. These tools use proprietary algorithms to estimate search volume, and their numbers can be off by many factors (10x over or underestimations) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:28">[01:42:28]</a>. Google itself does not provide real search volume numbers due to monopolistic reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:40">[01:41:40]</a>.

A more reliable approach is a "top-down" or Total Addressable Market (TAM) forecast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:03">[01:41:03]</a>. This involves estimating the total market size, segmenting it by relevant demographics or behaviors, and then applying a realistic market penetration rate for your product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:09">[01:39:09]</a>. This method, while still inexact, provides a more grounded estimate for SEO potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:06">[01:40:06]</a>. Keyword tools can still be used for normalization to understand how users search (e.g., "WordPress" with or without a space) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:51">[01:42:51]</a>.

## The Evolving Landscape of AI Technology
The need for SEO expertise is expected to "explode" as companies navigate the shifting search layouts and need to pivot their approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:35">[01:44:35]</a>. This creates a significant demand for growth advisors who can provide strategic guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:12">[01:45:12]</a>. For aspiring advisors, the focus should be on perfecting communication, sales, and client retention skills, rather than solely on operational excellence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:40">[01:45:40]</a>. Eli Schwarz advises moonlighting in a day job to practice these skills before transitioning to full-time advising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:59">[01:45:59]</a>.

Despite the changes, SEO is not dying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:06">[01:24:06]</a>. There will always be a need for users to request their own information and have choice in search results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:34">[01:24:34]</a>. Google believes LLMs are still in their very early days, and real user data from past searches remains crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:39">[01:24:39]</a>. For businesses, the aggregate number of people needing to take an action (e.g., buying shoes, booking a hotel) doesn't change, even if search volume shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:48">[01:25:48]</a>. The key is to ensure SEO efforts align with this actionable user intent.

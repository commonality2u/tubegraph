Experimentation is a critical tool for growth, allowing teams to test hypotheses and drive improvements. However, a common pitfall is focusing too narrowly on short-term metrics, which can lead to suboptimal outcomes for the business as a whole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Shopify's approach to growth and experimentation offers unique insights, particularly its emphasis on long-term holdouts and a 100-year vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:14">[01:01:14]</a>.

## The Pitfalls of Short-Term Metric Optimization

When teams are broken into different funnel stages, it's seductive to optimize for conversion rates within their specific part of the funnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This often leads to implicitly or explicitly making it harder to complete the step *before* their stage, artificially inflating their conversion rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:51">[00:27:51]</a>. For example, making it harder to sign up might increase the sign-up-to-activate rate, but it reduces the total number of activated users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>.

Instead, focusing on the **absolute number of people** who complete a stage, rather than just the conversion rate, encourages behaviors that bring more people into the funnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This approach ensures that teams are working towards overall business success, even if it might "hurt" a local conversion rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Shopify's Unique Growth Philosophy

Shopify operates with a distinct philosophy that sets it apart:

*   **100-Year Vision**: The company's priorities and product roadmap are guided by a long-term vision from CEO Toby, focusing on building a "100-year company" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:14">[01:01:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:20">[01:42:20]</a>. This allows for patience in evaluating impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:37">[01:13:37]</a>.
*   **Focus on Absolute GMV**: Rather than retention rates, Shopify's growth team optimizes for total Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV) produced by a cohort of merchants over multiple years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:54">[01:00:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:20">[01:10:20]</a>. This aligns with their mission to increase entrepreneurship on the internet by lowering barriers to entry, understanding that many businesses will fail, but the successful ones will generate significant revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:10">[01:07:10]</a>.
*   **Taste and Intuition for Core Product**: Unlike many companies, Shopify's core product teams deliberately do not have metrics or KPIs; decisions are made based on "taste and intuition" to build towards the long-term vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:20">[01:01:20]</a>. This "aim heavy" approach is enabled by a strong, opinionated founder (Toby) and key leaders (like Glenn, Head of Core Product) who enforce a consistent quality bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:01">[00:50:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>.

## The Power of Long-Term Experiments

Shopify's most impactful unique practice is keeping "long-term holdouts" for every experiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:37">[01:01:37]</a>.

> "We constantly will relook at an experiment a year later, see that the way the GMV curve for the distribution was different than we might have originally thought and that actually change what we do with from that previous experiment..." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:36">[01:12:36]</a>

### How Long-Term Holdouts Work at Shopify
They use two layers of holdouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:59">[02:10:59]</a>:
1.  **Across-the-board holdouts**: A percentage (e.g., 5%) of users are held out from seeing any changes across all experiments in a given quarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:59">[02:10:59]</a>.
2.  **Cohort-based holdouts**: For changes affecting *new* merchants, they might run a 50/50 split for a few weeks, then ship the winner to 100% of new users. However, they continue to monitor the original cohort that was assigned to the experiment (control vs. variant) for years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:09">[02:11:09]</a>.
    *   This allows them to ship quickly while still tracking long-term effects on the original cohort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:54">[02:13:54]</a>.
    *   Their internal experimentation tools automatically send updated results at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, and even up to 3 years later, to everyone involved in the experiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:54">[02:19:54]</a>.

### Key Learnings from Long-Term Experiments

> "I would encourage everyone if you can look at some of the experiments that you thought were your biggest winners look at the down tree metrics for a year two years on that experiment and I'll bet you'd be surprised how many times the metric is different than what you thought it would be after a year..." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:19">[01:19:19]</a>

Long-term holdouts reveal crucial insights:

*   **Short-term lift often disappears**: Approximately 30-40% of experiments that show a significant short-term lift (e.g., increased paying shops, first sales) show *no incremental long-term GMV lift* after a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:59">[01:14:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.
    *   This often means the experiment merely pulled forward success that would have happened anyway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:37">[01:37:37]</a>.
    *   Example: Sending notifications for failed payments initially showed a major lift in updating credit cards and revenue. However, a year later, there was no long-term GMV lift, as these users were often not dedicated entrepreneurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:14">[01:38:14]</a>.

*   **Neutral short-term results can become long-term wins**: Some experiments with no short-term lift can have a significant positive impact long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:07">[01:42:07]</a>.
    *   Example: Providing pre-filled sections in the online store editor initially showed no lift in converting to a paying merchant. However, six months later, it had a massive impact on the number of people selling and producing GMV. This is because it helped users create better, higher-converting stores, leading to early sales and sustained engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:04">[01:47:04]</a>.
    *   This insight allows Shopify to "ship neutral" experiments when there's good intuition that they will benefit merchants long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:41">[01:41:41]</a>.

*   **Uncovering valuable segments**: Experiments can reveal pockets of "extremely valuable entrepreneurs" who might have been missed by short-term metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>.
    *   Reducing "monetary friction" (e.g., trial length, incentives, price points) often leads to the belief that lower-quality users will join. However, it can causally enable entrepreneurs to succeed by giving them more time and opportunity to build their business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:26">[01:00:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:22">[01:16:22]</a>.

### Practical Advice for Experimentation

*   **Go as deep as possible in the funnel for as long as possible**: If long-term holdouts aren't feasible, aim to measure impact on downstream metrics for the longest possible duration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:19">[01:19:19]</a>.
*   **Ship experiments showing short-term lift**: Don't be afraid to ship if an experiment shows an early positive lift, but be "reasonable" about the ultimate impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:29">[01:29:29]</a>. Positive initial results are rarely harmful, but often neutral long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>.
*   **Embrace "Hybrid Journeys"**: Integrate different customer acquisition paths (e.g., self-service and sales-driven) to allow merchants to choose their preferred engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:04">[01:08:04]</a>. This requires significant investment in re-instrumenting LTV modeling and attribution to understand the true value of each touchpoint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:50">[01:09:50]</a>.
*   **Prioritize Incrementality Testing**: Beyond attribution, incrementality testing (e.g., A/B testing ad exposure) is the "gold standard" for understanding causal impact and making smarter investment decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:54">[01:05:54]</a>.

Ultimately, successful experimentation, especially for long-term growth, requires a clear understanding of the business's core mission, a willingness to challenge conventional metrics, and a commitment to gathering and learning from long-term data. This allows companies to avoid common pitfalls and focus on building sustainable value.

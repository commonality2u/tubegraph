NuBank, a significant player in the fintech space, offers a compelling case study for [[Strategy development and execution | strategy development and execution]] given its growth and unique approach to product building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. NuBank is larger than Coinbase, Robinhood, Affirm, Sofi, and Lemonade combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>, with 80-90% of its growth stemming from word-of-mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. The company aims to be "fundamentally different" rather than "incrementally better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Defining Strategy

Strategy is often misunderstood and can be confused with ambitious goals or aspirations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:07">[00:46:07]</a>. According to Richard Rumelt, author of "Good Strategy Bad Strategy" and "The Crux," strategy is:
> "a coherent plan for how you're going to apply your strengths in a leveraged way against a core important problem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:19">[00:46:19]</a>.

This definition highlights that strategy is:
*   **Specific and Detailed** It's not a broad, vague aspiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:39">[00:46:39]</a>.
*   **Action-Oriented** It informs the minimal set of activities needed for traction and success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:58">[00:47:58]</a>.
*   **Focused** It enables concentrated bets, which are essential for startups aiming to build something rather than preserve wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:50">[00:48:50]</a>.

### The Importance of Clarity
Even if a strategy isn't "right," clarity is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:24">[00:45:24]</a>. Kevin Systrom, in the early days of Instagram, famously said:
> "We may not be right, but at least we are clear" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:21">[00:45:21]</a>.

Clarity allows for a clearer understanding when things go off course <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:33">[00:45:33]</a>. Without clear strategy, execution can become diffuse and lead to wasted time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:50">[00:44:50]</a>.

## NuBank's Strategic Approach

NuBank's [[executing_strategy_effectively_in_product_management | strategic execution]] is rooted in several core principles:

### Obsession with Customer Love
NuBank's first and most prominent value is:
> "We want our customers to love us fanatically" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

This fanaticism about [[customer_engagement_and_product_development | customer love]] permeates the company culture, being known by 80-90% of employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. When faced with hard decisions, the bias is always in favor of the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

### Tapping into Deep Pain Points
NuBank started by addressing a profound pain point in Brazil's banking sector, where large incumbent banks were highly profitable but also "amongst the most hated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. Their initial strategy in 2014 was to target:
> "Millennial, middle-class, urban Brazilians who hated paying credit card fees and were not able to get credit in the first place because they were too young and without a credit history" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:57">[00:46:57]</a>.

The solution was a branchless, digital, no-fee credit card, which leveraged a specific advantage against an emotional pain point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:15">[00:47:15]</a>.

### Operationalizing Customer Fanaticism
NuBank integrates customer love into its product development processes:

*   **Amazon Mock Press Release Technique**: Before engineering work begins, teams must articulate in two paragraphs why the intended customer should care about the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>.
*   **Product and Design Reviews**: These regular reviews consistently ask, "Why is this great for the customer? Why is this fundamentally different?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.
*   **Sean Ellis Score**: NuBank fanatically follows the Sean Ellis score, which measures how disappointed customers would be if a product went away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>.
    *   The methodology considers a product to have achieved product-market fit if at least 40% of customers would be "very disappointed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>.
    *   Due to cultural politeness, NuBank raised its threshold to 50% for Brazilian customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>.
    *   This score serves as a gate: projects are rarely scaled until they hit this compelling threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>.
*   **Net Promoter Score (NPS)**: The company is "addicted" to its NPS score, aiming for world-beating results (often in the 70s-80s, and occasionally 90s in Mexico) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>.
*   **Direct Customer Feedback**: Product managers are encouraged to "pick up the phone" and call 10 customers directly to gather unfiltered feedback, rather than relying on summarized research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:28">[00:26:28]</a>.
*   **"Good Enough Isn't Good Enough"**: The team pushes for products to be "great enough" to redefine the category, not just incrementally better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>.

### Pushing Back Against Premature Scaling
A crucial aspect of [[executing_strategy_effectively_in_product_management | executing strategy effectively]] is the product manager's role in saying "no" to scaling a product before it's ready <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:30">[00:29:30]</a>.
> "We are not going to take a small problem and scale it, because if we do that, we end up with a big mess" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:43">[00:29:43]</a>.

This requires an "owner mindset" from PMs, where they are expected to communicate bad news early and bring clarity and data to their arguments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:30">[00:31:30]</a>.

## [[Developing and deploying a product strategy | Developing and deploying a product strategy]] through Category Design

NuBank believes in the power of [[elements_of_a_successful_strategy | category design]]:
> "Successful companies are typically in the fundamentally different business, they're in the new category business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:10">[00:54:10]</a>.

While existing categories can be reinvented, the company level absolutely needs to define its own category to dominate it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:52">[00:56:52]</a>. This means seeking a "disruptive vector" that allows a product to break through the noise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:45">[01:21:45]</a>.

### Product Line Expansion
NuBank has demonstrated success in [[developing_and_deploying_a_product_strategy | launching new business lines]]. From its start as a Brazilian credit card company, it evolved into a full-solution Latin American bank, launching five new products (bank account, lending, investments, insurance, small business products) and expanding to Mexico and Colombia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:20">[00:58:20]</a>. This expansion, while not following a "scientific master plan," relied on smart people, robust debate, and constant re-examination of performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:16">[01:01:16]</a>.

## The Future of Banking: An AI-Powered Personal Banker

NuBank envisions a future where banking is fundamentally different, leveraging social and AI technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:47">[00:59:47]</a>. Their long-term hypothesis is to build:
> "the world's first social and self-driving AI-powered bank" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:13">[01:13:13]</a>.

This vision includes:
*   **Holistic Banking**: Providing a full solution across all financial "seasons" of someone's life (spending, saving, investing, borrowing, protecting) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:30">[01:04:30]</a>.
*   **Global Bank on a Single Codebase**: Aiming to build the first global bank operating on a unified technology infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:15">[01:05:15]</a>.
*   **Social Mechanics for Financial Life**: Simplifying financial sharing with spouses, children, or parents, akin to sharing a Spotify playlist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:54">[00:40:54]</a>.
*   **Self-Driving Automation**: Automating tasks like bill payments and savings contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:49">[01:06:49]</a>.
*   **AI-Native Products**: Building products from the ground up with AI at their core, to provide personalized financial insights and solve "harshly unoptimized financial lives" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:50">[01:09:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:49">[01:07:49]</a>. The goal is to democratize access to a "personal banker" for all 8 billion people on the planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:06">[01:00:06]</a>.

NuBank believes that the company to reinvent banking can emerge from Latin America, not just traditional tech hubs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:09">[01:09:09]</a>.

## Lessons Learned

*   **Perseverance and Clarity**: Be clear about what you're trying to achieve and be willing to fight for it, while remaining open to feedback and knowing when to let go of parts that aren't working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:43">[01:20:43]</a>.
*   **Disruptive Vector**: As an insurgent, avoid fighting on the incumbents' ground. Find a "fundamentally different" approach to break through the noise, as "incrementally better" is often insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:34">[01:21:34]</a>.
*   **Ownership Mindset**: Employees, particularly product managers, should act as owners, pushing back when initiatives are not ready to scale or are strategically misaligned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:30">[00:31:30]</a>. This contributes to strong [[organizational_dynamics_in_strategy_execution | organizational dynamics]].

Providing constructive feedback is a crucial communication skill, especially in professional environments. It is often an "on-the-spot" interaction that requires preparation and clear structuring to be effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:01">[00:34:01]</a>.

## Defining Feedback

Feedback should be viewed as an opportunity to problem-solve, rather than simply bestowing an opinion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:47">[00:52:47]</a>. The goal is to collaborate with the other person to address a challenge or issue, inviting them to join in the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:05">[00:53:05]</a>. This approach aligns with the principles of [[candor_and_feedback_in_professional_growth | radical candor]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:25">[00:53:25]</a>.

## Structuring Feedback

A well-structured approach helps both the giver and receiver of feedback digest and understand the information more easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:44">[00:53:44]</a>.

### What-So What-Now What Structure

This three-part structure can be used for feedback sessions or updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:57">[00:39:57]</a>:

*   **What:** Describe the specific observation or behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:14">[00:54:14]</a>.
*   **So What:** Explain the importance and relevance of this observation, including its consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:16">[00:54:16]</a>.
*   **Now What:** Suggest actionable steps or what should be done next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:21">[00:54:21]</a>.

**Example:**
"I thought the meeting went really well, except when you talked about the implementation plan you spoke a little quicker than you did with the other parts and you didn't go into the same level of detail [What]. When you speak quickly without a lot of detail, people might think you're not as prepared or you're really concerned about this part [So What]. Next time I suggest you slow down and you include these two or three bits of data so that people see you really are knowledgeable on this area [Now What]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:07">[00:54:07]</a>.

### Four I's Structure

This more robust structure provides a clear framework for delivering feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:52">[00:54:52]</a>:

1.  **Information:** Set the context by stating the specific behavior or issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:04">[00:55:04]</a>.
2.  **Impact:** Share the effect this behavior had on you or others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:10">[00:55:10]</a>.
3.  **Invitation:** Invite the other person to collaborate on a solution or discuss the issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:12">[00:55:12]</a>.
4.  **Implications:** Discuss the potential consequences or benefits of addressing the behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:17">[00:55:17]</a>.

**Example:**
"This is the third time that you have showed up late to this meeting [Information]. I feel you're not prioritizing this meeting the same way others of us are [Impact]. What can we do to help make sure you show up prepared for the next meeting [Invitation]? Because if you do, we're going to finish the project on time and get a new cool project [Implications]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:24">[00:55:24]</a>.

## Improving Feedback Skills

To become better at giving feedback and other forms of communication, consistent practice is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:38">[00:41:38]</a>:

*   **Repetition:** Regularly apply these structures in different communication situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:42">[00:41:42]</a>.
*   **Reflection:** Think about what worked well and what could be improved after each interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:46">[00:41:46]</a>.
*   **Feedback:** Seek feedback from others on your communication, as we are often not the best judges of our own performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:50">[00:41:50]</a>.

Many resources can help, including [[challenging_leadership_styles_and_seeking_feedback | Toastmasters]], which provides structured practice opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:41">[00:42:41]</a>.

Shas Doshi, a seasoned product leader, shares three key questions he wished he had asked himself sooner in his career to navigate the inherent difficulties of the role. His reflections highlight common pitfalls and provide insights into addressing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>.

## Personal Reflections

Doshi reflects that his career as a product management leader was filled with "suffering" due to constant stress and dissatisfaction, even while doing a good job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>. He experienced physical pains and aches that he later realized were manifestations of this stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:00">[07:06:00]</a>. This struggle with busyness and its associated stress lasted for about 16 or 17 years of his 20-year product career before he found solutions in the last three or four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>.

## The Perennial Problem of Busyness

A major challenge for product leaders is being perpetually busy, feeling there's always work that cannot be done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:00">[06:08:00]</a>. While many are familiar with productivity tips like to-do lists, calendar management, and prioritization frameworks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:00">[08:04:00]</a>, these often fall short.

### The "Immovable Force" of Scope
As product professionals grow in their careers, their scope of responsibility increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:00]</a>. Eventually, this scope becomes so large that no matter how efficient one is or what prioritization tools are used, they will remain "incredibly busy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:58:00">[08:58:00]</a>.

### The Pitfalls of Annual Planning
Annual planning is a significant time sink for senior product managers and leaders, often consuming two to three months with spreadsheets, meetings, managing dependencies, and stakeholder engagements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31:00">[10:31:00]</a>. This process makes leaders feel busy and guilty, taking time away from supporting their teams or making product decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:55:00">[10:55:00]</a>.

A common observation is that after weeks of intense planning, the "actual plan" is often forgotten by late February, with teams executing from other lists due to emergent issues like customer escalations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:12:00">[13:12:00]</a>. The common adage, "Plans are useless but planning is everything," often cited in these situations, provides little clarity or practical value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:45:00">[13:45:00]</a>.

Doshi found that having a *real*, compelling, and cohesive product strategy, with pre-alignment from all stakeholders, drastically reduced the time spent on annual planning to just a few days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:52:00">[14:52:00]</a>. This strategic clarity helps eliminate much of the "nonsense" associated with traditional planning and allows for more rigorous handling of sales or support escalations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:47:00">[15:47:00]</a>.

> [!TIP] Tactical Tip for Busyness
> If you have a clear, well-aligned product strategy, many prioritization and planning problems will dissipate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:22:00">[17:22:00]</a>. This allows for better decision-making when unexpected issues arise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:34:00">[17:34:00]</a>.

### The Cost of Poor Product Decisions
Another core reason for busyness and frustration is making poor product decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:58:00">[17:58:00]</a>. Decisions are often made quickly, sometimes influenced by catchy metaphors like "two-way doors," without thoroughly considering customer motivation, differentiation, or distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:07:00">[19:07:00]</a>.

> Many product teams often make decisions based on engineer availability rather than thorough product thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:59:00">[19:59:00]</a>.

Such quick decisions, even for seemingly "two-way doors" (reversible decisions), can lead to accumulating "feature debt" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:24:00">[20:24:00]</a>. A feature committed to in a meeting might take weeks to build and launch, then show low adoption in a Quarterly Business Review (QBR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:33:00">[20:33:00]</a>. This often results in committing to *more* work to make the feature "full-featured" or meet "table stakes," leading to a cycle of more work for features that should not have been built in the first place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:32:00">[22:32:00]</a>.

> [!TIP] Tactical Tip for Better Decisions
> It is often beneficial to pause for minutes, days, or even weeks before making a product decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:52:00">[23:52:00]</a>. Most doors that appear "two-way" for a PM leader are, in fact, "one-way" and lead to accumulated work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:06:00">[24:06:00]</a>. "Thinking is cheap," so more thinking should be done, not less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:39:00">[25:39:00]</a>.

## The Frustration of Misalignment

Product management, especially at the leadership level, can be a lonely job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:51:00">[38:51:00]</a>. Frustration often stems from a misalignment between one's "superpowers" and how they spend most of their time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:19:00">[39:19:00]</a>.

### Loneliness of the PM Leader
The product leader's job is described as "further lonelier" than that of individual product managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:56:00">[38:56:00]</a>.

### Operating Outside Your Superpowers
Product work can operate at three levels: impact, execution, and optics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:58:00">[39:58:00]</a>. Doshi's epiphany was realizing he had a preferred level of operation (impact) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:10:00">[40:10:00]</a>. Spending most of his time in a "non-default" level, particularly the "Optics level," led to significant frustration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:16:00">[40:16:00]</a>. As one climbs the corporate ladder, spending more time on optics becomes inevitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:50:00">[40:50:00]</a>.

To combat this, Doshi realized the need to abandon the traditional career path dictated by societal or corporate expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:28:00">[41:28:00]</a>. For example, he chose to step back from managing a very large team (around 50 people) at Stripe to return to earlier-stage products that allowed him to operate more at his preferred impact level, avoiding the "corporate game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:51:00">[41:51:00]</a>.

> [!TIP] Overcoming Frustration
> Identify your "superpowers" and make career decisions that align with them, rather than being driven by external expectations or "LinkedIn envy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:37:00">[42:37:00]</a>. Operating in alignment with your true self will lead to the best, most enjoyable, and most effective work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:43:00">[42:43:00]</a>.

## The Importance of True Listening

A final, often overlooked, challenge for product leaders is the ability to truly listen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:42:00">[43:42:00]</a>. Beyond simply recapping and making eye contact, there is a deeper level of listening that is crucial for becoming a "world-class leader" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:56:00">[43:56:00]</a>. Resources from figures like Rick Rubin, Dee Hock, and Peter Drucker are suggested for those seeking to understand this deeper form of listening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:27:00">[44:27:00]</a>.

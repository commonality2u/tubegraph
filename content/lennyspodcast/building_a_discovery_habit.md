[[continuous_product_discovery | Continuous Discovery]] involves building continuous feedback loops with customers to inform product decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a>. It's about continuously making decisions on what to build and including the customer in that process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:35">[00:23:35]</a>.

## Discovery vs. Delivery

Product development always involves "bets" in the backlog, whether discovery is done or not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Discovery helps make better bets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. While some situations warrant risky bets, constantly making risky bets due to zero discovery can harm the appetite for discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. It's crucial to continue making bets in parallel with starting discovery so that those bets improve over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

A common mistake is thinking of discovery and delivery as phases (first discover, then deliver) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>. Instead, product teams should always be delivering and always discovering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:00">[00:53:00]</a>. Building a discovery habit improves the quality of these "bets" over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>. This approach is key for [[balancing_delivery_and_discovery_in_product_management | balancing delivery and discovery]] in product management.

## The Opportunity Solution Tree Framework

The Opportunity Solution Tree is a simple visual framework designed to add structure to the complex, unstructured problem of deciding what to build, starting from an outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. It's a decision tree that starts with an outcome at the root, branching into the opportunity space, then into solutions, and potentially assumption tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

Its purpose is to help product teams manage the complex problem of starting with an outcome and figuring out what to build, shifting from an output-focused to an outcome-focused approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.

The core challenge lies in distinguishing between the problem space (opportunities) and the solution space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. An opportunity is defined as an unmet need, pain point, or desire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. Many struggle to write opportunities without embedding solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. Good product development involves getting comfortable in the problem space and taking time to frame problems before jumping to solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.

As one moves vertically down the tree, opportunities become smaller and more solvable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. This allows teams to address smaller, specific needs while still contributing to a larger, overarching problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. This framework promotes customer-focused decisions, satisfying current needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.

## Effective Interviewing for Discovery

Opportunities emerge from customers' stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>. Interviewing is a grossly underestimated skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>.

Common mistakes:
*   Asking direct, context-less questions (e.g., "What do you like to watch on Netflix?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>. Such questions lead to unreliable answers that don't reflect actual behavior or nuance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>.
*   Staying shallow and not digging deeper into specific instances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:26">[00:39:26]</a>.
*   Focusing on what people *would* do or *think* they'd do, which is unreliable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:47">[00:40:47]</a>.

Best practices for [[developing_customer_discovery_methods_for_productmarket_fit | customer discovery]]:
*   **Elicit Stories:** Ask open-ended questions like "Tell me about the last time you..." to gather specific, grounded experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>. This approach can reveal unmet needs or pain points customers aren't even aware of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>.
*   **Maintain a Conversational Cadence:** Interviews should feel like a natural conversation, not a questionnaire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:51">[00:36:51]</a>.
*   **Be Curious and Listen Actively:** Continuously ask "What happened next?" or "Tell me about that" to follow the timeline and dig into areas of friction or interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:25">[00:38:25]</a>.
*   **Focus on Actual Behavior:** The true measure for product people, who are in the business of changing behavior, is what customers actually did, not what they might do or think <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:58">[00:40:58]</a>.
*   **Frame Opportunities Specifically:** Vague statements like "I wish this was easier to use" are less helpful than specific pain points, e.g., "It's hard to enter my password selecting specific letters on the screen with the Apple TV remote" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>. Specificity allows for solvable problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>.

## Addressing "No Time for Discovery"

When leaders claim there's no time for discovery, they often mean there's no time for traditional, project-based research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:17">[00:25:17]</a>. [[continuous_product_discovery | Continuous Discovery]] can be achieved with as little as one interview per week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:46">[00:24:46]</a>.

*   **Parallel Bets and Discovery:** Avoid halting all development until discovery is complete; instead, continue making "bets" while simultaneously conducting discovery to improve future bets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:16">[00:26:16]</a>.
*   **Individual Empowerment:** For individual contributors, focus on developing personal discovery habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>. This includes finding customers to talk to, even outside official channels, to gain a fuller context of business and customer needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>.

## Automating Customer Interviews

To make interviewing a sustainable, weekly habit, automate the recruitment process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:27">[00:27:27]</a>.

*   **In-Product Opt-in:** Allow customers to opt-in for an interview while using the product (e.g., similar to an NPS survey, ask "Do you have 20 minutes to talk to us?"). If they say yes, send scheduling software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:52">[00:27:52]</a>.
*   **Internal Team Recruitment:** For B2B or decision-makers, leverage internal teams (sales, account managers, support) who are already in contact with customers. Have them define a weekly trigger (e.g., "looking to talk to someone experiencing X pain point") and use scheduling software to book interviews directly on the product team's calendar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:31">[00:28:31]</a>.
*   **Tools:** Calendly, Ethnio, Qualaroo, Intercom, Usabilla, Chameleon, Hotjar, and even features within Outlook, Google, and Salesforce can facilitate scheduling and in-app intercepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:16">[00:29:16]</a>.

## Evaluating Solutions with Assumption Testing

Assumption testing is any activity that helps evaluate a solution by starting with a specific assumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:43">[00:44:43]</a>. It's essentially the start of delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a>. This falls under [[challenges_and_strategies_in_building_an_experimentation_platform | building an experimentation platform]].

*   **Assess Risk:** Not all solutions require extensive discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:13">[00:30:13]</a>. Prioritize robust discovery for core product experiences or differentiators where risk is higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:26">[00:30:26]</a>. Instrumenting the product to measure impact helps hone judgment on where risk exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:07">[00:31:07]</a>.
*   **Compare Multiple Solutions:** To guard against bias towards an "obvious" solution, work with multiple solutions for the same opportunity, comparing and contrasting them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:41">[00:31:41]</a>.
*   **Break Down Ideas:** Learn to take an idea and break it into its underlying assumptions. Prioritize these assumptions and run small, rapid tests that evaluate only that specific assumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:10">[00:45:10]</a>. This enables running dozens of assumption tests weekly across multiple ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:49">[00:45:49]</a>.

Some express cynicism about making decisions based on talking to only a few people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:29">[00:42:29]</a>. However, one interview is better than zero, especially when considering that many business decisions are made without any customer data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:51">[00:42:51]</a>. Product teams can make decisions on small data because they have robust feedback loops and can get larger-scale data through live production prototyping and continuous delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:32">[00:43:32]</a>.

## Product Team Collaboration (The Trio)

Effective product work is fostered by collaborative teams rather than rigid functional silos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:01">[00:33:01]</a>. The "Trio" — comprising the product manager, designer, and software engineer — should ideally be the decision-makers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:33">[00:34:33]</a>.

In a well-functioning trio, disagreements are less frequent because the team works from a shared understanding derived from joint discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:55">[00:34:55]</a>. When disagreements arise, it signals that a better option has not yet been found, prompting further exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:07">[00:35:07]</a>. This collaborative approach leads to better products compared to cultures focused on individual power or political negotiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:57">[00:33:57]</a>.

## Scaling Discovery

Ideally, the fundamental process of discovery does not change as a company grows from early-stage to later-stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:11">[00:41:11]</a>. A successful team, whether three people or 100,000, should be empowered to reach an outcome by interviewing weekly, assumption testing, and finding solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:15">[00:41:15]</a>.

The primary difference in larger companies is the presence of many adjacent teams and dependencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:40]</a>. This necessitates:
*   Relying on design patterns and libraries for a coherent user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:57">[00:41:57]</a>.
*   Engaging in lateral collaboration to share discovery work and be aware of other teams' efforts to build a coherent product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:04">[00:42:04]</a>.

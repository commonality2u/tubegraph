Amy Vora, Chief Product Officer at Fair, shares insights on [[leadership_and_communication_in_tech | leadership]], product management, and personal growth in the tech industry, emphasizing the importance of authenticity and continuous learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:39">[01:34:39]</a>. Prior to Fair, Amy was an early employee at Facebook, where she launched the first Facebook developer platform, led product for the global Facebook ads business, oversaw the introduction of ads on Instagram, and most recently led product and design for WhatsApp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:15">[01:13:15]</a>.

## Authenticity and Imperfection in Leadership

Vora's goal is to demonstrate that individuals can be "messy and imperfect" and still achieve significant success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:10">[02:17:10]</a>. She contrasts this with the "superwomen" image of successful women in tech who appear to have everything figured out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:39">[02:37:39]</a>. Vora shares her own experience of working from her bathroom during the pandemic, highlighting that success doesn't require perfection or having everything planned out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>. She emphasizes that most people are "winging it" and learning through trial and error <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>.

Her career success has often come from following instinct rather than a rigid plan: choosing roles that "feel right," working with people who feel like friends, and being in environments where she feels creative and lucky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>. This emotional approach, or "putting on the coat of the job," is more telling than a spreadsheet analysis of career trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:00">[09:05:00]</a>. A feeling of "being at home" and trust with colleagues allows her to take more risks and perform better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:35:00">[09:35:00]</a>.

## Navigating Disagreement and Feedback

### Sublimating Ego and Cultivating Curiosity

Boz, the CTO of Meta, noted Vora's remarkable ability to respond to profound disagreements with genuine curiosity, saying "fascinating, you have to tell me more why you think that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. Vora admits this did not come naturally, as she previously enjoyed "being right" and saw it as part of her identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>.

She learned that trying to be right often prevented her from reaching the best outcome, as it ignored valuable information others possessed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>. The shift occurred when she prioritized getting to the best outcome over being right, and recognized the selfish benefit of learning from others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>. Opening the door to different perspectives makes work more interesting and fosters continuous learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>.

### Interpreting Visceral Reactions

Vora advises reinterpreting visceral reactions to disagreement not as a signal to shut down, but as an opportunity to learn more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>. Taking a pause before responding allows the body to calm down and the mind to think, leading to a better, less primal reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>.

She finds it "fascinating" how different people can observe the same facts and arrive at completely different narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. Exploring these differences helps understand how people see the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.

## Effective Product Leadership and Communication

### Understanding the "Dinosaur Brain"

When conducting [[product_management_and_leadership_insights | product reviews]], Vora uses the "dinosaur brain" metaphor, suggesting that executives can only hold about three facts at once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>. Her advice to product teams is to make a clear recommendation, rather than presenting all available information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>. This acknowledges that executives have broader responsibilities (pattern matching, context, industry insights) but cannot go as deep as the presenting team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>.

### Product Reviews: Recommendations Over Decisions

Product reviews should be used to calibrate on principles, not just to get individual decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>. The goal is to establish principles for future decision-making, thereby increasing the organization's capacity for good decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.

Key advice for product reviews:
*   **Keep it simple and short:** Present the minimal amount of information needed for a clear recommendation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>.
*   **Be opinionated:** Force deep understanding and conviction by making a direct recommendation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.
*   **Focus on principles:** Discuss "why" decisions were made (trade-offs, optimization, risk tolerance) to enable future autonomous decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.
*   **Invite fewer people:** Keep discussions informal and faster, prioritizing speed over formality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.
*   **Ensure cross-functional accountability:** Include leadership and presenting teams from different functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>.
*   **Build implicit trust:** Allow teams to present to senior leaders without their direct managers present, fostering independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>.
*   **Record or broadcast:** Share principle discussions to wider audiences to ensure calibration across the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.

### The Power of Metaphors and Imagery

Vora excels at using metaphors and imagery to rally teams and convey ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>. This skill was honed by a former manager, Eric Antonow, who would ask about the desired feeling users should experience with a product, and what real-life analogies captured that feeling (e.g., "sitting in Dolores Park with my friends on a sunny Saturday") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>.

Key benefits of metaphors and imagery:
*   **Narrative carries weight:** As teams scale, a shared story or metaphor can align decisions without explicit instruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>.
*   **Consistent product feeling:** If everyone agrees on the desired feeling, designers know what iconography to create, and communicators know the tone, leading to a consistent product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>.
*   **Example: WhatsApp:** The core product metaphor for WhatsApp was "face-to-face communication" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>. The goal was to make users feel connected, like in a natural conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. Small details like typing indicators or two checkmarks contribute to this feeling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>.
*   **Example: Family Room for Video Calls:** For WhatsApp's video calling, the metaphor of "sitting around in your family room" meant calls should feel lightweight, joinable, and allow people to pop in and out without heavy actions, mimicking real-life family interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>.

A tactical piece of advice for creating metaphors: think about what you want your users to feel when using the product, and then identify other situations where they've felt that same way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>.

### "The Hill Climb" Metaphor

The "hill climb" metaphor illustrates the difference between a local optimum and a global optimum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. It describes the choice to leave a comfortable, optimized "hill" to descend into a "valley" and climb a much larger "mountain" in the distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>. This represents taking risks for greater long-term gain, even if it means a period of difficulty and uncertainty without immediate guarantees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. The key is remembering the feeling of the "summit" to get through the "slog" of the valley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>. This metaphor helps set expectations that significant change can be challenging but ultimately worthwhile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>.

## Strategy vs. Execution

### Execution Eats Strategy for Breakfast

Vora firmly believes that execution beats strategy every time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>. While strategy is "glamorous" and philosophical, customers only care about the product in their hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>.

*   **Perfect strategy, poor execution = no win, no learning:** If a great strategy isn't executed, it never reaches the market, and you don't know if the strategy or execution was at fault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.
*   **Good enough strategy, perfect execution = learning and iteration:** With strong execution, even a "pretty good" strategy allows for market learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>. You can then update the strategy and iterate until it's perfect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>.

Execution, though less glamorous, involves the "nuts and bolts" work like looking at dashboards, rewriting specs, and "bringing the donuts," which directly leads to customer outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>.

For product managers, Vora suggests a time proportion: 20% on strategy and the bulk on execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>. A year-long strategy built in isolation risks irrelevance as the market, customer needs, and competition evolve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>. Even at senior levels, most time should be spent ensuring strategies reach the market, unblocking teams, and continuously improving the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>.

### Developing Strategic Acumen

Vora struggled with strategy feedback, feeling like an impostor and lacking the confidence to declare a strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>. She learned to build confidence by:
*   **Talking to customers:** Gaining unique knowledge of customer needs and building an "emulator" for them (e.g., "what would this customer say about this product?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>.
*   **Working through product iterations:** Visualizing what a strategic outcome would look like from a product perspective in 3-5 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>.
*   **Soliciting diverse opinions:** Running surveys to gauge leadership alignment on future trends (e.g., revenue sources), then discussing disagreements to understand strategic ramifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>.

The ability to commit to an opinion about future trends, combined with the confidence that the "execution machine" can adapt and iterate, is key to strategic thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>.

## [[empowering_women_in_tech_leadership | Being a Woman in Tech Leadership]]

### Interpreting Feedback

Vora notes that women in tech often receive different styles of feedback, frequently focusing on personal style rather than the content of their role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>. This feedback can be contradictory, demanding both more and less directiveness, or faster and slower movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>.

Early in her career, Vora received feedback that, despite her intelligence, people didn't "like" her, leading her to shrink herself and be "less aggressive" and "more unobjectionable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>. This even included wearing "earth tones" to "fade back" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>. While this initially "worked" in making people more likely to work with her, it eventually hindered her ability to be a visible leader with opinions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>.

She now emphasizes that receiving feedback doesn't mean immediate action on all of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:00">[05:29:00]</a>. It's crucial to interpret themes, choose actions, or even decide to maintain one's operating style while providing more context for decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>. Her current philosophy is to "not dampen who you are and your strengths," but rather to continually "expand" by adding new tools and ways to express oneself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>.

### Mentorship and Sponsorship

Vora critiques the common advice given to women to "find a mentor" or "sponsor," viewing it as "another set of hoops" that adds an unnecessary burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:4:00">[05:04:00]</a>. She acknowledges receiving extreme generosity from many leaders but did not have a single "mentor" in the traditional sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:00">[05:49:00]</a>. Instead, she advocates for expanding one's "tool sets" and "keys to unlock new different kinds of doors," which makes one "bigger and more powerful and more expansive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>.

## Setting Goals and Aligning Incentives

### Avoiding "Toddler Soccer"

Vora advises against giving broad goals like "get revenue" or "get GMV" to all teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>. This can lead to "toddler soccer," where everyone converges on the same measurable area, resulting in inefficiency and tripping over each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>.

Instead, she recommends detangling customer journeys and assigning each internal team a different goal that ladders into an overarching framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:00">[05:24:00]</a>. This allows teams to make progress in their own "lanes," understand how they fit into the bigger picture, and collectively solve the full customer impact end-to-end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>. For example, instead of all teams focusing on GMV, they could focus on GMV per surface, or on underlying input metrics like conversions or reorders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>. These input metrics must be genuinely connected to the output metric and customer success, not just for "making a team feel good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>.

### Acknowledging Healthy Tension

It's important to acknowledge that different teams, and even individuals within cross-functional teams, will have different incentives and information, leading to disagreements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>. This is a sign of "healthy tension" and knowledge, not necessarily something "going wrong" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>.

For tension to be healthy, one must:
*   **Acknowledge it openly:** Recognize that disagreement stems from different information, not poor intent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:34:00">[06:34:00]</a>.
*   **Agree on the outcome:** Ensure everyone is aligned on the company and customer goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>. If not, there are structural issues to address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>.
*   **Discuss openly:** Frame disagreements as conversations about the best way to achieve the agreed-upon outcome using diverse information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00">[06:11:00]</a>.

### Ramping Up in a New Role

Joining a new company, especially in a senior role, can feel "terrible" because expectations of one's own impact are high, but the necessary context and network take time to build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>. Vora reminds herself to learn enough to make changes in 60-120 days, rather than trying to immediately change everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>. Her move to Fair was a significant learning curve with a new business model, people, and customer problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>. It also affirmed her abilities beyond her previous environment, addressing a "deep-seated insecurity" about only being good at Meta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03:00">[08:03:00]</a>.

### Working with Visionary Founders

Vora emphasizes the critical importance of a strong, trusting relationship with the CEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:00">[09:12:00]</a>. At Fair, her CEO, Max, was "growth mindset" and open to discussions about fundamental changes, even if they were "hot takes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:00">[09:34:00]</a>. This openness was a "gift" that allowed her to build a complimentary relationship and make an impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:00">[10:00:00]</a>.

For Founders hiring a CPO:
*   **Mind-meld:** Spend a day together to understand how they think and operate, ensuring high fidelity and trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:34:00">[11:34:00]</a>.
*   **Assess seniority needs:** Ensure the level of seniority hired matches the actual need; sometimes, a founder's vision means they need someone to build the product, not necessarily scale the team or build systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:51:00">[11:51:00]</a>.

### The Nature of Senior Decisions

As leaders become more senior, they increasingly face problems that are "fundamentally unsolvable" because easier problems would have been solved earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>. Senior leaders are often choosing among "suboptimal" options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>. The role becomes about choosing the "least bad" option, describing the principles and context for that choice, and acknowledging its suboptimal nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>.

Vora notes that people often mistakenly believe senior leaders "say a thing and then it happens," and that they make "bad decisions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>. Normalizing these "hard truths" helps leaders avoid feeling like failures, acknowledging that it's part of the job's impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>.

## Focusing on the Customer

Vora's overarching advice for product professionals, especially as organizations scale, is to **think about the customer** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>. Talking to customers and being their advocate is a shortcut to success, even amidst distractions like team alignment or roadmapping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>.

She stresses that customer value and company value are rarely adversarial in the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>. While short-term divergences may occur, a business must exist to create customer value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>. Metrics should ultimately reflect long-term customer impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.

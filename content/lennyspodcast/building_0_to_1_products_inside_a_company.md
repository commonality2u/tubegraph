Companies must remain entrepreneurial to stay competitive, constantly thinking about what's next, defining industry standards, and anticipating competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:39">[01:16:39]</a>. This approach helps companies avoid being overtaken by the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:51">[01:16:51]</a>.

## Figma's Approach to Innovation

Figma fosters a "run with it" culture, one of its core values, which encourages employees to "sprint off in a direction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:04">[01:17:04]</a>. This is viewed not as a distraction but as a manifestation of the company's values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:17">[01:17:17]</a>. Some of Figma's most significant product launches originated from hackathons and bottom-up initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:28">[01:17:28]</a>. Examples include:
*   Multi-edit, a long-requested feature that was a multi-year, multi-product initiative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:35">[01:17:35]</a>.
*   Jambot, an AI plugin within FigJam, which stemmed from an AI hackathon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:50">[01:17:50]</a>.
*   The entire widgets platform, which began as a hackathon project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:56">[01:17:56]</a>.

This culture celebrates bottom-up ideas, facilitating an environment where employees are constantly encouraged to be entrepreneurial, both in launching new products and improving internal processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:01">[01:18:01]</a>.

## Mahika Kapor: The Go-To for 0 to 1

Mahika Kapor is known at Figma as the "go-to person" for leading new 0 to 1 products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:55">[00:55:55]</a>. She was an early product manager on FigJam and is currently spearheading the development of a new product slated for a June launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:48">[00:48:48]</a>. Her passion for building new things stems from a personal inclination towards entrepreneurial companies and cultures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:57">[01:16:57]</a>.

## Key Elements for Launching New Products

Bringing a new idea into existence within a company requires three core elements:

### 1. Having the Right Idea
The current product Mahika is working on originated from a series of conversations where she was pitching FigJam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>. Key aspects of generating the right idea include:
*   **User Empathy:** Continuously engage in conversations with users to understand their pain points, general perceptions of the company, and their full end-to-end tool usage. It's crucial to understand why non-users aren't using the product, as these can be the most insightful conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:20">[02:11:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:38">[02:11:38]</a>.
*   **Alignment with Company Goals:** Ensure the new idea aligns with and contributes to broader company objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:50">[02:11:50]</a>.

### 2. Securing Buy-in
Successful 0 to 1 efforts require "optimism that borders on delusion," creating an almost "reality distortion field" where "no" is heard as "not yet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:14">[02:23:14]</a>.
*   **Persistence:** Initial pitches may not be successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:40">[02:23:40]</a>. Mahika's current product idea was initially pitched in ad hoc conversations and at a PM offsite with limited momentum before finally gaining traction at a Maker Week hackathon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:51">[02:23:51]</a>.
*   **Compelling Vision and Pitch:** Translate user insights into a compelling vision. At Figma, this often involves "designing and prototyping even before a project gets a green light" to create an emotional pull <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:02">[01:18:02]</a>. Pitches combine pain points, solutions, and proof points (like user testimonials or data) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:51">[01:11:51]</a>.
*   **Leverage Internal Events:** Utilize company-wide forums like hackathons (e.g., Maker Week), sales kickoffs (SKO), or annual showcases (e.g., Config) to present ideas and build excitement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:07">[02:24:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:04">[01:57:04]</a>.
*   **Scrappiness and Believability:** Be willing to make trade-offs in quality or believability to quickly demonstrate the core idea. For instance, a small code change to swap an icon in the file browser can make a new product feel more real during a demo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:30">[02:25:30]</a>.

### 3. Making it Spread
Once an idea has initial buy-in, the goal is to make it "spread like wildfire" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:54">[02:19:54]</a>.
*   **The "Keeper of the Hearth" Metaphor:** The person or team pushing a 0 to 1 idea acts as the "Hesta" (or keeper of the Hearth in Greek mythology), whose job is to continuously stoke the flames of the idea, even when others are disengaged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:11">[02:19:11]</a>.
*   **Early Staging and Dogfooding:** Figma employs a multi-month staging or dogfooding process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:10">[02:27:10]</a>. This early exposure helps the team receive critical feedback and makes people across the company feel invested in the product, fostering collective ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:12">[02:28:12]</a>.
*   **External Hype:** Beyond internal enthusiasm, generating external hype is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:05">[02:39:05]</a>. This involves getting users excited about the product, understanding the product's unique "brand of delight," and celebrating milestones (e.g., FigJam's "birthday party" launch) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:42">[02:41:42]</a>.

## Fostering an Entrepreneurial Culture

*   **Empower Individuals:** Encourage employees to identify problems and propose solutions, even if it means "founding something inside of an existing company" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:20">[02:55:20]</a>. This can leverage distribution or technical advantages of the existing company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:46">[02:55:46]</a>.
*   **"Feedback as a Gift":** Establish a culture of constant, direct, two-way feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:39">[02:30:39]</a>. By taking feedback first, then offering it, and acting on it quickly, others are incentivized to do the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:05">[02:31:05]</a>.
*   **Understand Motivations:** Recognize that different team members (engineers, designers, researchers, data scientists) have varied desires for involvement in the product visioning phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:50">[03:09:50]</a>. Cater to individual motivations to build a high-functioning team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>. Asking directly how much they want to be involved in product decisions is a useful approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>.
*   **Cultivate Passion:** [[Building a successful product management team | Passion]] for work stems from believing in the product's vision and feeling a strong connection to the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:23">[03:05:23]</a>. Investing in culture builds trust and makes the team more durable during tough times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:20">[03:06:20]</a>.
*   **Embrace Change:** Displaying grace and enthusiasm when priorities shift or projects are re-evaluated helps leverage change as a superpower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:15">[03:15:15]</a>. This ties into the "strong opinions, weakly held" mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:07">[02:27:07]</a>.
*   **Hire for Well-Rounded Teams:** While individuals can be "spiky" in their strengths, a team should be well-rounded, covering each other's blind spots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:51">[03:15:51]</a>.
*   **Share Insights Widely:** If an individual has a unique insight, it's crucial to share it broadly within the company. This not only spreads the idea but also inspires others to contribute to an entrepreneurial culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:22">[03:29:22]</a>.

37signals, co-founded by Jason Fried, operates as a fundamentally different kind of company compared to typical venture-backed startups, prioritizing efficiency, profitability, and small team structures over rapid, often unprofitable, growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:03">[01:01:03]</a>. With over 100,000 customers and tens of millions in annual profit, 37signals achieves this with approximately 75 employees, a stark contrast to competitors like Asana (1600 employees), ClickUp (1000), Slack (2500), Smartsheet (3000), and Monday (1500), which often do not make a profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:09">[01:09:09]</a>.

## The Philosophy of Small Teams

Jason Fried advocates for staying small, viewing it not just as a stepping stone but as a "great destination itself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:57">[01:38:57]</a>. The core reason for this approach is to foster efficiency and avoid the "sloppiness" that can come with abundant capital and the pressure for constant growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:55">[01:16:55]</a>.

Key tenets of 37signals' small team philosophy:
*   **Focus on Efficiency, Not Growth** Companies often believe that more people mean more can be done, leading to sprawling offerings and large sales and support infrastructures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>. 37signals, however, has no salespeople and typically offers one product with one or two price points, avoiding the complexity of servicing many different company types and expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:50">[01:48:50]</a>.
*   **Embracing Constraints** [[Balancing Micromanagement and Team Autonomy | Constraints]], such as small teams and limited cash, often lead to better outcomes by forcing simplicity and clarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:04">[01:45:04]</a>. The company intentionally avoids spending money on things they don't need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:40">[01:42:40]</a>.
*   **Underdoing the Competition** Instead of trying to "outdo the competition," which is expensive and defensive, 37signals aims to "underdo" it by focusing on simplicity and clarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:12">[01:14:12]</a>.
*   **Working for Themselves** As an independent business with no investors, no board, and no plans to go public or sell, 37signals maintains control and can shape the company as they wish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:27">[01:39:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:08">[01:46:08]</a>. This allows them to avoid external pressures to chase growth or specific exit strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:15">[01:19:15]</a>.

### Why Bootstrapping Fosters Small Team Success
Bootstrapping, or self-funding, is seen as crucial because it forces entrepreneurs to practice the "fundamental skill" of making money from the start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Unlike venture-backed companies that might practice spending money, bootstrapped businesses learn to be profitable and efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:56">[01:18:56]</a>. This discipline, born from necessity, builds a robust foundation.

## [[Building Effective Product Teams | Product Development]] with Small Teams

37signals employs a unique development methodology called "Shape Up," detailed in a free online book at basecamp.com/shapeup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:39">[01:38:39]</a>.

Key aspects of their [[Building Effective Product Teams | product development]] approach:
*   **Six-Week Cycles** All projects are constrained to a maximum "appetite" of six weeks, rather than an "estimate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:56">[01:39:56]</a>. This forces teams to find the simplest, most effective version of a feature to complete within the budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:33">[01:34:33]</a>.
*   **Two-Person Teams** Every feature is developed by a team of two: one programmer and one designer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:01">[01:12:01]</a>. This avoids large projects with many meetings, slow decision-making, and indecision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:19">[01:17:19]</a>.
*   **"Appetites" vs. Estimates** Instead of estimating how long something *will* take, they define how long they *are willing* to spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:01">[01:34:01]</a>. Work expands to fill the time available, so setting a fixed appetite prevents indefinite projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:56">[01:34:56]</a>.
*   **Shaping the Work** Work is "shaped" ahead of time, providing a clear idea but not a detailed spec. The two-person team then has the latitude to figure out *how* to get it done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:20">[01:35:20]</a>.
*   **Trading Concessions** During development, teams might realize a feature cannot be done as initially thought within the timeframe. They engage in discussions to mold and change the scope, making "concessions" to stay within the appetite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:55">[01:35:55]</a>.
*   **Killing Projects** If a project isn't progressing ("still on the left side of the hill" on a Hill Chart) by the time limit, it almost certainly dies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:02">[01:37:02]</a>. This prevents demoralizing, never-ending projects and ensures focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:11">[01:37:11]</a>.
*   **Cool-Down Periods** After each six-week "cycle" (not "sprint"), there's a two-week cool-down period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:49">[01:42:49]</a>. During this time, teams can internal freelance, tighten up recently shipped features, fix bugs, or work on pet projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:14">[01:43:14]</a>. This allows for replenishment and prevents burnout from continuous high-intensity work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:45">[01:43:45]</a>.

## [[Prioritization and decisionmaking in startups | Decision-Making]] by Gut and Instinct

37signals, led by Jason Fried, makes decisions primarily based on intuition, gut feelings, and opinion, rather than solely on data or metrics like OKRs, KPIs, or revenue targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:56">[01:43:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:47">[01:48:47]</a>.

*   **Trusting Judgment and Experience** When hiring executives, companies seek judgment and experience, not just data analysis skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>. Fried believes that every human decision is a judgment call, influenced by countless known and unknown factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:51">[01:44:51]</a>.
*   **"How Does This Feel?"** A common question within 37signals is "How does this feel?" – applied to screens, flows, features, words, and even website aesthetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:02">[01:48:02]</a>. This acknowledges that humans are primarily "feeling creatures" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:30">[01:48:30]</a>.
*   **Asking "What Do You Think?"** Instead of "What do you know?" or demanding justification with numbers, they ask "What do you think?" to encourage sharing personal, unquantifiable insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:35">[01:47:35]</a>.

## [[Lessons in hiring and team building | Hiring for Instinct]]

To maintain this approach, [[Lessons in hiring and team building | hiring]] is highly selective. For designers, Jason Fried looks for:
*   **Taste and Admiration** Candidates are asked whose work they admire and why, to understand their lens on the world and influences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:10">[01:51:10]</a>.
*   **Project-Based Assessment** Finalists complete a paid project (a week's work). During the critique, Fried pushes back and asks, "If you had another couple days, what would you do with this?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:42">[01:51:42]</a>. This reveals raw gut reactions and the ability to riff on ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:06">[01:52:06]</a>.
*   **Synchronicity and Play** The goal is to find individuals whose "gut is filled with ideas" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:41">[01:52:41]</a> and who can engage in a "playful" riffing process, indicating a shared "wavelength" and creative resonance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:50">[01:54:50]</a>.
*   **Execution with Ideas** While ideas are valued, candidates must also demonstrate strong execution skills and time management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:01">[01:54:01]</a>. A clever, well-executed design with potential for further development is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:31">[01:54:31]</a>.

## Implementing Small Team Practices

For other companies interested in adopting these practices, particularly Shape Up:
*   **Start Small and Low Criticality** Don't attempt a "180-degree change" quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:41">[01:56:41]</a>. Instead, apply the new method to a "low criticality project" where failure won't be disastrous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:26">[01:56:26]</a>. This allows teams to learn and improve without the pressure of high stakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:50">[01:57:50]</a>.
*   **Gradual Adoption** Companies can adopt parts of the methodology, such as the six-week cycle or the idea of appetites versus estimates, without going "wholesale" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:46">[00:59:46]</a>.
*   **Fight Complexity** Businesses tend to get complicated quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:06">[01:14:06]</a>. Staying connected to the core work and avoiding unnecessary layers of abstraction helps maintain efficiency and directness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:03">[01:43:03]</a>. Jason Fried likens his business to a "stick shift" car – very direct and tight, unlike "automatic transmission" large businesses where everything is simulated and disconnected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:05">[01:43:05]</a>.

## No Long-Term Planning

[[Effective time management and scheduling for better productivity | Long-term business planning]] is considered a "fantasy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:02">[01:03:02]</a>. 37signals re-evaluates its direction every six weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:28">[01:03:28]</a>. This approach allows them to "do what I think, not what I thought" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:07">[01:03:07]</a>, adapting to current feelings and intuition rather than being bound by past obligations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:45">[01:04:45]</a>. This flexibility is a direct benefit of their independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:13">[01:05:13]</a>.

## Work Isn't War

Jason Fried actively rejects the "war metaphors" commonly used in business language (e.g., "conquer the market," "target customers," "destroy the competition") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:36">[01:09:36]</a>. He finds this language depressing and prefers words that are "additive and alternative," focusing on creation, pride, and excitement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:02">[01:11:02]</a>. The goal is to "make something great," not to beat or destroy others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:05">[01:11:05]</a>.

### Key Takeaways

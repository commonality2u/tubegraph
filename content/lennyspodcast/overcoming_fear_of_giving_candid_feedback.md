From: [[lennyspodcast]] <br/> 

Giving candid [[importance_of_giving_and_receiving_feedback | feedback]] can be challenging, especially for individuals who tend to be "people pleasers" or are concerned about hurting others' feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:51">[02:25:51]</a>. This discomfort often leads to what Kim Scott, author of *Radical Candor*, calls "ruinous empathy," a common mistake where a person shows they care but fails to challenge directly, ultimately hindering growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:16">[06:16:16]</a>. However, overcoming this [[handling_limiting_beliefs_and_fears | fear]] is crucial for effective [[developing_leadership_skills_and_understanding_feedback | leadership]] and fostering productive relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:49:09">[08:49:09]</a>.

## The Problem: Ruinous Empathy and its Consequences

Most people try to be nice, remembering to show they care personally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:20">[06:20:20]</a>. Yet, this often leads to failing to tell someone something they'd be better off knowing in the long run, known as "ruinous empathy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:30">[06:30:30]</a>. This creates a "false harmony" that is detrimental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:01">[02:10:01]</a>.

### Why We Hold Back
*   **Desire to be liked**: Many, including self-identified "recovering people pleasers," find it difficult to give hard [[importance_of_giving_and_receiving_feedback | feedback]] because they want people to like them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:51">[02:50:51]</a>.
*   **Fear of emotional response**: Leaders might worry about someone getting upset, crying, or reacting defensively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>. This often stems from a "negativity bias" where the fear of the other person's upset is greater than the likelihood of it actually happening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:34">[03:32:34]</a>.
*   **Manipulative Insincerity**: Sometimes, the reluctance to give candid [[importance_of_giving_and_receiving_feedback | feedback]] comes from self-preservation, like worrying about one's reputation as a leader if an employee reacts negatively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:38">[02:37:38]</a>.

### The Cost of Silence
Failing to give necessary [[importance_of_giving_and_receiving_feedback | feedback]] can lead to severe consequences:
*   **Loss of top performers**: If poor performance is tolerated due to a lack of candid [[importance_of_giving_and_receiving_feedback | feedback]], high-performing team members will become frustrated and may leave, as their work is affected by others' shortcomings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>.
*   **Inefficiency and poor results**: The team's overall deliverables can be delayed, and the company's results can suffer due to unaddressed issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:30">[02:43:30]</a>.
*   **Unfair to the individual**: Not telling someone their work isn't good enough is deeply unfair to them, preventing them from improving or finding a role where they can excel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.

> "By not telling Bob, thinking I was being so nice, I'm having to fire him as a result. Not so nice after all." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:29">[02:29:29]</a>

## Embracing Radical Candor

[[radical_candor_framework_and_its_application | Radical Candor]] is achieved when one remembers to care personally and challenge directly simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:06">[04:06:06]</a>. This leads to better relationships, better work, and increased success and happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:58:00">[08:58:00]</a>.

### Mindset Shift for Leaders
*   **Focus on caring, not liking**: The job of a leader is not to be liked, but to care about other people. Shift focus from self-preservation to being "others-focused" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:22">[02:28:22]</a>.
*   **Kindness in the long run**: Realize that it's *unkind* in the long run not to tell someone they are making a mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>.
*   **Enlightened self-interest**: For leaders who are primarily focused on results, explain the negative impact of poor [[importance_of_giving_and_receiving_feedback | feedback]] on productivity and team retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:50">[09:50:50]</a>. Obnoxious aggression, for example, is inefficient because it puts people into "fight or flight" mode, making them unable to hear the [[importance_of_giving_and_receiving_feedback | feedback]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>.
*   **Unleashing inherent capacity to care**: Many leaders who appear not to care simply don't know they are "supposed to care" or how to show it. Encouraging this innate capacity can make them more effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:58:00">[09:58:00]</a>.
*   **Growth Mindset**: Leaders should adopt a growth mindset regarding [[importance_of_giving_and_receiving_feedback | feedback]], acknowledging that everyone makes mistakes and can improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:37:00">[10:37:00]</a>.

## Tactical Approaches to Giving Candid Feedback

Kim Scott offers the "HIP CORE" framework and other [[techniques_for_effective_feedback_and_communication | techniques for effective feedback and communication]].

### The "HIP" Principles:
*   **Humble**: Go into the conversation acknowledging you might be wrong. [[techniques_for_effective_feedback_and_communication | Candor]] is a dialogue, not a monologue, implying "here's how I understand the situation, I'm also curious to know how you understand it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:59:00">[15:59:00]</a>. Omniscience is not a requirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:08:00">[16:08:00]</a>.
*   **Helpful**: State your intention to be helpful; you are telling them this to support their growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:16:00">[16:16:00]</a>.
*   **Immediately**: Give [[importance_of_giving_and_receiving_feedback | feedback]] right away, unless you or the other person are too upset to hear it effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:37:00">[16:37:00]</a>. Waiting often means never saying it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:50:00">[16:50:00]</a>.
*   **In-person/Synchronously**: Have these conversations live, ideally in person or via phone, as non-verbal cues can be misinterpreted on video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:17:00">[17:17:17]</a>. Avoid email or text for [[importance_of_giving_and_receiving_feedback | feedback]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:19:00">[18:19:00]</a>.
*   **Private (for criticism) / Public (for praise)**: Criticize in private, praise in public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:04:00">[19:04:00]</a>.
*   **Personality (avoid)**: Do not give [[importance_of_giving_and_receiving_feedback | feedback]] about someone's personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:09:00">[19:09:00]</a>.

### The "CORE" Framework (Context, Observation, Result, Next Step):
When giving [[importance_of_giving_and_receiving_feedback | feedback]], structure it clearly:
*   **Context**: Where and when the behavior occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:31:00">[19:31:00]</a>.
*   **Observation**: The specific action or behavior observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:38:00">[19:38:00]</a>.
*   **Result**: The impact of that behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:41:00">[19:41:00]</a>.
*   **Next Step**: What action should be taken or changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:44:00">[19:44:00]</a>.

> **Example (Criticism)**: "In the meeting [context], when you said 'um' every third word [observation], it made you sound stupid [result]. Go to the speech coach [Next Step]." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:34:00">[19:34:00]</a>
>
> **Example (Praise)**: "In the meeting [context], when you offered both sides of the argument [observation], it earned you credibility [result]. Do more of that [Next Step]." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:50:00">[19:50:00]</a>

### Additional Tactics for Giving Feedback:
*   **Gauge how it's landing**: Pay attention to emotional signals. If the person looks sad or mad, move up on the "care personally" dimension (e.g., "Maybe I didn't say that in the best possible way. How could I have said it differently?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:05">[55:05]</a>. Avoid "pulling back the words" or going the "wrong way on challenge directly," which leads to ruinous empathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:15">[56:15]</a>.
*   **Get curious, not furious**: If someone is mad, try to understand why rather than reacting defensively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:02">[57:02]</a>.
*   **Be specific and thorough**: If there are many mistakes, point out every single one to avoid the person only noticing a few <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:26">[31:26]</a>.
*   **Be prepared to "keep going"**: If someone is brushing you off, be ready to be more direct until the [[importance_of_giving_and_receiving_feedback | feedback]] penetrates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:08">[32:08]</a>.

## How to Solicit Feedback (The First Step)

Starting with soliciting [[importance_of_giving_and_receiving_feedback | feedback]] is the most important step to improve relationships and make it easier to give and receive it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:17">[37:17]</a>.

### Key Steps to Solicit Feedback:
1.  **Ask an authentic question**: Avoid generic questions like "Do you have any [[importance_of_giving_and_receiving_feedback | feedback]] for me?" as people will often say "no, everything's fine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Craft a question that sounds authentic to you, such as:
    *   "What could I do or stop doing that would make it easier to work with me?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>
    *   "Tell me why I'm wrong." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:46">[38:46]</a>
    *   "What's one thing I could be doing better?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:01">[41:01]</a>
    *   "What's one way I could help you be more successful?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:05">[41:05]</a>
    *   "What could I have done this week to better support you in your work?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:27">[41:27]</a>
2.  **Ask consistently**: As a manager, solicit [[importance_of_giving_and_receiving_feedback | feedback]] weekly from each direct report (e.g., five minutes at the end of a one-on-one) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:31">[39:31]</a>. Also ask cross-functional peers and your boss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:13">[40:13]</a>.
3.  **Don't accept "no feedback"**: If someone is reluctant, tell them you're not perfect and need their observations to improve. Emphasize that telling you when you're wrong is the most helpful thing they can do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:52">[41:52]</a>.
4.  **Embrace the discomfort**: There's no "emotional Novocain" for giving or receiving [[importance_of_giving_and_receiving_feedback | feedback]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:34">[43:34]</a>. The only way out is through. A simple tactic is to "close your mouth and count to six" to encourage the other person to speak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:53">[43:53]</a>.
5.  **Listen to understand, not to respond**: You will likely feel defensive, which is normal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:29">[44:29]</a>. Ask follow-up questions to truly understand their perspective before reacting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:22">[45:22]</a>.
6.  **Reward the [[radical_candor_framework_and_its_application | candor]] richly**: This is the most crucial step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:41">[45:41]</a>.
    *   **If you agree**: Fix the problem and make your listening tangible. Be loud about the change you made based on their [[importance_of_giving_and_receiving_feedback | feedback]] (e.g., "So-and-so told me the tea was terrible, and now we have 35 kinds of tea!") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:00">[46:00]</a>. Even "overcorrect" initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:47">[46:47]</a>.
    *   **If you disagree**: Find 5-10% of their [[importance_of_giving_and_receiving_feedback | feedback]] you can agree with and acknowledge it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:12">[47:12]</a>. Then, state you need to think about the rest and follow up later with a respectful explanation for your disagreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:21">[47:21]</a>. Unspoken disagreement poses a greater risk to relationships than expressed, respectful disagreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:39">[47:39]</a>.

## Addressing Cultural Challenges and Time Constraints

Company culture can often lean towards ruinous empathy, making it difficult to practice [[radical_candor_framework_and_its_application | Radical Candor]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:00">[36:00]</a>. However, starting with soliciting [[importance_of_giving_and_receiving_feedback | feedback]] is the key to changing the dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:20">[37:20]</a>.

### Cultural Shift
*   **Show impact**: For leaders who struggle with low self-awareness or believe obnoxious aggression is the only way, explain the detrimental impact of their behavior on results and retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:00">[58:00]</a>.
*   **Share personal stories**: Leaders can share their own mistakes and instances where they acted like a "jerk" to encourage others to reflect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:13:00">[10:13:00]</a>. This "holding up the mirror" can foster self-awareness and a [[developing_leadership_skills_and_understanding_feedback | growth mindset]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:30:00">[10:30:00]</a>.

### Managing Time
*   **Integrate into existing routines**: Soliciting [[importance_of_giving_and_receiving_feedback | feedback]] can be part of regular one-on-ones, not an added meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:16">[51:16]</a>.
*   **Prioritize impromptu conversations**: Giving [[importance_of_giving_and_receiving_feedback | feedback]] should ideally happen immediately in "two-minute impromptu conversations" (e.g., walking to a meeting) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:00">[52:00]</a>.
*   **Schedule slack time**: Block out time in your calendar or shorten meetings (e.g., 25-minute instead of 30-minute meetings) to create space for these conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:42">[52:42]</a>.
*   **Be willing to be late**: If necessary, prioritize these "moments of management" over being perfectly on time for the next meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:07">[53:07]</a>.

[[SEO as a growth strategy|SEO]] is considered one of the most powerful yet least understood growth levers for companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:54">[01:00:54]</a>. However, many companies often under-resource their [[SEO as a growth strategy|SEO]] efforts while over-resourcing paid advertisements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This article, drawing insights from Ethan Smith, CEO of Graphite, aims to demystify [[SEO as a growth strategy|SEO]] and provide actionable advice on strategies, tools, and team structures for success.

## Key SEO Concepts and Misconceptions

A common misconception in [[SEO as a growth strategy|SEO]] is the over-reliance on technical audits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. While technical aspects are important, a technical audit primarily identifies bugs rather than driving growth directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. True growth comes from strategic implementation, particularly through content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.

### [[Programmatic vs Editorial SEO|Types of SEO]]

There are three main types of [[SEO as a growth strategy|SEO]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:10">[01:54:10]</a>:

1.  **[[AI and programmatic SEO|Programmatic SEO]]**: Involves automatically generated pages from a database of information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>. Examples include product pages on eBay or address pages on Zillow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a>. These are typically category pages (grids/lists of items) or item pages (single items) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>. The advantage is that you don't spend money on each page created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:03">[02:01:03]</a>. User-generated content (UGC) sites like Glassdoor also utilize [[AI and programmatic SEO|programmatic SEO]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>.
2.  **[[SEO and content marketing|Editorial SEO]]**: Refers to content manually written by a person, such as articles, guides, or listicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>. This type of [[SEO as a growth strategy|SEO]] is increasingly driving more traffic than [[AI and programmatic SEO|programmatic SEO]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>. While [[SEO and content marketing|editorial SEO]] pages have a cost per page, it's an opportunity for every company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:16">[02:01:16]</a>. Examples include MasterClass, BetterUp, NerdWallet, HubSpot, and Dotdash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>.
3.  **Technical SEO**: Focuses on the infrastructure of the website, including internal link architecture, tags, redirects, and page speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>.

### Topics vs. Keywords

Historically, [[SEO as a growth strategy|SEO]] was keyword-based, with one page for every keyword <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:58">[00:31:58]</a>. However, Google's algorithm has evolved to have a semantic understanding, targeting topics rather than individual keywords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:42">[00:32:42]</a>. A single page can now rank for hundreds to thousands of different keywords related to a topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:52">[00:32:52]</a>. Thinking in topics helps prioritize content creation, understand the true search volume, and ensure comprehensiveness of content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:01">[00:33:01]</a>.

### [[Understanding topical authority in SEO|Topical Authority]]

Google determines a site's authority not just on overall domain strength but on specific topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:01">[01:09:01]</a>. Authority signals include:
*   Links from other sites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:41">[01:09:41]</a>
*   Non-[[SEO as a growth strategy|SEO]] traffic from other channels (e.g., direct, paid, social) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:59">[01:09:59]</a>
*   Social shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:12">[01:10:12]</a>
*   Branded search queries (people typing your brand name into Google) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:14">[01:10:14]</a>

Google looks for sites that are disproportionately known for certain themes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:48">[01:10:48]</a>. This allows newer companies to outrank larger competitors by focusing on specific areas where they can build strong topical authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.

## When to Invest in SEO

[[SEO as a growth strategy|SEO]] is a valuable investment when:

*   **The Addressable Market is Large**: Most markets are sufficiently large for [[SEO as a growth strategy|SEO]] to be effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:49">[01:11:49]</a>. Assess this by looking at the total traffic of product and audience competitors using tools like Similarweb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:56">[01:12:56]</a>.
*   **You Have Existing Authority/Traction**: If a company is starting from zero with no existing traction, it's often too soon for [[SEO as a growth strategy|SEO]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:40">[01:10:40]</a>. Google prefers to rank credible domains, not just [[SEO as a growth strategy|SEO]] farms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:52">[01:10:52]</a>. Indicators of sufficient authority include at least 1,000 non-[[SEO as a growth strategy|SEO]] visits per day and roughly 1,000 referring domains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:19">[01:11:19]</a>.
*   **[[SEO as a growth strategy|SEO]] Compares Favorably to Other Channels**: Evaluate [[SEO as a growth strategy|SEO]]'s potential impact and cost against other growth channels like paid advertising or social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:54">[02:22:54]</a>.

## How to Do SEO Well: Workflow and Techniques

A high-impact [[SEO as a growth strategy|SEO]] strategy follows a structured workflow:
1.  **Define the Addressable Market**: Identify the topics and keywords you want to target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:49">[00:23:49]</a>.
2.  **Determine Page Type**: Based on target keywords, analyze Google search results to see what kind of pages are ranking (e.g., articles, product pages, address pages) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>.
3.  **Define Product Requirements**: Based on the chosen page type, determine what content components are essential for usefulness and engagement (e.g., maps, phone numbers, recipes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:16">[00:24:16]</a>. Google prioritizes pages that are useful to users and fulfill their intent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:56">[00:27:56]</a>. High engagement (click-through rates, time on page) leads to higher rankings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:15">[00:28:15]</a>.
4.  **Content Strategy**: Outline the subtopics and themes needed for comprehensive coverage within each page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a>.
5.  **Infrastructure**: Ensure Google can easily find all your pages through proper internal linking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:30">[00:24:30]</a>.

### Generating Pages

*   **[[AI and programmatic SEO|Programmatic SEO]]**: For item or product pages, index all high-quality pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:57">[00:29:57]</a>. For category pages, group keywords at the topic level to avoid creating low-utility pages for every minor variation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:57">[00:30:57]</a>.
*   **[[SEO and content marketing|Editorial SEO]]**: Build out article/listicle page types and have writers create content through a CMS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:32">[00:31:32]</a>.

## Essential Tools for SEO

Effective [[SEO as a growth strategy|SEO]] relies on a combination of free and paid tools:

*   **Google Search Console**: Free and essential for real traffic information and serp tracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:58">[00:37:58]</a>.
*   **Clearscope**: Best for content analysis and scoring, helping identify content gaps and ensure comprehensiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:16">[00:38:16]</a>.
*   **Keyword Research Tools (Ahrefs, Semrush)**: Used to find keywords, analyze competitor performance, and understand search volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:41">[00:38:41]</a>.
*   **Screaming Frog**: A niche but useful tool for crawling sites, auditing for errors (e.g., redirect loops), and analyzing internal link coverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:24">[00:39:24]</a>.

## Timelines and Leading Indicators

[[SEO as a growth strategy|SEO]] is a long-term investment. Expect to see results within six to nine months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:32">[00:40:32]</a>. The timeline depends on existing authority; a new company might take a year, while a large established brand could see changes in days or weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:41">[00:40:41]</a>.

Early leading indicators to look for include:
*   Ranking at least number 20 for target keywords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:41">[00:42:41]</a>.
*   Seeing progress in rankings (e.g., moving from position 15 to 8) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:52">[00:42:52]</a>.
*   Increased impressions for keywords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:58">[00:42:58]</a>.

These early signals indicate that the strategy is effective and worth scaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:21">[00:43:21]</a>. It's crucial to avoid prematurely concluding failure, as initial attempts may just be incorrectly implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:42">[00:43:42]</a>.

## Team and [[Hiring strategies for SEO roles|Hiring]] for SEO

The ideal team structure depends on the [[SEO strategies in the age of AI|SEO strategy]] and company stage.

*   **[[AI and programmatic SEO|Programmatic SEO]]**: Requires specialized skills and is harder to find talent for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:50">[00:45:50]</a>. Look for growth professionals with technical ability who have a proven track record of driving significant [[SEO as a growth strategy|SEO]] growth at lesser-known companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:43">[00:47:43]</a>. Their day-to-day involves analyzing competitors, defining product requirements for automated pages, clustering keywords, and working with engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:17">[00:49:17]</a>.
*   **[[SEO and content marketing|Editorial SEO]]**: A larger pool of talent exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:59">[00:45:59]</a>. A dedicated [[SEO as a growth strategy|SEO]] manager (who might not have deep prior [[SEO as a growth strategy|SEO]] experience but has content or editorial strategy skills) along with a domain expert writer is a minimum effective team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:10">[00:59:10]</a>. The [[SEO as a growth strategy|SEO]] manager focuses on topic selection, outlining subtopics, and analyzing performance, while the writer creates the content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:50">[00:55:50]</a>.

It's critical to adequately resource [[SEO as a growth strategy|SEO]] efforts, as many companies under-invest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:01">[00:47:01]</a>. [[SEO as a growth strategy|SEO]] often gets blocked due to being separate from the product organization, its perceived mystery, and the sheer volume of work involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>.

## Internal Linking Strategy

Internal linking is a powerful yet often under-appreciated lever for [[SEO as a growth strategy|SEO]] growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:52">[01:06:52]</a>. Pages with more internal links tend to get more traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:41">[01:17:41]</a>. This is because Google crawls sites through links, and more paths help Google find pages and assign credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:30">[01:18:30]</a>.

*   Aim for at least 5-10 internal links per page for Google to find and crawl it regularly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:47">[01:18:47]</a>.
*   Avoid placing all links in the footer or navigation; body links carry more weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:47">[01:22:47]</a>.
*   Many sites suffer from a "power curve" of links, where a small percentage of pages receive the majority of internal links <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:17">[01:20:17]</a>.
*   Implement algorithms or manual processes to ensure a wide distribution of internal links, creating a "flat graph" structure rather than a deep hierarchy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:30">[01:21:30]</a>. Fixing this can lead to significant traffic increases (25%+ or even 100%+) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:07">[01:22:07]</a>.

## [[Impact of AI on SEO|AI]] in SEO

While there's a proliferation of startups using [[AI and programmatic SEO|AI]] (like GPT-3) to generate pages, caution is advised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:33">[01:24:33]</a>.
*   **Concerns**: [[AI and programmatic SEO|AI]]-generated content can be grammatically correct but factually inaccurate, leading to low-quality or even harmful information if not rooted in underlying wisdom or structured data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:35">[01:25:35]</a>. This presents [[SEO challenges with AI answers|challenges]] for trustworthiness.
*   **Effective Use of [[Impact of AI on SEO|AI]]**: [[Impact of AI on SEO|AI]] is highly useful for automating data analysis tasks in the content workflow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:33">[01:27:33]</a>. This includes:
    *   Deciding which topics to write about by clustering keywords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:52">[01:27:52]</a>.
    *   Determining topical authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:01">[01:28:01]</a>.
    *   Identifying subtopic themes and creating outlines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:04">[01:28:04]</a>.

The ideal approach is to leverage [[Impact of AI on SEO|AI]] for analytical tasks to create a strong content structure and then have human domain experts write the actual content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:08">[01:28:08]</a>.

## General Advice

*   **Data-Driven Hypotheses**: Base your [[SEO strategies in the age of AI|SEO strategy]] on data analysis of your own site and competitors, rather than just believing Google's statements or external advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:33">[01:03:33]</a>.
*   **Network**: Contact other [[SEO as a growth strategy|SEO]] professionals at successful companies to learn from their tested strategies and insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:50">[01:04:50]</a>.
*   **Focus on Execution**: The ability to get things launched and implemented is often more critical for [[SEO as a growth strategy|SEO]] success than the strategy itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:36">[01:07:36]</a>.

## First Steps for Exploring SEO Opportunity

1.  **Assess Addressable Market Size**: Use tools like Similarweb to determine if the market is large enough by analyzing competitor traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:46">[01:28:46]</a>.
2.  **Assess Existing Authority**: Determine if your company has enough traction by looking at non-[[SEO as a growth strategy|SEO]] traffic and referring domains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:57">[01:28:57]</a>.
3.  **Compare Channels**: Evaluate [[SEO as a growth strategy|SEO]] against other growth channels based on cost, opportunity, and expected returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:09">[01:29:09]</a>.

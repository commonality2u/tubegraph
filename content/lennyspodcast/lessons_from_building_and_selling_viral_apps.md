Nikita Beer, a serial entrepreneur and investor, has built, launched, and helped more apps reach the top of the App Store than almost anyone [02:07:09]. His career includes selling his first major hit, TBH, to [[Growth strategies and frameworks used at Facebook | Facebook]] for over $30 million, and his second, Gas, to Discord for "many millions more" [02:11:03]. Beer achieved these successes with small teams and minimal funding [02:18:03]. He also advises dozens of founders and companies on [[viral_growth_strategies_for_consumer_apps | viral growth strategies]], design feedback, and product development [02:31:03].

Beer emphasizes that while luck plays a role, much of his success stems from "very tactical work" [02:27:03].

## Early Ventures and the Pivot to Consumer Apps

Beer's first product was "Potify," a web app built in college that helped users understand the financial impact of political policies on their lives [06:17:03]. It went "super viral," gaining about four million users during an election season [07:40:03]. This project evolved into a company called "Outline," securing government contracts, including one with the Obama Administration [08:00:03].

However, a government shutdown led to a contract cancellation, prompting Beer to realize he disliked selling software to governments [08:42:03]. He pivoted, informing investors he would return their money to build consumer apps, but none took it back [09:17:03]. This transition highlighted his core competency: "making things that go viral on the internet" [09:01:03].

### Midnight Labs and the Learning Curve
Over the next four to five years, Beer's team, operating as Midnight Labs, built a variety of consumer apps, including mapping, chat, and event meetup apps [09:30:03]. This period involved numerous failures, with about 14 of 15 apps being "Duds" [15:08:03]. This process helped them develop a "muscle to understand what people want and how to actually make things grow and how to test them" [10:37:03].

### The Focus on Teens
A key insight gained was the importance of targeting teens for consumer social apps [10:47:03]:
*   **Malleable Habits**: Older individuals tend to have fixed habits with communication products [10:55:03].
*   **Invitation Rate**: The number of people a user invites to an app declines "almost exponentially" for every additional year of age from 13 to 18 [11:18:03]. Beer states that for every social app he's built, "the number of invitations sent per user drops 20% for every additional year of age from 13 to 18" [12:00:03].
*   **Daily Interaction**: Teens "see each other every day," which is critical for network effects [11:28:03].
*   **Cost of Acquisition**: Building for adults often requires significant venture capital to finance user acquisition through ads [12:27:03].
*   **Urgency to Connect**: Teens are in the "upward curve of adding connections to your social graph," meaning the urgency to connect is higher [18:05:03].

> "If your users aren't inviting people to your app, you're going to have to find another way to acquire them and that most likely means ads" [12:17:03].

## TBH: A Case Study in Viral Growth

TBH, a positive anonymous polling app, was launched when the company was running low on funds and a key team member had given their two weeks' notice [20:17:03].

### The Core Insight
The idea for TBH came from observing two trends:
1.  **Snapchat TBH Game**: Kids were playing a game on Snapchat where they'd post emojis and receive positive feedback [25:22:03].
2.  **Saraha App**: The #1 app in the U.S. App Store was Saraha, an anonymous messaging app entirely in Arabic, indicating a strong latent demand for anonymous disclosure, despite its negative messaging [26:06:03].

Beer identified that people wanted to "feel good about themselves" and avoid bullying [27:27:03]. TBH addressed this by only allowing positive interactions through pre-authored polls, such as "who has the best smile" or "who's most likely to be president" [27:46:03]. This mechanic led to "literally explosive adoption," with one school sending 450,000 messages in seven days [28:33:03].

### Testing and Scaling
*   **Reproducible Testing Process**: Beer emphasizes developing a "reproducible testing process" for consumer products, as success is unpredictable. Taking many shots at bat reduces risk [19:11:03].
*   **Seeding**: TBH was seeded into a high school in Georgia chosen for its early start date [21:09:03]. Within 24 hours, 40% of the school downloaded it, rapidly spreading to neighboring schools [21:29:03].
*   **Targeted Saturation (for Testing, not Scaling)**: To get initial density for testing, they ran targeted ads and created dedicated Instagram accounts for specific schools, following students whose bios identified their school [30:05:03]. This allowed them to eliminate "confounding variables" and know if the product worked when enough people were on it [31:42:03].
*   **Geofencing**: Due to rapid growth and server crashes, TBH was temporarily geofenced by state to manage scaling [29:56:03].
*   **Live Chat Customer Support**: Implementing 24/7 live chat provided a "white glove experience" and served as a crucial tool for user research and feedback [32:51:03].

### Product-Market Fit
Beer echoes Roger Dicky's sentiment on product-market fit: "If your products working you'll know... if there's any uncertainty it's not working" [36:14:03]. For TBH, the metric was "hourly actives per day," not just daily active users [36:47:03].

### Sale to [[Growth strategies and frameworks used at Facebook | Facebook]]
Nine weeks after launch, TBH was sold to [[Growth strategies and frameworks used at Facebook | Facebook]] for over $30 million [02:11:03]. The selling process was "draining" [37:22:03]. Beer describes Facebook's M&A team as having 80 people, while his company consisted of himself, two engineers, and one designer [37:28:03].

### Product Management at Large Tech Companies
Joining [[Growth strategies and frameworks used at Facebook | Facebook]] as a Product Manager, Beer discovered that "there is very little product management that you do" in large tech companies [39:36:03]. PMs are "completely detached from the design process," primarily writing documents and coordinating approvals [39:55:03].

> "Products Live and Die in the pixels. You should be designing the hierarchy, the pixels, the flows everything that's on you" [01:15:03].

He notes that it's difficult for large companies to innovate on "zero to one products" because:
*   **Risk Aversion**: It's hard to present "hunches" about ideas without existing market signals, as employees are focused on performance reviews [04:14:03].
*   **Difficulty in Verbalizing Core Motivations**: The nuanced, sometimes controversial, reasons people download apps (e.g., to flirt, make/save money, unplug from reality) are hard to frame in corporate meetings [04:31:03].
*   **Slow Response to Market Signals**: Large companies often take 12 to 24 months to respond to competitive threats [04:55:03].

## Gas: Reinventing Growth in a New Climate

After four years at [[Growth strategies and frameworks used at Facebook | Facebook]], Beer left and, amidst a market downturn, decided to build Gas [01:13:03]. His motivation was to explore if a positive anonymous polling app could still be relevant five years later and whether it could be monetized [01:19:03].

### Reinventing Growth Systems
The regulatory environment had changed significantly, preventing the simple text invites used by TBH [01:28:28]. Gas required a complete reinvention of its growth systems, involving about nine launches and numerous feature changes [01:59:16].

Key growth and product lessons from Gas:
*   **Ethical Growth**: Beer emphasizes operating "above board" with growth systems, ensuring user data is not misused (e.g., sending texts on behalf of users) [01:00:59]. He believes "the internet operates on a similar paradigm" to the Gia hypothesis, where doing wrong by users will lead to negative consequences [01:01:25].
*   **Phased Validation**: Products should be validated in sequence: core flow usage, in-peer-group spread, and cross-peer-group spread [01:11:50]. For each stage, execute at 100% to get clear signal, even if other parts are "half-assed" [01:12:13].
*   **Fighting Hoaxes**: Gas faced a viral hoax claiming it was used for human trafficking [01:04:42]. Beer and his team "fought it at every vector possible," including:
    *   Insisting on specific positive headlines from journalists (e.g., "Gas app is not for human trafficking") [01:06:39].
    *   Calling school superintendents and police chiefs to retract false public statements [01:06:51].
    *   Asking Apple to remove review bombs from the App Store [01:07:02].
    *   Creating a TikTok video explaining the truth, which users saw when deleting accounts [01:07:10].
    *   The goal: ensure "the hoax is less viral than your app" [01:09:38].
*   **Lean Operations & Monetization**: Gas made $10 million in sales with 10 million downloads [01:09:57]. The team ran "almost entirely on Startup credits," negotiating every vendor bill down, resulting in "pure cash flow" without outside investors [01:10:13].
*   **Naming Impact**: The app's name significantly impacted invitation rates. An initial name, "Crush," caused boys to hesitate inviting friends due to its feminine connotations (pink icon). Renaming it "Gas" with a black flame icon and making it "more masculine" significantly increased invite rates [01:16:01].

## Key Lessons for Building Consumer Apps

### The Aha Moment: Invert Time to Value
Users' attention spans are short, so demonstrating value within the first three seconds is crucial [01:27:27]. This involves crafting onboarding and the entire experience to get users to the "aha moment" as quickly as possible [01:29:58]. An example is the "Dupe" app, where users type `dp.com` in front of a URL to find the cheapest version of a product, providing instant value [01:28:01].

### Understanding Growth Mechanisms
*   **Contact Permissions (iOS 18)**: Changes in iOS 18 make it significantly harder for apps to leverage contact sync for friend discovery, as users must manually select contacts from an alphabetical list [01:24:02]. This will likely entrench incumbents and force new apps to "reinvent what contact sync is" [01:25:51].
*   **Leverage APIs in Non-Traditional Ways**: Great product people are aware of every possible API and how it can be used creatively to activate users [01:30:33]. Avoid lazy solutions like expecting users to exchange usernames; optimize for "one tap" activation [01:31:21].
*   **Align Marketing and Product**: Marketing (ads, imagery) and in-app experience must be fully aligned with the product's growth mechanisms [01:33:55].

### The Science of Growth vs. Randomness of Durability
Beer believes that "growing a product can be a science with certainty," where a skilled individual "can make an app grow and go viral" [01:20:26]. However, achieving durability for a consumer social product is a "Black Swan event," with "a tremendous amount of Randomness" [01:18:50].

### Motivation
Beer's primary motivation for building apps is the "thrilling drug" of watching a product "take over the Internet" [01:49:03]. He values the quality of life and financial gains from rapid, high-impact projects over the long-term commitment and managerial duties of running a large corporation [01:21:21].

Beer advises companies, particularly venture-backed ones, on growth strategies, aiming to deliver a 10x return on their investment within the first 30 days [01:34:51]. He gets "in the pixels" with teams to refine designs and identify "step function changes" for growth [01:35:35]. He also shares "growth hacks that still nobody knows about" [01:36:03].

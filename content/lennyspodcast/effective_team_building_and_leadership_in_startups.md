Melton Berkowitz, Head of Growth at Deel, shares insights into how the company built its team and fostered a strong culture during its rapid growth. Deel grew from less than $1 million in Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) in July 2020 to $295 million ARR by the start of 2023, while remaining EBITDA positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:46">[05:15:46]</a>. This extraordinary trajectory highlights the effectiveness of their [[lessons_from_successful_founders_and_startups | strategies]] for [[challenges_and_strategies_for_creating_successful_startups | creating a successful startup]].

## Early Team Building and Prioritization
Melton joined Deel as the second marketing hire, and overall, employee number 19 or 20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:19">[05:54:19]</a>. In the early days, the focus was on building the fundamental infrastructure before investing in extensive growth channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

Key early priorities:
*   **Website Presence**: Ensure a fast, discoverable website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.
*   **Clear Messaging**: Develop a concise and unique pitch that explains what the company does, avoiding generic B2B statements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:09">[00:28:09]</a>. Rapid A/B testing of value propositions was crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:10">[00:29:10]</a>.
*   **Product-First Approach**: The core of the business must be solid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:54">[00:43:54]</a>. At Deel, most of the early team was product and engineers, indicating a strong foundation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:52">[00:43:52]</a>.

### Hiring Philosophy
Melton emphasizes hiring individuals who are committed to the business's bottom line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:44">[00:47:44]</a>.

Key attributes sought in early hires:
*   **Commitment to Revenue KPIs**: Candidates should be willing to commit to closed-won revenue goals, not just lead numbers, demonstrating a focus on the business's ultimate success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:35">[00:47:35]</a>.
*   **"Little Hands" Mentality**: No matter their seniority, team members must be willing to engage in the "nitty-gritty" or "dirty work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:46">[00:48:46]</a>. This concept, loosely translated from French, means being prepared to do the smallest tasks and not shy away from them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:38">[00:48:38]</a>.
*   **Operating with Limited Resources**: Evaluate if candidates, especially from larger companies, are accustomed to or willing to operate with significantly fewer resources than they might have had previously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:28">[00:48:28]</a>. A good test is to ask them to devise strategies with zero, ten thousand, and one hundred thousand dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:17">[00:50:17]</a>.

## Evolution of Team Structure
Deel's [[building_effective_product_teams | team structure]] evolved to support global expansion and specialized expertise.

Early team composition:
1.  **Product Marketing Leader**: The first hire was a product marketing person, bridging the product team and go-to-market teams to set messaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:47">[00:51:47]</a>.
2.  **Copywriter**: A talented copywriter was hired second to help refine messaging and tone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:02">[00:52:02]</a>.
3.  **Data Analyst**: The third hire was a data analyst, reflecting a commitment to understanding where every dollar was going and what it achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:10">[00:52:10]</a>.

Current structure:
*   **Functional Teams**: These teams consist of subject matter experts who can be based anywhere in the world. Examples include product marketing, content, community, events, paid advertisements, and brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:55">[00:52:55]</a>. The benefit is that technical roles sitting together allow for better best practice learning and faster skill leveling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:50">[00:53:50]</a>.
*   **Regional Teams**: Comprised of local [[leadership_and_team_dynamics_in_highgrowth_companies | marketing managers]] for different key regions. They collaborate with functional teams to execute strategies, ensuring local expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:17">[00:53:17]</a>. Resource allocation for regional teams depends on the Total Addressable Market, opportunities, and competitive landscape within a region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:30">[00:54:30]</a>.

## Culture at Deel
Deel's culture is defined by shared values and expectations, ensuring rapid growth and a positive work environment.

Key cultural components:
*   **"Deal Speed"**: The company's version of velocity, emphasizing urgency in addressing customer problems (e.g., answering within 24 hours) and building products (e.g., ten times faster than competitors) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:28">[00:55:28]</a>.
*   **Default Optimism**: A requirement for team members to be positive and solution-oriented, asking "how can this be done?" rather than focusing on reasons it won't work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:09">[00:56:09]</a>. This fosters an environment where people don't slow things down with pessimism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:15">[00:56:15]</a>.
*   **Deep Customer Care**: Recognizing that Deel deals with human livelihoods (payroll, contracts), emphasizing the personal impact of their work and ensuring the best possible service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:35">[00:56:35]</a>.

In return, Deel offers:
*   **Flexibility**: Employees have the freedom to choose where and when they work, enabling a global workforce and authentic self-expression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:23">[00:57:23]</a>.
*   **Fulfillment**: The intensity and fast pace lead to a fulfilling experience, as people see things getting done and feel alive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:10">[01:00:10]</a>.

Deel's values, including "Deal Speed" and "Default Optimism," were formalized about a year into the company's existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:08">[00:58:08]</a>. These values were organically adopted phrases before being officially defined, reflecting who the company already was rather than aspirational goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:29">[00:58:29]</a>. This organic development of culture, even before formal values, was crucial, especially given the company's early remote-first nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:29">[01:04:29]</a>.

## The Underlying Role of Product
All [[hiring_for_growth_roles_in_startups | growth]] and [[leadership_and_communication_in_tech | marketing efforts]] rely on a strong product. Acquisition channels are ineffective if the product doesn't meet expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:32">[00:42:32]</a>. Deel's product was considered "top-notch" from day one, allowing their sales and marketing efforts to succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:42">[00:42:42]</a>. For B2B companies, a poor product will quickly lead to customer churn and a damaged reputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:22">[00:43:22]</a>. When joining a young company, it's advisable to look at the team breakdown: a higher ratio of product and engineers to sales people indicates a solid core business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:52">[00:43:52]</a>.

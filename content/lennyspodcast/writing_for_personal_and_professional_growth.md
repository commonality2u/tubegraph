Will Larson, CTO at Carta and author of two essential books for engineers, is a prolific writer who consistently shares his insights through books and his blog, `larson.com` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. His approach to writing offers valuable lessons for those looking to leverage it for [[career_growth_and_personal_development | personal]] and professional advancement.

### The Motivation Behind Prolific Writing

Larson emphasizes that the key to writing a lot is to write what you genuinely want to write <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:37">[00:27:37]</a>. He doesn't write for financial gain or on a strict schedule, as he finds scheduled or externally dictated writing draining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:45">[00:27:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:55">[00:27:55]</a>. The freedom to "write where there's [[Energy audit for personal and professional growth | energy]]" and stop when there isn't, allows him to maintain consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:38">[00:28:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>. This means abandoning projects that don't come together, like a previous infrastructure engineering book he started <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:21">[00:28:21]</a>.

### Impact of Writing on Career and Growth

Writing has had a significant impact on Larson's career by helping him refine his thinking and improve his performance at work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:27">[00:36:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:28">[00:36:28]</a>. When writing about topics directly related to his work, it's not a distraction but an alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:02">[00:36:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:30">[00:36:30]</a>. This process allows him to test his ideas against experts in the field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:47">[00:36:47]</a>.

He highlights that the biggest risk to content creation is quitting due to burnout, not growing too slowly initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:48">[00:32:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:50">[00:32:50]</a>. Building an audience is a long game, and consistency over a decade is far more important than initial rapid growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:12">[00:33:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:02">[00:34:02]</a>.

### Practical Advice for Aspiring Writers

#### Making Time for Writing
Larson has adapted his schedule for writing, moving from dedicated Saturday mornings before having a child to mostly writing at night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:56">[00:36:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:09">[00:37:09]</a>. The core principle remains: if you're excited about something, you will find the time and [[Energy audit for personal and professional growth | energy]] for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:18">[00:37:18]</a>.

#### Quantity vs. Quality
For those aiming to advance their [[career_development_and_advice | career]], Larson advises focusing on creating two or three "really good things" by spending significant time drafting, revising, and getting feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:58">[00:37:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:01">[00:38:01]</a>. There's no need to maintain a long-running blog if the goal is to showcase deep thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:10">[00:38:10]</a>.

However, if the goal is to write a lot consistently, his advice is simply to "just publish" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:35">[00:38:35]</a>. He publishes almost everything he writes, only starting a piece if he believes it can be published <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:47">[00:38:47]</a>. This approach prioritizes getting ideas out and showing his [[maximizing_human_potential_and_personal_growth | evolution as a thinker]] over creating a polished, perfect product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:10">[00:39:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:20">[00:39:20]</a>.

#### Overcoming Fear of Judgment
Larson suggests that people often overestimate how much others care about what they put out, as most will give it only a brief glance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:21">[00:40:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:23">[00:40:23]</a>. Negative feedback often reflects the sender's issues, not the writer's work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:49">[00:40:49]</a>. When starting out, the stress is minimal because the audience is small, making it an ideal time to experiment freely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:04">[00:41:04]</a>.

#### Adding Value
To capture attention, it's crucial to "add something new to the conversation" by sharing novel insights or information not found elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:03">[00:35:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:11">[00:35:11]</a>.

### An Underappreciated Piece: "Hard to Work With"
Larson considers his piece "Hard to Work With" to be one of his most important and underappreciated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:28">[01:14:28]</a>. It addresses the challenge faced by talented individuals who are perceived as "combative or difficult to work with" because they hold their peers to a high standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:38">[01:14:38]</a>. He notes that many high-achievers struggle with this throughout their careers, being "despised because they care so much" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:20">[01:15:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:29">[01:15:29]</a>. This topic directly relates to [[candor_and_feedback_in_professional_growth | professional growth]] and how one's intentions can be misconstrued if not managed carefully.

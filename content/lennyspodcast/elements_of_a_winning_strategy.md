Strategy, as defined by Richard Rumelt, is a design for overcoming a high-stakes challenge, combining policy and action to address a specific issue, which can be either an upside opportunity or a negative threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. The term "strategy" originates from the Greek word *stratos*, referring to elected leaders in Athens who dealt with the day's issues, not solely military matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. Fundamentally, [[understanding_strategy_and_its_challenges | strategy]] is about dealing with a challenge or problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

## The Kernel of a Good Strategy

A good [[understanding_strategy_and_its_challenges | strategy]] consists of three essential components, often referred to as the "kernel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:28">[00:26:28]</a>:

1.  **Diagnosis**
    The first step is a thorough understanding of the situation, specifically identifying the one or two key challenges that can actually be addressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. This involves deciding what aspects of reality to pay attention to and forming hypotheses about how things connect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. A rich diagnosis acknowledges the complexity of the world, rather than simplifying it into two-by-two matrices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. It's about figuring out "what makes it hard" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:40">[00:56:40]</a>.

2.  **Guiding Policy**
    Following the diagnosis, a guiding policy outlines how the organization will deal with the identified challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. This policy involves making choices about what to do and, crucially, what *not* to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. It is the core of the strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.

3.  **Coherent Actions**
    The final and most important part of a [[understanding_strategy_and_its_challenges | strategy]] involves a set of coordinated and coherent actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>. These actions must directly address the diagnosis and guiding policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>. They must also be internally consistent, avoiding self-contradictory efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. The actions should be focused on a few key areas, as concentration is a fundamental source of [[Role of Power in Strategy | power]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:03">[00:25:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:11">[00:25:11]</a>.

### Example: Microsoft and AI
When Microsoft adapts to AI, the process illustrates these components:
*   **Diagnosis:** Recognizing the challenge of adapting to AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>.
*   **Guiding Policy:** Investing in a major AI leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>.
*   **Coherent Actions:** Incorporating AI into its search engine and other products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>.

## Identifying [[Good vs Bad Strategy | Bad Strategy]]

[[Good vs Bad Strategy | Bad strategy]] is pervasive and often leads to confusion and ineffective efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>. Key signs of [[Good vs Bad Strategy | bad strategy]] include:

*   **Goals as Strategy:** Presenting abstract, high-level goals (e.g., increasing growth and profit simultaneously) as if they are a [[understanding_strategy_and_its_challenges | strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>. This is merely a list of ambitions or wishes, not a plan for action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>.
*   **Fluff:** Using fancy words or "word salad" that sound abstract and strategic but lack concrete meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>.
*   **Missing or Poor Diagnosis:** Failing to articulate the specific problem or challenge being faced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:18">[00:21:18]</a>. Simply stating a desire (e.g., "we need to grow faster") without identifying the underlying causes is not a diagnosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:45">[00:19:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>.
*   **Incoherent Actions:** Proposing actions that contradict each other or do not align with the stated goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:59">[00:20:59]</a>.

## The [[Role of Power in Strategy | Role of Power in Strategy]]

At its core, [[Role of Power in Strategy | power]] in strategy involves exploiting an asymmetry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:48">[00:28:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:17">[00:29:17]</a>. This means identifying something that differentiates your company or team from others, such as unique knowledge, possessions, or capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:52">[00:32:52]</a>. Examples of sources of [[Role of Power in Strategy | power]] include:

*   **First-mover Advantage:** Being the first to recognize or enter a market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:38">[00:29:38]</a>.
*   **Reputation:** A strong reputation in a certain area can provide an advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:47">[00:29:47]</a>. However, an established reputation can also hinder adaptability to new contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:58">[00:29:58]</a>.
*   **Relationships:** Existing relationships with key customers or stakeholders can be a significant source of leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:13">[00:30:13]</a>.
*   **Network Effects:** The value of a product or service increasing with the number of users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:16">[00:35:16]</a>. This is a dominant force in today's tech space, as seen with social media platforms and e-commerce giants like Amazon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:31">[00:36:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:18">[00:37:18]</a>.
*   **Data Size:** In the age of generative AI, the volume of data available for learning algorithms can be a powerful asymmetry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:25">[00:38:25]</a>.
*   **Specialization:** Owning a particular, niche approach that differs from market leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:20">[00:39:20]</a>.

Identifying [[Role of Power in Strategy | power]] involves looking for "asymmetries" in your company, team, or market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:52">[00:32:52]</a>. A strategy should be designed to exploit a source of [[Role of Power in Strategy | power]] that makes success more likely, shifting the odds in your favor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:52">[00:43:52]</a>.

## Overcoming Organizational Challenges

One of the biggest hindrances to winning strategies is organizational dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:40]</a>. Complex organizations struggle to focus energy due to differing interests among departments and individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:51">[00:27:51]</a>.

Challenges include:
*   **Too Many Priorities:** Companies often list numerous "priorities" which are actually just a "lottery list" of desired outcomes, diffusing effort rather than focusing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:37">[00:27:37]</a>. A true "priority" means "the first" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.
*   **Disagreement on Diagnosis:** Within organizations, there are often arguments over the true nature of the problem, which must be resolved to create a coherent strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a>.
*   **Fear of Action and Change:** Implementing a strategy often requires people to change their roles and alters power relationships, which can lead to hesitation from leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:55">[01:15:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:30">[01:16:30]</a>.
*   **Lack of a Decider:** In the face of diverse interests and conflicting information, a clear decision-maker is essential to coalesce a group around an action agenda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:05">[01:12:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:24">[01:16:24]</a>.

## Strategy for Startups

For startups, especially those pre-product-market fit, [[understanding_strategy_and_its_challenges | strategy]] involves dealing with significant uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:57">[02:20:57]</a>. It is essentially making a bet on a particular market or solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:05">[02:11:05]</a>.

Key aspects of startup strategy:
*   **Iterative Discovery:** Reality is revealed in bits and pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:23">[02:12:23]</a>. Successful startups often "switch" or pivot, realizing that their initial target customer or solution needs adjustment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:35">[02:22:35]</a>.
*   **Dual Mindset:** Founders need to be convinced of their certainty to win, yet also be willing to shift when things aren't working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:14">[02:23:14]</a>.
*   **Focus on "Value Denied":** A useful exercise is to identify things that people *should* be able to buy but cannot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:46">[02:26:46]</a>. This highlights unmet needs and potential opportunities for innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:49">[02:28:49]</a>.

When considering how a product manager might approach [[developing_a_product_strategy | developing a product strategy]], such as for an onboarding experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:33">[00:55:33]</a>:

*   **Focus on the Challenge (The Crux):** Instead of a broad "strategy," identify the hardest point of the problem, similar to the "crux" in mountain climbing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:01">[01:03:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:17">[01:04:17]</a>. If you can't solve the crux, the overall goal might be unachievable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:46">[01:04:46]</a>.
*   **Call it an "Action Agenda":** Instead of a "strategy," frame it as an "action agenda" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:29">[00:29:29]</a>. This emphasizes concrete steps rather than abstract goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
*   **Connect Ambition to Problems:** Start with ambitions, then filter them by what can be made progress on, identifying the specific barriers or problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:11">[01:00:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:01">[01:01:01]</a>.
*   **Prioritize Achievable and Important Challenges:** Choose challenges that are both important to the overall ambition and addressable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:44">[01:01:44]</a>.

## Cultivating Strategic Insight

[[Building Strategy Skills and Effective Goals | Building strategy skills]] and having insight are critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:21">[01:09:21]</a>. Insight isn't magical; it comes from immersing oneself in the nature of the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:24">[01:09:24]</a>. Strategic thinking is about looking at a problem, identifying what makes it hard, and then finding a way to solve it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:48">[01:08:48]</a>. This often involves drawing analogies from historical human experience, as strategy is not a science with equations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:57">[01:47:57]</a>. Reading biographies and histories, particularly business history, provides valuable insights into how others have navigated complex situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:32">[01:47:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:38">[01:47:38]</a>.

To improve at strategy:
*   **Spend more time diagnosing the problem** and finding the biggest challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:21">[01:10:21]</a>.
*   **Call it an action agenda**, focusing on what will actually be done, not just what is wished for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:32">[01:10:32]</a>.
*   **Practice "thinking again"**: After an initial diagnosis, consider if there's another way to look at the situation or a better approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:03">[01:52:03]</a>.
*   **Focus on "doable" goals**: Be consistent in concentrating efforts on achievable outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:57">[01:45:57]</a>.

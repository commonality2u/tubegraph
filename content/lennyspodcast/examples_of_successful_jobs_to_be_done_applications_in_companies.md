The Jobs to Be Done (JTBD) framework emphasizes that people "hire" products to make progress in their lives, rather than simply buying them [00:05:33]. This perspective helps businesses understand the true competitive landscape from the "demand side" of the world, focusing on the customer's context and desired outcome, rather than just the product's features or underlying technology [00:05:40].

## Core Principle: Context and Outcome, Not Just Pain and Gain

A major misconception about JTBD is viewing it merely as "pain and gain" [00:00:00]. Instead, it's about understanding the specific context a person is in and the outcome they desire [00:00:04]. This context makes seemingly "irrational" behaviors rational [00:00:13]. The framework reveals that "a struggling moment causes demand" [00:07:56], and identifying these moments is crucial for innovation [00:09:01].

## Real-World Applications

Several companies and products have successfully applied the JTBD framework to understand customer behavior, drive innovation, and achieve significant growth.

### Snickers vs. Milky Way
While Snickers and Milky Way are both candy bars often found in the same checkout aisle, their "jobs to be done" are distinct [00:05:52].
*   **Snickers** is often "hired" by individuals who have missed a meal, are low on energy, and need to quickly return to their tasks [00:06:21]. It competes with items like protein drinks, Red Bull, or coffee, serving almost as a meal replacement [00:06:42]. Its ingredients are designed to masticate into a ball, absorbing stomach acid and providing sustained energy [00:46:48].
*   **Milky Way** is typically consumed after an emotional experience, often alone, as a way to regroup [01:06:51]. It competes with comfort items like a glass of wine, a brownie, or even a run [00:07:01].

Understanding these different contexts and desired outcomes allows companies to see their true competitive set, moving beyond direct product comparisons [00:07:09].

### Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU)
In 2010, Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU) identified "anomalies" â€“ 50 to 60 students who were paying full price for school but not attending classes, instead watching everything online [00:08:07]. Investigating these students revealed a different "job" compared to typical 18-24 year olds [00:08:31]. These were older individuals, often with prior degrees or unsuccessful college attempts, who now had responsibilities and wanted to "do something new" [00:08:34].

By understanding this struggling moment (wanting to go back to school but facing constraints), SNHU realized the market was not just a few thousand people, but hundreds of thousands [00:08:50]. This insight led them to grow into one of the largest universities globally, with over 200,000 students [00:08:57]. The product wasn't built first; the "struggling moment" caused the demand [00:09:01].

### Intercom
Intercom successfully applied JTBD by recognizing that people "hired" their product for four distinct reasons [00:21:01]. Instead of building separate products or trying to cater to all needs with a single, complex offering, they strategically turned off features not relevant to a user's specific pathway [00:21:05].
*   For users seeking "acquire" (customer acquisition), Intercom competed with products like HubSpot [00:21:12].
*   For those focused on "support," it competed with Zendesk [00:21:24].

By changing their pricing model to match the competition for each specific "job" and positioning themselves as a valuable "Next Step" between basic solutions and more comprehensive, complex offerings (like HubSpot or nothing), Intercom grew to be valued at over two billion dollars [00:21:29].

### Autobooks
Autobooks, a Detroit-based company helping banks provide invoicing services (like Apple Pay integration) for small businesses, revamped its sales process by understanding the customer's buying journey [00:14:51]. They identified that customers (both small businesses and banks) go through different "phases" in their buying process:
1.  **First thought:** Initial awareness [00:15:38].
2.  **Passive looking:** Problem-aware but solution-unaware, needing to learn [00:15:39].
3.  **Active looking:** Both problem and solution-aware, trying to frame a solution [00:15:46].
4.  **Deciding:** Making trade-offs [00:15:51].
5.  **First use:** Initial adoption [01:17:06].
6.  **Ongoing use:** Building a new habit [01:17:07].

By breaking their demo into three different segments tailored to where the customer was in their buying journey (e.g., telling stories for passive looking, showing alternatives for active looking, offering choices for deciding), Autobooks quadrupled their conversion rate and nearly halved their sales cycle [00:16:17].

### Unnamed Social Media Marketplace
A large social media company observed users transacting on their platform without specific tools [00:28:24]. To launch a new marketplace (a 0-to-1 product), they studied established competitors like eBay and Etsy [00:28:36]. By interviewing users of these platforms, they uncovered the "jobs" sellers and buyers were trying to get done when using Craigslist, eBay, or Etsy [00:28:40]. This allowed them to understand what existing solutions people would "fire" when "hiring" their new product, leading to the creation of a marketplace now worth nearly three billion dollars [00:28:49].

### Home Building and Condo Sales
In his personal experience building houses, Bob Moesta applied JTBD to address customer "frictional points" [01:13:32].
*   **Condo Sales:** When selling smaller condos to "downsizers," many cancellations occurred because buyers struggled with moving all their accumulated belongings [01:13:47]. By *raising the price* of the condo to include moving services and two years of storage, sales increased over 30% [01:13:55]. This addressed a significant "anxiety" [01:12:44] and "habit of the present" [01:12:57] that prevented people from making progress [01:12:40].
*   **Dining Room Table:** Downsizing parents often claimed they didn't want a dining room table in their new condo, stating they wouldn't host holidays [01:03:37]. However, sales would stall if there wasn't a designated space for it [01:04:01]. The dining room table, it turned out, was an "emotional bank account" for their lives [01:04:07]. By sacrificing a second bedroom suite to include a symbolic space for a dining table (even if too small for actual dining), sales increased by 22% [01:04:41]. This addressed an "irrational contradiction" and a deep-seated emotional need [01:04:51].

## The Interview Process for JTBD

To uncover these insights, a specific interview process is recommended:
*   **Focus on Causation:** The goal is to understand "the causation of what pushes people to say today's the day I got to do something different" [01:11:54].
*   **Interview Recent Purchasers:** Talk to people who have recently "purchased" (hired) a product or service [01:19:29]. Ask them not about the product itself, but about their story: "what was going on, what were they hoping for, what were they worried about, what did they have to give up, how did they convince somebody else" [01:14:15].
*   **Interview Churned Customers:** For established products, interviewing churned customers is highly insightful [00:35:17]. They are still making progress but found the product too hard or insufficient, revealing new struggling moments and changing contexts [00:35:22].
*   **No Discussion Guide:** Instead of a rigid discussion guide, use the framework of pushes, pulls, anxieties, and habits to guide the conversation [00:30:24]. The aim is to get the customer to elaborate on their story, even if it means playing things back "incorrectly" to encourage more detailed responses [00:27:54].
*   **Focus on "The Edge of Language":** Push interviewees beyond simple answers to "the edge of language" where they have no more words, then use bracketing questions (e.g., "was it more about this or more about that?") to force further elaboration [00:31:07].
*   **Avoid "What They Say They Want":** People often express what they *think* they want (e.g., granite countertops, Energy Star compliance) [00:17:19]. The true insights come from understanding the actual trade-offs they made when they *bought* (e.g., a finished basement instead of Energy Star features) [00:17:25].
*   **Quantity of Interviews:** For causal mechanisms, insights tend to repeat after seven or eight interviews [00:29:10]. It's recommended to do 10-12 interviews, potentially in two rounds, rather than a large number of random interviews [00:29:22].
*   **"Bitching Ain't Switching":** Don't rely on people's complaints alone [00:37:04]. Just because they express dissatisfaction doesn't mean they'll switch products [00:37:06]. Focus on those who have *tried* to make progress, even if they failed [00:36:58].

## When JTBD May Not Be the Right Framework
JTBD is less effective when there is no real choice for the customer, or when the decision-making process is so habitual that users cannot recall the buying moment [00:51:12]. For instance, people know more about car insurance (because they actively choose it) than health insurance (often chosen by employers with limited options) [00:51:18]. Similarly, recalling when one last *bought* chewing gum is difficult due to habit, but recalling when one *chewed* gum is easier and more informative [00:52:51]. In such cases, methods like ethnography, prototyping, or focusing on "how" people use a product (rather than "why" they buy it) may be more appropriate [00:52:28].

Failure is an inevitable part of any career, and learning how to navigate and recover from it is crucial for long-term success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:02">[00:53:02]</a>. Ethan Evans, a former Vice President at Amazon, shares his experience of failing on an important project for Jeff Bezos and the valuable [[lessons_from_successful_founders_and_startups | lessons learned]] from that experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:16">[00:41:16]</a>.

## Ethan Evans's High-Stakes Failure at Amazon

Ethan Evans recounts a significant failure during the launch of the Amazon App Store, where he was a director <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:07">[00:41:07]</a>. The launch, which included a key "test drive" feature emphasized by Jeff Bezos, was delayed due to a database problem that his team was still debugging hours after the planned go-live time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:50">[00:41:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:18">[00:42:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:10">[00:43:10]</a>. This infuriated Jeff Bezos, leading to a cascade of angry emails and a loss of trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:46">[00:43:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:04">[00:44:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:55">[00:46:55]</a>.

## Strategies for Recovery and Rebuilding Trust

In the face of intense pressure and anger from top leadership, Ethan applied several key strategies to manage the crisis and eventually re-earn trust:

### 1. Take Immediate Ownership
The first crucial step was to admit the problem and take full responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:28">[00:44:28]</a>. This involves acknowledging the mistake directly, without deflection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:41">[00:50:41]</a>.

### 2. Proactive and Frequent Communication
Ethan began providing hourly updates to Jeff Bezos and other copied leaders, detailing the current status, the plan for the next hour, and when the next update would be provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:39">[00:44:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:56">[00:50:56]</a>. This transparency helped to rebuild trust incrementally and prevent micromanagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:12">[00:51:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:22">[00:51:22]</a>.

### 3. Seek External Help
Leveraging internal resources, Ethan's team received critical support from AWS principal engineers who provided immediate solutions to their database issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:39">[00:45:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:50">[00:45:50]</a>.

### 4. Work Relentlessly to Fix the Problem
Recovering from a major mistake requires pulling out all stops and working diligently to resolve the issue, even if it means working through uncomfortable periods like weekends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:55">[00:51:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:09">[00:52:09]</a>. This demonstrates true [[common_startup_challenges_and_failure_points | ownership]] and commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:36">[00:52:36]</a>.

### 5. Face the Music In Person
Despite the previous tension, Ethan chose to attend a scheduled meeting with Jeff Bezos, even sitting directly next to him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:44">[00:47:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:12">[00:48:12]</a>. This brave step allowed for a more human conversation, which is much harder for leaders to maintain anger in a face-to-face setting compared to emails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:57">[00:49:57]</a>.

### 6. Embrace Resilience and Persistence
Even after a significant failure and facing the potential for being fired, Ethan's "bullheadedness" and refusal to live in shame helped him move forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:13">[00:53:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:26">[00:55:26]</a>. This mindset is crucial for [[overcoming_impostor_syndrome_for_career_success | overcoming impostor syndrome]] and realizing that one mistake does not define a career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:02">[00:53:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:09">[00:55:09]</a>.

### 7. Adapt Your Approach
The experience taught Ethan to be more cautious about "surprise launches" and to prioritize thorough beta testing over strict adherence to deadlines, especially when considering the potential for negative media exposure (e.g., "Fear The New York Times headline") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:19">[00:58:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:51">[00:56:51]</a>.

### 8. Support Your Team Members
Ethan expressed regret over not reaching out to the new college graduate engineer whose code caused the major bug <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>. Despite the bug being "on him," Ethan recognized that the system had failed the engineer by leaving him without sufficient oversight, and that the engineer likely felt undue responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:32">[00:59:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:26">[01:00:26]</a>. Being there for the human aspect of failure is as important as fixing the technical issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:14">[01:00:14]</a>.

Ultimately, by applying these principles, Ethan was able to re-earn Jeff Bezos's trust and was promoted to Vice President two years after the incident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:03">[00:49:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:06">[00:50:06]</a>. His story demonstrates that even public failures with top leaders can be overcome with the right approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:09">[00:50:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:51">[00:52:51]</a>.

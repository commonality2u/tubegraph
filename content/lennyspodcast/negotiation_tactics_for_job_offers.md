When looking for a job, it's crucial to approach the process with a clear strategy, playing to win rather than just trying not to lose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>. This means taking charge of the interview and negotiation stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:15">[00:49:15]</a>. Phil Terry, author of "Never Search Alone," emphasizes that many people make a significant mistake by not being assertive during these critical phases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:25">[00:49:25]</a>.

## Playing to Win

Phil Terry advocates for a "play to win" mentality, which doesn't mean being a ruthless negotiator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:51">[00:49:51]</a>. Instead, it involves being proactive and demonstrating your value to the prospective employer.

### Crafting Your Job Mission with OKRs

A key tactic is to create your own version of the job description, called a "job mission with OKRs" (Objectives and Key Results) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:28">[00:50:28]</a>.
Most job descriptions are often unclear, as companies may not fully understand what they are looking for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:40">[00:50:40]</a>. By developing your own mission, you are defining what you believe you will be accountable for and the outcomes you will deliver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:06">[00:51:06]</a>.

> [!tip] Private Draft, Then Share
> Draft your job mission privately first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:16">[00:51:16]</a>. After a couple of interviews, share it as a draft with the hiring manager during a live conversation (phone or Zoom, not email) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:36">[00:51:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:44">[01:02:44]</a>.

Benefits of this approach:
*   **Generates Interview Questions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:21">[00:51:21]</a>: Drafting the mission helps you formulate incisive questions to clarify the role.
*   **Impresses Hiring Managers** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:27">[00:51:27]</a>: A senior Amazon manager, who has hired over 2,000 product leaders, stated that if someone presented a job mission with OKRs, it would "blow my mind" and he "would hire them on the spot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>.
*   **Clarifies Expectations** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:01">[00:53:01]</a>: It helps avoid taking a "job A" that turns out to be "job B" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:23">[00:53:23]</a>.

## Negotiating Beyond Salary

Once an offer is received, it sets you up to negotiate the "four legs of the negotiation stool," which extends beyond just salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:43">[00:53:43]</a>. This demonstrates your investment in succeeding in the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:30">[00:59:30]</a>.

Examples of non-salary negotiations:
*   **Budget for Initiatives**: Ask for budget to address specific challenges, such as "tech debt" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:28">[00:54:28]</a>. One Chief Product Officer (CPO) successfully negotiated a $20 million budget on day one, which led to a promotion within a year and consideration for a CEO role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:57">[00:54:57]</a>.
*   **Team Training & Development**: Inquire about resources for team training, hiring additional Individual Contributors (ICs), or strengthening weak functions like design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:40">[00:55:40]</a>.
*   **Professional Development**: Even for junior roles, discuss mentorship opportunities, professional development, and conference attendance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:16">[00:56:16]</a>.

> [!tip] Tie Back to OKRs
> Ensure these requests tie back to the OKRs you've already discussed and agreed upon with the hiring manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:14">[00:59:14]</a>.

> [!warning] Red Flags
> If a company is unwilling to discuss these resources or dismisses your needs, it can be a significant red flag, indicating they may not be serious about setting you up for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:12">[00:57:12]</a>.

## Asking for More Money

Despite current market conditions, asking for more money is often successful. Historically, 87% of the time, people who ask for more money receive it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:10">[01:01:10]</a>.

> [!tip] Collaborative Approach
> Avoid an "antagonistic" or "shark-like" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:51">[00:57:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:35">[01:00:35]</a>. Instead, phrase your request collaboratively: "Are you open to [desired amount]? That was really what I was hoping for, what I think I'm worth. Is that something we can talk about?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:06">[01:01:06]</a>. Most of the time, they will at least engage in the conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:17">[01:01:17]</a>.

## Overcoming Negotiation Anxiety

Negotiating can be uncomfortable, but it's important to remember that companies often have more resources (lawyers, HR) than an individual job seeker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:52">[01:01:52]</a>.

> [!note] The Role of [[Job Search Strategies and Candidate Market Fit | Job Search Councils]]
> Joining a [[job_search_strategies_and_candidate_market_fit | Job Search Council]] provides crucial support and accountability during the negotiation process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>. This community helps combat the feeling of being alone and encourages you to take charge, even when your instincts might say otherwise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:02">[01:02:02]</a>.

> [!tip] Debrief After Interviews
> After an interview or negotiation, debrief with your [[Job Search Strategies and Candidate Market Fit | Job Search Council]] or trusted contacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:11">[01:07:11]</a>. People often misinterpret how they performed, influenced by their inner critic or impostor syndrome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:18">[01:07:18]</a>. External perspective helps to accurately assess the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:24">[01:07:24]</a>.

By proactively defining your role, discussing necessary resources, and confidently articulating your value, you can significantly improve your chances of securing a desirable job offer and setting yourself up for success.

When seeking a job, adopting a proactive and strategic approach is crucial, much like a product person develops new products with a narrow, clear focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>. This involves being "in charge" during the interview and negotiation process, rather than passively accepting what is offered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:45">[00:49:45]</a>. The goal is to [[hiring_and_firing_strategies_in_startups | play to win]], not just to avoid losing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:45">[00:49:45]</a>.

## Key Negotiation Strategies

### 1. Create a Job Mission with OKRs

Instead of just reacting to a job description, proactively define the role and your contributions:
*   **Develop Your Own Job Description**: Create a personal version of the job description, detailing what you believe the role entails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:30">[00:50:30]</a>.
*   **Incorporate OKRs**: Frame your understanding of the role with Objectives and Key Results (OKRs), outlining the outcomes you expect to deliver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:53">[00:50:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:06">[00:51:06]</a>.
*   **Benefits of this approach**:
    *   **Informs Interview Questions**: Drafting your own OKRs helps you formulate insightful questions to clarify the job's scope with the hiring team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:21">[00:51:21]</a>.
    *   **Impresses Hiring Managers**: When shared, this proactive approach can "blow the mind" of hiring managers, demonstrating initiative and accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:01">[00:52:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:50">[00:52:50]</a>. An Amazon senior leader, who has hired over 2,000 product leaders, stated that if someone presented this, he would hire them on the spot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:01">[00:52:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:14">[00:52:14]</a>.
    *   **Clarifies Expectations**: It helps prevent situations where "job A turned out to be job B" by explicitly discussing what the role entails and what priorities are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:01">[00:53:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:30">[00:53:30]</a>.

### 2. Negotiate for Success (Beyond Salary)

Before discussing compensation, engage in a conversation about the resources and support needed to achieve the agreed-upon OKRs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:51">[00:53:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:19">[00:54:19]</a>.
*   **Identify Key Needs**: Discuss critical aspects like budget (e.g., for tech debt, new hires), team training, or professional development opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:26">[00:54:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:50">[00:55:50]</a>.
    *   *Example*: A Chief Product Officer (CPO) successfully negotiated a $20 million budget for tech debt on day one, which led to significant success, promotions, and consideration for a CEO role within two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:39">[00:54:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:08">[00:56:08]</a>.
*   **Show Initiative**: This conversation demonstrates your commitment to succeeding in the role and your understanding of what it will take to deliver results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:32">[00:59:32]</a>.
*   **Identify Red Flags**: If the company is unwilling to discuss these aspects or address identified needs, it can be a "huge red flag" indicating a lack of seriousness or support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:12">[00:57:12]</a>.
*   **Face-to-Face or Call**: Whenever possible, have these discussions live (in-person or video call) with the hiring manager, rather than over email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:41">[01:02:41]</a>.

### 3. Ask for More Money

Once the success-enabling factors are discussed, then proceed to salary negotiation.
*   **It Works**: Historically, 87% of the time, people get more money when they ask for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:17">[01:00:17]</a>. While the market might be tighter now, it's still worth asking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:28">[01:00:28]</a>.
*   **Collaborative Approach**: Avoid a "ruthless negotiator" style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>. Instead, frame it as a collaborative conversation: "Are you open to [desired salary]?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:06">[01:01:06]</a>.
*   **Honesty is Key**: Be honest about what you're asking for and why, without hiding intentions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:56">[01:27:56]</a>.

### 4. Leverage Your Support Network

*   **Job Search Councils**: Your [[job_search_strategies | job search council]] can provide essential support and a sounding board throughout the negotiation process, helping you overcome natural resistance to these proactive tactics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:57">[00:32:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:58">[01:01:58]</a>.
*   **Debrief After Interviews**: Immediately debrief after interviews and negotiations with your council or trusted contacts. This helps process what happened, counteract imposter syndrome, and gain an accurate perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:12">[01:07:12]</a>.
*   **"Gratitude House" Exercise**: Before interviews, reflect on everyone who has supported you (your "gratitude house"). Imagining them "on your shoulders" can boost confidence and help you show up as your authentic self <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:29">[01:06:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:36">[01:09:36]</a>.

> "Everyone feels anxious and insecure in the job search... you are not alone." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:26">[01:29:26]</a>

By focusing on these strategies, individuals can transform their job search from a passive "spray and pray" approach into a targeted, confident, and ultimately more successful endeavor, even in challenging markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>.

The **Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe)** emerged from the desire to scale Scrum and other processes in large organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. While it gained popularity for providing a structured approach to agile implementation, its effectiveness and alignment with core product management principles are debated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## What is SAFe?

[[safe_and_its_implementation_in_large_organizations | SAFe]] is a highly prescriptive framework designed to tie multiple agile teams together at scale within an organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:28">[00:27:28]</a>. It provides an operating model that appeals to executives in large enterprises, often with tens of thousands of employees, because it offers a seemingly comprehensive guide for software development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:36">[00:27:36]</a>. SAFe aims to bring rigor and process to large-scale development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:32">[00:27:32]</a>.

### SAFe's Approach to Roles

SAFe introduces distinct roles, notably separating the "product owner" and "product manager" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:19">[00:29:19]</a>.
*   **Product Owner (PO)**: In SAFe, the PO is typically part of the agile team, responsible for defining what goes into the backlog, writing user stories, prioritizing work for developers, and managing the backlog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:27">[00:28:27]</a>. This role often becomes highly tactical, focusing on keeping developers busy with tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">[00:37:37]</a>. Product owners often spend 40 hours a week writing user stories to ensure a full backlog for developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:58">[00:28:58]</a>.
*   **Product Manager (PM)**: In SAFe, the PM is positioned higher up, often with a system architect and a release train engineer, focusing on features and feeding customer insights to product owners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:34">[00:30:34]</a>.

This separation can lead to product owners being "order takers" and lacking strategic experience, making career progression to a product manager role challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:37">[00:34:37]</a>. Organizations adopting SAFe may find their product managers not having the strategic experience needed to truly understand customer needs and market research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:01">[00:35:01]</a>.

## Challenges with SAFe

Many companies that adopted SAFe have since abandoned or significantly modified it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>. Capital One, an early adopter of SAFe, has since removed its agile and scrum roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:07">[00:36:07]</a>.

Key criticisms and [[challenges_in_agile_transformations_within_nonsoftware_native_companies | Challenges in agile transformations within nonsoftware native companies]] of SAFe include:
*   **Over-prescription and Rigidity**: SAFe's detailed "map" and explicit definitions can lead to excessive meetings and a focus on process over actual work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:55">[00:27:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:18">[00:24:18]</a>. This rigidity can hinder true agility and lead to less efficient ways of working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:36">[00:36:36]</a>.
*   **Lack of Product Discovery**: SAFe often doesn't adequately describe how to perform essential product discovery activities like market research, experimentation, or data analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:18:55]</a>. Teams often commit to quarterly plans without sufficient prior discovery, leading to building the wrong things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:19">[00:31:19]</a>.
*   **Process Over Outcomes**: The emphasis can shift from achieving business goals and delivering customer value to simply adhering to agile cadences and filling backlogs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:56">[00:50:56]</a>. This can result in delayed product launches and even financial struggles, as seen in a water company that went bankrupt due to slow deployment of a new invoicing system while learning SAFe processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:41">[00:50:41]</a>.
*   **Misunderstanding of Roles**: The product owner role, as defined in SAFe, often acts as a liaison for developers rather than a strategic product leader, making developers reliant on them for tasks and accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:41">[00:32:41]</a>.

## Traditional Methods (Waterfall) vs. Agile/Scrum

Historically, many large companies, especially those not natively building software, relied on traditional "waterfall" development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This method involved long development cycles, sometimes years, culminating in a "big bang" release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>. The risk with waterfall was high, as there was no consistent testing or feedback from customers until the very end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>.

The **Agile Manifesto**, written in 2001 by software developers, aimed to address these issues by advocating for a different approach to software development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. The core principle of agile is to move quickly and deliver great value to customers through iterative development and faster feedback loops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:52">[00:52:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. Scrum, a popular [[product_management_methodologies | Product Management methodologies]] within agile, breaks work into short "sprints" (typically two weeks) to produce potentially shippable product increments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.

Crucially, the agile manifesto and early Scrum Guide did not explicitly define a "product manager" role as understood in software-native companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. The product owner role in Scrum was primarily to help developers prioritize work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>.

## Why Companies Adopt SAFe/Agile

Many large companies adopt frameworks like SAFe or Scrum because they traditionally did not grow up building software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>. They seek to [[implementing_technical_and_cultural_practices_for_efficient_software_development | Implement technical and cultural practices for efficient software development]] at scale and find the prescriptive nature of SAFe appealing, as it provides a seemingly ready-made "plug-and-play" solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:43">[00:36:43]</a>. This is particularly true for organizations like banks, insurance companies, or pharmaceutical companies undergoing digital transformations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:46">[00:39:46]</a>.

## Recommendations for Digital/Agile Transformations

Instead of rigidly adopting frameworks, companies should develop a comprehensive product operating model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:36">[00:41:36]</a>. This includes:
1.  **Product Strategy**: Defining a clear strategy that connects product goals back to overall business objectives and value creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:54">[00:41:54]</a>.
2.  **Organizational Design**: Structuring teams around products, ensuring proper coverage and skilled product managers across all levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:08">[00:42:08]</a>.
3.  **Product Operations**: Building infrastructure to support teams, such as providing access to data for decision-making and enabling direct customer interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:21">[00:42:21]</a>.
4.  **Culture and Incentives**: Aligning company culture and reward systems to outcomes (value delivery) rather than just output (shipping features) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:58">[00:42:58]</a>. Transparency in roadmaps and progress is crucial for large organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:06">[00:44:06]</a>.

## The Importance of Skilled Leadership

Successful transformations require strong product leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:38">[00:52:38]</a>. This means bringing in experienced product people who understand how to run large-scale technology organizations and can define roles and responsibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>. Companies can train existing staff, but it's vital to intersperse experienced product leaders who can mentor and set an example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:39">[00:53:39]</a>. A Chief Product Officer (CPO) is essential at the C-suite level to drive software strategy and integrate it with overall business strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:55">[01:21:55]</a>.

## Product Owner vs. Product Manager

The key difference lies in scope and strategic involvement.
*   **Product Owner**: Focuses on managing the development backlog, writing user stories, and overseeing sprints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:45">[01:04:45]</a>. This role is inherently tactical and process-oriented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:03">[01:05:03]</a>.
*   **Product Manager**: A product manager is responsible for understanding the customer, conducting market research, testing hypotheses, defining feature direction, and measuring success based on business outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:07">[01:05:07]</a>. This role is strategic, focusing on *what* to build and *why* it's valuable to the customer and the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:14">[01:05:14]</a>.

For product owners seeking to become product managers, it's advised to take ownership of understanding customer needs, engaging in discovery, and connecting their work to business goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:59">[00:57:59]</a>. They should ask leaders about their career path and try to participate in customer research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:47">[00:58:47]</a>. Resumes should focus on value delivered and metrics moved, not just agile processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:26">[01:03:26]</a>.

Certification for product owners (e.g., CSPO) is often a quick, two-day class that doesn't guarantee job readiness or full product management skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:38">[01:07:38]</a>. While some companies may require them, top tech companies prioritize experience over certifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:28">[01:10:28]</a>.

## Agile Principles as a Guide

When considering [[product_management_methodologies | agile methodologies]], the core idea is to move quickly and deliver great value to customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:32">[01:17:32]</a>. Adopting a rigid, dogmatic approach, as seen with some interpretations of SAFe or Scrum, can be counterproductive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:42">[01:17:42]</a>. The Agile Manifesto principle of "inspect and adapt" means continuously evaluating processes and changing them if they are not serving the company, culture, or customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:07">[01:20:07]</a>.

Ultimately, while large, non-software native companies face [[challenges_in_agile_transformations_within_nonsoftware_native_companies | Challenges in agile transformations within nonsoftware native companies]] compared to Silicon Valley startups, it is possible to build great products consistently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:50">[01:20:50]</a>. Success comes from learning from established software companies, adapting principles to one's unique context, and ensuring that software strategy is deeply integrated into the overall business strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:04">[01:21:04]</a>. The goal is to continuously deliver customer value and maintain competitiveness, not just to follow a framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:11">[01:21:11]</a>.

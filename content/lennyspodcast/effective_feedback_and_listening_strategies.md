Effective communication, especially in challenging situations like layoffs or when dealing with strong emotions, is a cornerstone of strong leadership. Executive coach Matt Mohari emphasizes the importance of personalized, empathetic approaches to feedback and listening to foster trust and facilitate emotional processing.

## The Importance of Personalized Communication
A key differentiator between a "botched" and a "successful" layoff is how the news is delivered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. When an individual learns they no longer have a job directly from their manager in a one-on-one setting, the outcome tends to be manageable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. In contrast, hearing the news via email, group chat, or in a public setting is "terrible" and often leads to significant anger and public backlash, as it feels dehumanizing and lacks courtesy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Group settings also prevent individuals from expressing their emotions freely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This highlights the [[importance_of_giving_and_receiving_feedback | importance of personalized feedback]] and creating space for emotional responses.

## Giving Feedback Effectively

One of Matt Mohari's key [[techniques_for_effective_feedback_and_communication | techniques for effective feedback]] involves understanding how to deliver difficult messages without triggering defensiveness.

### The "I Statement" Approach for Emotional Feedback
Matt learned from his wife how to effectively communicate when he was in a state of anger or fear. Initial attempts like "you're in anger" or "are you in anger" were ineffective, making him feel accused or leading to more anger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>. The breakthrough came with the phrase: "I perceive you to be in anger" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>.

This [[effective_feedback_and_apology_structures | "I statement"]] is effective because:
*   It's a "first-person" statement, describing the speaker's perception rather than making an accusation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>.
*   It frames the observation as a perception, removing judgment and allowing the feedback to "punch through" the recipient's emotional state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>.
*   It allows the recipient to become aware of their emotion and take a moment to shift out of it before acting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>.
*   Matt notes that anger is often a cover for pain, which the brain externalizes, damaging relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>. The ideal goal is for individuals to allow themselves to feel the underlying pain, rather than pushing it onto others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>.

## Strategies for Making People Feel Heard

Making others feel heard is a crucial [[the_art_and_importance_of_listening_for_leaders | leadership skill]] that goes beyond just listening. Matt offers several tactical approaches:

### 1. Written Acknowledgment
In group settings, instead of verbalizing opinions one by one, Matt suggests having everyone write down their solutions for five minutes and then dropping them into a document <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:20">[00:32:20]</a>. When reading, acknowledge each contribution by name (e.g., "Thank you Lenny") to show that their input has been seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:33">[00:32:33]</a>.

### 2. Verbal Repetition
To ensure full understanding, ask the person to share their thoughts verbally and then repeat it back to them: "Lenny, I think what I heard you say is [restate their point], is that right?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:41">[00:32:41]</a>. Continue this until they confirm your understanding, ensuring they know you've grasped their message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:53">[00:32:53]</a>.

### 3. Reflecting Unspoken Thoughts and Emotions
For deeper understanding, especially when receiving feedback, reflect back what you *imagine* are the unspoken thoughts or emotions the person might be holding back due to fear of hurting feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:02">[00:33:02]</a>. For example, "Lenny, I think what I'm hearing you say is you're pissed off and you're thinking 'screw you Matt, how dare you walk into the office and not even say hello to me.' Is that close?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:34">[00:33:34]</a>.

Often, people will confirm that your reflection of their thoughts is "stronger than what I was thinking, but directionally that's right," which means "yeah, that's what I was thinking." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:53">[00:33:53]</a> This makes them feel truly heard, acknowledging their full internal experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:07">[00:34:07]</a>.

### Acting on Feedback
Once someone feels heard, the process isn't complete. You must then:
1.  **Decide to accept or not accept the feedback:** If accepting, clearly state what actions you will take <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:16">[00:34:16]</a>.
2.  **Explain if not accepting:** If you cannot accept the feedback, explain your perspective and context so they can understand why, potentially shifting their initial feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:25">[00:34:25]</a>.

## Preparing for Difficult Conversations
When initiating a difficult conversation, Matt advises starting by telling the person it will be difficult and giving them a few seconds to mentally prepare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>. This reduces the element of surprise, which often triggers fear and can cause the brain to shut down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:16">[00:30:16]</a>. After delivering the news, actively invite them to share their emotions (e.g., "My guess is you're feeling a lot of anger right now, fear, sadness. Is that true? And if so, would you be willing to share with me what you're feeling and what you're thinking?") and then actively listen to make them feel heard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:09">[00:31:09]</a>. Sitting with their pain, rather than trying to escape it, helps them through the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:37">[00:31:37]</a>.

## Learning and Practicing These Skills
Matt believes that individuals don't necessarily need a coach to implement these [[developing_leadership_skills_and_understanding_feedback | leadership skills]]. His methodologies, including step-by-step scripts for difficult conversations or making someone feel heard, are publicly available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:11">[00:35:11]</a>. He suggests that once someone follows a script and experiences its effectiveness, the positive outcome becomes the primary motivation to continue practicing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:32">[00:35:32]</a>. His ultimate goal in systematizing his coaching advice is to make himself unnecessary, empowering individuals to implement these strategies on their own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:40">[00:36:40]</a>.

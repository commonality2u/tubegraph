Shas Doshi, in a live podcast recording, shared three pivotal questions—plus a bonus—he wished he had asked himself earlier in his career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:00:22]</a>. These [[career_advice_and_frameworks | reflective questions]] served as crucial tools for self-assessment, enabling him to navigate challenges and achieve greater satisfaction in his roles as a product leader. He emphasizes the need for honest self-reflection, even when the answers are uncomfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

## Why Am I So Busy?

Shas noted that for about 16-17 years of his 20-year product career, he was constantly stressed and dissatisfied due to feeling overwhelmed by busyness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. While common productivity tips and tools are useful, they often fail to address the fundamental issue for senior product leaders: an ever-growing scope of responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

### The Illusion of Efficiency and The Problem of Scope
Traditional productivity hacks are often seen as the answer to busyness, but Shas argues they eventually "peter out" when the scope of work becomes too large <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. For instance, annual planning processes, often lasting four to six weeks, consume immense time with spreadsheets, meetings, and stakeholder management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. Despite the effort, these plans often become irrelevant within weeks due to new customer escalations and shifting priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. The common adage, "Plans are useless but planning is everything," is often misunderstood and can contribute to this cycle of unproductive busyness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>.

### The Solution: A Real Product Strategy
Shas discovered that having a "real product strategy" — one that is compelling, cohesive, and has pre-alignment from all stakeholders — can drastically reduce the time spent on planning from weeks to days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>. This strategy provides a rigorous framework for prioritization and handling escalations, making many "nonsense" activities of annual planning unnecessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>.

### The Deeper Problem: Poor Product Decisions
Beyond planning, Shas realized his busyness stemmed from not making good product decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>. Often, product teams make quick decisions on new features without thoroughly considering customer motivation, differentiation, or distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>. The misguided belief that a decision is a "two-way door" (easily reversible) often leads to committing to features that require significant time and resources, ultimately leading to more work and frustration when they don't perform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>. For a PM leader, most seemingly "two-way doors" are actually "one-way doors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>.

A tactical tip is to "pause for two minutes, or two days, or two weeks" before making a decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:52">[00:23:52]</a>. More "thinking is cheap" and can prevent accumulating "debt" from poorly conceived features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:37">[00:25:37]</a>.

## Do I Actually Have Good Taste?

This question forced Shas to confront his deeply held beliefs about product strategy and execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:53">[00:25:53]</a>. Early in his career at Google, he adopted the prevailing belief that "strategy is for MBAs," and "execution is everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:36">[00:26:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>.

### From Execution to Strategy
It was at Twitter, post-IPO, that he realized the company's struggles stemmed from a lack of a real, compelling product strategy, despite having incredible assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:13">[00:28:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:26">[00:28:26]</a>. This experience, further solidified at Stripe, made him realize that strategy was not useless, but profoundly important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:05">[00:29:05]</a>.

### Redefining "Taste"
Shas argues that "taste" in a product leader is more than just appreciating design aesthetics ("beautiful pixels") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:32">[00:29:32]</a>. It's about the "ability to identify what is really good without needing to see its results" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:41">[00:31:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:06">[00:32:06]</a>. True taste means recognizing potential *before* success is obvious, similar to how "game recognizes game" in sports *before* the match is called <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:53">[00:32:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:05">[00:33:05]</a>. He cautions against becoming a "stuff grader" who critiques everything, as that requires "zero taste" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:38">[00:33:38]</a>.

He emphasizes developing taste in the "beliefs we choose to create within ourselves" as leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:05">[00:30:05]</a>. This includes being able to evaluate ideas separate from catchy metaphors (e.g., "two-way door" vs. "reversible decisions"), alliterations (e.g., "fail fast" vs. "fail quickly"), or complicated charts that aren't fully understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:06">[00:34:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:04">[00:35:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:05">[00:36:05]</a>. This [[analyzing_candidate_introspection_and_selfawareness | critical thinking]] and shedding of social and authority proofs is crucial for [[career_development_and_growth_strategies | growth as a product leader]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:08">[00:37:08]</a>.

## Why Does My Job Feel So Frustrating?

Despite loving his PM leadership job, Shas experienced daily frustrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:20">[00:38:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:44">[00:38:44]</a>. He realized this often stemmed from behaving "in misalignment with our superpowers and who we truly are at our core" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:19">[00:39:19]</a>.

### The Three Levels of Product Work
Shas identifies three levels of product work:
*   **Impact:** Focusing on the ultimate outcome and value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:59">[00:39:59]</a>.
*   **Execution:** Managing the day-to-day building and delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:02">[00:40:02]</a>.
*   **Optics:** Managing perceptions, presentations, and corporate appearances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:04">[00:40:04]</a>.

Frustration arises when one is forced to operate predominantly at a level that is not their "happy place" or "default level" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:16">[00:40:16]</a>. As leaders advance, they often have to spend more time on "Optics," which can be draining even with willpower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:50">[00:40:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:10">[00:41:10]</a>.

### Aligning with Superpowers and Being True to Oneself
The solution for Shas was to "abandon the traditional path" and choose roles that aligned with his preferred level of operation (Impact, in his case) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:28">[00:41:28]</a>. This meant being content with managing a smaller team size (e.g., 50 people) to avoid being forced into excessive "Optics" work that caused frustration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:51">[00:41:51]</a>. His suggestion is to "identify your superpowers" and operate your career "not out of expectation, not out of envy" (like "LinkedIn Envy") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:37">[00:42:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:55">[00:42:55]</a>. By doing so, one will do their best work, love it, and avoid the frustration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:09">[00:43:09]</a>. This self-awareness contributes to [[building_a_long_and_meaningful_career | building a long and meaningful career]] and [[career_transition_advice_and_mentorship | career transition advice and mentorship]] by prioritizing personal alignment over external expectations.

## Bonus Question: Am I Really Listening?

Shas considers this the hardest question, as he initially believed he was a good listener by merely recapping and making eye contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:42">[00:43:42]</a>. He realized there is an "entirely other level to listening" that is essential for becoming a "world-class leader" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:56">[00:43:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:03">[00:44:03]</a>. He suggests exploring the insights of Rick Rubin, Dee Hock, and Peter Drucker on this topic to understand this deeper form of listening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:23">[00:44:23]</a>.

Dharmesh Shah, co-founder and CTO of HubSpot, offers a unique and often contrarian perspective on [[cultural_practices_in_rapidly_scaling_companies | building and scaling a company's culture]]. His approach, rooted in a systematic, data-driven mindset and a willingness to challenge conventional wisdom, has shaped HubSpot into a 7,000-plus employee public company while maintaining an entrepreneurial spirit.

## [[cultural_practices_in_rapidly_scaling_companies | Defining and Evolving Culture]]

Shah's involvement with culture at HubSpot began about three or four years into the company's journey, when his co-founder suggested it was "really important" and asked him to "go do that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:02">[01:16:02]</a>. Initially reluctant due to his self-professed dislike of "being around people a whole lot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:58">[01:16:58]</a>, Shah interpreted the task not as *creating* culture, but as *articulating* the existing one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:41">[01:17:41]</a>.

### [[Building a productfocused company culture | Culture as a Product]]

Shah's core philosophy is that "culture is a product" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:28">[01:21:28]</a>. He posits that every company builds two products: one for its customers and one for its team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:31">[01:21:31]</a>. If this holds true, then just as product development involves customer feedback and iteration, so too should culture.

HubSpot actively manages its culture as a product:
*   **Customer Feedback:** They conduct quarterly NPS (Net Promoter Score) surveys, asking employees how likely they are to recommend HubSpot as a place to work, and crucially, *why* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:07">[01:22:07]</a>.
*   **Transparency:** Every survey response is published internally, including the score and subjective comments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:25">[01:23:25]</a>.
*   **"Bugs" and Iteration:** At All Hands meetings, feedback (termed "bugs" in the culture product) is categorized and addressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:49">[01:23:49]</a>. Some "bugs" are committed to be fixed, while others are acknowledged as "works as designed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:02">[01:24:02]</a>.
*   **Continuous Improvement:** The goal is not to "preserve the culture," but to iterate on it, as the needs of employees change with company scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:53">[01:22:53]</a>.

## [[using_operating_principles_to_guide_company_culture | Core Principles and Operating Systems]]

HubSpot's culture is guided by several deeply embedded principles:

### Fighting Complexity (Second Law of Thermodynamics)

Shah believes that "every leader and every business is fighting the second law of thermodynamics," also known as entropy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. This law states that "within a closed system entropy increases over time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:43">[00:37:43]</a>, meaning "unless you intervene, everything goes to crap" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:06">[00:38:06]</a>. Companies, like physical systems, tend towards disorder and complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:03">[00:39:03]</a>.

![](.attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240723143922.png)
*   **Stages of a Company:**
    1.  **Fighting to survive:** Trying not to die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:41">[00:38:41]</a>.
    2.  **Fighting stagnation:** Driving growth to avoid eventual death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:50">[00:38:50]</a>.
    3.  **Fighting complexity:** Avoiding crumbling under one's own weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:01">[00:39:01]</a>.
*   **"Fight for Simplicity":** HubSpot's operating principle is "fight for simplicity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:53">[00:39:53]</a>. This means simplicity is important, but also that it requires active effort because "the universe is working against you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:07">[00:40:07]</a>.
*   **Systematic Constraints:** Implementing systematic "guardrails and constraints" is more effective than just verbalizing principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:51">[00:44:51]</a>.

### Balancing Core Values with Group Autonomy

HubSpot balances "federal laws" (core company values) with "state laws" (autonomy for individual groups) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:57">[01:26:57]</a>. While core values like transparency endure, other practices can be adapted by teams to optimize for their specific needs, such as a support organization needing fixed hours of operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:53">[01:27:53]</a>.

### Aspirational vs. Current Culture

When creating the first public version of HubSpot's "Culture Code" deck, Shah included things that were not yet fully true, labeling them as aspirations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:26">[01:29:26]</a>. He found that these aspirations became "increasingly true by virtue of being in the deck," as new hires would treat them as the existing culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:43">[01:29:43]</a>.

## [[Building a culture of speed and optimism | Unique Cultural Practices at HubSpot]]

HubSpot employs several distinctive practices that stem from its core cultural principles:

*   **No Direct Reports for Dharmesh Shah:** Shah has never had a direct report in his 18 years at HubSpot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>, a decision made early on because he admits he "suck[s] at management" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:11">[01:17:11]</a>. This allows him to "get all the upside of scale" without the downsides of managing people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:17">[01:18:17]</a>.
*   **No Meetings Before 11 AM (Initially):** In the early years, the co-founders, being "night people," implemented a rule of no meetings before 11 AM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:30">[01:19:30]</a>. This rule later evolved to allow meetings before 11 AM as long as a co-founder wasn't invited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:41">[01:19:41]</a>.
*   **Flat Salaries:** At the beginning, everyone, including the co-founders, was paid a flat salary of $5,000 a month for about the first year and a half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:56">[00:32:56]</a>. This fostered simplicity and avoided complex compensation structures early on.
*   **No Titles (Initially):** To embody a flat organization, HubSpot initially had no titles for anyone in the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:21">[00:30:21]</a>. This was later changed to classic titles when it became apparent that titles served as a "signaling device" for career progression, especially for external opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:09">[00:31:09]</a>.
*   **Seating Lottery:** In their first office, HubSpot used a lottery system to assign seats, ensuring fairness and avoiding "office politics" around desirable spots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:25">[00:35:25]</a>. This practice, with slight optimizations, continued for hundreds of people and eliminated "incalculable" grief over office space hierarchy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:09">[00:36:09]</a>.
*   **Radical Transparency:** From day one, almost all information within HubSpot was shared equally with everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:03">[00:25:03]</a>. When going public, HubSpot designated every single employee as a "designated insider" to maintain this transparency, as there was no legal limit to the number of insiders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:43">[00:26:43]</a>.
*   **Flash Tags for Communication:** To address the "megaphone issue" where a leader's casual opinion is taken as a mandate, Shah developed "Flash Tags" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:59">[00:57:59]</a>. These are specific hashtags (e.g., #FYI, #suggestion, #recommendation, #plea) used in communication, particularly email, to indicate the weight and expected response level of a message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:45">[00:58:45]</a>. Notably, there is no "mandate" tag, reflecting a culture of autonomy and trust in employees to make decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:20">[01:01:20]</a>.
*   **Decision-Making: Debate, Decide, Unite:** HubSpot's decision-making framework is "Debate, Decide, Unite" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:17">[01:04:17]</a>. This is a softer version of Amazon's "disagree and commit," emphasizing open discussion, clear decision-making by a designated responsible individual (DRI), and then unified support for the chosen path, even by those who initially disagreed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:25">[01:04:25]</a>. Shah also suggests a "systematic" approach to decisions, imagining a Python function or Excel spreadsheet to identify and rank influencing factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>.

## [[creating_an_entrepreneurial_culture_within_an_organization | Cultivating Entrepreneurial Spirit and Learning]]

Shah emphasizes leaning into strengths and a willingness to "zig when other people are zagging" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:37">[01:38:37]</a>.

*   **Leaning into Strengths:** Instead of spending years becoming "passively okay at management," Shah chose to focus on areas he enjoys and excels at <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:20">[01:19:20]</a>. This philosophy extends to the company, where individuals are encouraged to align their roles with their natural talents.
*   **Contrarian Bets:** HubSpot made early high-conviction, low-consensus bets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:47">[00:28:47]</a>:
    *   **SMB Focus:** While conventional wisdom suggested focusing on Enterprise software, HubSpot chose to target small and medium businesses (SMBs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:14">[00:29:14]</a>. Despite initial investor skepticism, this allowed for faster feedback loops, no revenue concentration, and the ability to experiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:57">[00:47:57]</a>. Shah notes that "reverse gravity" in software often pulls companies upmarket, leading many to become Enterprise companies, thus leaving the SMB space less crowded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:07">[00:49:07]</a>.
    *   **All-in-One Product Strategy:** Contrary to advice for startups to "focus on one thing and be really... world-class" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>, HubSpot from day one built a broad suite of tools (SEO, web analytics, blogging, CRM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:45">[00:51:45]</a>. The "zig" was to solve the complete customer problem for SMBs who struggled to integrate disparate tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:10">[00:52:10]</a>. A humorous internal heuristic was to ensure they weren't in the "top three" in any single product category, as their value was in the all-in-one integration, not individual best-of-breed features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:16">[00:53:16]</a>.
*   **Learning in Public:** Shah is a strong advocate for learning in public, as exemplified by releasing the Culture Code deck and his AI explorations with ChatSpot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:37">[01:38:37]</a>. He believes this generates valuable feedback and accelerates learning, as "the internet is exactly good at telling you why you're an idiot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:52">[01:38:52]</a>.
*   **Idea Evaluation Framework:** When deciding what ideas are "worth investing in," Shah uses a framework based on four factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:05">[01:10:05]</a>:
    1.  **Potential:** The magnitude of the outcome if successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:37">[01:10:37]</a>.
    2.  **Probability of Success:** The likelihood of achieving that outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:52">[01:10:52]</a>. (Crucially, evaluate potential *before* probability to avoid prematurely discarding high-impact, low-probability ideas) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>.
    3.  **Passion:** How much one cares about solving the problem or working on the idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:36">[01:12:36]</a>.
    4.  **Prowess:** Unique assets or an "unfair advantage" that makes one uniquely positioned for success (e.g., existing code, market access) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:52">[01:12:52]</a>.

Dharmesh Shah's approach to [[building_and_scaling_product_innovations | building and scaling]] a company's culture is deeply analytical yet highly human-centric, viewing culture as a dynamic, evolving product that requires continuous feedback, iteration, and a steadfast commitment to core principles, even when they challenge industry norms. His definition of success is "making the people who believed in you look brilliant" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:34">[01:39:34]</a>.

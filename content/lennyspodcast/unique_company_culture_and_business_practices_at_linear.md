Linear, founded in 2019, is a project and issue tracking system specifically designed for software companies and technical teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. Co-founder and CEO Karri Saarinen, previously a founding designer at Coinbase and principal designer at [[lessons_from_airbnbs_company_culture_and_growth | Airbnb]], explains that Linear was created to address the clunky and complex nature of existing project management tools, aiming for a frictionless and streamlined experience for modern software development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. The company has achieved profitability for the last two years and boasts a "net negative lifetime burn rate," meaning they have more cash in the bank than they've raised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

Linear's success is attributed to its distinct approach to product development, team building, growth, and overall [[building_and_maintaining_company_culture | company culture]].

## Product Development Philosophy

Linear operates with a strong emphasis on craft, quality, and a unique "Linear method."

### Craft and Quality
Linear places a "huge focus on Craft and quality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. This focus is driven by the belief that collaboration thrives when products are frictionless and don't create "paper cuts" for users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. The founders, including engineers, share a deep appreciation for detail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.

Instead of A/B tests or metric-based goals, Linear prioritizes taste and opinions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Quality starts with hiring people who care about craft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. While quality can sometimes push timelines, it's typically by days, not by requiring complete reworks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

A key strategy for maintaining quality while moving fast is:
*   **Early Internal Releases:** Features are often shipped to production, visible only internally, very early in the development process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. This allows the team to realize how the product *should* work by building it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.
*   **Customer Beta Programs:** After internal testing, features are released to a small group of customers who opt into a beta program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. During these stages, the experience might be "janky or not that polished," but the team is transparent that it's not finished and seeks early feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.
*   **Final Polish for General Release:** Only when a feature is ready for general release is significant attention paid to polish and craft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.

Design is seen as a crucial differentiator, especially in crowded markets where many choices exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:04">[00:25:04]</a>. High-level design from the beginning is now a basic requirement for startups to be taken seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:48">[00:26:48]</a>. Design and brand act as powerful forces that draw people to a company and its product, setting expectations for quality even before use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:54">[00:27:54]</a>.

### The Linear Method
The "Linear Method" outlines the company's approach to building software, focusing on opinionated design and consistent cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:41">[00:38:41]</a>.

*   **Opinionated Software:** Linear believes productivity software, especially for companies, should be opinionated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:37">[00:39:37]</a>. This means providing good defaults and clear workflows, so users and teams don't waste time figuring out how a feature works in multiple ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:27">[00:40:27]</a>. The goal is to design "something for someone," optimizing for a specific, best solution rather than a generalized one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:47">[00:40:47]</a>.
*   **Cycles:** Cycles are an optional but encouraged way for teams to focus on priorities for a defined period (e.g., one or two weeks) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:25">[00:41:25]</a>. This helps teams concentrate on selected tasks and avoid getting distracted by an "infinite list of things to do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:53">[00:41:53]</a>. Cycles are similar to sprints but emphasize continuous improvement rather than just speed, and they run on an automated schedule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:57">[00:42:57]</a>.

### Decision-Making
Linear doesn't rely on A/B testing or specific metric goals for features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:46">[00:36:46]</a>. While they track company-level goals like weekly active users, feature-specific metrics are avoided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:41">[00:43:41]</a>. The belief is that a complex system used by diverse companies shouldn't be optimized by isolated metrics; instead, the focus is on solving problems, and success is measured by whether customers agree the problem is solved and enjoy the solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:02">[00:44:02]</a>.

This approach is described as a mixture of "magic and science" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:34">[00:45:34]</a>:
*   **Science (User Understanding):** The team extensively talks to users, conducts user research for new projects, and encourages everyone to engage directly with customers (e.g., on Slack channels) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:59">[00:45:59]</a>. This ensures a deep understanding of customer problems and product performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:31">[00:46:31]</a>.
*   **Magic (Intuition and Informed Decisions):** With a shared, deep understanding of customers and the product, the team can use intuition and informed judgment to make decisions, rather than relying solely on data to back them up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:41">[00:47:41]</a>. This approach requires comfort with making mistakes and quickly fixing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:51">[00:49:51]</a>.

## Team and Organizational Structure

Linear emphasizes a lean, high-caliber team structure to foster ownership and quality.

### Minimal Product Managers
Linear operates with only one product manager, who serves as the head of product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. This decision was made when the product and team grew to a point where alignment and tracking became challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>. The Head of Product's role is to define the product's direction and help teams align, not to be in every meeting or write every spec <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>. Karri anticipates hiring more PMs in the future as the company and product grow, but they will operate at a higher level, focusing on specific areas or customer types, rather than day-to-day management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a>.

### Project Team Ownership
Without a large product management layer, many responsibilities traditionally held by PMs are distributed to engineers and designers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>. This requires engineers and designers to spend time thinking about problems and scope, not just executing code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:29">[00:19:29]</a>. Every project has a "Project Lead," who can be an engineer or a designer, responsible for starting the project, collaborating with the team, and communicating progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>. This ownership allows teams to identify and implement quality improvements, such as an engineer proactively creating "safe areas" for mouse navigation in a right-click menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>. This structure fosters a strong sense of ownership and allows for spontaneous quality improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>.

## [[hiring_and_team_management_innovations_at_linear | Hiring Practices]]

Linear takes a highly deliberate and slow approach to hiring, believing that "you can actually build better with less people than you can with more people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:47">[00:57:47]</a>. The company never more than doubled in size in a year, prioritizing quality over rapid expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:09">[00:58:09]</a>.

### What Linear Looks For
When [[hiring_and_team_management_innovations_at_linear | hiring]], Linear seeks candidates who are "more than their title" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:03">[01:00:03]</a>. This includes:
*   **Taste and Product Sensibility:** Candidates should have opinions about products, understand how they work, and be able to articulate why certain choices are better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:56">[00:58:56]</a>. This is tested by asking candidates about their past projects, probing decisions made, and asking if they would have done things differently, requiring rational, context-based reasoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:05">[01:07:05]</a>.
*   **Broader Perspective/Scope:** They look for individuals interested in a broader scope than just their specific skill set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:28">[00:20:28]</a>. This enables people to pick up tasks outside their defined role, fostering a collaborative environment where phrases like "it's not my job" are rare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:08">[01:00:08]</a>. This creates a "smaller units but more effective units" structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:31">[00:24:31]</a>.
*   **Ownership:** The goal is to have fewer hierarchical levels, allowing people to own more areas from the start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:39">[01:01:39]</a>.

### Paid Work Trial
Linear utilizes a unique "paid work trial" as the final step in its interview process for all employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:28">[01:02:28]</a>.
*   Candidates are given a vague problem statement (e.g., "build this feature") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:02">[01:03:02]</a>.
*   They must understand the problem, scope it, and then build a version of it, gaining access to Linear's codebase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:14">[01:03:14]</a>.
*   At the end, they present their work and reasoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:28">[01:03:28]</a>.
*   This trial allows both the company to assess how a candidate operates in their environment and for the candidate to understand the company culture and work style, including seeing the codebase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:33">[01:03:33]</a>.
*   Candidates join meetings, get access to internal tools (Slack, Notion), and have one-on-one chats with team members, providing a comprehensive view of what they are "signing off for" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:32">[01:05:32]</a>. Linear works with candidates to schedule these trials around their availability, with very few declining the opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:59">[01:04:59]</a>.

## Growth and Product-Market Fit

Linear's growth has been organic and highly focused, prioritizing deep product-market fit within specific segments.

### Early Launch and Waitlist
*   After a few months of prototyping and building the core system (April 2019), Linear launched a website with a waitlist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:27">[01:09:27]</a>.
*   Founders, with existing followings on platforms like Twitter, announced the company, quickly attracting around 4,000 people to the waitlist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:35">[01:11:35]</a>.
*   The waitlist included a survey asking about current tools used, company size, and interest, allowing Linear to selectively invite smaller companies using supported tools who showed genuine interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:17">[01:10:17]</a>.

### Cohort-Based Private Beta
*   Linear remained in private beta for almost a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:07">[01:10:07]</a>.
*   Initially, invites were sent manually, with Karri personally reviewing survey responses, sending invites, and following up for feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:48">[01:12:48]</a>.
*   They invited people in small "cohorts" (e.g., 10 people a week, gradually increasing) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:06">[01:13:06]</a>. This prevented everyone from hitting the same early-stage bugs and problems simultaneously, allowing the team to fix issues identified by one cohort before inviting the next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:18">[01:13:18]</a>. This was deemed a more effective way to develop the product initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:06">[01:14:06]</a>.

### Pricing Experimentation and Public Launch
*   During the private beta, Linear introduced an optional payment function with a "sliding scale" where users could choose how much to pay per seat (e.g., $1 to $28) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>. While not providing enough data to set a definitive price, it confirmed that users were willing to pay, with some even opting for the maximum amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:49">[01:15:49]</a>.
*   A year after starting, in June, Linear launched publicly with a defined pricing model, and almost all existing beta companies converted to paying customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:42">[01:10:42]</a>.

### Product-Market Fit as a Spectrum
Karri views product-market fit not as a binary state, but as a spectrum, strong within certain customer segments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:07">[01:19:07]</a>.
*   Early on, they felt strong product-market fit with smaller, early-stage companies, especially those whose founders were still deeply involved in product development and valued speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:51">[01:16:51]</a>.
*   The initial goal was to become the "default for startups" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:18">[01:18:18]</a>.
*   More recently, the focus has shifted to strengthening product-market fit for larger companies with hundreds or thousands of employees, recognizing that their current solution might not be a perfect fit for a Fortune 500 company today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:41">[01:18:41]</a>.
*   This strategy involves "doubling down" on categories where they see strong pull, like the current trend of AI companies using Linear, similar to how Zoom focused on universities in its early days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:21">[01:20:21]</a>.

## Company Culture

Linear fosters a remote, focused, and respectful [[building_and_maintaining_a_company_culture | company culture]].

### Focus and "Main Quest"
Karri emphasizes extreme focus, comparing it to an RPG game's "main quest lines" versus "side quest lines" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:42">[00:55:42]</a>.
*   Inspired by Y Combinator's advice to focus on "talk to customers, build the product, exercise" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:50">[00:53:50]</a>.
*   This principle helps avoid "shiny objects" and unnecessary tasks (like getting a SOC 2 certificate too early, or making t-shirts) that don't directly progress the "main quest line" of building an awesome product for customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:13">[00:55:13]</a>.
*   The key question is: "Is this important to do now or is it important to maybe do later?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:49">[00:54:49]</a>.

### Remote Work and Team Building
As a fully remote and distributed company, Linear has found creative ways to build team cohesion across time zones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:17">[01:25:17]</a>.
*   **Baking/Cooking Competitions:** Inspired by "The Great British Baking Show," the team holds quarterly baking or cooking sessions over Zoom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:44">[01:25:44]</a>. Participants receive a company card to buy ingredients, follow a chosen recipe (e.g., roll cake, pastel de nata), troubleshoot together, and share photos of their creations on Slack for friendly competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:12">[01:26:12]</a>. This activity reinforces the value of craft, even if it's "not necessarily about the taste or the texture" remotely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:22">[01:27:22]</a>.

### Respect for People and Things
Karri's personal motto, "go slow to go fast," reflects Linear's deliberate approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:04">[01:36:04]</a>. It's about taking the time to think through actions rather than rushing and having to fix mistakes later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:23">[01:36:23]</a>. This aligns with a broader value of respecting people and things, emphasizing taking good care of tools and resources for future use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:48">[01:36:48]</a>.

## The Future

Linear is continuously improving its product. A new feature called "Asks" is being developed to streamline interactions between product teams and other company functions (e.g., IT, infrastructure) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:35">[01:30:35]</a>. This Slack-integrated feature allows non-Linear users to make requests and receive updates without ever needing to use the Linear app, making product operations more accessible to the entire company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:39">[01:31:39]</a>.

Karri's journey from IC designer to CEO has highlighted the wide range of responsibilities and learning opportunities in a leadership role, from product to financials and legal matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:48">[01:28:48]</a>. He emphasizes that hiring and delegation are key to managing this diverse scope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:52">[01:29:52]</a>.

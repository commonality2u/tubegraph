Strategy is fundamentally a design for overcoming a high-stakes challenge, combining policy and action to address an issue, whether it's an opportunity or a negative development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. The word "strategy" originates from the Greek *stratos*, referring to elected strategic leaders in Athens who dealt with issues of the day like invasions or plagues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. Richard Rumelt, author of *Good Strategy Bad Strategy* and *The Crux*, is considered a legend in the world of strategy, having consulted for companies like Microsoft, Apple, and Intel, and government organizations such as the US Army Special Operations Command <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

## What is Strategy?

A strategy is about dealing with an issue, challenge, or problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. It's not merely an analytical tool, but a way of making sense of and acting on a situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

### The Kernel of Good Strategy
Richard Rumelt identifies three essential components that form the "kernel" of a good strategy <a class="yt-0-26-28">[00:26:28]</a>:
1.  **Diagnosis:** This involves understanding the situation and the nature of the challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. It's a deliberate decision about what to focus attention on, forming hypotheses about how things connect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. The hardest part of strategy is identifying the challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.
2.  **Guiding Policy:** This is the core approach for dealing with the diagnosed situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. It clarifies what actions will be taken and, importantly, what actions will *not* be taken to address the challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.
3.  **Coherent Actions:** These are the specific steps taken that must align with the guiding policy and collectively address the diagnosed problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>. Actions should not contradict each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.

If any of these three elements are missing, it's not truly a strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>. For instance, Microsoft's adaptation to AI involves diagnosing the challenge, creating a guiding policy to invest in major AI leaders, and then executing coherent actions to incorporate AI into products like their search engine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>.

### Calling it an "Action Agenda"
Instead of "strategy," it's often more beneficial to call it an "action agenda" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This emphasizes focusing on one or two key, addressable challenges and the coherent actions to take them on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. An action agenda outlines what will be *done* rather than just stating goals or general missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:36">[01:02:36]</a>. This approach helps avoid the pitfalls of overly complex or vague "strategies" sold by many advisors that focus on missions, visions, and values before any concrete action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:48">[00:58:48]</a>.

## Identifying Bad Strategy
Bad strategy is prevalent because many organizational leaders fail to implement good strategic practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>. Signs of a bad strategy or its absence include:
*   **Abstract Goals:** A common bad strategy for corporations is merely a list of profit or performance goals, which are ambitions, not strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>.
*   **"Word Salad":** Using fancy or abstract words to describe a situation without clear meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>.
*   **Incoherent Actions:** Proposing actions that contradict each other, such as simultaneously trying to increase growth and profit without understanding their potential conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:59">[00:20:59]</a>.
*   **Lack of Diagnosis:** Often, bad strategies skip the crucial diagnosis step, failing to identify *why* a problem exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:18">[00:21:18]</a>. For example, a "strategy" for intelligence agencies to "work together more effectively" without diagnosing *why* coordination is difficult is incomplete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>. Similarly, stating a company wants to "grow faster" isn't a strategy without identifying what's "holding you back" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>.
*   **Mistaking Goals for Strategy:** Confusing high-level ambitions with concrete strategic direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:10">[00:24:10]</a>.

Focus is the fundamental source of power in strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:09">[00:25:09]</a>. Trying to achieve too many disparate things at once leads to diffused efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:37">[00:27:37]</a>.

## The Role of Power and Asymmetry
In a competitive situation, the fundamental aspect of "power" in strategy is something that gives you an advantage, often an asymmetry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:45">[00:28:45]</a>. If competitors are equally balanced, the outcome is 50/50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>. A good strategy exploits some kind of asymmetry to gain an edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:17">[00:29:17]</a>.

### Sources of Power
Sources of power can include:
*   **Being First:** Recognizing something before others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:38">[00:29:38]</a>.
*   **Reputation:** A well-established reputation can be a source of power, as IBM leveraged its respected position with large corporations to serve customers during its turnaround <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:47">[00:29:47]</a>. However, a fixed reputation can also be a hindrance if it limits expectations for new endeavors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:58">[00:29:58]</a>.
*   **Relationships:** Existing connections and networks can provide significant leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:13">[00:30:13]</a>.
*   **Network Effects:** The more users a product has, the more useful it becomes, creating a powerful advantage, as seen with early telephone systems, Microsoft's software, social media platforms, and Amazon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:13">[00:35:13]</a>. This is a dominant game in the tech space, where speed in building a user base is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:16">[00:40:16]</a>. Twitter is cited as an example of how strong network effects can sustain a product despite significant internal changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:26">[00:40:26]</a>.
*   **Data:** For generative AI, the size of the data used for training is suspected to be a key factor in performance, giving larger players like Google an asymmetry in search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:25">[00:38:25]</a>.
*   **Specialization:** Countering market leaders by owning a particular, focused approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:18">[00:39:18]</a>.
*   **Talent Acquisition:** The ability to attract top talent, as seen with companies like OpenAI that can draw the "smartest AI people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:36">[00:33:36]</a>.

To identify sources of power, individuals or companies should look at how they differ from othersâ€”what knowledge, possessions, or capabilities they have that others do not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:52">[00:32:52]</a>. This [[growth_strategies_in_tech_companies | asymmetry]] must be focused on a target that can be affected or achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:01">[00:27:01]</a>.

## Organizational Dynamics and Strategy
One of the biggest challenges to winning strategies is often organizational dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:40]</a>. Complex organizations, especially, struggle to focus energy due to competing interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:08">[00:28:08]</a>.

### Challenges in Large Organizations
*   **Diverse Interests and Agendas:** Within large organizations, different departments or individuals have varying opinions, private interests, and agendas, which can lead to disagreements about priorities and information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:13">[01:14:13]</a>.
*   **Fear of Action and Change:** Implementing a strategy involves people changing what they do and shifting power relationships, which can be challenging and met with hesitancy, even by CEOs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:55">[01:15:55]</a>.
*   **Displacement by "Leadership" Ideals:** The concept of strategy is sometimes displaced by an emphasis on "leadership" that focuses on self-perfection or vision, rather than direct management and concrete directives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:49">[01:16:49]</a>. This can lead to a reluctance to make definitive choices or "tell somebody what to do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:19">[01:17:19]</a>.
*   **Organizational Inertia:** Organizations can become "frozen" due to the difficulty of changing established positions of interest and power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:18">[01:19:18]</a>. Nokia's decline, for example, was partly attributed to a matrix organization that diffused power, making it difficult for anyone to make decisions or respond to new market entrants like Apple's iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:35">[01:19:35]</a>. This illustrates a challenge to [[innovation_within_large_organizations | innovation within large organizations]].

Overcoming these challenges often requires a hierarchy of power where a "decider" can make choices, putting some interests aside to focus on specific actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:06">[01:11:06]</a>. This can be addressed by applying methods to facilitate decision-making, such as "Foundries" where senior executives collaborate to identify and address core problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:01">[01:14:01]</a>.

## Strategy for Startups
For startups, especially those pre-product market fit, strategy involves dealing with high uncertainty and making a "bet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:59">[01:20:59]</a>.

### Pivoting and Adaptation
*   **Iterative Search:** Many successful [[effective_pivot_strategies_for_startups | startups]] initially aim at a particular product-market solution but frequently pivot, adapting their target customer or solution as reality is revealed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:28">[01:22:28]</a>. This process is like a "truffle hunt," requiring both conviction to win and a willingness to shift when things aren't working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>.
*   **Fast Adaptation:** Startups need to be fast and adapt quickly to changing conditions, especially in rapidly evolving technological fields like generative AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:46">[01:25:46]</a>. This contrasts with more stable industries where strategy might not change for years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:27">[01:14:27]</a>. This relates to [[small_team_management_and_operational_efficiency_in_startups | small team management and operational efficiency in startups]].
*   **Focus on Problems:** A startup's "action agenda" should focus on an important and *achievable* problem, making progress on ambitions by addressing their underlying barriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:27">[01:01:27]</a>. This means identifying "value denied"â€”what people *should* be able to buy but cannot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:46">[01:26:46]</a>.

## Cultivating Strategic Insight
Strategic thinking is not a science with fixed equations; it's heavily based on analogy to previous human experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:57">[00:47:57]</a>. To improve strategic thinking, it's vital to:
*   **Study History:** Immerse oneself in business history, biographies, and world history to gain access to diverse experiences and understand how complex situations unfolded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:29">[00:47:29]</a>. By observing historical events like the Great Depression and forming independent opinions, one can develop diagnostic skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:56">[00:50:56]</a>.
*   **Deep Immersion in Problems:** Insight comes from immersing oneself in the nature of a problem, focusing on what makes it difficult, and then seeing a way through it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:24">[01:09:24]</a>. This is akin to finding the "Crux" in mountain climbingâ€”the hardest part that, once overcome, makes the rest easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:01">[01:03:01]</a>.
*   **Question Assumptions:** Continuously ask, "Is there another way to look at this situation?" or "What makes this hard?" to deepen understanding and uncover new solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:17">[00:51:17]</a>.

## Practical Advice for Crafting Strategy
For someone writing a strategy, especially a product manager, the key is to clearly state the problem and frame it as an action agenda:
1.  **State the Problem:** Identify the core challenge you face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:05">[00:58:05]</a>.
2.  **Focus on an Achievable Challenge:** Choose one or two key challenges that are both important and addressable given your resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:39">[01:01:39]</a>.
3.  **Define Coherent Actions:** Outline the specific steps to be taken to address that challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:21">[01:02:21]</a>. These actions should be consistent and mutually reinforcing, not a scattered list of "wishes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:37">[01:02:37]</a>.
4.  **Leverage Asymmetry:** Identify your "power"â€”what makes you different or gives you an edgeâ€”and focus it on the chosen target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:42">[00:26:42]</a>.
5.  **Be a Decider:** In organizations, someone ultimately needs to make choices and direct action, overcoming diverse interests and hesitancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:24">[01:16:24]</a>.

Strategy is not mysterious; it's about solving the most important, addressable problem one faces and being consistent about doing something about it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:20">[01:31:20]</a>.

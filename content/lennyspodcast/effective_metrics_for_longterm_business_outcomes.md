Effective Metrics for Long-Term Business Outcomes
Jessica Lax, Vice President of Analytics and Data Science at DoorDash, emphasizes that analytics should be a business impact-driving function, not merely a service function. For her, it's about finding opportunities and having a point of view on decisions, answering "what do we do now that we know this?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a> She is known for her skill in defining [[metrics_for_measuring_product_success | metrics]] that align incentives and drive desired outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## Core Principles for Choosing Effective Metrics

### 1. Short-Term Metrics Driving Long-Term Outputs
A common pitfall is to set goals on long-term outcomes like retention, which is "a terrible thing to goal on" because it's almost impossible to drive in a meaningful way in the short term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Instead, the focus should be on identifying [[choosing_and_using_north_star_metrics_effectively | short-term metrics]] that act as "proxy metrics for long-term outcomes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:02">[00:55:02]</a>. Through experimentation, teams can then test whether these short-term inputs indeed drive the desired long-term output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:21">[00:45:21]</a>.

### 2. Simplicity and Intuition
Metrics should be simple, even if they aren't "perfect" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:09">[00:46:09]</a>. Complex composite metrics, which often involve weighted coefficients, are hard for people to understand and don't intuitively convey meaning (e.g., "a 0.1 increase is that is a lot, is it good, is bad") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:38">[00:45:38]</a>.
If people understand a metric, have an intuition around it, and can discuss it across the company, it will be much more effective at driving real outcomes than a complex, made-up score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:13">[00:46:13]</a>. For example, instead of a composite "Merchant Health score" of "35," it's better to focus on simpler, actionable inputs like the percentage of new merchants getting an order in their first seven days, or merchant photo coverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:51">[00:51:51]</a>.

### 3. Common Currency for Trade-offs
It's crucial to understand how different metrics across the company equate to one another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:40">[00:46:40]</a>. Quantifying the impact of various business levers (e.g., price, delivery times, selection, quality) in a common currency (like gross order value or volume) allows for better decision-making and trade-offs across different teams, such as marketing and logistics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:49">[00:46:49]</a>. This provides an "inventory of things that we can do short-term, long-term and what we get for it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:48">[00:47:48]</a>, enabling teams to select the most impactful actions to achieve goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:15">[00:50:15]</a>. This is particularly vital in a multi-sided marketplace business like DoorDash, where there are complex trade-offs between supply investment, demand growth, and Dasher growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:20">[00:50:20]</a>.

### 4. Focusing on Edge Cases and Fail States
While averages are important, it's equally critical to examine edge cases and "fail states" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:34">[00:55:34]</a>. These rare, negative experiences, such as "never delivered" orders, can be extremely costly from a financial and customer experience standpoint, leading directly to [[optimizing_for_churn_and_its_implications_on_business | churn]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:21">[00:56:21]</a>.
These issues might be missed if only average values are tracked, as their low frequency doesn't reflect their high impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:02">[00:56:02]</a>. Setting specific goals to eliminate these fail states, understanding why they happen, and preventing them can lead to significant positive impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:04">[00:57:04]</a>.

## Aligning Teams with Metrics
For analytics teams to be effective, their goals should align with those of their business partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. This shared goal setting allows teams to prioritize work based on what is most important for achieving mutual objectives. When faced with multiple requests, an analytics professional can communicate tradeoffs, asking "is this... more important than these other three things that I was going to be working on?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:55">[00:21:55]</a> This [[staying_lean_and_efficient_in_business | ruthless prioritization]] ensures the team focuses on the most impactful work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:03">[00:24:03]</a>.

Data teams should also proactively seek out insights and opportunities. This involves carving out dedicated time for exploratory work and deep dives, as these often drive future roadmaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>. For example, a hackathon at DoorDash uncovered significant fraudulent behavior in their referral channel by actively trying to commit fraud themselves, leading to improved fraud checks and caps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>. This demonstrated the importance of looking at data distributions rather than just averages, as average performance can be "incredibly misleading" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>.

It's also essential for data professionals to consider "what data don't we have, what data might we be missing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:46">[00:59:46]</a>. Sometimes, critical problems, like login errors, are not visible in existing data because users can't even access the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:28">[00:59:28]</a>. Addressing these unseen issues is crucial for business health.

Ultimately, picking the right metrics and defining how they drive business outcomes requires a blend of clarity, strategic alignment, and a willingness to explore beyond surface-level data.

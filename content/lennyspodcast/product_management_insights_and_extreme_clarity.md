Naomi Gleit, Meta's Head of Product, is renowned for her ability to simplify complex problems and drive [[impact_in_product_management | results]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:09">[01:07:09]</a>. Her approach emphasizes "extreme clarity" and a structured methodology to ensure teams are aligned and productive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

## The Product Manager as a Conductor

Naomi Gleit defines the role of a Product Manager (PM) through the metaphor of a conductor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:14">[00:46:14]</a>. Just as a conductor leads an orchestra, a PM ensures that various functions within a team—including legal, policy, comms, data analytics, engineering, and design—play their parts correctly and are unified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:20">[00:46:20]</a>.

Key characteristics of this role include:
*   **Facilitation, not Stardom**: The PM is not the "star of the show," much like a conductor doesn't speak during a performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:10">[00:47:10]</a>.
*   **Harmony and Sync**: A good team, like a good orchestra, operates in harmony, in sync, and at the right tempo and cadence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:59">[00:46:59]</a>.
*   **Empowering Experts**: The PM helps the most talented individuals in their specific skills perform their best work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:12">[01:17:12]</a>.

## Driving Extreme Clarity

"Extreme clarity" is a cornerstone of Naomi Gleit's philosophy for getting things done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:07">[00:49:07]</a>. It means everyone has the same understanding of the facts, even if they disagree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:17">[00:49:17]</a>. This approach aims to prevent misunderstandings and focus discussions on genuine disagreements rather than factual discrepancies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:43">[00:49:43]</a>.

### Canonical Everything
A core tactic for achieving extreme clarity is "canonical everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:09">[00:50:09]</a>. This ensures a shared understanding and eliminates ambiguity.

*   **Canonical Nomenclature**: Establishing a shared vocabulary by defining terms to prevent people from using different words to describe the same things, or the same words for different things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:11">[00:50:11]</a>. For example, distinguishing between "consistency" and "accuracy" in performance metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:37">[00:50:37]</a>.
*   **Canonical Documents**: Every project should have one central, canonical document that serves as the single source of truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:33">[00:53:33]</a>.
    *   It contains essential information: discrete areas of work (workstreams), owners for each workstream (single-threaded owner - STO), and the process for how the team collaborates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:08">[00:54:08]</a>.
    *   It links to all other relevant documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:54">[00:53:54]</a>.
    *   For clarity, all lists within documents should be numbered, not bulleted, to allow for specific referencing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:25">[00:52:25]</a>.
*   **Canonical Processes**: Establishing defined processes for meetings, email lists, and chat groups avoids fragmentation and ensures everyone has the same context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:52">[00:54:52]</a>.
*   **Canonical Visuals and Frameworks**: Visual representations of frameworks help drive clarity, allowing for real-time editing during meetings to document decisions and next steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:17">[00:51:17]</a>.

### Running Effective Meetings
Effective meetings are crucial for [[simplification_and_prioritization_in_product_management | clear decision-making]] and progress. Naomi Gleit employs several tactics:

*   **Pre-Reads**: An agenda with a pre-read should be sent 24 hours before the meeting. Some leaders will cancel a meeting if the pre-read isn't provided on time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:05">[01:07:05]</a>. This allows attendees to have full context and add comments before the meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:24">[01:07:24]</a>.
*   **Decision-Oriented**: Meetings should primarily be for making decisions. When a decision is needed, present three options and a clear recommendation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:06">[01:08:06]</a>.
*   **Visual Decision Tables**: Use a "traffic light" table (red, yellow, green) to evaluate options against various criteria (e.g., legal, policy, product, user experience, engineering feasibility) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:50">[01:09:50]</a>. This visual method helps quickly identify strengths and weaknesses and ensures clear decision rationale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:39">[01:10:39]</a>.
*   **Real-Time Editing**: During the meeting, real-time edit the projected visual (e.g., the decision slide) to reflect agreed-upon options and next steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:17">[01:08:17]</a>. This prevents post-meeting confusion about what was decided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:47">[01:08:47]</a>.
*   **Post-Meeting Notes**: Send notes with decisions and next steps as a reply-all to the calendar invite within 24 hours after the meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:30">[01:08:30]</a>. The calendar invite serves as the canonical unit for all communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:40">[01:08:40]</a>.

## Simplifying Complex Problems

When tackling "gnarly" and complex projects, Naomi Gleit focuses on simplification to gain clarity and align the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>.

*   **"Kindergarten Level" Understanding**: She approaches complex projects by seeking to understand them at a basic level, creating a "curriculum" from kindergarten up to a PhD level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:30">[00:56:30]</a>. This involves identifying the most basic building blocks of a problem and then progressively adding complexity and details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:53">[00:56:53]</a>.
*   **Addressing People/Process Issues First**: Naomi estimates that 80% of project challenges stem from people or process issues, rather than strategy or execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:20">[00:58:20]</a>. By addressing these first (e.g., ensuring the right people are on the project with the right processes), a project can achieve "perfect execution" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:41">[00:58:41]</a>.
*   **Perfect Execution for Strategy Evaluation**: Achieving perfect execution is critical because it allows teams to accurately evaluate whether the strategy itself is sound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:48">[00:58:48]</a>. If a project fails with imperfect execution, it's impossible to know if the strategy was wrong or if the execution was simply poor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>.

## Developing a Strong First-Party Perspective

For [[attributes_of_successful_product_managers | successful product managers]], it's not enough to simply manage people and processes; they must also develop a strong "first-party perspective" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:24">[01:21:24]</a>. This means cultivating their own well-informed opinion and strategy rather than outsourcing or delegating their thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:39">[01:21:39]</a>.

To achieve this:
*   **Dedicated Thinking Time**: Actively schedule 2-3 hour blocks of time for focused thought and reflection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:07">[01:23:07]</a>.
*   **Sparring Partners**: Utilize one or two trusted individuals as sounding boards to clarify ideas and synthesize information, as talking things through can be more effective than solitary thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:19">[01:23:19]</a>.
*   **Synthesize Diverse Views**: While considering all opinions, PMs must ultimately synthesize them into their own unique perspective, optimized for their role and project goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:01">[01:22:01]</a>. This is part of [[becoming_more_strategic_in_product_management | thinking strategically]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:11">[01:25:11]</a>.

## Broader PM Role and Growth
As Head of Product at Meta, which has several [[product_management_in_large_tech_companies | thousand PMs]], Naomi Gleit feels responsible for the entire PM community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>. Her focus includes [[product_management_competencies | PM performance, culture, onboarding, and training]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:07">[01:14:07]</a>.

She sees PMs as a significant point of [[impact_in_product_management | leverage]] for accomplishing company goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:27">[01:14:27]</a>. Her work often involves projects that span across Meta's family of apps and [[the_future_of_product_management | future platforms]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:16">[01:02:16]</a>.

For example, on the early Facebook growth team, the focus shifted from acquisition to retention, leading to the famous "seven friends in 10 days" activation metric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:32">[02:26:32]</a>. The most important aspect of this metric was the extreme clarity it provided as a rallying point for the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:08">[03:43:08]</a>. The team pioneered a data-driven, product-led approach to growth, focusing on removing both macro barriers (e.g., access to smartphones, internet.org) and micro barriers (e.g., optimizing registration flows, email confirmation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:28">[03:28:28]</a>. This also led to innovations like community-driven translations instead of traditional professional translators, supporting over 100 languages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:55">[03:32:55]</a>.

The user research field is currently undergoing a "reckoning," implying a critical moment for re-evaluation and change in the tech industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:14">[01:27:14]</a>. Jud Anon, who previously built the user research practice at Facebook and was a longtime head of research at Airbnb, notes that the user research discipline as it has existed for the last 15 years is "dying" and needs to adapt quickly to survive and thrive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:01">[05:46:01]</a>. This shift is critical given recent industry-wide layoffs, which disproportionately affected UX and UX research teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:52:43">[07:52:43]</a>.

## The "User Research Reckoning"

The current challenges suggest that the system through which user research operates is "broken," failing to drive the necessary value or impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:54">[08:27:54]</a>. Much of this stems from misaligned practices within the research field and how companies leverage user research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>.

### Causes of the Reckoning

A significant factor is the over-hiring of researchers during periods of easy capital, referred to as the "ZIRP (Zero Interest Rate Phenomenon) era" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:46">[01:32:46]</a>. Companies hired researchers with good intentions but often failed to properly integrate them, setting them up as a "service function" rather than strategic partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. This reactive positioning led to less influential roles and reduced impact, ultimately contributing to layoffs and sidelining of research teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>.

### The Problem with "Middle Range Research"

Jud Anon categorizes research into three types:
*   **Macro Research** Strategic, business-focused, forward-looking, and innovation-oriented, involving market analysis, competitive review, and long-term product direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:21">[09:06:21]</a>.
*   **Micro Research** Highly technical and focused on usability, enabling high-quality product releases, or analyzing A/B test results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:21:40">[09:21:40]</a>.
*   **Middle Range Research** This category addresses questions that are "middle altitude," focusing on user understanding (e.g., how users think, feel, behave with a product) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:37">[09:37:37]</a>.

A core issue is that too much emphasis has been placed on "middle range research" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:49:45">[08:49:45]</a>. While often interesting, it can be "devastating" due to its limited impact on business outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:00">[10:04:00]</a>. This type of research frequently yields insights that are difficult to operationalize, triggers "post-hoc bias" (where findings seem obvious after the fact), and allows teams to perform "user-centered performance" without truly changing their approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:40:00">[10:40:00]</a>. It also delays decisions, as product teams wait for research validation rather than trusting their own judgment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:38:00">[13:38:00]</a>.

## Rethinking User Research

For the field to evolve, fundamental changes are needed in how research is conducted and perceived.

### [[balancing_user_research_with_business_goals | Shifting Focus]]: Business Goals Over Pure User Needs

While empathy and user-centeredness are crucial, researchers must become more explicit about the overlap between user needs and business profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:25:00">[21:25:00]</a>. This means understanding business metrics, conversion funnels, OKRs, and competitive landscapes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:25:00">[22:25:00]</a>. By understanding the business context, researchers can frame questions that drive maximum business impact and product improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:16:00">[15:16:00]</a>.

### The Phenomenon of User-Centered Performance

User-centered performance is a common and damaging practice where "customer obsession" or "user-centered practice" is symbolic rather than genuinely focused on learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:12:00">[24:12:00]</a>. It often manifests when a [[role_of_product_managers_in_tech_companies | PM]] asks for a quick user study at the end of a product process merely to "validate assumptions" or "check the box" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:53:00">[24:53:00]</a>. This means they are not genuinely interested in being proven wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:06:00">[25:06:00]</a>. Similarly, executive listening sessions, while well-intentioned, are often performative and not focused on driving better outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:28:00">[25:28:00]</a>.

A key mindset shift for researchers, [[role_of_product_managers_in_tech_companies | PMs]], and designers is to "falsify" assumptions rather than merely "validate" them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:00:00">[26:00:00]</a>. This requires an open mind to being wrong and understanding how insights can help fix issues quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:07:00">[26:07:00]</a>. When teams rely solely on intuition, they fall prey to cognitive biases, confirmation bias, and ego, which research can help expose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:22:00">[27:22:00]</a>.

### [[how_to_evaluate_and_hire_effective_ux_researchers | The "Great Researcher" Profile]]

Great researchers possess a "Swiss army knife" of skills, extending beyond traditional qualitative methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:11:00">[20:11:00]</a>. The five essential tools for a researcher include:
1.  **Formative or Generative UX Research** Looking ahead, focused on innovation, and open-ended (e.g., ethnographic studies) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:08:00">[18:08:00]</a>.
2.  **Evaluative Research** Focused on usability testing and micro-level product improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:28:00">[18:28:00]</a>.
3.  **Rigorous Survey Design** A scalable way to gather responses from diverse communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:32:00">[18:32:00]</a>.
4.  **Applied Statistics** Necessary for understanding A/B test results and engaging in data-rich environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:45:00">[18:45:00]</a>.
5.  **Technical Skills** Traditionally SQL for querying data, now potentially including "prompt engineering" for interacting with generative AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:57:00">[18:57:00]</a>.

When [[how_to_evaluate_and_hire_effective_ux_researchers | evaluating researchers]], look for candidates who propose multi-method approaches to open-ended questions, demonstrating versatility and depth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:26:00">[20:26:00]</a>.

### Overcoming Common Tropes About Research

Several misconceptions hinder effective collaboration between [[role_of_product_managers_in_tech_companies | PMs]] and researchers:

*   **"Research just slows us down"**: Good research, particularly micro-level work, can be incredibly fast (e.g., 48-hour insights) and actually speeds up the product development process by preventing costly mistakes later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:52:00">[33:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:32:00">[34:32:00]</a>. For example, a minor text change on an Airbnb button, informed by quick research, generated millions of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:37:00">[35:37:00]</a>.
*   **"I can do my own research"**: While engaging with customers is encouraged for product people, true research requires expertise to avoid biases and turn "garbage into something that's not garbage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:03:00">[39:03:00]</a>.
*   **"A/B test everything"**: A/B tests tell you *what* happened but rarely *why* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:08:00">[40:08:00]</a>. Researchers provide the "how and why," which is crucial for building better products and avoiding future mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:40:00">[41:40:00]</a>. Ideal partnerships integrate both data scientists and researchers for a holistic understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:56:00">[41:56:00]</a>.
*   **The Henry Ford Quote ("If I'd asked my users...")**: This often-cited quote, though apocryphal, misrepresents research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:25:00">[42:25:00]</a>. Researchers do not simply ask users what they want; they delve deeper to understand underlying needs and behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:56:00">[42:56:00]</a>.
*   **"We knew this already" (Post-Hoc Bias)**: This reflects "hindsight bias" and the "narrative fallacy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:18:00">[43:18:00]</a>, where people selectively remember and construct narratives to justify their intuition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:55:00">[43:55:00]</a>. Great researchers challenge intuition, expanding horizons and ensuring decisions are based on evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:44:00">[27:44:00]</a>.

## [[integrating_ux_research_into_product_development_cycles | Integrating Research for Maximum Impact]]

### The Ideal Partnership Between PMs and Researchers

The solution to the broken system is to restructure product development to fully [[integrating_ux_research_into_product_development_cycles | integrate research]] from beginning to end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:32:00">[14:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:40:00">[50:40:00]</a>. This means:
*   **Consistent Relationships**: Researchers should be actively involved in conversations, framing the right questions that drive business impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:40:00">[14:40:00]</a>.
*   **Strategic Alignment**: Researchers should share the same success metrics (OKRs) as the product team, ensuring collective accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:51:00">[31:51:00]</a>.
*   **In-the-Room Influence**: The goal is for teams to not want to have decision-making meetings without the researcher present, signaling influence and trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:07:00">[32:07:00]</a>.
*   **Ruthless Prioritization**: [[role_of_product_managers_in_tech_companies | PMs]] must help researchers prioritize, typically limiting a researcher's workload to two major and one small project for optimal performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:44:00">[51:44:00]</a>.
*   **Active Engagement**: [[role_of_product_managers_in_tech_companies | PMs]] should dedicate time to be with researchers, even joining field studies to experience insights firsthand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:05:00">[52:05:00]</a>.

[[Leveraging User Insights for Product Development | User research]] helps improve the mental model of the user, guiding product decisions rather than dictating exact product builds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:05:00">[45:05:00]</a>. It provides frameworks based on evidence, allowing teams to experiment toward successful products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:46:00">[46:46:00]</a>.

### Breaking Down Silos

Companies should avoid siloing different insights disciplines (e.g., UX research, consumer insights, market research, data science) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:07:00">[49:07:00]</a>. Integrating all sources of customer feedback and data into a "one insights machine" provides a more unified and valuable understanding for product teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:03:00">[50:03:00]</a>.

Regarding team size, the ideal number of researchers depends on the company and product stage, but the guiding principle should be relationships: ensuring that those who need a consistent research partner have one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:29:00">[57:29:00]</a>. Even early-stage startups can benefit significantly from a researcher to help navigate iterations or pivots, providing evidence to inform tough decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:31:00">[59:31:00]</a>.

## Empowering Researchers for the Future

Researchers, though operating in a challenging system, can drive their own success. Key advice includes:
*   [[evolving_skills_in_the_tech_industry | Developing Diverse Research Skills]] and going deep on business knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:01:00">[48:01:00]</a>.
*   [[navigating_career_growth_and_advancement_in_tech | Building Strong Relationships]] with product partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:20:00">[48:20:00]</a>.
*   Learning to say "no" and focusing on high-impact projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:42:00">[48:42:00]</a>.
*   Becoming excellent communicators, tailoring messages to different audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:53">[01:02:53]</a>.

While dogfooding products (using them yourself) is valuable, [[Importance of Customer and User Research | product managers]] must be wary of relying solely on their own intuition, as they are not typical users and may miss crucial context and constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:01">[01:07:01]</a>. Research helps identify and prioritize issues in a way that personal usage cannot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:24">[01:08:24]</a>.

Jud Anon also offers a critique of Net Promoter Score (NPS), stating that it is not a useful or accurate metric according to survey science, primarily due to its flawed 0-10 scale, often unlabeled points, and inconsistent application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:53">[01:03:53]</a>. A simple customer satisfaction (CSAT) metric is generally more precise and better correlated to business outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:17">[01:05:17]</a>.

Companies often fail because they don't talk to users, which prevents them from finding [[product_market_fit | product market fit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Without [[product_market_fit | product market fit]], little else truly matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. The core mistake startups make is not engaging with customers to learn if what they're building is genuinely useful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. The fundamental principle is to "make things people want," a truth that remains constant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Consequences of Neglecting User Feedback
Many startups, particularly within Y Combinator, fail because they don't talk to customers. This lack of communication means they don't understand what's important to users, rendering any product development potentially useless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:57">[00:22:57]</a>. Founders can get stuck on their own ideas without validating them with users, which is a primary source of failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:09">[00:23:09]</a>.

## Strategies for Achieving [[product_market_fit | Product Market Fit]] and Gathering Feedback

### The Imperative to Talk to Users
A common mistake founders make is being afraid to talk to customers, often due to a fear of rejection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:52">[00:23:52]</a>. Technical people sometimes believe software alone is the solution, but direct communication—via Zoom, phone, or in-person—is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:03">[00:24:03]</a>.

Founders need to understand that most people are not early adopters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:34">[00:24:34]</a>. To find the 10% who are, significant outreach is required, meaning founders must engage with many people to secure a single conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:47">[00:24:47]</a>. This intensive effort is effectively part of the sales process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:59">[00:24:59]</a>.

### Overcoming the Fear of Rejection
Founders often fear that if their product is not used, it means people hate it. In reality, customers are frequently indifferent; they sign up and simply forget or don't care enough to use it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:39">[00:29:39]</a>. The worst outcome for a startup isn't hatred, but indifference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:08">[00:30:08]</a>. People have busy lives, and a product's initial non-use doesn't preclude a second chance after improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:23">[00:30:23]</a>.

The fear of rejection should be contextualized: most people are not early adopters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:46">[00:30:46]</a>. Starting with a narrow solution for a specific problem is necessary, even if it appeals to fewer people, because a complete solution cannot be built upfront <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>. Even successful companies like Airbnb began with very specific, potentially "strange" offerings (e.g., air mattresses in living rooms) before evolving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:10">[00:31:10]</a>. Overcoming this fear of rejection is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:30">[00:31:30]</a>.

### Understanding the Intensity of User Pain
To truly identify a product's value, founders must understand the intensity of the problem they are solving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:09">[00:32:09]</a>. Instead of asking customers directly, which might yield superficial answers, it's more effective to *observe* them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:55">[00:32:55]</a>. Watching users, having them screen-share, and guiding them through their daily workflows helps uncover their pain points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:30">[00:33:30]</a>. This direct observation reveals challenges users might not even articulate as "difficult" because they lack technical solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:25">[00:33:25]</a>.

## The Role of Technical Founders in Product Development
Having a technical co-founder is critical because many decisions and iterations in a startup are technical and rely heavily on engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:35">[00:36:35]</a>. Without understanding this, founders may not make the right decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:43">[00:36:43]</a>. The engineering part is often the hardest, and successful companies typically have founders who can build the first prototype themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:18">[00:35:18]</a>. This direct involvement ensures that iterations are driven by an intimate understanding of the product and its users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:20">[00:38:20]</a>.

## Distinguishing True [[product_market_fit | Product Market Fit]] from External Validation
Founders often confuse external validations—like being accepted into YC or receiving investment—with actual [[product_market_fit | product market fit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:41">[00:26:41]</a>. Y Combinator reminds new batches that almost none of them have [[product_market_fit | product market fit]] on day one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:59">[00:26:59]</a>. The most important thing is talking to customers and learning what truly matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:09">[00:27:09]</a>. Companies that become skilled at this are the successful ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:16">[00:27:16]</a>.

> "The truth is that we're not not very good at knowing what's going to succeed we're not certainly we cannot figure out who's going to be the really successful company in the batch like that's not possible." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:14">[00:45:14]</a>

Instead of predicting outlier success, YC focuses on preventing common failures by being direct with founders about potential pitfalls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:49">[00:45:49]</a>. Things like being in a "hot industry" or getting media attention are uncorrelated with outlier success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:16">[00:46:16]</a>. A strong indicator of potential success is consistent weekly or bi-weekly progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:34">[00:47:34]</a>.

## The Evolution of Product Focus
In the early stages of a company, the focus should not be on "growth team mindset," which emphasizes scalable solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:47">[00:57:47]</a>. Instead, the focus should be on "doing things that don't scale"—deep, unscalable engagement with customers to understand their needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:58">[00:57:58]</a>. Once a product gains traction and reaches a certain scale (e.g., 1000 daily sign-ups), then a growth mindset becomes highly valuable to further scale operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:04">[00:58:04]</a>.

Ultimately, caring about the product means caring about the customers' needs and expectations, not just a founder's personal perception of quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:52">[00:56:52]</a>. While distribution becomes crucial for a large company, it's not the initial focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:19">[00:57:19]</a>. The most critical aspect is talking to customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:41">[00:58:41]</a>.

Elena Verna, a renowned expert in growth strategy, offers extensive insights on building and managing growth teams, drawing from her experience leading growth at companies like Miro, SurveyMonkey, and Amplitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. She emphasizes that [[building_a_highperformance_team | growth is an evolution, not a revolution]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:17">[00:52:17]</a>.

## When to Hire Your First Growth Person

A startup should only consider hiring a dedicated growth person or team after achieving strong [[developing_a_growth_model | product-market fit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:28">[00:52:28]</a>. This means:
*   Demonstrated customer retention, ideally measurable after six months to a year post-initial offering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:36">[00:55:36]</a>.
*   An existing ability to acquire and monetize customers, showing "green shoots" in product distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:50">[00:55:50]</a>.

Hiring a growth person to "figure out your growth model" from the beginning is a mistake and a delegation of a critical business function that founding teams should initially drive themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:10">[00:56:10]</a>.

## Finding Your First Growth Hire

Elena suggests that finding the first growth hire internally is often preferable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:29">[00:52:29]</a>. This internal hire could be:
*   A finance or planning analyst <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:32">[00:52:32]</a>.
*   An existing product manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:33">[00:52:33]</a>.
*   A data analyst <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:34">[00:52:34]</a>.
*   An engineer who is business-minded and technically inclined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:36">[00:52:36]</a>.

### Advantages of Internal Hires
Internal candidates are already familiar with the product and how its growth model should function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:55">[00:52:55]</a>. Growth models must be authentic and localized to the specific product offering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:03">[00:53:03]</a>. Bringing someone external carries the risk that they might simply apply their previous company's growth model, which usually results in a high failure rate because "copy-paste never works" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:10">[00:53:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:40">[00:53:40]</a>.

If quick wins are desired, internal hires are the way to go <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:36">[00:53:36]</a>. If the company is willing to invest time in educating and sponsoring an external growth hire, that can also work, but it typically takes three to six months, or even longer, for them to understand the product's unique growth model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:41">[00:53:41]</a>.

A common pitfall is hiring an external growth leader under pressure to accelerate growth immediately, leading them to copy-paste past strategies, which guarantees failure or departure within a year or two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:53">[00:53:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:56">[00:53:56]</a>.

## Defining a Growth Leader's Role

Elena, having served in interim leadership roles at companies like Miro and Amplitude, assists organizations in identifying the specific type of leader they need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>. She considers the traditional methods of hiring leaders—through recruiting agencies or direct CEO outreach—to be "broken" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.

Instead, Elena advocates for a "try before you buy" approach, similar to a [[growth_hacking_and_sustainable_growth_strategies | product-led growth freemium model]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>. This could involve:
*   Starting as an advisor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.
*   Taking on an interim leadership role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>.

This allows both the leader and the company to assess compatibility before committing to a full-time position, optimizing for retention in the leadership role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. This approach is beneficial because a leader's bet on a company is riskier than the company's bet on them, as it makes up a significant chunk of their career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.

Leadership tenures are shrinking partly because both sides tend to oversell the role during recruitment, avoiding discussions about existing problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>. The interim approach helps prevent "mismatches" by allowing a leader to help the company understand what type of leader it needs while keeping operations moving and ultimately facilitating a smooth transition to the permanent hire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.

## Developing a Growth Mindset and Frameworks

Elena observes that [[the_role_of_growth_teams_versus_founderled_growth | growth leadership]] faces challenges because traditional career ladders for leadership haven't caught up with the interdisciplinary nature of growth professionals, who often span product and marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>.

A key piece of advice for fostering growth is to identify patterns in the problems being solved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:07">[00:57:07]</a>. Instead of treating each problem individually, developing a framework for solving it allows for easier scaling, repeatability, and sustainable, competitively defensible growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:23">[00:57:23]</a>. This approach minimizes "context switching" and promotes a growth culture and mindset across the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:57">[00:57:57]</a>.

Shas Doshi identifies the question "Why does my job feel so frustrating?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:18">[00:38:18]</a> as one he wished he had asked himself sooner in his career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. While he loved his PM leadership role, it was marked by daily frustrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:44">[00:38:44]</a>. The job of a PM leader is notably lonely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:51">[00:38:51]</a>.

## Misalignment with Superpowers

Frustration in a role often stems from behaving in [[magic_loop_concept_for_career_growth | misalignment]] with one's "superpowers" and true core identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:19">[00:39:19]</a>. Doshi realized he loved the macro aspects of his job but disliked the micro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:39">[00:39:39]</a>.

Product work operates on three levels:
*   **Impact Level** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:59">[00:39:59]</a>
*   **Execution Level** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:02">[00:40:02]</a>
*   **Optics Level** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:04">[00:40:04]</a>

Doshi's epiphany was recognizing his preferred level of operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:10">[00:40:10]</a>. When consistently forced to operate in a non-preferred or non-default level, it leads to significant frustration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:16">[00:40:16]</a>. For example, many product leaders thrive at the execution level, while Doshi himself preferred the impact level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:35">[00:40:35]</a>. Climbing the corporate ladder often means spending more time on the "Optics level" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:53">[00:40:53]</a>, which, if not one's natural inclination, can be draining despite having the willpower and skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:10">[00:41:10]</a>.

## Solution: Abandoning the Traditional Path

The solution involves abandoning the "traditional path" of career progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:26">[00:41:26]</a>. Doshi realized this at Stripe when the team he was managing grew to around 50 people, including engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:51">[00:41:51]</a>. At this size, a significant amount of time was dedicated to "Optics" work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:09">[00:42:09]</a>. Instead of pushing through against his nature, he opted to return to working on an earlier-stage product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:25">[00:42:25]</a>.

Doshi's suggestion is to:
*   **Identify your superpowers** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:37">[00:42:37]</a>.
*   **Be true to yourself** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:43">[00:42:43]</a>, as Shakespeare advised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:43">[00:42:43]</a>.
*   Make career decisions based on self-honesty, not external expectations or [[the_impact_of_power_on_personal_life_and_autonomy | envy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:51">[00:42:51]</a>.

By identifying and working in accordance with one's superpowers, individuals can achieve their best work, love their job, excel, and avoid significant frustration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:09">[00:43:09]</a>.

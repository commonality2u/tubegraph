Naomi Gleit, Head of Product at Meta and its longest-serving executive besides Mark Zuckerberg, describes the role of a product manager using the analogy of a conductor leading an orchestra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. This analogy encapsulates the essence of what product managers do and what makes a great product manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:01">[00:46:01]</a>.

## The Conductor Analogy

Naomi Gleit's "conductor" analogy is one of her "Naomi-isms" – principles she developed on the job that she found herself repeating to guide product management practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:54">[00:45:54]</a>.

> [!QUOTE] "Naomi is called the conductor here at Meta. She has an incredible ability to handle the most complex projects and problems and bring the right people together to simplify and solve them. She's very firm yet kind. Her standards are extremely high and she sets the bar."
> — Adam Mosseri, Head of Instagram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:50">[00:43:50]</a>

The analogy breaks down as follows:
*   **The Team as an Orchestra** The product team, composed of various functions such as legal, policy, communications, data analytics, engineering, and design, is akin to an orchestra with many different instruments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:14">[00:46:14]</a>.
*   **The PM's Role** The product manager's job is to ensure everyone plays their part correctly, playing together, unified in the "music" they are producing, and at the right tempo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:34">[00:46:34]</a>.
    *   This includes ensuring the team is in harmony, in sync, at the right tempo, and maintaining the correct cadence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:56">[00:46:56]</a>.
*   **Not the Star** Crucially, the product manager is not the star of the show. Like a conductor, they don't say anything during the performance, yet they are essential for the team's cohesion and performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:10">[00:47:10]</a>.
*   **Empowerment** The conductor's role emphasizes empowering team members and elevating their contributions, rather than being a "boss" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:03">[01:18:03]</a>. The best product managers often have strong opinions and product sense, but their goal is to enable the most talented individuals to do their best work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:17">[01:19:17]</a>.

Naomi Gleit even used to give product managers "metronomes and conductor wands" as a physical representation of this role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:22">[00:47:22]</a>.

## Key Principles for the Conductor PM

To effectively serve as a conductor, several principles are vital:

### Extreme Clarity
[[top_attributes_of_a_successful_product_manager | Extreme Clarity]] means ensuring everyone is on the same page, even if they disagree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:09">[00:49:09]</a>. It's about having a shared understanding of facts, options, and trade-offs to avoid misunderstandings that waste time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:17">[00:49:17]</a>.

Tactics for achieving Extreme Clarity:
*   **Canonical Nomenclature**: Use shared vocabulary and write out definitions for all terms to prevent talking past each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:09">[00:50:09]</a>. For example, distinguishing "consistency" from "accuracy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:37">[00:50:37]</a>.
*   **Visuals**: Leverage visuals in meetings and real-time edit slides to reflect decisions and next steps. This ensures everyone sees and agrees on what has been decided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:07">[00:51:07]</a>.
*   **Numbered Lists**: Avoid bulleted lists; use numbered lists to make it easy to refer to specific points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:25">[00:52:25]</a>.
*   **Canonical Documents**: Every project should have one canonical document as the single source of truth, linking to all other related documents <a class="yt="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:33">[00:53:33]</a>. This document should include:
    *   Discrete work streams and their single-threaded owners (formerly called "directly responsible individuals" or "DRI") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:08">[00:54:08]</a>.
    *   The established process for team collaboration, including canonical meetings, email lists, and chat channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:49">[00:54:49]</a>.
    *   Canonical visuals, often incorporating agreed-upon frameworks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:38">[00:55:38]</a>.

### Simplifying Complex Problems
A conductor PM excels at simplifying complex problems by identifying basic building blocks and then gradually adding complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:50">[00:56:50]</a>. This is likened to creating a "school pyramid" of understanding, starting at a kindergarten level and building up to a PhD level, ensuring everyone on the team has the necessary curriculum to understand the project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:07">[00:57:07]</a>. Often, this simplification process helps identify the most critical issues to address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:38">[00:57:38]</a>.

### Prioritizing People and Process Issues
When facing challenges in a project, 80% of the time, the problem lies in people or process issues, rather than strategy or execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:21">[00:58:21]</a>. The conductor PM focuses on resolving these first, ensuring perfect execution. This allows the team to accurately evaluate whether a strategy is right or wrong, as a project's failure due to poor execution obscures lessons learned about the strategy itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:41">[00:58:41]</a>.

### Running Effective Meetings
Meetings are high-value and high-cost, so making them productive is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:58">[01:06:58]</a>.
*   **Pre-reads**: Send a pre-read agenda 24 hours before the meeting, allowing participants to come with full context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:05">[01:07:05]</a>.
*   **Decision-Focused**: Meetings should ideally be for decisions, requiring three options and a recommendation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:06">[01:08:06]</a>.
*   **Real-time Editing**: Real-time edit visuals during the meeting to document decisions and next steps, ensuring immediate clarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:15">[01:08:15]</a>.
*   **Post-meeting Notes**: Send meeting notes, decisions, and next steps via "reply all" to the calendar invite within 24 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:28">[01:08:28]</a>.
*   **Traffic Light Evaluation**: When evaluating options, use a traffic light system (red, yellow, green) against specific criteria (e.g., legal, policy, product perspective, user experience, engineering feasibility) rather than flat pros and cons lists. This provides a quick visual overview and a clear framework for team members to contribute their perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:50">[01:09:50]</a>.

### Developing a First-Party Perspective
While fostering collaboration, a conductor PM must also develop their own strong, first-party perspective on the project and communicate it clearly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:52">[01:21:52]</a>. This requires dedicated time for thinking and synthesizing information, often in two to three-hour blocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:05">[01:23:05]</a>. It can involve lone strategic thinking or bouncing ideas off one or two trusted sparring partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:16">[01:23:16]</a>.

The [[the_role_of_product_managers | role of a product manager]] as a conductor is physically and mentally demanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:53">[01:13:53]</a>. Maintaining personal well-being through practices like exercise, sleep, and alone time is crucial for optimal performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:44">[01:12:44]</a>.

From: [[lennyspodcast]] <br/> 
Claire Hughes Johnson, former Chief Operating Officer at Stripe and author of "Scaling People", emphasizes the critical role of establishing clear operating principles and systems, both personally and organizationally, to foster growth and stability within a company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>. Her book serves as a tactical guide for management and company building, starting with individual self-awareness as a foundational element <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>.

## Personal Operating Principles

Johnson asserts that effective management and [[building_and_maintaining_company_culture | company building]] begins with the individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>. Her personal operating principles are foundational to the book's content, guiding how individuals can operate more effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>.

### Core Principles for Individuals

1.  **Build Self-Awareness to Build Mutual Awareness**: This is considered the most fundamental principle for success in company building and management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>. Seeking feedback, understanding personal motivators, strengths, blind spots, and tendencies, and exposing them to others, leads to greater effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>.
    *   **Crystallizing Personal Values**: To understand your personal operating principles, begin by identifying your core values. This can be done by reviewing a list of values (e.g., family, ambition, impact, competition, education, integrity) and narrowing them down to the top three that are most important to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>. Explaining *why* these values are paramount, often by recalling formative experiences, helps in [[the_role_of_personal_growth_and_selfawareness_for_founders | self-discovery]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>.
    *   **Understanding Work Style Tendencies**: Utilize various work style assessments (e.g., Myers-Briggs, DISC, Enneagram) to gather data on tendencies like introversion/extroversion or task/people orientation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>. Plotting these tendencies alongside core values helps define how you naturally operate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>.

2.  **Say the Thing You Think You Cannot Say**: Often, your greatest strength is something you don't recognize because it feels as natural as breathing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>. This principle encourages direct and open communication, even with uncomfortable truths, but in a non-threatening, non-judgmental way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.
    *   **Tactical Advice for Difficult Conversations**:
        *   **Ask a Question**: Frame your observation as a question to make it less threatening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>.
        *   **Own Your Observation**: Present it as your perception or experience, rather than a definitive judgment ("I feel like...", "My experience of you was...") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>.
        *   **Be an Explorer, Not a Lecturer**: As a manager, your role is to enable your team to be their best by providing context and coaching, rather than always being the expert who dictates actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>. This involves being curious and exploring patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>.
        *   **Hypothesis-Based Coaching**: Instead of waiting for extensive data, form a well-informed hypothesis from observations and explore it collaboratively with the individual. This holds up a mirror, allowing them to self-correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>.

3.  **Distinguish Between Being a [[leadership_principles_and_career_success | Leader]] and a Manager**: Early in her career, Johnson admits she struggled with this distinction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>. A leader inspires and sets vision, while a manager focuses on operational execution and enabling individuals. Reid Hoffman, for example, self-identifies as more of a leader than a manager, valuing an environment of open feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>.

4.  **Come Back to the [[the_operating_model_in_product_management | Operating System]]**: In chaotic environments, a personal operating system provides stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>. This means adhering to established rituals and common practices, such as how decisions are made, plans are formed, and progress is measured. It helps maintain predictability and focus even when external factors are turbulent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:00">[04:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>. This also helps individuals scale themselves by having a consistent approach across different functions and projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>.

## Company Operating Principles: The "House" Metaphor

Johnson likens a company's structure to a house, with foundational documents and consistent practices forming the support beams and mechanicals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>. Building these elements early, even when the company is small, is crucial because they provide the framework for future scale, preventing the need for costly "tear downs" later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.

### Foundational Documents

These documents articulate the company's core identity and direction:

*   **Mission**: A concise statement of what the company aims to accomplish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>. Stripe's mission, "to increase the GDP of the internet," resonated organically with candidates and customers, even before being formally codified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Goals**: More detailed articulations of why the company exists and what it seeks to accomplish over a longer horizon (e.g., three to five years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>. These serve as aspirational headlines that guide strategic choices and ensure alignment with the mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>. For Stripe, "to advance the state of the art in developer tools" is an example of a long-term goal that informs investment and user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>.
*   [[governance_and_values_in_building_companies | Company Values]] / Operating Principles: These define how the company works and what it believes in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a>. Stripe shares its operating principles with candidates to ensure mutual fit and alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>.

A clear sign that a company needs to invest more in these foundational documents is when new hires frequently ask basic questions about what's important or why things are done a certain way, indicating a lack of clear, documented guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>.

### The Company Operating System and Cadence

The [[the_operating_model_in_product_management | company operating system]] comprises the routines and practices that enable the company to function smoothly, providing structure and predictability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>.

*   **Components**: This includes setting milestones, [[importance_of_company_mission_and_strategy_in_product_development | goal-setting]] systems (like OKRs), regular business reviews (e.g., quarterly business reviews or QBRs), and metrics dashboards to track progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:00">[05:55:00]</a>.
*   **Importance of Cadence**: A consistent cadence (e.g., annual targets, quarterly reviews) creates stability and predictability for teams, enabling them to march toward goals with clear deadlines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>. While younger companies may resist rigid calendar-based cadences, finding the right rhythm (e.g., six-month processes or more frequent reviews for fast-moving product areas) is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:19:00">[06:19:00]</a>.
*   **Signs a Cadence is Off**:
    *   **Too Fast**: Not enough progress is made between review periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:18:00">[06:18:00]</a>.
    *   **Too Slow**: Content being reviewed feels stale, or strategy discussions happen too infrequently and are displaced by metrics reviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:23:00">[06:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>.
*   **Consistency over Perfection**: There is no perfect system or process, but "having one and committing to it is good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>. Companies should aim to do "very few things consistently and well," rather than constantly adopting new approaches, which can create chaos and overhead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:00">[06:26:00]</a>. Reducing overhead, such as by reviewing live dashboards instead of requiring special presentations, is important for maintaining velocity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>.

### Communication Practices

Smart communication practices are vital for keeping the company informed and aligned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. This includes leveraging internal sites, newsletters, and quick videos from founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. Leaders must be "repeaters in chief," using various channels to ensure messages are heard and understood by diverse audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:27">[01:12:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:30">[01:12:30]</a>.

### Effective Meetings and Decision-Making

*   **Meetings**: The core of effective meetings is clarity. Attendees need to know *why* they are meeting and the meeting's objective (e.g., decision-making, information sharing). It's crucial to make implicit intentions explicit and ask who truly needs to be present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:20">[01:16:20]</a>.
*   **Decision-Making**: For product managers and others without formal authority, clarifying the decision-making process is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:19">[01:17:19]</a>. This involves making explicit who is making the decision, the criteria for the decision, and who will be informed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:01">[01:18:01]</a>. Utilize existing models (e.g., RACI, RAPID) and apply them consistently. Johnson advises that if you're unsure who the decision-maker is, it's often you, and it's better to act and ask than to get stuck and slow down progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:41">[01:18:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:15">[01:19:15]</a>. Evaluate decisions based on their impact and reversibility (e.g., Bezos's Type 1/Type 2 decisions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>. Ultimately, focus on progress, impact, and momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:24">[01:19:24]</a>.

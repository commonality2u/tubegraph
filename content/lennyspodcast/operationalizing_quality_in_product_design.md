In product development, the concepts of "quality" and "beauty" often face skepticism, with many prioritizing raw functionality or new features over refined experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. However, leaders like Katie Dill, Head of Design at Stripe, argue that [[importance_of_design_in_product_development | beauty enhances functionality]] by making products easier to use, more approachable, and more compelling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Furthermore, aesthetically pleasing products can increase user trust, signaling that meticulous detail is applied even to unseen aspects of a product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## The ROI of Design and Quality

The perceived [[speed_vs_quality_in_product_development | tension between speed and quality]] often leads to design and quality being deprioritized in favor of new features, partly due to the unclear Return on Investment (ROI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. Katie Dill outlines different levels of quality:
1.  **Baseline Quality:** Does the product work and provide value? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>
2.  **Functional Quality:** Is it error-free and well-rounded? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>
3.  **Exceptional Quality:** Does it exceed expectations and offer unforeseen value to the user? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>

While user requests often prioritize new features, leading to a "seduction by the chase" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>, companies that view quality as non-negotiable understand its long-term necessity. It's akin to regular exercise: individual workouts may not show immediate drastic results, but consistent effort leads to better long-term health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.

### Quality as Growth

Quality is not merely a separate concern but a direct driver of growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>. Products that are easier to use and more understandable naturally attract more users and encourage deeper engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>.

At Stripe, the growth team is "maniacally focused" on building better experiences because it directly impacts business metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. For example, improvements to onboarding flows that make products easier to understand have led to increased activations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>.

A significant example of business impact through quality is Stripe's checkout experience. Research showed that 99% of top e-commerce sites had errors in their checkout flows, hindering seamless and quick transactions, and thus conversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>. By maniacally focusing on improving the quality of the checkout experience, Stripe observed a **10.5% increase in businesses' revenue** when moving from an older to a newer checkout form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>. These small quality details can have a material impact on revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>.

Katie emphasizes that "quality is growth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>. Quality improvements directly increase the bottom line, often by reducing support cases or making complex processes clearer for users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:04">[00:49:04]</a>. It is a "false belief" that quality work doesn't move metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:55">[00:49:55]</a>.

## Operationalizing Quality

Operationalizing quality is a continuous pursuit of excellence, not a one-time fix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:17">[00:27:17]</a>. Key principles include:

*   **Group Effort:** Quality is a group effort, not the sole responsibility of one person, team, or QA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:29">[00:29:29]</a>. Internal standards and communication directly reflect in external products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:58">[00:29:58]</a>.
*   **Vision and Alignment:** Even highly talented individuals need a shared vision to ensure their work fits together cohesively, similar to an architect's plan for a house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:22">[00:30:22]</a>.
*   **Editing and Courage:** An editor or "GC" (General Contractor) is crucial to ensure all pieces fit and to have the courage to say "almost, but no" when work isn't good enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:21">[00:31:21]</a>. This means having the resolve to push for excellence even when teams have put in significant effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>.
*   **User Perspective:** [[understanding_work_for_product_development | Understanding the user's full journey]] is critical to assess quality, as users rarely interact with product features in isolation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:37">[00:32:37]</a>.

### "Walk the Store" Process

To combat quality regression over time, especially as products evolve and companies grow, Stripe implemented a "Walk the Store" process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:44">[00:34:44]</a>:

1.  **Identify Critical User Journeys:** They selected 15 essential user journeys that are crucial for their users and must be of the highest quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:56">[00:34:56]</a>.
2.  **Assign Owners:** Each journey is owned by engineering, product, and design leaders, who are responsible for its quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:20">[00:35:20]</a>.
3.  **Regular Review (Friction Log):** These owners regularly review the journeys, "walking the store" as if they were a user. They friction log their experiences, noting what works and what doesn't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:32">[00:35:32]</a>. This includes the entire journey, from internet search to website, docs, and dashboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:05">[00:36:05]</a>.
    *   This first-hand experience provides a visceral understanding of user pain points that even detailed user research might miss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:10">[00:40:10]</a>.
    *   The reviews happen quarterly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:06">[00:41:06]</a>.
    *   Ideally, the reviews are done by engineers, product managers, and designers *together* to leverage diverse perspectives on issues like load times, consistency, or design system adherence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:17">[00:42:17]</a>.
4.  **Scoring and Calibration (Product Quality Review - PQR):** Owners score their journeys using a qualitative, color-based rubric (e.g., yellow, yellow-green) that considers usability, utility, and desirability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:15">[00:45:15]</a>. Scores are debated and calibrated in "Product Quality Review" (PQR) meetings with senior leaders from different functions, including design, engineering, product, and product marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:23">[00:43:23]</a>.
    *   This calibration uplevels the shared understanding of the quality bar across the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:29">[00:37:29]</a>.
    *   It also provides upstream impact, helping leaders identify broader opportunities for product improvement and refine internal processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:40">[00:37:40]</a>.

### Prioritizing Quality in Roadmaps

Stripe doesn't have a strict percentage formula (e.g., 10% on fixes, 20% on growth) for how teams spend their time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:06">[00:47:06]</a>. Instead, they rely on:
*   **Hiring Judgment:** Hiring individuals with great judgment, pride in their work, and a commitment to building great things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:38">[00:47:38]</a>.
*   **Leadership Advocacy:** Strong advocacy for quality at the highest levels of the company fuels this thinking during planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:02">[00:48:02]</a>.
*   **Multi-Disciplinary Planning:** Product, engineering, and design collaborate on plans, considering both feature advancement and quality improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:10">[00:48:10]</a>.
*   **Demonstrating Impact:** Showing how quality improvements directly move business metrics (e.g., reduced support calls) helps cement this cultural prioritization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:44">[00:48:44]</a>.

### Evaluating Performance

To reinforce quality as a priority, Stripe uses:
*   **Clear Definition of Impact:** Performance rubrics emphasize a broad definition of "impact" beyond immediate metric movement, including multi-quarter or multi-year projects and hard-to-measure quality efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>.
*   **Level Ladder System:** Documents like the "level ladder" guide expectations for each role and level, explicitly mentioning the importance of quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:01">[00:52:01]</a>.
*   **Operating Principles:** Core operating principles, such as "meticulous craft," reinforce that attention to detail and quality is expected from everyone, across all functions (design, engineering, support) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:28">[00:52:28]</a>.

## Team Building and Leadership

Katie Dill, having led design teams at hypergrowth companies like Airbnb, Lyft, and Stripe, shares key lessons on scaling and managing large teams:

### Performance = Potential - Interference

This formula serves as a clarifying force for leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:05">[00:55:05]</a>:
*   **Increase Potential:** Focus on strong hiring and talent development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:37">[00:55:37]</a>.
*   **Decrease Interference:** Remove obstacles that hold talented individuals back, preventing burnout and ensuring strong performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:50">[00:55:50]</a>.

An example of reducing interference was at Lyft. The design team was physically separated from engineering and product by a locked door <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:27">[01:02:27]</a>. While this created a safe creative space, it led to wasted work, misalignment, and slower progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:18">[01:03:18]</a>. By physically and organizationally bringing design, engineering, and product together (e.g., designers sitting with their respective product and engineering teams), while still maintaining shared creative spaces, they achieved faster iteration cycles, better clarity, and reduced interference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:17">[01:04:17]</a>. This [[proximity_to_customers_in_product_design | co-location and re-organization]] ensured teams worked *with* each other rather than in silos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:47">[01:04:47]</a>.

### Improving Awareness

As companies grow, people can lose touch with what's happening across the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:14">[00:57:14]</a>. To improve clarity and reduce redundant work, Katie implemented a practice of designers sharing screenshots or prototypes of their work in a shared Google Slide deck every few weeks (now monthly) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:47">[00:57:47]</a>.
*   This allows designers to see what others are working on, identify collaboration opportunities, and discover useful patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:03">[00:58:03]</a>.
*   It also provides product managers, engineering leaders, and company leaders with a clear visual overview of all ongoing projects and how they fit together across different parts of the product journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:20">[00:58:20]</a>.
*   The low-maintenance format of a Google Slide deck makes it accessible for all functions, not just designers in Figma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:12">[00:59:12]</a>.

### Fighting the Fear of Bold Ideas

Companies often fall into the trap of incrementalism due to fear of bold ideas, as big changes are hard to measure and feel riskier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:01">[01:08:01]</a>. This can lead to a piecemeal approach that doesn't improve the overall product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:50">[01:08:50]</a>.

Instead, Katie advocates for "reach for the stars and land on the moon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:02">[01:09:02]</a>.
*   **Vision Work is Crucial:** Create "vision work" that sketches out the ideal, comprehensive "11-star experience" of a product journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:06">[01:09:06]</a>.
*   **North Star:** This North Star vision, even if it's two years out, lays out the desired outcome and helps coordinate a multi-team effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:04">[01:10:04]</a>.
*   **Measured Risk-Taking:** It allows for large-scale changes to be broken down into measured, thoughtful steps, ensuring progress towards the overarching vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:45">[01:10:45]</a>.

## Hiring for Design Quality

When hiring designers, especially for non-designers like founders or product managers, prioritize:
*   **Taste and Character:** These are harder to teach than tools and process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:31">[01:11:31]</a>. Look for individuals with great judgment and a natural inclination for quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:41">[01:11:41]</a>.
*   **Humility:** Humility is vital for teamwork, respect for users, and curiosity about what's working (or not) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:08">[01:12:08]</a>.
*   **Hustle/Chutzpah:** The creative process can be scary (proposing new ideas, saying "not good enough"). Look for courage to "fight for great" and the hustle to execute rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:47">[01:12:47]</a>.
*   **Doers vs. Thinkers (for startups):** In early stages, prioritize a "doer" over a "thinker/operator." Consider pairing a senior design advisor with a full-time executor to bring both [[philosophical_approach_to_product_development | strategic user focus]] and execution capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:29">[01:13:29]</a>.

## The Role of Beauty: Stripe Press Example

Stripe's commitment to quality and beauty extends beyond its core financial infrastructure products to ventures like **Stripe Press** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:26">[01:15:26]</a>. Stripe Press publishes books that embody "ideas of progress," even if unrelated to finance, demonstrating their care in delivering ideas beautifully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:34">[01:15:34]</a>.

For instance, the redesign of the *Poor Charlie's Almanac* book and its accompanying teaser site (press.stripe.com) showcased an intense collaboration between design and engineering to create an engaging, unconventional online reading experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:02">[01:16:02]</a>. This project, while not core business, aligns with Stripe's mission to increase GDP of the internet by fostering ideas and exemplifies their identity and pursuit of creativity and excellence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:19">[01:18:19]</a>. This level of [[category_design_in_product_development | meticulous design]] in a non-core area helps people understand the care Stripe puts into everything they do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:15">[01:19:15]</a>.

## Design as Intention

At its core, design is simply **intention** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:40">[01:19:40]</a>. It's about bringing intentionality to decisions by considering who is impacted and who is using the product. This applies to anything from designing a doorknob (easy to turn, comfortable, manufacturable) to organizational structure or strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:47">[01:19:47]</a>.

While design expertise brings creative skills and great taste, anyone in any function can bring "more care and intentionality" to their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:47">[01:20:47]</a>. This universal mindset, focusing on user impact and thoughtful decision-making, ultimately leads to better internal and external outcomes in the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:51">[01:20:51]</a>.

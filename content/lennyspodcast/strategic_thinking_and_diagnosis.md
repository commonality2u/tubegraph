Strategic thinking, at its core, is about designing a plan to overcome a high-stakes challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. This concept originates from the Greek word "Stratos," referring to elected leaders who dealt with the issues of their day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. Strategy isn't merely an analytical tool, but rather a method for dealing with issues, challenges, or problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>, and it often involves discovered strength, a surprising insight, or a creative solution to a problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.

## The Kernel of Good Strategy

A good strategy, as outlined by Richard Rumelt in his book *Good Strategy Bad Strategy*, consists of three essential components, often referred to as the "kernel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>:

1.  **Diagnosis**
    The diagnosis is an understanding of the situation at hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. It's a decision about what aspects of reality to pay attention to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a> and involves hypothesizing how things connect together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>. A rich diagnosis is critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. For example, President Obama's diagnosis that the United States was falling behind in education was a correct statement, but a real diagnosis would explain *why* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:23">[00:21:23]</a>.

2.  **Guiding Policy**
    The guiding policy outlines how the organization will address the diagnosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. It defines what actions will be taken and, importantly, what actions will *not* be taken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. A guiding policy differs from a long list of "priorities," which are often just a "lottery list of all the things we wish would happen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. The word "priority" means the first thing, not a grab bag of everything that might matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.

3.  **Coherent Actions**
    Coherent actions are the practical steps taken to implement the strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>. These actions must align with the diagnosis and guiding policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>, and they must not contradict each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. For instance, simultaneously trying to increase growth and profit can be contradictory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. Coherence in action is critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>.

If any of these three elements are missing, it is not truly a strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>. For example, Microsoft's current approach to AI involves diagnosing the challenge of adaptation, creating a guiding policy to invest in major AI leaders, and then coherently incorporating AI into products like their search engine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>.

## Identifying Bad Strategy

Bad strategy often manifests in several ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>:

*   **Mistaking Goals for Strategy**: A common flaw is presenting abstract, high-level goals (e.g., profit or performance targets) as a strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>. These are ambitions, not a strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>.
*   **Absence of Diagnosis**: If a strategy doesn't clearly articulate the problem it aims to solve, it's incomplete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>. For example, stating that a company's "diagnosis is it's not grown fast enough" is merely a statement of values, not an analysis of *what's holding it back* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>.
*   **Fluff**: Using "fancy words" or "word salad" to describe a situation without substance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>.
*   **Incoherent Actions**: Prescribing actions that conflict with each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:59">[00:20:59]</a>.

## The Crux and Focus

The "crux," a term borrowed from mountain climbing, refers to the hardest part of a climb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:01">[01:03:01]</a>. In strategy, it's the most difficult aspect of a problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:17">[01:04:17]</a>. [[Effective decision making | Effective decision making]] and strategy require focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:09">[00:25:09]</a>. Richard Rumelt uses the analogy of a magnifying glass focusing sun rays to illustrate how concentrating on a few things increases effectiveness and is a fundamental source of power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:32">[00:25:32]</a>.

A good strategy selects a challenge to focus on, ensuring it is both important and achievable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:31">[01:01:31]</a>. Trying to do too many things diffuses effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:37">[00:27:37]</a>.

## Power and Asymmetry in Strategy

At the heart of a successful competitive strategy is the exploitation of an *asymmetry* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:17">[00:29:17]</a>. This "power" or "leverage" means possessing something different or better than competitors, such as being first, having a strong reputation, or leveraging specific relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:31">[00:29:31]</a>.

Examples of power include:
*   **Reputation and Relationships**: IBM under Lou Gerstner recognized its primary asset was its respected relationships with large corporate clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:20">[00:30:20]</a>.
*   **Network Effects**: The more users a product has, the more useful it becomes. This principle, first recognized with telephone systems, now drives the success of social media platforms and companies like Amazon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:13">[00:35:13]</a>.
*   **Data Size**: In the age of generative AI, the size of data fed into learning algorithms can make an AI better, giving a significant advantage to leaders like Google in search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:25">[00:38:25]</a>.
*   **Specialization**: Smaller companies can gain power by specializing in a particular approach that differs from market leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:18">[00:39:18]</a>.

To identify power, organizations should ask: "In what way is my company different than other companies?" or "What do we know that other people don't know?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:52">[00:32:52]</a>. Power is a resource that can be used to make a competitive situation not "an even bet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:28">[00:42:28]</a>.

## Organizational Dynamics as a Hindrance to Strategy

Complex organizations often struggle with strategic focus due to diverse interests and internal politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:49">[00:27:49]</a>. Senior executives often know the challenges but disagree on their importance, and their personal interests can conflict with the organization's overall goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:17">[01:15:17]</a>. Fear of action also plays a role, as strategy involves changing power relationships and what people do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:55">[01:15:55]</a>.

Ultimately, a "decider" is needed to make choices and direct action, as not everything can be pursued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:04">[01:11:04]</a>. The difficulty in making these choices often freezes organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:18">[01:19:18]</a>.

## Laying Out a Strategy: The Action Agenda

Richard Rumelt advises against calling it a "strategy" and instead refers to it as an "action agenda" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This reframing emphasizes concrete steps rather than abstract concepts.

To create an action agenda:
1.  **State the Problem/Challenge**: Start by asking, "What makes it hard?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:46">[00:56:46]</a>. This uncovers the true obstacles.
2.  **Filter Ambitions**: Rather than trying to achieve all ambitions, identify which ones can realistically be made progress on and what challenges are holding them back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:53">[01:00:53]</a>.
3.  **Focus on Achievable Challenges**: Choose problems that are both important and addressable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:44">[01:01:44]</a>. This means identifying the "one or two key challenges that can actually be addressed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:01">[01:47:01]</a>.
4.  **Define Action Steps**: These are specific things the organization will *do*, not just goals to achieve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:36">[01:02:36]</a>. For larger companies, these steps might span two to three years; for smaller companies, six months to a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:26">[01:02:26]</a>.

This approach prioritizes solving problems with coherent actions, rather than getting caught up in vague missions, visions, or values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:51">[00:58:51]</a>.

## Insight and Learning

[[Effective leadership and strategic thinking | Strategic thinking]] is not mysterious; it's about solving problems, particularly the most important, addressable ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:20">[01:31:20]</a>. [[Effective decision making | Insight]] is critical to strategy and comes from immersing oneself in the nature of the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:21">[01:09:21]</a>.

Strategy is not a science with fixed equations like physics or engineering; rather, it is heavily based on analogy to previous human experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:57">[01:47:57]</a>. Reading history, biographies, and world events can provide valuable context and analogies for current situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:29">[01:47:29]</a>. By studying past events and trying to understand complex situations, individuals can develop their own diagnostic skills and gain insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:08">[00:51:08]</a>.

One exercise to cultivate strategic insight is to consider "value denied"—what people should be able to buy but cannot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:40">[01:26:40]</a>. Another is to think about the "perfect X"—what would a perfect product or service look like <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:18">[01:28:18]</a>? These simple questions can lead to new business ideas.

## Strategy for Startups

For founders, strategy is inherently a "bet" in an environment of high uncertainty, similar to an oil well wildcatter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:05">[01:21:05]</a>. The market reveals reality in bits and pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:23">[01:21:23]</a>. While startups typically aim for a specific product-market solution, those that survive and prosper often "switch" their target customer or solution as they learn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:35">[01:22:35]</a>.

[[Creating a winning product strategy | Startup strategy]] requires a "double-jointed exercise": being convinced of the certainty of winning while also being willing to pivot when things aren't working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:09">[01:23:09]</a>. The action agenda for a startup must emphasize quick adaptation to changing conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:57">[01:25:57]</a>.

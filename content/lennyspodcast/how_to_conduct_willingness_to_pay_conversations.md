When discussing pricing, many often focus solely on dollar figures, but price is fundamentally a measure of value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The core of this understanding is the [[the_concept_of_willingness_to_pay_and_its_importance_in_pricing_strategy | willingness to pay]] conversation, which reveals if people truly want a product and would actually buy it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. This concept acts as a proxy for how much customers value a product and how badly they desire it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.

## When to Have These Conversations

It's crucial for entrepreneurs and companies to engage in [[the_concept_of_willingness_to_pay_and_its_importance_in_pricing_strategy | willingness to pay]] discussions much earlier in the product development cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Instead of just aiming for "product market fit," the goal should be "product market pricing fit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. If pricing isn't included in the product market fit validation, companies often hear what they want to hear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>.

> "price before product period" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>
> "you actually don't have a choice whether you'll have a pricing conversation with your customer the only thing in your control is when you will have it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>

There's no such thing as "too early" for this conversation; even when an idea is just forming, it's beneficial to gauge if someone would pay for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>. The process isn't about nailing the exact pricing from the outset, but rather understanding if there's [[the_concept_of_willingness_to_pay_and_its_importance_in_pricing_strategy | willingness to pay]] and then refining that understanding through iteration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>.

> A key takeaway for product teams: You cannot prioritize a product roadmap without having a [[the_concept_of_willingness_to_pay_and_its_importance_in_pricing_strategy | willingness to pay]] conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a>. This ensures focus on what customers need, value, and are willing to pay for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:58">[00:21:58]</a>.

### Examples of Early Testing

*   **Porsche Cayenne**: Before even drawing a blueprint for their SUV idea, Porsche checked with the market if there was a need, value, and [[the_concept_of_willingness_to_pay_and_its_importance_in_pricing_strategy | willingness to pay]] for it. Every feature was battle-tested with customers, sometimes even through "car clinics" with prototypes. This approach led to the highly successful Cayenne, which accounts for over half of Porsche's profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>.
*   **Two-Sided Marketplace (Abstract Example)**: A company building a product for the "buy side" initially had 40 ideas from their product teams. Instead of building blindly, they tested wireframes and concepts with customers and prospects to understand monetization potential. Features thought to be exciting internally were often low priority for customers, or even negatively perceived (e.g., "highlight connections from Facebook" feature) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>.

## How to Conduct the Conversations

Directly asking "how much should I charge for this product?" will yield unreliable answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:34">[00:24:34]</a>. Instead, use nuanced methods that tease out [[the_concept_of_willingness_to_pay_and_its_importance_in_pricing_strategy | willingness to pay]] indirectly. Before asking price-related questions, have the exact sales and marketing conversation you would after launching, priming them to the product's value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:55">[00:26:55]</a>.

### Specific Techniques

1.  **Relative Framing**:
    *   Ask customers to compare your product's value to an established competitor (e.g., "If Salesforce was indexed at 100 in value, where do you think we are?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:23">[00:25:23]</a>.
    *   Then, ask about pricing relative to that competitor (e.g., "If Salesforce was indexed at 100 in pricing, where do you think we should be?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:57">[00:25:57]</a>. People are "absolutely meaningless" but "relatively super smart" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:09">[00:25:09]</a>.

2.  **Psychological Thresholds (Acceptable, Expensive, Prohibitively Expensive)**:
    *   After pitching the product's value, ask:
        *   "What do you think is an **acceptable price** for this Innovation?" (Price where they love the product *and* the price - a no-brainer) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:43">[00:26:43]</a>
        *   "What do you think is an **expensive price**?" (Value-priced, neutral reaction) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:54">[00:26:54]</a>
        *   "What do you think is a **prohibitively expensive price**?" (They would "laugh you out of the room") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:57">[00:26:57]</a>
    *   By doing this at scale, you can identify "cliffs" or psychological thresholds where demand suddenly drops (e.g., crossing $99 to $101) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:28">[00:27:28]</a>. Rahul Vora of Superhuman used this method to arrive at their $30 price point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:52">[00:27:52]</a>.

3.  **Purchase Probability Questions**:
    *   Instead of "Would you buy this product?", ask on a scale of 1-5 (1 = not interested, 5 = most likely / would buy for certain) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:45">[00:28:45]</a>.
    *   Even a '5' often means only 30-50% certainty of purchase, a '4' means 10-20%, and '3' or below means they'll never buy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:08">[00:29:08]</a>. This helps build a demand curve and understand price elasticity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:22">[00:29:22]</a>.

4.  **Most/Least Important Features**:
    *   Instead of asking customers to rank 10 features (which can be difficult due to a "messy middle"), present a subset (e.g., 6) and ask them to identify the "most important" (must-have, would pay for) and "least important" (don't need, won't pay for) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>.
    *   By changing the subset and repeating, you can prioritize the entire feature set based on what truly drives [[the_concept_of_willingness_to_pay_and_its_importance_in_pricing_strategy | willingness to pay]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:43">[00:30:43]</a>. Often, 20% of what you build drives 80% of [[the_concept_of_willingness_to_pay_and_its_importance_in_pricing_strategy | willingness to pay]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:10">[00:31:10]</a>.

5.  **Trade-off Exercises / Buying Scenarios**:
    *   Present real-life buying scenarios with different packaging and pricing options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>.
    *   Observe how customers react to changes in features and price (e.g., "would you buy any of these, or none?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:23">[00:31:23]</a>. This reveals mental models and rules customers use to make decisions and helps precisely measure price elasticity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:40">[00:31:40]</a>.

### The Importance of "Why"

Regardless of the method, always ask "why" after an answer. This helps uncover valuable information for product design or value messaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:51">[00:31:51]</a>. Roughly 50% of your questions should be "why" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:28">[00:26:28]</a>.

## Logistical Considerations

*   **Who**:
    *   **Early Stage**: Often one-on-one conversations led by founders, pitching the idea to understand product market pricing fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:58">[00:33:58]</a>.
    *   **Later Stage**: Cross-functional teams (sales, product) can conduct these <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:10">[00:34:10]</a>. In B2B SaaS, this might involve multiple decision-makers within a company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:52">[00:34:52]</a>.
*   **Format**: Can be one-on-one meetings, focus groups, or more quantitative controlled surveys (e.g., inviting participants to give opinions on concepts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:04">[00:35:04]</a>.
*   **Context**: These conversations are part of a larger customer development or product market fit discussion, often at the end of a user research or desirability feedback session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:47">[00:35:47]</a>.
*   **Number of Participants**:
    *   **B2C**: For large customer bases, quantitative validation with 1,000-2,000 responses can be statistically significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:39">[00:37:39]</a>.
    *   **B2B SaaS**: Aim to talk to as many as possible of your top 20-30 accounts that drive 80-90% of your business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:48">[00:37:48]</a>. You'll start hearing patterns repeatedly after a point (e.g., if 20 people say an idea is horrible, it probably is) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:02">[00:38:02]</a>.

## Iteration and Refinement

Once an initial pricing thought is formed, it's recommended to revisit your pricing strategy at least every six months, with a deeper review every 12 to 18 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:23">[00:38:23]</a>. Key pivot points, such as introducing a new plan or new features, also necessitate having these conversations again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:37">[00:38:37]</a>.

## First Steps for Founders or PMs

1.  **Educate Yourself**: Understand that pricing has a science behind it, not just an art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:06">[00:39:06]</a>.
2.  **Gain Confidence**: Recognize that companies, from startups to large enterprises like Porsche, have successfully applied these principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:12">[00:39:12]</a>.
3.  **Read and Apply**: A dedicated resource like "Monetizing Innovation" includes a detailed chapter (Chapter 4) on how to conduct these conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a>.

By proactively engaging in [[the_concept_of_willingness_to_pay_and_its_importance_in_pricing_strategy | willingness to pay]] conversations and using structured techniques, product teams can design products that customers truly value and are eager to buy.

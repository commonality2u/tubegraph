The notion that functionality reigns supreme over other aspects like aesthetics has led to a dramatic decrease in the use of the word "beauty" in digitized books from the 1800s to the 2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:27">[00:22:27]</a>. However, functionality and beauty are not opposing concepts; instead, beauty can enhance functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:45">[00:22:45]</a>. Things that are more beautiful are often easier to use, more approachable, and more compelling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:54">[00:22:54]</a>.

## The Business Case for Design Quality

While most product managers and founders intellectually understand the value of design and high quality, it is often not prioritized over new features or product launches due to an unclear ROI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

### Challenging the Functionality-Only Mindset
Many mistakenly believe that functionality and beauty are separate or even opposing concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. However, beauty actually enhances functionality by making things easier to use, more approachable, and more compelling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Furthermore, aesthetically pleasing products can increase trust, as the painstaking detail suggests care for unseen aspects of the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

### Levels of Quality
Quality can be segmented into different levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>:
*   **Baseline Quality** The product works and provides value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>.
*   **Error-Free Performance** The product performs exceedingly well without errors and in a well-rounded manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.
*   **Exceeding Expectations** The product goes beyond what users seek, delivering a surprising and delightful experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>. This level of quality is crucial for [[improving_user_experience_and_product_quality | improving user experience and product quality]] and [[importance_of_design_in_business_growth | business growth]].

### Prioritizing Quality
Companies often get "seduced by the chase of another feature" rather than enhancing existing ones to a high level of quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. This often happens because new features are explicitly requested by users, and their ROI might seem clearer or more directly measurable than quality improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>. However, this perspective overlooks the long-term benefits of sustained quality investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.

### Quality as Growth
A core philosophy is that [[business_sustainability_and_profitability | quality is growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>. Products that are easier to use and more understandable drive more users to use them and use them more often, leading to a better overall experience that users will share with others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>. For example, Stripe's growth team is maniacally focused on building better experiences because it directly ties to business metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>.

## Quality Improvements at Stripe

Stripe has demonstrated how focusing on quality directly impacts business metrics:

*   **Onboarding Flow** Improvements in the onboarding flow, making products easier to understand, have led to increased activations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>.
*   **Checkout Experience** Research revealed that 99% of top e-commerce sites have errors in their checkout flow that hinder seamless and quicker checkout, leading to lower conversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:17:09]</a>. By maniacally focusing on improving the checkout experience, Stripe has seen a **10.5% increase in businesses' revenue** when migrating from an older to a newer checkout form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:46]</a>. This demonstrates how small quality details can have a material impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>. Stripe's checkout powers major companies like Amazon, Hertz, Shopify, and Spotify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>.

The perspective of a product manager might focus on finding friction points to move a metric, while a designer's lens also considers the emotional experience and how users feel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>. This highlights the importance of multi-disciplinary teams working closely together, ensuring that utility, usability, and desirability combine to create truly great products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:12">[00:20:20]</a>.

## Operationalizing Quality

[[operationalizing_design_quality_and_processes | Operationalizing design quality and processes]] is crucial because the "gravitational pull is to mediocrity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:53">[00:26:53]</a>, and achieving truly great results requires concerted effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:06">[00:27:06]</a>.

### Key Principles for Building Quality
1.  **Group Effort** Quality is a collective responsibility, not just for a single team or individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:31">[00:29:31]</a>. Internal standards and communication directly reflect external quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:56">[00:29:56]</a>.
2.  **Vision and Alignment** Even with talented individuals, a shared vision is necessary to ensure all product pieces fit together as a cohesive whole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:22">[00:30:22]</a>.
3.  **Editing and Courage** There needs to be a role, like a general contractor or architect, who can see how all pieces fit and have the courage to say "no" if something isn't good enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:21">[00:32:02]</a>.
4.  **User Perspective (Journeys)** To truly understand quality, it's essential to view the product from the user's perspective, across their entire journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:37">[00:32:37]</a>. Products can regress in quality over time as new features are added, often because individual teams focus on their specific areas without fully considering how they integrate into the broader user journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:32">[00:34:32]</a>.

### "Walk the Store" Process
Stripe has implemented a "Walk the Store" program to increase awareness and accountability among leaders for owning user journeys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:45">[00:34:45]</a>.
*   **Critical User Journeys** Stripe identifies 15 critical user journeys that are essential to get right at the highest level of quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:56">[00:35:18]</a>.
*   **Regular Review** Engineering, product, and design leaders are responsible for these journeys and regularly review them as if they were users, documenting friction points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:20">[00:35:39]</a>. This involves looking at the entire journey, from internet search to website, documentation, and dashboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:05">[00:36:14]</a>.
*   **Scoring and Calibration** Leaders score the journeys based on a rubric that considers usability, utility, and desirability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:17">[00:45:22]</a>. These scores are then calibrated in Product Quality Review (PQR) meetings, ensuring a shared understanding of the quality bar across the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:33">[00:37:08]</a>. This process fosters empathy for users and helps identify broader opportunities for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:12">[00:37:51]</a>.

## Prioritizing Quality within Teams

*   **Cultural Emphasis** A key factor is hiring individuals with great judgment and pride in their work, then giving them the trust to make quality decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:48">[00:47:48]</a>. Leadership advocacy at the highest levels of the company reinforces this commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:02">[00:48:02]</a>.
*   **Linking to Metrics** It is important to demonstrate how [[defining_effective_business_metrics | quality improvements lead to better business outcomes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:47">[00:49:47]</a>. For instance, clarifying a button that reduced support calls directly improved the bottom line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:13">[00:49:36]</a>. Companies should highlight such examples to counter the false belief that quality doesn't move metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:50">[00:49:57]</a>.
*   **Impact Definition** Performance evaluations should clearly define what "impact" means, allowing for the recognition of multi-quarter or harder-to-measure quality efforts alongside immediate metric movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:55">[00:51:36]</a>.
*   **Operating Principles** Stripe's operating principles, such as "meticulous craft," emphasize the expected level of care across all functions, from designing spaces to building APIs and handling support calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:57">[00:53:02]</a>.

## Design as Intentionality

At its core, design is about bringing intentionality to decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:40">[01:19:40]</a>. Whether designing a doorknob or a strategy, thinking about who is impacted and who is using the product allows anyone to bring intentionality to their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:47">[01:20:25]</a>. While design expertise brings creativity and great taste, fostering intentionality across all disciplines will lead to better internal and external outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:25">[01:20:56]</a>.

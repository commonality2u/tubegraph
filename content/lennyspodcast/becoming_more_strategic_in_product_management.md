Being perceived as "strategic" in product management involves two key elements: being able to articulate a compelling and simple "why" behind company and product decisions, and acting as a change agent for initiatives that serve the long-term interests of the product or company, even if they are difficult to execute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. If either of these elements is missing, individuals may not be seen as truly strategic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

Anuka Gupta, Chief Product Officer at Rubrik and a lecturer on product management at Stanford University's Graduate School of Business, provides insights into [[developing_longterm_strategic_approaches_in_product_development | developing long-term strategic approaches in product development]] and enhancing one's strategic mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

## Key Elements of Strategic Thinking

### Articulate the "Why"
Being strategic means clearly communicating the rationale behind decisions and the direction of the company and product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This "why" needs to be compelling and simple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

### Be a Change Agent
A strategic individual champions and drives changes, even when they are hard, because they are in the best long-term interest of the product or company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Bringing only small ideas to the table, even with a clear "why," is not considered strategic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:55">[01:52:55]</a>. Conversely, championing big ideas without being able to articulate a compelling "why" is also not strategic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.

## Tactical Approaches to Become More Strategic

### Summarization
A highly effective tactic is to summarize discussions in meetings, especially when multiple stakeholders are involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:19">[02:16:19]</a>. This synthesis helps clarify the direction and ensures alignment, and it is often perceived as strategic thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:50">[02:19:50]</a>. It also helps people feel heard and brings diverse perspectives together for better insights and decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:21">[02:41:21]</a>.

Tactics for summarization:
*   **Verbal Summary:** Pause a discussion and state, "Let me pause here for a second and try to capture what has been said" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:59">[02:17:59]</a>. Present what you've heard, including challenges, proposed solutions, the right to win, and intended actions, then ask for agreement or dissent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:55">[02:24:55]</a>. Ending with a question invites further discussion rather than shutting it down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:58">[02:48:58]</a>.
*   **Visual Summary:** Use a whiteboard to summarize while people are talking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:59">[03:21:59]</a>.
*   **Digital Summary:** In virtual meetings, summarize in the chat to avoid interrupting the flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:08">[02:46:08]</a>.

### "One Click Better"
Instead of aiming for radical changes, focus on taking existing ideas and making them "one click better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:12">[02:22:12]</a>. This approach, often from an "outside-in" perspective focusing on customer problems and go-to-market strategies, can lead to significant, transformative ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.

### Deep Business Understanding
Leaders should deeply understand business details and ask detailed questions to grasp what's working and what's not, including financial goals and decision-making processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:51">[01:49:51]</a>. This in-depth knowledge allows leaders to identify where significant or small course corrections are needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:16">[01:55:16]</a>. When presenting strategies, ask open-ended questions and share hypotheses to guide the team towards improvements rather than dismissing their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:48">[02:08:48]</a>.

## Mindset for Strategic Impact

### Embrace Fun and Gratitude
Cultivate a mindset of finding fun in your job, even during difficult times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:30">[02:28:30]</a>. This shifts the perspective from scarcity to opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:06">[02:45:06]</a>. Bringing humor into meetings can also elevate the mood and approach to difficult situations, influencing the team's mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:06">[02:48:06]</a>. Practicing gratitude, even towards challenging personalities, by seeking to learn from them, fosters an abundant mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:58">[03:59:58]</a>.

### Manage Energy, Not Just Time
Architect your day to maximize your energy, ensuring you can bring your full self to work and tackle difficult situations with an abundant mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>. This includes simple acts like taking time for lunch or scheduling challenging tasks during optimal energy periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:05">[06:04:05]</a>.

## Strategic Decision-Making

### Be a Historian
Understanding past decisions, why products succeeded or failed, and the historical perceptions within the organization provides crucial context for future decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:54">[02:50:54]</a>. Learning from past mistakes, even those not personally experienced, helps overcome "baggage" (e.g., "we've tried that before") and informs better strategic choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:07">[03:07:07]</a>.

### Make the Decision, Not the "Right" Decision
Avoid analysis paralysis by making decisions even with incomplete information (e.g., 70% certainty) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:06">[03:42:06]</a>. Once a decision is committed, more information becomes available, allowing for iteration and adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:19">[03:51:19]</a>. Speed in decision-making and willingness to iterate are crucial for organizational progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:30">[03:28:30]</a>.

### Reward Learning, Not Just Outcome
To foster a culture where people are willing to take risks and make bets, reward the learning derived from decisions, rather than solely focusing on outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:20">[03:32:20]</a>. If a strong hypothesis is in place, even if the outcome isn't as expected, the insights gained can be valuable for future decisions and the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:31">[03:34:31]</a>.

## Strategic Leadership and Team Building

### Working with Founders
As a product leader, effectively working with a founder in "founder mode" means leveraging their power to drive initiatives that benefit the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:05">[01:10:05]</a>. Understand their motivations and the underlying objective behind their ideas. If their proposed mechanism is not the best, frame alternative options in terms of achieving that core objective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:11">[01:21:11]</a>. Decide which "hills to die on" based on what will truly make or break the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:30">[01:29:30]</a>.

### Giving and Receiving Feedback
Strategic leaders excel at giving and receiving hard feedback.
*   **Receiving Feedback:** Allow yourself to feel the emotional response to negative feedback without immediately reacting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>. Then, approach it with curiosity, seeking to understand the "why" behind the feedback. All feedback is valid in terms of people's feelings, but not all feedback requires action. Prioritize feedback based on what is best for the company and what the organization needs most <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>.
*   **Giving Feedback:** Convey genuine care and a desire for the person's success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:16">[04:47:16]</a>. Be direct about specific behaviors or perceptions, providing concrete examples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>. Frame feedback in terms of "how you are being perceived" rather than "you are doing X" to open a dialogue about changing perceptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:00">[05:14:00]</a>. Tailor feedback to their career aspirations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>.

## Common Misconceptions for New Product Managers

New product managers often misunderstand the core [[product_management_insights_and_extreme_clarity | skills required for product management]], focusing too much on tools like Figma or specific processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:17">[05:55:17]</a>. Instead, the most critical skill is the ability to take ambiguous situations and consistently drive clarity over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:49">[05:55:49]</a>.

New PMs often find success by:
*   Joining a company in a [[career_growth_strategies_for_product_managers | product-adjacent role]] (e.g., engineering, customer support, sales) and then transitioning internally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>. This leverages existing credibility and company-specific knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19:00">[05:19:00]</a>.
*   Joining small startups where they might be the first PM or take on broader "Product Management Plus+" responsibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:18">[05:59:18]</a>.

## Cultivating a Positive Mindset

The mindset brought to work is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:11">[01:38:11]</a>. Approaching every situation with a positive mindset allows for greater achievement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. Journaling can be a powerful tool for processing negative thoughts, understanding their origins, and differentiating between rational and irrational feelings, leading to more productive responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:19">[01:52:19]</a>.

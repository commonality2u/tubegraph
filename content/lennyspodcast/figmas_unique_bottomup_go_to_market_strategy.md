From: [[lennyspodcast]] <br/> 

Figma's go-to-market (GTM) strategy is characterized by a "Bottoms Up" motion, primarily focusing on individual contributors (ICs) within companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:03">[01:14:03]</a>. This approach diverges from traditional "top-down" Software as a Service (SaaS) models, where the focus is on selling to executives or buyers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:05">[01:15:05]</a>. Figma's strategy centers on fostering a deep love for the product among its users, enabling them to become internal champions who drive adoption and revenue within their organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:21">[01:14:21]</a>.

> Figma's strategy is an example of a [[new_company_approach_and_the_shift_from_traditional_growth_strategies | new company approach]] that shifted from traditional growth strategies, particularly in not having a sales team for the first three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:33">[01:15:33]</a>. All early revenue was self-served, with users paying via credit card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:56">[01:15:56]</a>. Even after establishing a sales team, marketing qualified leads (MQLs) largely originated from the free or "Pro" tiers, where existing users sought to upgrade their entire company's usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:11">[01:16:11]</a>.

## Two-Part Go-to-Market Strategy

Claire Butler, Figma's first marketing hire and current lead of go-to-market and bottom-up growth, outlines a two-part strategy:
1.  Getting individual contributors (ICs) at a company to love the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:06">[01:34:06]</a>.
2.  Enabling them to spread the product within their organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:06">[01:36:06]</a>.

### Part 1: Getting Individual Contributors to Love the Product

This initial phase focuses on building genuine connection and value with the end-users, primarily designers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:06">[01:31:06]</a>.

#### 1. Building Credibility
Designers, as a technical audience, prefer technical features and their functionality over traditional marketing buzzwords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:41">[01:32:41]</a>.
*   **Technical Content:** Figma produced deep technical content, written by engineers and designers, explaining how features like Vector Networks and grids were implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:36">[01:33:36]</a>. The bar for this content was high: if a marketer could understand or write it, it was too basic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:16">[01:34:16]</a>. This helped maintain user interest and provided reasons for them to return to the tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:28">[01:36:28]</a>.
*   **Designer Advocates:** About six months post-launch, Figma hired its first Designer Advocate, a passionate user and former product designer, to engage directly with the community, gather feedback, and create content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:55">[01:34:55]</a>. This role became a "magic dust" for the GTM strategy, scaling with the company to include developer and FigJam Advocates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:32">[01:35:32]</a>.

#### 2. Building with Users (Customer Obsession)
Figma prioritizes customer feedback and integrates it directly into product development.
*   **Early User Focus:** The initial goal was to get one company to use the product and keep using it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:07">[01:38:07]</a>. An early example involved driving to Palo Alto to fix a new user's MacBook issue, preventing them from opening a file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:10">[01:38:10]</a>.
*   **Direct Support:** In the early days, everyone, including engineers and the CEO, participated in customer support via Intercom, debugging products live with users and immediately fixing bugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:29">[01:39:29]</a>. This direct interaction made users feel ownership and strengthened their relationship with the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:40">[01:40:40]</a>.
*   **"Little Big Updates":** At scale, Figma instituted "quality weeks" where engineers focused on fixing small, annoying bugs and making minor quality-of-life improvements based on user feedback (e.g., from Twitter or support) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:51">[01:52:51]</a>. These updates are then packaged and launched together annually, becoming one of Figma's most popular releases because they directly address user pain points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:02">[01:53:02]</a>.

#### 3. Finding the Right Channel to Build Relationships
Figma sought to connect with users where they already existed, rather than forcing them to a new platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:50">[01:44:50]</a>.
*   **Twitter Focus:** Dylan Field, Figma's CEO, identified Twitter as the primary hub for the design community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:18">[01:45:18]</a>. Figma went "all in" on this channel, using it to push out technical content and spur conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:48">[01:45:48]</a>.
*   **Influencer Mapping:** Dylan built a custom tool to map influencers within the design community on Twitter, identifying key individuals and their network of followers across different design topics (e.g., iconographers, graphic designers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:05">[01:46:05]</a>. This allowed Figma to engage with influential users for feedback and build connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:48">[01:46:48]</a>.
*   **Personal Interaction:** The company encouraged personal interaction from its team (including Dylan and engineers) on Twitter, rather than relying solely on the brand account. This put a human face behind the brand and fostered a more engaged community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:31">[01:47:31]</a>.

#### 4. Transparency and Authenticity
Building trust requires honesty and not hiding behind a brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:09">[01:49:09]</a>.
*   **Public Postmortems:** When major issues like downtime occurred, Figma would release public postmortems, explaining the technical reasons for the problem and how they addressed it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:18">[01:55:18]</a>.
*   **Acquisition Announcement:** During the highly stressful acquisition announcement, Figma's immediate response was to hold a public Twitter Space with key leaders to answer user questions directly, reinforcing transparency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:48">[01:55:48]</a>. This human and authentic approach helped turn the tide of negative sentiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:46">[01:56:46]</a>.

### Part 2: Enabling Spread Within the Organization

Once ICs love the product, the next step is to facilitate its expansion throughout their companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:23">[02:00:23]</a>.

#### 1. Making it Easy to Try and Share
Reducing friction for adoption is crucial for a bottom-up model.
*   **Robust Free Tier:** Figma offers a very generous free tier that allows individual users to sign up easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:33">[02:01:33]</a>.
*   **Unlimited Collaborators on Free Teams:** Initially, the free "starter team" tier limited collaborators. Figma strategically shifted this model to allow unlimited collaborators but a limited number of files <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:41">[02:02:41]</a>. This change was monumental, as it made it much easier for teams to adopt the product freely before needing to pay, accelerating internal spread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:06">[02:03:06]</a>.
*   **Free Viewers:** Figma charges only for editors, allowing unlimited "viewers" who can comment on files for free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:52">[02:05:52]</a>. This feature significantly expands the product's reach and utility within organizations, as designers collaborate with product managers, engineers, and other stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:05">[02:06:05]</a>.

#### 2. Designer Advocates in the Sales Process ("Tom Factor")
Designer Advocates (DAs) play a unique and crucial role in the sales process.
*   **Credibility and Expertise:** Salespeople often lack the deep technical knowledge to resonate with designers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:12">[02:09:12]</a>. DAs, as former product designers and passionate users, possess this credibility and can directly address technical problems and best practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:21">[02:09:21]</a>.
*   **The "Tom Factor":** Tom Lowry, a Designer Advocate who joined Figma on the same day as the first salesperson, became invaluable. His involvement in sales calls increased the likelihood of deals closing, leading the sales team to coin the term "The Tom Factor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:39">[02:09:39]</a>. DAs are not sales quota-carrying and maintain a connection to the product, synthesizing user feedback for the product team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:57">[02:09:57]</a>.

#### 3. Leveraging Design Systems
Figma turned a key blocker into a growth engine by focusing on Design Systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:07">[02:10:07]</a>.
*   **Addressing a Blocker:** Large organizations initially saw the lack of robust Design System features as a major impediment to adopting Figma, as it hindered collaboration with engineering and consistency across hundreds of designers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:27">[02:12:27]</a>.
*   **Community Engagement and Features:** Figma actively engaged with the Design Systems community through informal meetups to learn their needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:10">[02:13:10]</a>. This led to the development of features that enabled sharing and managing Design Systems across teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:25">[02:13:25]</a>.
*   **Marketing and Events:** Figma created dedicated resources like designsystems.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a> and hosts an annual conference called Schema, bringing together advanced Design Systems practitioners to share how they use Figma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:04">[02:14:04]</a>.
*   **Upgrade Driver:** Design Systems became a primary reason for companies to upgrade from "Pro" to "Org" or "Enterprise" tiers, as they represent a more advanced organizational need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:13">[02:14:13]</a>.

#### 4. Maintaining and Growing Connections with Internal Champions
Figma continuously invests in its relationship with champions, understanding that these individuals put their "social capital" on the line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:19">[02:16:19]</a>.
*   **Ongoing Support:** Even if a champion expresses dissatisfaction (e.g., via Twitter), Figma's team immediately engages to address their concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:30">[02:16:30]</a>.
*   **Career Growth and Amplification:** Figma actively helps champions grow their careers and profiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:03">[02:17:03]</a>. This includes inviting them to speak at events like Config, amplifying their voices on social media, and promoting them as thought leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:15">[02:17:15]</a>. This symbiotic relationship reinforces credibility for Figma and its products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:44">[02:17:44]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE] Config Conference
> Config, Figma's annual conference, is a prime example of scaling engagement. Its content is largely sourced from a public call for proposals, ensuring it meets the technical and deep needs of individual contributors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:02">[00:59:02]</a>. DAs help shape talks, and the conference helps speakers grow their own profiles, creating a virtuous cycle of community and content generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:22">[00:59:22]</a>.

## Prerequisites for Applying This Strategy

While Figma's approach has been highly successful, certain conditions make it more likely to thrive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:39">[02:19:39]</a>:

*   **Technical, Craft-Focused Audience:** The target audience should be technical and deeply care about their tools and craft, finding significant value in using the product individually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:51">[02:19:51]</a>. This allows for technical discussions beyond just "collaboration," which users often don't want to discuss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:10">[02:20:10]</a>.
*   **Existing Community:** It helps if the target audience already has a strong, self-organized community (e.g., on Twitter for designers) that existed before the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:57">[02:20:57]</a>. This provides a natural distribution channel for engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:16">[02:21:16]</a>.
*   **Collaborative IC Role:** The core IC audience should have many natural connection points within their organization, making it easy for them to spread the tool through their daily work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:26">[02:21:26]</a>.
*   **Executive Buy-in:** A critical component is an executive leader who deeply believes in and advocates for this bottom-up approach, even when metrics are not immediately clear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:58">[02:22:58]</a>. Dylan Field's consistent belief in the strategy allowed Figma to prioritize "signal over metrics" in early stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:41">[02:23:41]</a>.
*   **Patience:** This strategy requires patience, as product adoption and internal advocacy take time to build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:22">[02:22:22]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Potential Challenges
> While this strategy offers many advantages, it's important to remember that it's not without challenges. For example, convincing designers to switch from established tools and adopt a new, collaborative workflow (which was initially seen as a disadvantage by some) was a "massive shift" that required significant effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:51">[02:21:51]</a>.

The field of growth is relatively new, leading to significant interest in "growth hacks" and "sure things" to achieve rapid growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. However, many tips and tricks shared, particularly on social media, are often out of context, highly specific to one example, or not applicable as general patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. This has led to a high failure rate for [[growth_teams_and_misconceptions | growth teams]] and heads of growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

Elena Verna, an expert in B2B growth, identifies common growth tactics that consistently fail, yet companies continue to invest heavily in them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

## Failed Growth Tactics

### 1. Hiring a Growth Team Too Soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>

A common misconception is that a [[growth_teams_and_misconceptions | growth team]] is needed early on to achieve product-market fit (PMF) and distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>. This is incorrect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. Founders and founding teams must establish initial growth to reach milestones like $1 million, $5 million, or even $10 million in Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. Product-market fit and initial distribution cannot be outsourced to a growth team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

A growth team is typically not needed until:
*   **Solid Product-Market Fit (PMF)**: The product solves a problem, and customers are not only adopting but also retaining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. This can be assessed using metrics like the Sean Ellis score (how many users cannot live without your product) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.
*   **Sufficient Data Volume**: There are enough users to run experiments, learn, optimize, and innovate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. A small user base (e.g., 10 users) is not enough data for a growth team to function effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.

**Founder-led growth** should precede the formation of a dedicated growth team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. The longer a company waits to hire a growth team, the better, as it trains the entire organization to be responsible for growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.

**Sales vs. Growth Hiring:** If a company's primary monetization strategy is through a sales team, sales hires should precede growth hires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>. Growth teams are more crucial for companies relying on a [[common_pitfalls_and_best_practices_in_implementing_productled_sales_strategies | product-led growth]] motion, where the product itself drives acquisition, activation, or monetization (e.g., freemium, trial acquisition) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.

### 2. Hiring a Head of Growth When Business is Declining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>

Bringing in a "shiny growth head" to fix a fundamental business slowdown is a common mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>. A head of growth in such a scenario is "destined to fail" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a> because the underlying issues are deeper than the absence of a growth team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>.

A [[growth_teams_and_misconceptions | growth team]] can optimize growth by 10-15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>, but it cannot fix core product or marketing issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>. If a business is slowing down due to declining product-market fit or strong competition, a growth team will be "absolutely helpless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>.

The appropriate time to hire a head of growth for an established company is after core product and marketing teams have managed to at least plateau the decline or show initial signs of recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>.

### 3. Rebranding or Redesigning Marketing Sites for Growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>

Rebranding or redesigning a marketing site, especially the homepage, rarely produces good performance results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>. While there are valid reasons for a rebrand (e.g., entering a new market, product evolution) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:03">[00:20:03]</a>, it often serves as a "lagging indicator" that something needs to change, and it will require significant optimization to even return to previous performance levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>.

Often, new CMOs initiate these projects based on personal taste, promising increased acquisition, but these promises rarely materialize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>. Such efforts can be costly (millions of dollars) and time-consuming (8-10 months), with "very lackluster results" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:36">[00:21:36]</a>.
Redesigns are often a "step back in performance" that requires extensive follow-up work to recover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">[00:22:22]</a>. Companies should bake in 3-6 months of post-launch optimization work, rather than expecting immediate growth or moving on to the next big project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:56">[00:24:56]</a>.

### 4. Blindly Copying Competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:16">[00:25:16]</a>

While understanding and being inspired by competitors is important, blindly copying their tactics or flows often leads to "subpar results" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">[00:26:05]</a>. Every product experience is unique to its customer base and channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:23">[00:26:23]</a>. It's also difficult to know if a competitor's experience is a general offering or a personalized test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:30">[00:26:30]</a>.

Copying competition skips crucial steps like ideation, user research, customer interviews, and A/B testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:55">[00:26:55]</a>, and it fails 95% of the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:02">[00:27:02]</a>. It is the "fastest way to mediocrity" and prevents a company from becoming a leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:12">[00:28:12]</a>.

**Using Competition for Inspiration:**
*   Analyze general frameworks of how competitors solve problems (e.g., sharing models) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:41">[00:30:41]</a>.
*   Observe common elements across multiple competitors that seem to be "winning elements" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:47">[00:27:47]</a>.
*   Use these observations as an input into ideation, but never as a final destination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:19">[00:31:19]</a>.

**Benchmarking pitfalls:** Benchmarks are often dangerous because definitions of metrics (e.g., signups, visitors) vary greatly between companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:40">[00:28:40]</a>. They can be a valuable input but should not be blindly used to set targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:44">[00:29:44]</a>.

### 5. Assuming Your Problems Are Unique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:09">[00:34:09]</a>

Many teams believe their growth problems are unique and require re-engineering solutions from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:14">[00:34:14]</a>. This is almost never true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:29">[00:34:29]</a> and results in "time lost to market" and "huge opportunity cost" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:48">[00:34:48]</a>.

**Instead, leverage existing knowledge:**
*   **Look at competition** (as inspiration, not to copy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:41">[00:35:41]</a>.
*   **Talk to people** who have solved similar problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:47">[00:35:47]</a>. Leverage networks and platforms like LinkedIn to find and consult with experts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:04">[00:36:04]</a>.
*   **Focus on patternization**: Instead of solving a problem as a one-off, seek frameworks that can apply to multiple similar problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:40">[00:36:40]</a>. This allows teams to get to 60% of a solution much faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:04">[00:37:04]</a>.

### 6. Prioritizing SEO, SEM, and Social Over Owned/Earned Channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:04">[00:44:04]</a>

While SEO (organic search), SEM (paid search), and social media are important, a [[growth_teams_and_misconceptions | growth team's]] top priority should be developing **owned or earned channels** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:31">[00:44:31]</a>. These channels are unique to the company and cannot be easily replicated or out-competed by others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:40">[00:44:40]</a>.

Channels like paid marketing or social media algorithms can be controlled by external platforms and can change at any time, leaving companies vulnerable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00">[00:45:00]</a>.
[[Utilizing lowcost growth channels | Earned channels]] often stem from [[unorthodox_frameworks_for_growth_and_impact | product-led growth acquisition]] concepts, such as:
*   **Virality**: Users inviting other users (e.g., Dropbox's sharing model, which accounts for over 50% of its acquisition) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:43">[00:49:43]</a>.
*   **Word-of-mouth**: Organic recommendations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:42">[00:45:42]</a>.
*   **User-generated content (UGC)**: Content created by users (e.g., templates, case studies, reviews) that attracts new users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:47">[00:45:47]</a>.

Investing in these channels, even if it requires significant product, engineering, and marketing resources, is crucial for long-term sustainable growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:09">[00:48:09]</a>. Not investing in earned channels leaves a company's growth future in the hands of external platforms, leading to increased customer acquisition costs and competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:06">[00:49:06]</a>.

### 7. Not Evolving Growth Models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:38">[00:51:38]</a>

Many companies start with a single growth model (e.g., purely product-led or sales-led) and fail to layer on additional models over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:16">[00:51:16]</a>. Just as products need continuous evolution and expansion of product-market fit, growth models also have a limited lifespan before experiencing diminishing returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:02">[00:52:02]</a>.

Relying solely on one growth model, even if it's currently successful (like Dropbox's sharing loop for 17 years), is an anomaly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:03">[00:53:03]</a>. Most growth loops become less effective within 5-7 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:15">[00:53:15]</a>.
Companies need to continuously overlay different growth models, such as:
*   [[common_pitfalls_and_best_practices_in_implementing_productled_sales_strategies | Product-led growth]]
*   Marketing-led growth
*   Sales-led growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:27">[00:53:27]</a>

Diversifying growth strategies ensures that the company is not solely reliant on one model that might fail, and it keeps pace with market opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:39">[00:53:39]</a>. A healthy growth team should allocate 20-25% of its annual time to introducing new growth loops or channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:25">[00:56:25]</a>. It's important to allow these new initiatives time (e.g., 6 months to 1.5 years) to evolve before expecting significant revenue impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:58">[00:57:58]</a>.

### 8. Not Hiring Advisors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:37">[01:01:37]</a>

Many companies fail to hire advisors, which is a "huge mistake" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:18">[01:03:18]</a>. Advisors provide external input and access to vast experience and data points from other companies, significantly accelerating a business's progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:01">[01:02:01]</a>. Even experienced operators hire advisors for themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:53">[01:02:53]</a>.

**Tip for Hiring Advisors:** Instead of blindly hiring, conduct a paid workshop with potential advisors to see them in action and assess their ability to provide useful information and work with your team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:14">[01:04:14]</a>. Continually evaluate an advisor's value on a monthly basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:21">[01:05:21]</a>.

### 9. Too Much Risk Averseness / Experimenting on Everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:10">[01:06:10]</a>

While experimentation is a core process for [[growth_teams_and_misconceptions | growth teams]], testing every single initiative can be a "paralyzing disease" that slows down progress, velocity, and learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:48">[01:06:48]</a>.

**When to avoid extensive testing:**
*   **Low volume real estate**: If collecting a sufficient sample size for a test would take too long (e.g., 8 months), it's not worth it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:02">[01:08:02]</a>. A rule of thumb is not to test if a sample size cannot be collected in a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:13">[01:08:13]</a>.
*   **Trust intuition**: Leaders should trust their intuition based on user understanding and market knowledge to make decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:41">[01:08:41]</a>.
*   **Debilitating impact**: Over-reliance on scientific measurement for every change can paralyze a growth team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:38">[01:09:38]</a>.

Instead, utilize **pre vs. post analysis** for most initiatives. While not as precise as A/B testing, it allows for faster iteration and assessment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:21">[01:08:21]</a>. Reserve rigorous A/B testing for major strategic pivots or high-traffic areas where even small percentage differences equate to significant revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:03">[01:09:03]</a>.

### 10. Quick-Fire Failed Tactics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:50">[01:10:50]</a>

*   **Color Optimizations**: Spending time testing shades of blue or other color variations is an outdated tactic from the early 2000s that doesn't yield significant growth results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:03">[01:11:03]</a>.
*   **Third-Party Sign-ups**: Adding Google, Facebook, Slack, or Microsoft authentication (OAuth) options doesn't typically drive incremental acquisition or improve activation/retention for most products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:28">[01:11:28]</a>. For developer products, GitHub OAuth is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:44">[01:11:44]</a>, but for productivity tools, email sign-up is sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:54">[01:11:54]</a>.
*   **One-Email Wonders**: Expecting a single email to a customer group to generate significant lift is a mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:17">[01:12:17]</a>. Email campaigns should be thought of as a series of communications that integrate with product communication as part of a larger strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:41">[01:12:41]</a>.
*   **Obsessing Over Removing Friction (Simplifying Onboarding)**: While fixing confusing or cognitively demanding friction points is important, simply removing steps or oversimplifying a product to oblivion can lead to a loss of identity and functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:12">[01:13:12]</a>. "Simplify onboarding" should never be a problem statement on a roadmap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:57">[01:13:57]</a>; rather, it's a potential solution to specific problems like user confusion, getting lost, or lack of education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:10">[01:14:10]</a>.

## Recommended Growth Frameworks

Elena Verna highlights several [[growth_strategies_and_frameworks_used_at_facebook | growth frameworks]] as powerful patterns to guide ideation and problem-solving:

*   **Growth Loops**: Focusing on self-contained flywheels where an action generates a reaction that leads to another action, creating a sustainable growth engine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:04">[01:16:04]</a>.
*   **Race Car Framework**: A framework that categorizes growth initiatives into Engines (loops), Fuel (e.g., paid marketing), Turbo Boosts (large events), and Lubrications (optimizations) to understand their impact and allocate resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:42">[01:16:42]</a>.
*   **Adjacent User Theory**: From Balaji Srinivasan, this framework helps in evolving growth by considering users outside the ideal customer profile (ICP) and optimizing their experiences to expand the product's reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:34">[01:17:34]</a>.

## Conclusion: Progress Over Perfection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:28">[01:30:28]</a>

In the dynamic field of growth, the velocity of information and progress is more important than achieving initial perfection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:35">[01:30:35]</a>. Failure is an inherent part of growth, but the goal is to shorten the failure cycles to learn faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:32">[00:40:32]</a>.

[[understanding_product_positioning | Product positioning]] is a foundational marketing concept that defines how a product is the best in the world at delivering specific value to a well-defined set of companies who care deeply about that value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:52">[01:02:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:54">[01:12:54]</a>. Despite being discussed since the 1980s, its definition is often misunderstood or stretched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:30">[01:12:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:37">[01:12:37]</a>.

April Dunford, a best-selling author and expert in [[understanding_product_positioning | product positioning]], has led teams at seven successful B2B startups and worked with over 200 companies to help them "nail their positioning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. Her book, *Obviously Awesome*, is considered an industry bible on the topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:46">[00:46:46]</a>. She specializes in working with [[importance_of_product_positioning_in_b2b_tech | B2B tech]] companies, particularly growth-stage startups, but also larger companies with complex positioning issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

## The Importance of Positioning

[[importance_of_product_positioning_in_b2b_tech | Positioning]] is crucial because if a product isn't performing well, the problem may not be the product itself, but its [[understanding_product_positioning | positioning]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. When [[understanding_product_positioning | positioning]] is done well, it "feels like magic" and becomes obvious to buyers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:59">[00:17:59]</a>. A well-positioned product makes customers think, "Of course that's what it is, and of course we need one of those" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>. The true test of effective [[understanding_product_positioning | positioning]] is whether a qualified prospect gets excited and wants to buy the product when the story is told to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:28">[00:21:28]</a>.

> "If your product isn't doing well, there's a chance that it may not be the product that's the problem, it may be your positioning." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>

## [[challenges_and_signs_of_weak_product_positioning | Challenges and Signs of Weak Product Positioning]]

Weak [[understanding_product_positioning | positioning]] can negatively impact the entire sales pipeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>:
*   **Early Stages**: People may not understand what the product is, leading to low response rates in marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.
*   **Middle Stages**: If salespeople are involved, the "light doesn't come on" until after multiple calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. Customers might ask sales reps to "back it up and pitch it to me again" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.
*   **Late Stages/Post-Sale**: Customers might think they understand the product but are wrong, leading to churn because "this isn't the thing that I thought it was" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. Alternatively, they might understand what the product *does* but not its value, asking, "I don't get why anyone would pay for that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.
*   **Internal Misalignment**: A common problem is when the founder, marketing, sales, and product teams have different understandings of the product's [[understanding_product_positioning | positioning]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>. This often occurs when a [[founderled_sales_strategies | founder]] loses direct market contact as the company grows, or the market itself shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>.

## [[steps_to_develop_and_align_on_product_positioning | April Dunford's 5-Step Positioning Methodology]]

Dunford advocates for a structured approach to [[understanding_product_positioning | positioning]], often involving a cross-functional team (marketing, product, sales, customer success, and CEO) to ensure alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>. Starting by asking "why does everybody love our stuff?" leads to subjective opinions; instead, start by understanding the competitive landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:58">[00:22:58]</a>.

1.  **Competitive Alternatives**: Identify everything the product needs to beat to win a deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:30">[00:23:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>. This includes:
    *   **Status Quo**: What customers are currently doing to solve the problem (e.g., spreadsheets, pen and paper, interns) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:59">[00:23:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:32">[00:24:32]</a>. In B2B, roughly 40% of deals are lost to "no decision," meaning they lost to the status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:26">[00:24:26]</a>.
    *   **Shortlist Competitors**: Other products or solutions customers consider when actively looking for a new solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:09">[00:24:09]</a>.

2.  **Differentiated Capabilities**: List the specific features, functions, or company capabilities (e.g., pricing, professional services) that the product has which alternatives do not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:02">[00:25:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:09">[00:25:09]</a>.

3.  **Value**: Translate these differentiated capabilities into compelling value for the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:32">[00:25:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:36">[00:25:36]</a>. This often results in two or three core "value buckets" or themes that are unique to the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:49">[00:25:49]</a>.

4.  **Target Customers**: Identify the characteristics of ideal customer accounts that would care *most* about the unique value offered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:27">[00:26:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:01">[00:27:01]</a>. Not every company will value the differentiation equally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:22">[00:26:22]</a>.

5.  **Market Category**: Define the market context in which the product operates, such that its value is obvious to the target customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:45">[00:26:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:08">[00:27:08]</a>. This step comes last, as it's informed by the previous steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:47">[00:26:47]</a>.

### Example: Help Scout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:09">[00:30:09]</a>
*   **Competitive Alternatives**: Zendesk, other customer success software, or simple email/shared inboxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:57">[00:29:57]</a>.
*   **Differentiated Capabilities**: Shared inbox designed for service, personal customer treatment (no ticket numbers, assigned person), chatbots only appear with actual human availability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>.
*   **Value**: Delivering amazing customer service that deepens relationships, contrasting with cost-reduction approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:28">[00:31:28]</a>.
*   **Target Customers**: Direct-to-consumer (D2C) or e-commerce businesses that see customer service as a growth driver and a way to build loyalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:16">[00:32:16]</a>. Companies focused solely on reducing call center costs are not a good fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:57">[00:31:57]</a>.
*   **Market Category**: Customer success as a growth driver for modern e-commerce companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:08">[00:33:08]</a>.

## Output of the Positioning Process

The output of this [[steps_to_develop_and_align_on_product_positioning | positioning process]] is twofold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:06">[00:34:06]</a>:
1.  **A Document**: A clear articulation of the five positioning elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:26">[00:34:26]</a>.
2.  **A Sales Narrative/Pitch**: This document is then translated into a story that sales teams can pitch to qualified prospects, ensuring everyone in the company (product, customer success, CEO) tells the same consistent story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:49">[00:34:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:10">[00:35:10]</a>.

## [[differences_between_positioning_and_messaging | Positioning vs. Messaging vs. Branding]]

*   **[[understanding_product_positioning | Positioning]]**: A fundamental input that defines how to win in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:50">[00:40:50]</a>. It clarifies the target buyer and product differentiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:25">[00:41:25]</a>.
*   **[[differences_between_positioning_and_messaging | Messaging]]**: The text on a homepage or other communication materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:32">[00:40:32]</a>. It flows *downstream* from a clear [[understanding_product_positioning | positioning]] statement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:50">[00:40:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:39">[00:41:39]</a>.
*   **Branding**: What a company wants its brand to stand for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:21">[00:41:21]</a>. Effective branding is built *after* [[understanding_product_positioning | positioning]] is clear to ensure distinctness in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:33">[00:41:33]</a>.

## When to Tighten Positioning

In the super early days of a product, it's often better to keep [[understanding_product_positioning | positioning]] a little "loose" and allow the market to "pull" the product in an unforeseen direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:08">[00:51:08]</a>. This initial stance is a "positioning thesis," based on assumptions that are likely to be partially incorrect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:11">[00:50:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:51">[00:50:51]</a>.

Companies should wait until they see a clear pattern in who loves their product and why <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:49">[00:52:49]</a>. This signal can come from:
*   Consistent characteristics among diverse-looking customers (e.g., common software, team size) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:15">[00:53:15]</a>.
*   Predictable success of pitches based on specific customer conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:35">[00:53:35]</a>.

Once this pattern emerges, the company can "smash [its] foot on the gas" and aggressively pursue that market where they know they can consistently win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:50">[00:53:50]</a>.

## Segmentation vs. Personas in B2B

*   **Segmentation**: How a market is split up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:22">[00:55:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:25">[00:55:25]</a>. In B2B, this is typically based on **firmographics** (company size, revenue, geography) or **behavioral/technical characteristics** (e.g., using a specific software package, having a creative team of a certain size) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:21">[00:56:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:27">[00:56:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:41">[00:56:41]</a>. Effective segmentation is actionable, allowing sales and marketing to identify and target specific companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:59">[00:56:59]</a>.
*   **Personas**: Focus on the characteristics of a **particular type of buyer** (a person), including their hopes, dreams, fears, and goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:51">[00:55:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:57">[00:55:57]</a>. In B2B, multiple people (typically 5-7) are involved in a purchasing decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:11">[00:58:11]</a>.

Dunford argues that in B2B, the most important persona is the **champion**—the individual within the buying company whose job is to get consensus and "champion the deal" across various stakeholders, including the economic buyer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:57">[01:00:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:02">[01:01:02]</a>. If the [[understanding_product_positioning | positioning]] doesn't resonate with this champion, the product won't even make it onto a shortlist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:16">[01:01:16]</a>. While other personas (IT, purchasing, end-users) are involved later in the deal, the primary focus for [[understanding_product_positioning | positioning]] should be on arming the champion to sell internally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:32">[01:01:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:01">[01:02:01]</a>.

Dan Hockenmeyer, an expert in marketplace businesses, highlights several key distinctions between consumer and B2B (business-to-business) marketplaces, noting that every decision in a marketplace has second, third, or even fourth-order consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:50">[00:48:50]</a>.

## Founding and Problem Understanding
One reason there have historically been fewer B2B marketplaces is that there are fewer potential founders who deeply understand B2B problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:11">[00:55:11]</a>. Consumer use cases are often more obvious to founders because most founders are consumers themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:16">[00:55:16]</a>. Understanding a B2B problem, such as the pain of a retail buyer dealing with numerous suppliers, line sheets, PDFs, and incorrect pricing, often requires prior experience in that specific business domain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:20">[00:55:20]</a>. This extends the discovery process for B2B opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:55">[00:55:55]</a>.

## Fragmentation
A critical factor for a successful marketplace is high fragmentation within the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:07">[00:56:07]</a>.

### What is Fragmentation?
Fragmentation measures the number of total businesses in a space relative to the transaction volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:47">[00:56:47]</a>. If the top 5% of suppliers in a space do 80% of the total volume, the market is less fragmented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:53">[00:56:53]</a>.

### Impact of Low Fragmentation in B2B
B2B markets often have much lower fragmentation compared to consumer markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:05">[00:56:05]</a>. This lower fragmentation presents several [[Challenges and Strategies in B2B Sales | challenges]]:
*   **Supplier Leverage**: In concentrated markets, dominant companies have more leverage and are less likely to need the marketplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:12">[00:56:12]</a>. They have their own sales teams and internal operations, requiring less from a marketplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:10">[00:57:10]</a>.
*   **Lower Commission Willingness**: Less fragmented markets mean suppliers are less willing to pay a high commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:17">[00:57:17]</a>.
*   **Disintermediation Risk**: When transaction values are high, there's a greater incentive for suppliers and customers to bypass the marketplace and transact directly, leading to disintermediation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:21">[00:57:21]</a>. For example, in B2B materials where transactions can be tens of thousands or millions of dollars, the commission charged by a marketplace would be too high, incentivizing direct deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:10">[00:58:10]</a>. This contrasts with ride-sharing, where a few dollars in commission does not make disintermediation worthwhile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:41">[00:57:41]</a>.

## Share of Wallet
Share of wallet, which measures how much of a customer's total spending in a category is captured by the marketplace, can be more clearly measured in B2B marketplaces on the consumer (buyer) side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:05">[00:33:05]</a>. In consumer marketplaces, it's almost always possible to measure share of wallet on the supply side, but less consistently on the consumer side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:05">[00:33:05]</a>.

## Evolution of Business Models
It is generally easier for a [[Design and operation of online marketplaces | marketplace]] to evolve into a [[The importance of pricing models in B2B SAS | SaaS]] business than for a SaaS business to become a marketplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:18">[00:47:18]</a>.
*   **Marketplace to SaaS**: Marketplaces inherently build capabilities to generate demand and establish relationships with both supply and demand sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:25">[00:47:25]</a>. They operate higher up the value chain, leading to higher effective commissions (10-20%) compared to SaaS (2-3%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:33">[00:47:33]</a>. When a marketplace adds SaaS features, it often does so to solve customer pain points, creating a better experience and increasing stickiness and retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:29">[00:48:29]</a>.
*   **SaaS to Marketplace**: A SaaS business typically lacks pre-existing relationships with the demand-side customer, requiring them to acquire a whole new type of demand to become a marketplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:51">[00:47:51]</a>. While possible (e.g., OpenTable), it is generally more difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:57">[00:47:57]</a>.

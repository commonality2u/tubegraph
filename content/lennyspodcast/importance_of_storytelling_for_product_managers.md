The [[importance_of_storytelling_in_business_communication | Importance of Storytelling]] for Product Managers is a core skill, so much so that Yuki Yamashita, Chief Product Officer at Figma, includes it in performance reviews for his product managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. He believes that a great [[Role of Product Managers | Product Manager]] is fundamentally a great storyteller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>.

## Key Aspects of Storytelling for Product Managers

### 1. The Power of Synthesis
Storytelling for [[Role of Product Managers | Product Managers]] involves understanding the power of synthesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>. This means:
*   **Distilling Information** When taking notes in meetings, the most powerful part is synthesizing what happened, bringing together diverse opinions into a cohesive message that pushes a project forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.
*   **Frameworks for Problem Solving** It involves creating frameworks for talking about or thinking through a problem, which is a form of synthesis that helps make sense of disparate parts by providing a lens through which to view them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.
*   **Cohesion from Complexity** Just as literary commentary distills observations from a poem into a thesis, a good [[Role of Product Managers | Product Manager]] can take many ideas, opinions, and problems and distill them down into something cohesive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>.

### 2. Driving Action and Memorability
A story's effectiveness is measured by its ability to drive action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>. In a world of constant distractions, it's crucial to tell something powerful that sticks, especially given that attention spans are often only around 30 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>.

#### Mimification
A key concept is "mimification," where insights (from data or research) become so well-communicated that they are easily recalled and used by leaders in various meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>. When people can draw from and reference these insights, it signifies effective knowledge transfer within the company and compels action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>. Storytelling helps leaders create a mental "meme" or story about a project or problem, making it memorable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>.

## How to Improve Storytelling Skills
Yuki Yamashita suggests several ways to improve storytelling:
*   **Reset your Brain** Approach a problem or situation as if building a story from scratch, assuming no prior context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>.
*   **Avoid the Curse of Knowledge** Put yourself in the shoes of someone who has no idea what's happening but still needs to understand the nuances of the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>.
*   **Learn from Teaching** Explaining complex concepts (like computer science pointers) using real-world metaphors or relatable analogies helps in crafting stories that are accessible to anyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>.

## Storytelling in Practice
When hiring, one of Yuki Yamashita's favorite interview questions is to ask candidates to describe a controversial product decision they were part of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:02">[00:49:02]</a>. This reveals their storytelling ability by assessing if they can:
*   Set up the conflict.
*   Explain why the problem was important.
*   Represent both sides of the argument.
*   Communicate the conflict in an even-keeled way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:11">[00:49:11]</a>.

He also looks for whether candidates can make a seemingly boring problem sound exciting and compel others to work on it, as this demonstrates strong storytelling and [[communication_and_prioritization_techniques_for_product_managers | communication]] skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:51">[00:49:51]</a>.

Effective storytelling enables:
*   **Clarity of "Why"**: At Figma, [[Role of Product Managers | Product Managers]] are uniquely responsible for owning the "why" behind a product or idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>. Understanding the core problem being solved allows engineers and designers to make great local decisions, even without direct oversight, which is crucial for scaling a product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:54">[00:20:54]</a>.
*   **Empowering Champions**: In a product-led growth model, storytelling helps empower internal "champions" (like designers at Figma) to evangelize the product within their companies, providing them with the necessary data and narratives to make their case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:07">[00:53:07]</a>.
*   **Fostering Loyalty**: Building an emotional connection and "love" for the product, both internally and externally, fuels this advocacy. This involves not only solving user problems but also equipping them with a philosophy or narrative about a new, better way of working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:01">[00:57:01]</a>. For example, Figma's ability to support multiple designers in the same file was initially controversial but became a key part of its "revolution" narrative, which customers championed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:40">[00:57:40]</a>.

The landscape of AI development is characterized by rapid advancements, with new capabilities emerging almost every two months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. This fast pace means that users are quickly adapting to what feels like magic today, only to view it as "garbage" within a year as models become even more sophisticated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:20">[00:24:20]</a>.

## Evolving AI Capabilities

Future AI models are expected to develop in several key areas:

### Proactivity and Personalization
AI models are anticipated to become more proactive, anticipating user needs rather than just responding to explicit queries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:50">[00:33:50]</a>. This [[future_of_autonomous_agents_and_ai_in_collaboration | shift towards autonomous agents]] could involve:
*   Monitoring emails (with authorization) to spot trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:53">[00:33:53]</a>.
*   Providing proactive recaps of ongoing conversations or preparing research for upcoming meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:02">[00:34:02]</a>.
*   Drafting presentations or adapting project plans based on new market conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:14">[00:34:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:16">[00:35:16]</a>.

This [[future_implications_of_personalized_ai | personalized AI]] will extend beyond simple responses, offering immediate value to users.

### Asynchronous Interaction
As models grow in complexity and require more "thought" time, interactions will become increasingly asynchronous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:21">[00:34:21]</a>. Users can initiate a complex task and then step away, with the AI working in the background and notifying them upon completion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:34">[00:34:34]</a>. This allows for grander, project-based tasks rather than single-query interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:04">[00:35:04]</a>.

### Multimodal and Human-like Interaction
Future AI models will interact in all the same ways humans do, including speaking, seeing, and typing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:40">[00:35:40]</a>. An example of this is the advanced voice mode in ChatGPT, which enables real-time universal translation for conversations across language barriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:24">[00:36:24]</a>. This capability could transform travel and global communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:35">[00:36:35]</a>. Younger generations already expect AI to interact naturally and are finding new ways to use voice mode, even for personal conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:11">[00:37:11]</a>.

### Scaling Intelligence Through Reasoning
Beyond simply scaling pre-training (like GPT-2 to GPT-4), a new method of scaling intelligence involves enabling models to perform "system two thinking" or query-time reasoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:50">[00:30:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>. This means models will pause to "think" for extended periods (from seconds to potentially hours or days), forming hypotheses, refuting or affirming them, and reasoning through complex problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:07">[00:31:07]</a>. This approach is likened to the scientific method and how humans solve difficult questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:32">[00:31:32]</a>. This new form of reasoning is still in its early stages but promises significant advancements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:55">[00:31:55]</a>.

## Impact on Product Development and User Experience

The [[impact_of_ai_on_skills_and_products | impact of AI on skills and products]] is profound.

### Product Management Evolution
The role of a product manager (PM) is significantly changing, requiring a deeper understanding of the underlying technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>. The ability to write and grade "evals" (evaluations) for AI models is becoming a core skill for PMs, as the quality of an AI-powered feature depends on effective evaluation and prompting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>. Companies are even training PMs in this skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>.

Other key skills for PMs in the AI era include:
*   **Prototyping with models:** Using AI tools for rapid prototyping and A/B testing UI designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a>.
*   **Designing for non-determinism:** Creating product experiences for stochastic, non-deterministic systems, where the AI's output is not always predictable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>. This requires new approaches to feedback mechanisms, guard rails, and understanding aggregated model behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:35">[00:20:35]</a>.
*   **Observing Model Behavior:** PMs must observe how models behave in real-world scenarios, which can reveal surprising performance differences across users and data sets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>.

### User Adaptation and Education
Despite the non-deterministic nature of AI, users are remarkably quick to adapt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:16">[00:23:16]</a>. Products are increasingly designed to be educational, informing users about the AI's capabilities and how to use new features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:53">[00:24:53]</a>.

Within [[interactions_and_implications_of_ai_in_enterprise_settings | enterprise settings]], education strategies include:
*   Running educational sessions for non-technical users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:30">[00:26:30]</a>.
*   Leveraging internal "power users" to create custom AI tools (like custom GPTs) and become evangelists, making AI accessible to less technical colleagues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>.

### [[User experiences with AI and evolving AI capabilities | User Experiences with AI and Evolving AI Capabilities]]
User interactions with AI are becoming more akin to interpersonal relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:45">[00:38:45]</a>. Users are developing a sense of "two-way empathy" with models, noting nuances in their behavior, such as a new model feeling "smarter but a little more distant" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>. The "personality" of the model is becoming a crucial aspect of the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:46">[00:39:46]</a>. This also raises questions about the degree of customization for AI personalities versus maintaining a distinct brand personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:50">[00:39:50]</a>. Some users even ask models to describe them based on past interactions, highlighting the emerging personal connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:19">[00:40:19]</a>.

The ability of AI to automate "drudgery" — repetitive data manipulation and form-filling tasks — is a significant area of development, allowing humans to focus on more creative work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:57">[00:28:57]</a>.

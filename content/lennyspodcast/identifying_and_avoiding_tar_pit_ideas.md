Tar pit ideas are startup concepts that appear promising, seem like unsolved problems, and often receive positive initial feedback, but consistently prove to be difficult to succeed with, leading founders to get stuck and often fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:47">[00:23:47]</a>. Unlike simply "bad" startup ideas, which are obviously flawed or receive no positive feedback, tar pit ideas draw people in with their apparent viability and validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:46">[00:24:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:35">[00:26:35]</a>.

## Characteristics of Tar Pit Ideas

*   **Common Conception** A lot of people independently come up with the same tar pit ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:30">[00:24:30]</a>.
*   **Seemingly Unsolved Problem** They often address a problem that appears to be unaddressed or poorly addressed in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:33">[00:24:33]</a>.
*   **Positive Initial Feedback** Founders typically receive encouraging feedback from potential users or the market, which further validates the idea and makes it hard to abandon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:35">[00:24:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:27">[00:25:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:41">[00:26:41]</a>.
*   **Historical Difficulty** Many of these ideas have been attempted repeatedly since the 1990s without widespread success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:20">[00:25:20]</a>.
*   **Getting Stuck** The appealing nature and initial validation cause founders to get "stuck" in these ideas, making it difficult to [[the_pitfalls_of_shortterm_career_focus | pivot]] away even when they are struggling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:53">[00:23:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:43">[00:26:43]</a>.

## Examples of Tar Pit Ideas

*   **Friend Coordination Apps** Building an app to coordinate social outings or meetups with friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>. While seemingly useful, these have been attempted countless times without breaking through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:20">[00:25:20]</a>.
*   **Music Discovery** Trying to "fix" music discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:38">[00:25:38]</a>. This is a classic example that can garner positive feedback and users but is inherently difficult due to various industry complexities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:46">[00:25:46]</a>.
*   **Foursquare Clones** Startups built as clones of Foursquare that tried to allow users to interact with people checked into various locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:19">[00:26:19]</a>. Despite initial excitement from users, these failed to gain lasting traction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:11">[00:26:11]</a>.

## Avoiding Tar Pit Ideas

To avoid falling into a tar pit, founders should be wary of ideas that seem conventional or that everyone else is pursuing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:57">[00:21:57]</a>. Instead of following the same "information diet" as other founders, which leads to similar ideas, try to:

*   **Go Off the Beaten Path** Explore unique areas of personal interest or experience where you have expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:41">[00:22:41]</a>.
*   **Seek Unique Insights** Develop ideas from unique insights gained through deep experience, even if it's a side effect of previous ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:51">[00:22:51]</a>.
*   **Identify Unfashionable Spaces** Look for successful companies that operated in unfashionable spaces before they became conventional wisdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:40">[00:23:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a>.
*   **Challenge Conventional Thinking** Intentionally seek out large, publicly traded or private equity-owned companies with low customer satisfaction (NPS) to identify opportunities for disruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:46">[00:20:46]</a>.
*   **Mix Up Your Information Diet** Actively consume information from diverse sources and areas of expertise to foster unique ideas that others might not contemplate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:11">[00:23:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:35">[00:52:35]</a>.
*   **Avoid the [[avoiding_the_impulse_to_copy_competitors | Impulse to Copy Competitors]]** Do not simply copy what is currently "fashionable" in the startup world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>.

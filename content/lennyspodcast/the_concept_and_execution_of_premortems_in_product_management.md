The concept of a "premortem" is a proactive approach to risk management, designed to identify potential failures and issues *before* a project or launch begins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:56">[00:28:56]</a>. This contrasts with a "postmortem," or "after-action review" in military terms, which analyzes what went wrong *after* an event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:44">[00:27:44]</a>.

## Origin and Purpose

The idea of a premortem was discovered by Shreyas Doshi through a Harvard Business Review article written by Gary Klein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:34">[00:28:34]</a>. The core premise is that if a premortem is done correctly, the need for an "ugly postmortem" can be avoided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a>. While a postmortem may still be conducted for learning, a successful premortem significantly reduces the likelihood of a problematic outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:07">[00:29:07]</a>.

The "genius" of the premortem lies in its initial prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:17">[00:29:17]</a>:
> Imagine this project that we are working on has failed six months from now, or this launch we are doing has miserably failed. Let's just all imagine that. Now let's work backwards from there and ask ourselves, what went wrong? What could have contributed to this utter failure? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:30">[00:29:30]</a>

## Benefits of Premortems

*   **Psychological Safety**: By framing the discussion around a hypothetical failure, premortems create a safe space for team members to voice concerns they might otherwise hesitate to bring up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:26">[00:30:26]</a>. This is crucial because "nobody likes to be negative in modern organizations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:41">[00:30:41]</a>.
*   **Catharsis**: Engaging in this exercise can leave participants feeling lighter and provide a sense of catharsis, even after discussing terrible scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:36">[00:31:36]</a>.
*   **Shared Vocabulary**: Premortems establish a common language for discussing potential threats and issues, making it easier for teams to address concerns openly in future meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:50">[00:31:50]</a>.
*   **Early Problem Identification**: They help identify issues that might otherwise be missed or assumed someone else would handle, preventing situations where companies face backlash due to unaddressed obvious problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:18">[00:37:18]</a>. This proactive approach saves time and resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:52">[00:38:52]</a>.
*   **High Upside, Low Downside**: Premortems are considered a "very low downside but very high upside" activity due to their cost-effectiveness and potential for preventing significant problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:14">[00:39:14]</a>.

## Execution of a Premortem Meeting

When conducting a premortem, a [[Product management skills and best practices | Product Manager]] should consider the following:

### Who to Invite
It is crucial to include people from every function involved in the project or launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:22">[00:34:22]</a>.

For very large launches, it can be beneficial to separate the premortem into two groups:
1.  **Product & Engineering Focus**: This meeting involves all engineers (potentially 10-20 people), a PM, and a design counterpart. It focuses on engineering-related issues that could go wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:33">[00:34:33]</a>.
2.  **Go-to-Market Focus**: This involves sales, support, marketing, PR, and some core engineering leads. This session addresses go-to-market risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:04">[00:35:04]</a>.

For smaller launches, a single meeting with all relevant stakeholders is sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:27">[00:35:27]</a>.

### Meeting Flow and The "Tiger" Framework
1.  **Share the Prompt**: The leader begins with the "Imagine this has failed" prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:34">[00:35:34]</a>.
2.  **Quiet Time**: Allocate 5-10 minutes for individual reflection where participants privately enter their concerns into a shared document <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:46">[00:35:46]</a>.
3.  **Share Concerns**: Go around the room, asking each team member to share three types of potential issues:
    *   **Tiger**: A critical threat that could "kill" the project or product, causing significant harm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:05">[00:32:05]</a>.
    *   **Paper Tiger**: A seemingly threatening issue that others might worry about, but the individual believes is not a real concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:25">[00:32:25]</a>.
    *   **Elephant**: The "elephant in the room" â€“ an unspoken concern or unacknowledged reality that could cause problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:38">[00:32:38]</a>.
4.  **Voting**: After sharing, ask participants to vote on the "tiger" mentioned by *someone else* that they find most concerning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:21">[00:36:21]</a>.
5.  **Post-Premortem Action Plan**: The leader's responsibility is to take the collected output, prioritize the identified threats, and create an action plan to mitigate them. This plan should be shared with the team, and the leader should remain accountable for its progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:34">[00:36:34]</a>. The goal is not to solve every problem, but to identify and address critical blind spots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:44">[00:36:44]</a>.

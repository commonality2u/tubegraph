Founders often apologize for how they want to run their company, attempting to find a midpoint between their vision and their team's preferences. This approach can lead to misery for everyone involved, as what people truly desire is clarity and the ability to work cohesively in the same direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Pushing for Bigger Thinking and 10x Goals

A key aspect of effective leadership is challenging people to think bigger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:03">[00:46:03]</a>. Brian Chesky, CEO of Airbnb, often asked his teams, "How do we 10x this?" or "What would it take to 10x this idea?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:11">[00:46:11]</a>. Surprisingly, this ambitious goal-setting often led to achieving these "crazy goals," or at least doubling them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:16">[00:46:16]</a>.

### The "Add a Zero" Exercise
The practice of conceptually "adding a zero" to a goal encourages teams to imagine something an order of magnitude bigger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:33">[00:46:33]</a>. This exercise forces a different way of thinking about the problem, as the current processes would not suffice for a 10x scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:01">[00:47:01]</a>. To achieve this, a deep understanding of the problem and breaking it down into its foundational elements (first-principle thinking) is necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:16">[00:47:16]</a>.

## Setting the Pace and Bias for Action
A crucial role for a founder leader is to set the pace for the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:40">[00:47:40]</a>. This pace is not merely about how hard people work, but about how decisive they are. Faster decisions, driven by a bias for action, significantly improve a company's speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:51">[00:47:51]</a>. Instead of postponing decisions, a bias for action means resolving issues in the moment, potentially accomplishing months of work in a shorter timeframe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:03">[00:48:03]</a>.

## Cultivating a Growth Mindset
Leaders should strive to see potential in their team members that they might not see in themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:57">[00:48:57]</a>. When pushing a team, the communication should foster a [[resilience_and_perseverance_in_startups | growth mindset]] organization, rather than creating demoralization. The belief that a team can do better stems from the leader's confidence in their capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:13">[00:49:13]</a>. The leader's job is to motivate the team to tap into their full potential, set a tempo, and engage in first-principle thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:47">[00:49:47]</a>.

## The Beginner's Mindset and Continuous Learning
Maintaining a "beginner's mindset" is essential for continued growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:19">[00:59:19]</a>. This means approaching the world with curiosity, seeing everything with fresh eyes, and avoiding premature judgments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:03">[01:00:03]</a>. Learning involves:
*   **Understanding sources**: Studying the history and origins of different organizational structures and ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:14">[01:00:14]</a>.
*   **Being shameless about seeking help**: Realizing that asking for help is often an honor for others who want to feel useful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:51">[01:00:51]</a>. Advice doesn't always have to come from someone far ahead; even those a year ahead can offer valuable, current insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:17">[01:01:17]</a>.
*   **Constant hunger and fire**: Maintaining a continuous desire to improve and evolve, embracing the idea that "I haven't made it yet" because if one feels "done," then progress ceases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:37">[01:01:37]</a>.
*   **Embracing evolution**: Like an artist in a "constant place of becoming," leaders should always be evolving, learning, and growing, as the "canvas keeps getting bigger" and the "mountain top keeps getting higher" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:06">[01:02:06]</a>. This constant evolution suggests that beliefs and methods should be subject to modification and improvement over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:48">[01:02:48]</a>.

This integrated approach of [[building_strategy_skills_and_effective_goals | setting ambitious goals]], fostering a proactive environment, and maintaining a humble, curious [[the_impact_of_personal_responsibility_and_mindset_on_avoiding_distractions | mindset]] is key to driving sustained growth and preventing bureaucracy in an organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>.

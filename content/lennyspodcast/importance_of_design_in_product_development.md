Design plays an increasingly critical role in the success of any product or company today. As industries mature and product categories become more crowded, the bar for design quality rises significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Design as a Basic Requirement

In any domain or industry, the more it matters, the more design matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. When new paradigms emerge, such as mobile or the web, early product iterations don't necessarily need to be exceptionally well-designed because they are the first of their kind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. However, once a category is established and hundreds or thousands of products exist (e.g., email clients), the standard for design becomes very high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

Today, high-level design is a basic requirement from the very beginning for a product to even gain attention or be considered seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:07">[02:42:07]</a>. Older companies like Google or YouTube launched with very basic web pages; launching something similar today would not capture attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:27">[02:26:27]</a>.

## Design as a Differentiator

Design can be a significant differentiator, especially in crowded markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:08">[02:04:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:08">[02:40:08]</a>. When users have many choices, they often gravitate towards what looks best or appears to be the highest quality product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.

While design is crucial, it is rarely the *sole* reason for a company's success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>. The product still needs to offer something better or different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>. Instead, design acts as an enabler, much like technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. Good design or a strong brand can attract users, aid in user acquisition and retention, and positively influence the perception of the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.

An example is product packaging, like Apple's, which sets expectations for a high-quality product even before it's used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>. Similarly, for SaaS products, a landing page and other initial touchpoints communicate the product's value and set expectations for the user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>. Design can provide significant leverage, particularly in the early stages when a company and its product are unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>.

## Cultivating a Design-Centric Culture

For companies aiming for high quality and craft in their products, valuing design is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>. This value must be instilled from the leadership down and reflected in hiring practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>.

### Product Sensibility in Hiring
When hiring, especially for roles like engineers, it's crucial to look beyond just technical skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>. Hiring for a "product sensibility" or "judgment" around design choices ensures that team members can articulate *why* certain design decisions are better than others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>. This means seeking individuals who have opinions about products, can form those opinions, and use their judgment, rather than just executing tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>.

### Ownership and Autonomy
Giving project teams, comprised of engineers and designers, ownership over their projects fosters [[operationalizing_quality_in_product_design | a culture of quality and craft]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>. As they build, they identify opportunities to improve the design and user experience. An example of this is an engineer proactively improving the right-click menu's interaction by adding "safe areas" for diagonal cursor movement, even when not explicitly asked to do so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.

### Iterative Design and Feedback
Even with a strong focus on design, the process does not always involve perfection from the outset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. Teams at Linear prioritize pushing things out quickly, often in early, unpolished stages, to internal teams and then to small groups of opt-in customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>. This allows for early feedback and identifies necessary improvements as the product is being built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>. The final polish and craft are applied before a full general release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. This approach balances the need for speed with the commitment to quality, preventing "perfection mindset" paralysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.

## Building an Authentic Brand through Design
An authentic brand is built over time through consistent actions, communication, customer treatment, and the design of the website and product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:59">[03:09:59]</a>. It's not merely about a logo or colors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>. For example, Airbnb's success is partly attributed to its strong brand, which makes users associate it with unique stays, bypassing other booking options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>. A well-designed brand can draw people in and solidify their perception of the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>.

Founders often fear that a startup's failure is the worst possible outcome. However, it's argued that a far worse fate is to be stuck in a "zombie undead company" that you hate but cannot leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This can lead to a mental health crisis among founders, a topic that isn't discussed enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Building a company you despise, which then becomes a harmful force in the world, is considered significantly worse than a startup failing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. Founders are encouraged to take this prospect more seriously early on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## The Nature of Pivots in Startups

A core concept in startup methodology, popularized by Eric Ries, is the [[Pivot strategies in startups | pivot]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. A pivot is defined as a change in strategy without a change in vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:07">[01:02:07]</a>. While the vision is ideally constant, the founder's vision itself often evolves and is discovered through the process of building the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:21">[01:02:21]</a>. This means that building a startup is, in large part, a process of self-discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:31">[01:02:31]</a>.

Data suggests that pivoting is a common occurrence in the startup world. Approximately a fifth of consumer startups and almost half (40%) of B2B companies end up pivoting to a completely different product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:27">[01:00:27]</a>. However, it can be challenging to assess a pivot from the outside, as founders may not openly admit to it, or the narrative may change over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:18">[01:01:18]</a>. Even in famous cases like Facebook, its founders reportedly moved on to other ideas, believing Facebook wasn't successful enough, until its viral growth became undeniable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>.

### Psychological Barriers to Pivoting
Founders often find it difficult to admit when their initial strategy isn't working. This is partly due to the psychological damage of acknowledging failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. Many entrepreneurs adamantly claim they never failed or pivoted, asserting that everything unfolded exactly as they initially envisioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:16">[01:00:16]</a>. This denial hinders learning, as the fundamental lesson of the scientific method is that if you cannot fail, you cannot learn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.

## Recognizing the Need for a Pivot
A key indicator that a pivot might be necessary is when a founder starts asking if they have product-market fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:57">[01:13:57]</a>. If you have time to ask that question, it likely means you don't. When a product is working, there's typically no time for self-reflection or anxiety; the whirlwind of growth consumes everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>.

Startups that are not working often find themselves in a state of diminishing returns, where every effort yields little to no positive outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:10">[01:15:10]</a>. This can manifest as incremental, but ultimately insignificant, improvements in metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:07">[01:16:07]</a>. This stagnation signals that the current approach may no longer be fruitful, similar to older scientific paradigms that cease to yield productive experiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:38">[01:15:38]</a>.

## Strategies for Deciding and Executing a Pivot

1.  **Admit the Truth**: The first step is to honestly admit that the current approach is not working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:24">[01:14:24]</a>.

2.  **Set Fixed Time Periods for Action**: If a team can't agree that the current strategy is failing, a practical approach is to dedicate a fixed period (e.g., six weeks) to focus 100% on a core assumption and rigorously test it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:36">[01:14:36]</a>. This intense, focused effort can quickly reveal whether the needle can be moved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:02">[01:15:02]</a>.

3.  **Brainstorm New Directions**:
    *   Engage the team in an open discussion: "If I could start this company over again, the thing I wish we were doing was..." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:15">[01:17:15]</a>.
    *   Often, multiple team members secretly share the same desire for a new direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:37">[01:17:37]</a>.
    *   If there are multiple promising ideas, allocate fixed timeboxes (e.g., one month per idea) to test each, even if it means pausing the old product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:59">[01:17:59]</a>.

4.  **Confront the "Zombie" Company**: For founders stuck in a "zombie company" that won't die, introspection is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:56">[01:32:56]</a>. Ask yourself: if you could magically start a new company right now, would it be this one? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:56">[01:32:56]</a> If not, it's okay to move on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:37">[01:38:37]</a>. The decision then becomes tactical: shut down, return money, or execute a hard pivot into a genuinely new venture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:43">[01:38:43]</a>. The ultimate challenge is the psychological identification of the founder with the company; the company's "death" feels like a personal death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:05">[01:59:05]</a>.

## The Importance of Learning and Experimentation
A central theme is that much of the initial work in a startup often goes to waste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:29">[01:31:29]</a>. An example shared illustrates how nearly two years of work on a partnership agreement for a stock exchange venture ultimately fell apart, proving to be a complete waste of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:47">[01:31:47]</a>. However, this failure spurred the team to be much faster and more effective in subsequent endeavors, demonstrating the power of learning from mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:50">[01:31:50]</a>.

Pivots, while appearing as stark changes, often maintain a "thread of connectivity" from the initial attempt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:07">[01:33:07]</a>. This could be a critical insight or an element of the first product that is carried over into the second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:41">[01:33:41]</a>. It's often the failure of the first idea that allows founders to truly appreciate the potential of the second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>.

The ability to learn and adapt is paramount. Startup founders, despite their confidence, frequently make "laughably wrong" assumptions, often trying to do 100 times more work than necessary to test a hypothesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:26">[01:43:26]</a>. The "first principles thinking" that underpins the Lean Startup approach encourages breaking down problems to their fundamental truths and experimenting to validate assumptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:55">[01:43:55]</a>. This contrasts with blindly following "Just So Stories" of successful companies without understanding the underlying reasons or applicability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>.

> "If you can't fail you can't learn" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:16">[01:15:16]</a>

This commitment to experimentation and learning is essential for [[Challenges and strategies for creating successful startups | startup success]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:10">[02:22:10]</a>. Rather than seeing a pivot as a failure, it's a necessary step in the continuous process of discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>. The ultimate aim is to find out the "catastrophic thing" that might destroy the company as soon as possible, allowing time to course-correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:27">[01:48:27]</a>. This requires courage more than mere intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:05">[01:13:05]</a>.

Amazon's culture is deeply influenced by its explicit [[using_operating_principles_to_guide_company_culture | operating principles]] and a strong emphasis on invention and customer obsession. Ethan Evans, a former Vice President at Amazon who spent 15 years with the company, highlights several key aspects of this culture, including specific leadership principles he helped to draft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>.

## Key Leadership Principles

Amazon's 14 core [[using_operating_principles_to_guide_company_culture | leadership principles]] serve as a guide for decision-making and behavior within the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>. These principles are part of [[building_and_scaling_a_companys_culture | building and scaling the company's culture]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:13">[01:01:13]</a>.

### Ownership
Ethan Evans contributed to drafting the "Ownership" principle for Amazon's second major revision of its [[using_operating_principles_to_guide_company_culture | leadership principles]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:19">[01:01:19]</a>. He proposed the impactful phrase: "An owner never says that's not my job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:27">[01:02:27]</a>. This principle emphasizes that employees should act as owners, taking responsibility for results and problems, even if they fall outside their direct purview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:32">[00:44:32]</a>. Ethan's personal experience of publicly failing Jeff Bezos reinforced the importance of owning mistakes and proactively updating leadership to rebuild trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:32">[00:44:32]</a>.

### Bias for Action
Ethan Evans also highlights "Bias for Action" as a favorite principle, noting that "speed matters in business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:30">[01:03:30]</a>. This principle encourages moving quickly, making reversible decisions, and valuing speed in a competitive environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:36">[01:03:36]</a>. While this approach can lead to gambles, it enables rapid advancement and innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:51">[01:03:51]</a>.

### Invent and Simplify & Think Big
These principles push employees to be inventive and think on a grand scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:55">[00:29:55]</a>. Jeff Bezos considers himself primarily an inventor, aiming to make Amazon an "Invention Machine" that systematically out-invents competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>.

## Culture of Invention

Amazon's culture fosters systematic invention, an area where Ethan Evans initially felt challenged but eventually thrived, accumulating over 70 patents during his 15 years there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:08">[00:30:08]</a>. Key aspects of this inventive culture include:
*   **Expertise** One must be knowledgeable in the area they wish to invent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>.
*   **Dedicated Time** Invention requires dedicated, focused time away from distractions, even if it's just two hours once a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:57">[00:30:57]</a>.
*   **Combining Existing Ideas** The most straightforward way to invent is by combining two existing concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:19">[00:31:19]</a>. An example is Ethan's drone delivery patent, which combined drone technology with the concept of an aircraft carrier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:05">[00:32:05]</a>.
*   **Long-term Expression** A single good idea can take years to fully express and optimize. Concepts like Amazon Prime (a 20-year-old idea) and Kindle (a decade-old idea) are continually refined and expanded, demonstrating that much of Amazon's innovation is in the optimization phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:02">[00:34:02]</a>.

## Dealing with Failure at Amazon

Ethan Evans recounts a significant failure early in his directorship at Amazon when the launch of the Amazon App Store, specifically its "test drive" feature, encountered critical database problems on launch day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:21">[00:41:21]</a>. Jeff Bezos, who had personally emphasized this feature in his launch letter, was highly frustrated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:50">[00:41:50]</a>.

Ethan's approach to navigating this crisis, which aligns with key Amazonian cultural values:
*   **[[authenticity_and_leadership_in_tech | Owning the problem]]:** He immediately took ownership of the issue, stating, "it's my fault I will deal with it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:32">[00:44:32]</a>.
*   **Proactive Communication:** He provided hourly updates on the progress and plan to Jeff Bezos and other leadership, building trust one hour at a time and preventing micromanagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:56">[00:43:56]</a>. This exemplifies effective [[leadership_and_communication_in_tech | communication in tech leadership]].
*   **Seeking Help:** Leveraging the internal network, Andy Jassy's AWS team provided critical database support, offering hundreds of machines as an immediate fix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:39">[00:45:39]</a>.
*   **Facing Challenges Directly:** Despite the public nature of the failure, Ethan chose to attend a pre-scheduled meeting with Bezos, sitting next to him, demonstrating a refusal to "chicken out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:12">[00:48:12]</a>. This direct interaction allowed Bezos to shift from public anger to a more human conversation, rebuilding the relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:38">[00:48:38]</a>.
*   **Learning and Adapting:** The experience taught Ethan to prioritize reliability over aggressive deadlines, adopting the motto "Fear The New York Times headline" to ensure high-visibility launches were robust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:51">[00:56:51]</a>. He also learned the importance of supporting junior engineers, regretting not reassuring a new college graduate who felt responsible for the database bug <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:59">[00:59:59]</a>.

This incident, despite its severity, did not derail Ethan's career; he was promoted to Vice President two years later, demonstrating Amazon's culture of learning from mistakes and re-earning trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:44">[00:49:44]</a>.

## Other Cultural Elements

*   **Customer Obsession:** Jeff Bezos prioritizes customer obsession as Amazon's core differentiator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:32">[01:04:32]</a>. This focus drives the continuous improvement of services like Prime, which has expanded to include numerous benefits beyond shipping to become a "no-brainer" for customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:56">[00:35:56]</a>.
*   **Leaders are Right A Lot:** This principle, now refined, emphasizes that leaders should actively work to disconfirm their beliefs and seek diverse perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:50">[01:07:50]</a>. This encourages constant questioning and adaptability in decision-making, crucial for a global customer base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:03">[01:08:03]</a>.
*   **Openness to Challenge:** While not always easy, Amazon's culture allows for challenging senior leadership if ideas are strong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>. Ethan's group successfully challenged Jeff Wilke on the initial omission of the "Ownership" principle, demonstrating that good ideas can influence decision-making at the highest levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>.

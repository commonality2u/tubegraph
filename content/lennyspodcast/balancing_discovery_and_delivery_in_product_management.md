Every item in a product backlog is a "bet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Whether or not discovery is conducted, it remains a bet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. The primary purpose of discovery is to help teams make "better bets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## The Continuous Nature of Product Work

A common misconception is that discovery and delivery are distinct phases, where one is completed before the other begins (e.g., "first I discover and then I deliver") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. However, product work is fundamentally continuous: "you're always delivering and you're always discovering" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. By developing a strong discovery habit, the quality of these "bets" improves over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

### Insights from Teresa Torres

Teresa Torres, a product coach and author of *[[continuous_product_discovery | Continuous Discovery Habits]]*, defines [[continuous_product_discovery | continuous discovery]] as building continuous feedback loops into the product development process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:45">[02:34:45]</a>. This approach recognizes that digital products are never truly "done" and require continuous iteration and improvement as customer needs evolve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>.

## Addressing Challenges in Discovery

### "No Time for Discovery"

The perception that there is "no time for discovery" often stems from outdated project-based research methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:09">[02:11:09]</a>. Instead of stopping all work to conduct research, the recommended approach is to continue making bets while simultaneously initiating discovery efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>. This parallel process allows for continuous improvement of bets over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>.

*   **Balancing Risk**: Sometimes, it makes sense to take a risky bet in business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>. However, consistently making risky bets due to zero discovery can harm future appetite for discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>.
*   **Sustainable Discovery**: [[continuous_product_discovery | Continuous discovery]] can be implemented with minimal time commitment, such as just one interview per week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>.
*   **Empowering Individual Contributors**: Even if an organization operates as a "feature factory," individual product managers can still integrate discovery practices by proactively seeking customer insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>. This involves finding customers to talk to, even outside formal company channels, and understanding how their work contributes to business outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>.

### Cynicism about User Research

Some larger companies may express cynicism about user research, particularly concerning the small number of people interviewed to make a decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:29">[04:32:29]</a>. However, making decisions based on one interview is still better than making them with no data at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>. The product world is focused on changing behavior, not just seeking new knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>. Small experiments and good feedback loops allow teams to make decisions based on smaller datasets, leading to more reliable data over time as products are delivered and iterated upon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:00">[04:34:00]</a>.

## Key Activities in Discovery

### Qualitative Interviewing

Qualitative interviewing aims to understand the "opportunity space" by identifying unmet needs, pain points, and desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>. This involves collecting customer stories by asking "tell me about the last time you [did something related to the product]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>. This approach uncovers context and nuance, leading to more reliable insights than direct questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>. Effective interviewing feels like a natural conversation, allowing the interviewer to be curious and delve deeper into specific moments and experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>.

### Assumption Testing

Assumption testing evaluates potential solutions by starting with specific underlying assumptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>. This involves breaking down an idea into its core assumptions, prioritizing them, and then running small, focused tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>. This contrasts with running large, time-consuming experiments that test an entire idea at once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>. For example, a team might run a "half a dozen to a dozen assumption tests in one week" across multiple ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>.

## Collaboration in Product Management

[[coaching_and_leadership_in_product_management | Coaching and leadership in product management]] often involves fostering effective collaboration. An ideal product team operates as a "trio" consisting of a product manager, a designer, and a software engineer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>. In a well-functioning trio, disagreements are reduced due to a shared understanding, and the team continuously seeks better options when conflicts arise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>. This collaborative approach moves away from a "CEO of the product" mentality and territorial disputes, promoting continuous "doing" and trial-and-error <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>.

The "Understand Work" methodology is a critical framework for product development, emphasized by Bengali Kaba, Director of Product Management at YouTube, and a former leader at Facebook, Instagram, and Instacart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. It advocates for a deep, foundational understanding of problems before rushing into solutions, aiming to drive significant and sustainable impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>.

## The Anti-Pattern: Identify, Justify, Execute

Kaba identifies a common "anti-pattern" in product development, which he calls "Identify, Justify, Execute" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:55">[00:31:55]</a>. In this approach, someone identifies something that "would be great to build" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>, then data is pulled to justify the idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>, leading to a significant time investment in building it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>. The frequent result is that the product doesn't succeed because key components, user pain points, or market alternatives were not truly understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:51">[00:29:51]</a>.

## The "Understand, Identify, Execute" Framework

In contrast, the "Understand, Identify, Execute" framework, which Kaba learned from Facebook, prioritizes thorough understanding from "first principles" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:41">[00:41:41]</a>.

### Why Understand Work Matters

Understand Work serves several crucial purposes:
*   **De-risking Projects** It intentionally de-risks a project by learning what's going on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>.
*   **Clarifying Root Causes & Opportunities** It helps clarify root causes, [[understanding_the_jobs_to_be_done_framework | jobs to be done]], and optimal use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:16">[00:29:16]</a>. For instance, at Instacart, understand work revealed that customers were trying to make "taco Tuesday" not just buy individual ingredients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>.
*   **Velocity Multiplier** By identifying gaps in knowledge and de-risking ideas, it creates "parallel paths of work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:56">[00:29:56]</a>. Teams can execute on high-conviction items while simultaneously conducting understand work for future initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:04">[00:30:04]</a>. This leads to a "velocity multiplier" over time, increasing clarity, execution speed, and the "win rate" of shipped products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:32">[00:30:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:43">[00:30:43]</a>.
*   **Higher Win Rate** At Instagram, by embracing understand work, teams achieved a 60-70% positive and shippable experiment rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:04">[00:31:04]</a>.
*   **Enabling Intelligent Execution** While it might seem counter-intuitive to "slow down" for growth, Kaba argues it leads to "better execution" and ultimately "speed up" growth in the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:30">[00:34:30]</a>.

## Operationalizing Understand Work

Understand Work is an "intentional affordance" in the execution process, meaning it must be explicitly planned and allocated time for, rather than assumed to happen in the background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:51">[00:27:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:06">[00:28:06]</a>.

### Balancing with Execution

The balance between understand work and execution shifts over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:57">[00:31:57]</a>. When a team is new to a problem space, the ratio might be higher, e.g., 60% execution and 40% understand work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a>. As understanding grows, the mix shifts towards more execution, such as 80-85% execution and 15-20% understand work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:08">[00:32:08]</a>. Teams are encouraged to choose three to four key "understand projects" for each roadmap or sprint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:30">[00:38:30]</a>.

### Cross-Functional Involvement

All functions on a team can and should be doing understand work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:17">[00:36:17]</a>:
*   **Engineers** might analyze code for refactoring or instrument logging to ensure data visibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:28">[00:36:28]</a>.
*   **Data Science** can focus on activation metrics or proxy metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:51">[00:36:51]</a>.
*   **Product Managers** might research partnership strategies or "dog food" products in an [[adjacent_user_theory | adjacent user state]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:23">[00:56:23]</a>, meaning they use the product as if they were a new user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:55">[00:56:55]</a>.
*   **Go-to-Market** and **Marketing** teams should also be included in the planning sessions to ensure all issues are understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:41">[00:37:41]</a>.

### Examples in Practice

*   **Instagram Onboarding**: When Kaba joined Instagram in 2016, the signup flow had minimal logging, making it impossible to see where users were dropping off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>. The first understand work involved instrumenting the funnel to gather data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:12">[00:40:12]</a>.
*   **YouTube Creator Monetization**: In YouTube's live experience, a team focused on paid virtual goods needed to first understand the "whole live ecosystem" and product flow before shipping iterations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:12">[00:33:12]</a>. This involved data science analysis, PM dog-fooding, and engineering instrumentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:57">[00:33:57]</a>.
*   **Facebook People Recommendations (India)**: In India, Facebook observed that users had fewer common friends and significant "friending and unfriending" behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:30">[01:26:30]</a>. Understand work involved on-the-ground observation, revealing that Western-centric profile fields (like school or job title) were irrelevant, and common names like "Amit Kumar" made finding friends difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:52">[01:27:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:44">[01:28:44]</a>. This led to creative solutions to solve the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:09">[01:29:09]</a>.
*   **Instagram Account Churn**: Millions of users were churning because they couldn't log back into their accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:24">[01:22:24]</a>. Understand work revealed that many users, particularly in South Asia and Southeast Asia, *wanted* to log out to save data or share phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:10">[01:21:10]</a>. The solution wasn't to restrict logging out, but to make logging back in easier through an "Omni box" for all login methods and saving credentials on trusted devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:01">[01:22:01]</a>. This initiative not only reduced churn but also unexpectedly revealed that users were creating multiple accounts, leading to the development of Instagram's seamless multiple account navigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:25">[01:23:25]</a>.

## Origin of the Framework

The "Understand, Identify, Execute" framework originated from Kaba's time at Facebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:57">[00:25:57]</a>. He has since championed and instituted it at Instagram, Instacart, Twitter, and YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:10">[00:26:10]</a>.

## Understanding Strategy

[[understanding_strategy_and_its_challenges | Strategy]] is often seen as a glamorous aspect of product management, involving philosophical thought about future outcomes and market trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:20">[00:38:20]</a>. However, its true purpose is to change team behavior to create better customer outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:01">[00:44:01]</a>. Without a tangible change in product or building methods, a [[Product Strategy and Vision Development | strategy]] exercise merely serves to make the team feel good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:33">[00:44:33]</a>.

### Execution Eats Strategy for Breakfast
The adage "execution eats [[understanding_strategy_and_its_challenges | strategy]] for breakfast" highlights the critical importance of implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:06">[00:38:06]</a>. Customers are not concerned with a company's [[Product Strategy and Vision Development | fancy strategies]] or five-year plans; they care about the product in their hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:37">[00:38:37]</a>.

A perfect [[Product Strategy and Vision Development | strategy]] with poor execution yields no win and no learning, as it never reaches the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:05">[00:39:05]</a>. Conversely, a "good enough" [[Product Strategy and Vision Development | strategy]] coupled with perfect execution allows for learning, iteration, and improvement until the [[Product Strategy and Vision Development | strategy]] is perfected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:24">[00:39:24]</a>.

While strategy can be fun and glamorous, execution often involves the "nuts and bolts" and "grinding out work," such as reviewing dashboards or rewriting specifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:27">[00:40:27]</a>. This diligent effort is what ultimately leads to customer outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>. Product managers should aim to spend roughly 20% of their time on strategy, with the majority dedicated to confirming that the [[Product Strategy and Vision Development | strategy]] is sound for customers, building the product, and continuously improving it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:07">[00:42:07]</a>. Even at senior levels, the focus remains on ensuring strategies can reach the market and understanding what hinders progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>.

### Becoming a Better Strategic Thinker
For those looking to improve their [[understanding_strategy_and_its_challenges | strategic thinking]], Amy Vora recommends several approaches:
*   **Customer Engagement** Regularly speak with customers to gain unique insights and build an "emulator" of their needs and perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:32">[00:46:32]</a>.
*   **Product Iteration** Consider how various product iterations would align with desired outcomes or product portfolios in the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:55">[00:46:55]</a>.
*   **Solicit Opinions** Conduct surveys or discussions with leadership to gauge alignment on strategic topics, addressing disagreements explicitly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:12">[00:47:12]</a>.
*   **Embrace Opinion and Adaptability** Overcome self-confidence or impostor syndrome to express your own opinions on how the world might evolve, trusting in the "execution machine" to test, iterate, and adapt based on feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:39">[00:47:39]</a>.

## Setting Effective Goals and Aligning Teams

Effective goal setting is crucial for preventing "toddler soccer," a scenario where all teams converge on the same measurable outcome, leading to inefficiency and tripping over each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:56">[00:56:56]</a>.

### Decoupling Goals
To avoid this, it's vital to decouple goals, allowing each team to have a distinct objective that contributes to a larger framework of customer impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:23">[00:57:23]</a>. For example, instead of every team targeting gross merchandise value (GMV), break it down:
*   Goal teams on GMV per surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:34">[00:58:34]</a>.
*   Goal on underlying input metrics like number of visits, conversions, or reorders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:48">[00:58:48]</a>.

The chosen metrics should best match the overall customer outcome and mirror company objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:08">[00:59:08]</a>. They must be genuinely connected to the output metric and customer problem, not merely designed to make a team feel good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:27">[00:59:27]</a>.

### Managing Team Dynamics and Disagreements
It's important to acknowledge that teams, even within the same cross-functional unit, will have different incentives and information, leading to disagreements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:03">[01:00:03]</a>. This is a sign of healthy tension and diverse knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:29">[01:00:29]</a>. To manage this:
*   **Acknowledge Tension** Recognize that disagreements are normal and do not indicate poor intent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:39">[01:00:39]</a>.
*   **Agree on Outcomes** Ensure everyone agrees on the overarching company or customer outcome being pursued. If not, it signals a deeper structural issue requiring escalation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:54">[01:00:54]</a>.
*   **Open Discussion** Frame disagreements as conversations about the best way to achieve agreed-upon outcomes, leveraging diverse information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:11">[01:01:11]</a>.

Ultimately, customer value and company value are rarely adversarial in the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:41">[01:16:41]</a>. Focusing on [[key_strategies_and_practices_for_effective_product_management_and_team_building | long-term customer impact]] via metrics is crucial for sustained success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:18">[01:17:18]</a>.

### The "Dinosaur Brain" Metaphor for Product Reviews
When presenting in product reviews, especially to executives, it's helpful to remember the "dinosaur brain" metaphor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:16">[01:18:16]</a>. Executives often have limited capacity to go deep on every detail, so presentations should:
*   **Keep it Simple** Focus on conveying minimal, essential information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:51">[02:22:51]</a>.
*   **Provide a Clear Recommendation** The presenter's primary service is to make a definitive recommendation, not just catalog information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:32">[01:18:32]</a>. This forces the presenter to be opinionated and deeply understand the material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:57">[02:33:57]</a>.
*   **Calibrate on Principles, Not Just Decisions** Product reviews should aim to establish principles for future decision-making, reducing the need for constant review of every single decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:50">[02:00:50]</a>.
*   **Start with Problem and Timeline** Clearly state the problem being solved and the relevant timeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:51">[02:21:51]</a>.
*   **Smaller, Cross-Functional Groups** Fewer people lead to more informal, faster conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:40">[02:33:40]</a>. Cross-functional participation at both leadership and presenting levels ensures accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:13">[02:14:13]</a>. Implicit trust is needed if managers are not present in the room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:17">[02:44:17]</a>.

### Using Metaphors and Imagery
Using metaphors and imagery is a powerful [[key_strategies_and_practices_for_effective_product_management_and_team_building | strategy]] for rallying teams and conveying complex ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:27">[02:26:27]</a>. Amy Vora employs several such metaphors:
*   **"Putting on the Coat of the Job"** This metaphor helps evaluate a potential role by imagining daily interactions, commutes, and problems to solve, evoking an emotional response that is more telling than a spreadsheet analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.
*   **The "Hill Climb"** This illustrates the difference between optimizing a "local optimum" (current good situation) and pursuing a "global optimum" (a much higher, distant mountain) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:55">[02:56:55]</a>. It acknowledges that reaching the higher goal requires descending into an "unknown chasm" or "valley," which can feel like a slog, but ultimately yields greater rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:17">[02:59:17]</a>. The key is remembering "what the summit feels like" to endure the valley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>.
*   **"Fascinating"** When faced with profound disagreement, responding with genuine curiosity, "Fascinating, you have to tell me more why you think that," can tear down walls and lead to learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. This approach shifts the focus from being "right" to achieving the best outcome and personal learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>.

When [[developing_a_product_strategy | developing a product strategy]] or vision, consider:
*   What feeling should the users experience when using the product? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>
*   Where else have they felt that same way? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:39">[03:39:39]</a>
*   For WhatsApp, the metaphor was "face-to-face communication," aiming to make users feel connected as if talking in person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:11">[03:12:11]</a>. This guided small design decisions, like typing indicators, to create a feeling of presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>.

### The Amy Vora "Emulator"
Vora suggests building "emulators" for different people in one's head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:19">[03:19:19]</a>. This involves imagining how a specific leader (like Eric Antino for metaphors, Bos for principles, or Rob Goldman for metrics) would approach a problem, providing a fresh lens and new tools for problem-solving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:37">[03:37:37]</a>.

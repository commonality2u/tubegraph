Shopify operates with a unique approach to product development, particularly concerning its core product teams, where traditional Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are effectively banned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>. This distinctive method is a core part of [[shopifys_approach_to_product_development_without_kpis | Shopify's approach to product development]] and is influenced by a century-long vision for commerce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:18">[01:15:18]</a>.

## Why KPIs are Banned for Core Product Teams

At Shopify, core product teams are not driven by specific metrics or KPIs; instead, decisions are made based on "taste and intuition" and by building towards a long-term, 100-year vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>. The core product group focuses on creating the "right things for Commerce 100 years from now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.

This philosophy is rooted in the belief that an over-reliance on short-term conversion rates can lead to perverse incentives, where teams might inadvertently make it harder for users to complete earlier steps in a funnel just to boost their local conversion numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. For instance, making it harder to sign up could artificially increase the sign-up-to-activation rate by only allowing higher-intent users through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.

Instead, the emphasis is on the **absolute number of people** who complete a stage of the journey, rather than just the conversion rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>. This encourages making processes easier and reducing friction to get more people in the door, even if it might "hurt your conversion rate" initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>.

## How Decisions Are Made Without Traditional KPIs

For the core product team, accountability is not tied to specific metrics over a six-month period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>. Instead, it's about whether "we ship the right thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>. This conviction is derived from various lenses:
*   **Data** Data is still looked at, but it's only "a piece of their puzzle" and not the overriding factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>.
*   **Qualitative Insights** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:00">[04:19:00]</a>.
*   **Product Sense** or intuition about what is good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>.

The company is structured with different parts of the organization operating on different time horizons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>:
*   **Core Product**: Builds for the 100-year future of commerce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.
*   **Merchant Services**: Focuses on shorter to medium-term tools like payments and shipping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>.
*   **Growth Team**: Looks at the end-to-end customer journey, measuring impact over long time horizons, often revisiting experiments years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>.

For the growth team, every experiment is continually monitored, with automated updates at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months to assess the true long-term impact on Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. This reveals that about 30-40% of experiments showing short-term lifts actually have no long-term impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. In some cases, initial neutral results can become positive over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>.

## Pros and Cons of Banning KPIs

**Pros:**
*   **Long-Term Vision**: The primary benefit is the ability to focus on long-term product excellence and take risks on features that might not show immediate metric lifts but are crucial for the 100-year vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>.
*   **Technical Architecture**: There's a strong emphasis on the "how" of building products, ensuring a robust and adaptable technical architecture that determines long-term strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>.

**Cons:**
*   **Subjectivity**: Without clear metrics, conversations about what constitutes the "right thing to do" can become "extremely subjective" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>. This requires open discussions and strong leadership to maintain a consistent "bar for taste" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>.

## Role of Founder and Leadership

This model heavily relies on "a very opinionated founder" or a small group of leaders who have "extremely strong opinions on what good is and what taste is" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:59:00">[09:59:00]</a>. At Shopify, CEO Toby (Tobi LÃ¼tke) and Head of Core Product Glenn play this role, deeply involved in reviewing every project every six weeks, often delving into "incredible technical detail" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>. Every shipped project needs a "negative-two approval" from group leads like Glenn or Archie, ensuring a consistent quality bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>.

This approach creates a healthy tension between core product teams (focused on taste and long-term vision) and growth teams (focused on driving absolute numbers and learning from long-term experiments) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a>. This tension is managed through trust and a commitment to high-quality output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>.

For most companies, relying on metrics for accountability is more common and often more successful, as truly "good taste" founders are rare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:02:00">[10:02:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:00">[10:04:00]</a>. Without strong taste leadership, banning KPIs can lead to a "haphazard" state where teams build "a bunch of cool stuff" without clear direction or accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:58:00">[09:58:00]</a>.

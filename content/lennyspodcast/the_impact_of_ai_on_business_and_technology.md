The advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is considered by many, including HubSpot co-founder and CTO Daresh Shaw, to be a transformative event comparable to the early days of the internet. Having spent 30 years in commercial software, Shaw notes that while he's seen the rise of mobile and social technologies, nothing has registered on the "Rotor scale" quite like AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:51">[01:31:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:27">[01:32:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:37">[01:32:37]</a>.

## AI as Cognition at Scale
Historically, computing advancements have brought different forms of scale:
*   **Early PCs** provided "compute at scale" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:44">[01:32:44]</a>.
*   **The Internet** enabled "distribution at scale," allowing information and products to reach masses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:52">[01:32:52]</a>.
*   **AI** now introduces "cognition at scale" â€“ the unprecedented ability to literally amplify the human brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:01">[01:33:01]</a>. This is evidenced by working products like Chat GPT, which are already changing lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:09">[01:33:09]</a>.

[[the_impact_of_ai_on_musthave_skills_and_startup_strategies | AI unlocks massive opportunities]], particularly for startups, allowing for a reimagining of the world that was not possible before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:29">[01:33:29]</a>.

## Shift to Declarative Models
Software products are often described as "intuitive," but users typically have to translate their mental models into a series of clicks, drags, and swipes to accomplish tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:02">[01:34:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:15">[01:34:15]</a>. This "impedance mismatch" is a core challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:31">[01:34:31]</a>.

AI offers a fundamental shift from an "imperative" (step-by-step instructions) model to a "declarative" model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:43">[01:34:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:56">[01:34:56]</a>. In a declarative model, users describe the desired outcome, not the steps to achieve it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:58">[01:34:58]</a>. An analogy is SQL (Structured Query Language), where users describe the data they want, and the database figures out how to retrieve it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:06">[01:35:06]</a>.

With AI, this declarative approach can be applied to interfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:31">[01:35:31]</a>. Users can express their desires directly (e.g., "generate a report of all my customers in Europe from last quarter who spent more than 100K ARR") through text or voice, and the software can execute it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:35">[01:35:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:48">[01:35:48]</a>. This capability did not exist before AI, making software truly intuitive by removing the translation layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:53">[01:35:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:53">[01:36:53]</a>.

## The Case Study of Chatspot / Growth Bot
Daresh Shaw previously built a product called Growth Bot six and a half years ago, which was a chatbot for HubSpot and other business software, similar to what Chatspot is today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:02">[01:36:02]</a>. The "teeny tiny small problem" was that "it didn't work really well" because the underlying technology for AI wasn't yet capable of delivering the necessary fidelity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:13">[01:36:13]</a>. The advent of modern AI has allowed Shaw to "prove out [his] theory" with Chatspot, demonstrating the viability of this declarative approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:31">[01:36:31]</a>.

## Advice for Learning and Adopting AI
To understand and leverage AI effectively, especially for [[the_impact_of_ai_on_musthave_skills_and_startup_strategies | future skills]] and relevance, Shaw offers practical advice:
*   **Solve a Real Problem:** Instead of trying to learn AI in the abstract, find an actual problem you care about and try to solve it using AI tools or APIs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:45">[01:37:45]</a>.
*   **Set Measurable Goals:** Just as Shaw used "laughs per minute" to improve his comedy, having a clear, measurable goal for your AI project provides tangible motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:07">[01:38:07]</a>.
*   **Build in Public:** Share your learning journey and projects publicly. The internet excels at providing feedback, even if it's critical, which helps in continuous improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:35">[01:38:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:05">[01:39:05]</a>.

This hands-on, problem-driven approach is crucial for navigating the evolving landscape of [[impacts_of_ai_on_data_science_and_marketplace_operations | AI's impact on business and technology]].

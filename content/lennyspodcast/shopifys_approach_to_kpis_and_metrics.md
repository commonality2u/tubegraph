Shopify, a highly successful e-commerce platform, employs a distinct and often counter-intuitive approach to [[metrics_and_measuring_product_success | metrics]] and [[key_performance_indicators_for_marketplaces | KPIs]], particularly within its product and [[organizational_structure_of_shopifys_growth_team | growth teams]]. Led by VP of Product and Head of Growth Archie Abrams, Shopify's philosophy is deeply influenced by a long-term, "hundred-year vision" set by CEO Tobi LÃ¼tke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:15">[01:15:15]</a>.

## Core Philosophy: The Hundred-Year Vision

Shopify's priorities and product roadmap are driven by a long-term vision for commerce, extending 100 years into the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:02">[01:15:02]</a>. This long-term outlook allows the company to make decisions that may not yield immediate short-term gains but are crucial for sustained success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>.

### Metrics are Secondary to Long-Term Impact

A significant aspect of Shopify's approach is that core product teams do not have [[metrics_and_measuring_product_success | metrics]] or [[key_performance_indicators_for_marketplaces | KPIs]]; they are essentially "banned" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:59">[01:21:59]</a>, as are [[tips_for_successful_personal_and_professional_okr_use | OKRs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:02">[01:34:02]</a>. Instead, decisions for core product are made based on "taste and intuition" and building towards the long-term vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:26">[01:24:26]</a>.

> "The how the technical architecture determines strategy in a technology company even more than the kind of what and who we're building for." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:20">[01:45:20]</a>
> "It truly is do we have conviction that this is the right technical Foundation to build the future of Commerce." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:52">[01:48:52]</a>

While data is consulted, it's not the "overwriting" factor determining whether a feature is shipped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:02">[01:49:02]</a>. This approach fosters innovation and risk-taking but can lead to subjective discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:42">[01:49:42]</a>. The quality and "taste" bar is maintained by a small number of senior leaders, including Tobi and Glenn (Head of Core Product) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:13">[01:51:13]</a>. All projects require a -2 approval (two levels up from the project lead) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:55">[01:52:55]</a>.

## Growth Team's Approach to Metrics

Unlike core product, the [[growth_strategies_at_shopify | growth team]] does use [[metrics_and_measuring_product_success | metrics]], but with a unique focus on total value over long periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:54">[01:19:54]</a>.

### Optimizing for Churn and Total GMV

Shopify's [[growth_strategies_at_shopify | growth team]] uniquely "optimizes for churn" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:07">[01:31:07]</a>. Their mission is to increase entrepreneurship online by lowering barriers to entry, even if most businesses ultimately fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:14">[01:07:14]</a>. Because Shopify's revenue heavily relies on payments (tied to merchant success), the success of a few large merchants makes up for many smaller ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:39">[01:07:39]</a>.

The key metric for the [[growth_strategies_at_shopify | growth team]] is the total Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV) produced by a cohort of merchants over multiple years (1, 2, 3+ years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:30">[01:27:30]</a>. This is analogous to angel investing, where a few outlier successes drive the overall portfolio's return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:47">[01:09:47]</a>.

### Focus on Absolute Numbers, Not Ratios

Teams are incentivized to focus on the *total number of people* who complete a stage of the journey, rather than local conversion rates or percentages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:51">[01:09:51]</a>. This prevents the common pitfall of teams "making it harder" for users to enter their funnel stage to artificially boost their conversion rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:51">[01:27:51]</a>. For example, making it easier to sign up might hurt the sign-up-to-activation conversion rate but bring in more total activated users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:56">[01:28:56]</a>.

## Experimentation with Long-Term Holdouts

Shopify runs [[growth_strategies_at_shopify | experiments]] with "long-term holdouts" to understand their true impact over extended periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:39">[01:13:39]</a>.
*   **Methodology:** They hold out a percentage of users (e.g., 5%) from seeing changes or take a 50-50 split for new merchants. After a few weeks, the winner is shipped to 100%, but the original cohorts are tracked for years (1, 2, 3 years later) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:01">[02:11:01]</a>.
*   **Tooling:** An internal experimentation tool automatically emails experimenters with updated results at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, preventing teams from ignoring long-term outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:55">[02:19:55]</a>.
*   **Key Finding:** Approximately 30-40% of [[growth_strategies_at_shopify | experiments]] that show a short-term lift in metrics (like sign-ups or first sales) have *no incremental long-term lift in GMV* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. This often indicates the change merely "pulled forward" success that would have occurred anyway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:41">[03:07:41]</a>.
    *   **Example (No Long-Term Lift):** Improving payment failure notifications initially boosted short-term metrics. However, a year later, there was no long-term GMV lift, suggesting those users weren't committed entrepreneurs anyway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>.
*   **Counterintuitive Wins:** Sometimes, [[growth_strategies_at_shopify | experiments]] with neutral short-term results lead to massive long-term impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:21">[01:51:21]</a>.
    *   **Example (Neutral Short-Term, Long-Term Win):** Pre-filling sections in the online store editor showed no short-term lift in conversion to paying merchants. However, six months later, it had a "pretty massive impact" on the number of people selling and producing GMV, as it helped users create better stores, leading to early sales and sustained momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:47">[04:08:47]</a>. This encourages shipping "neutral" [[growth_strategies_at_shopify | experiments]] if intuition supports them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:23">[04:21:23]</a>.

## Collaboration Between Teams

Shopify fosters intentional "healthy tension" between its product groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:52">[01:49:52]</a>.
*   **Core Product:** Focuses on building the "right thing" for the long-term, based on conviction and taste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:13">[01:52:13]</a>.
*   **Growth Team:** Drives [[metrics_and_measuring_product_success | metrics]] on a shorter-term basis but ensures high-quality shipping and long-term monitoring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:48">[01:48:48]</a>.
*   **Conflict Resolution:** Disagreements are common (e.g., over "wizards" or specific UI changes) but are resolved through trust and a willingness to run tests and monitor long-term impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:19">[05:52:19]</a>.

## Integration of Sales and Hybrid Journeys

Shopify, traditionally product-led, has successfully integrated a sales motion. This has revealed challenges with traditional [[metrics_and_measuring_product_success | metrics]] and attribution models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:59">[01:59:59]</a>.
*   **Attribution Complexity:** When a user starts with self-service (e.g., via an ad) and then transitions to sales, traditional separate LTV (Lifetime Value) models for self-service and sales-driven merchants lead to suboptimal investment decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:59">[06:03:59]</a>.
*   **Shift to Incrementality:** The focus is moving towards [[defining_business_metrics_and_incentives | incrementality]] testing as the "gold standard" to causally understand what drives outcomes across various channels and hybrid journeys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:36">[06:05:36]</a>.

## Conclusion

Shopify's distinctive approach to [[metrics_and_measuring_product_success | KPIs]] and [[defining_business_metrics_and_incentives | incentives]] allows for both rapid experimentation and long-term strategic building. By prioritizing total value over rates and leveraging deep, long-term data analysis, they avoid common pitfalls of short-term optimization, enabling sustained growth and a focus on building a truly foundational product for the future of commerce. This model largely depends on strong, opinionated founders with excellent taste and intuition, or alternatively, a robust [[metrics_and_measuring_product_success | metrics]] system for accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:05">[01:00:05]</a>.

This article explores various facets of [[becoming_more_strategic | strategic thinking]] and effective goal setting, drawing insights from Amy Vora, Chief Product Officer at Fair, and her extensive career at Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp.

## Cultivating Strategic Thinking

Amy Vora emphasizes that [[effective_leadership_and_strategic_thinking | strategic thinking]] is a learned skill, often requiring personal growth and a shift in mindset.
Her experience shows that while it's natural to "enjoy being right," true success in the working world comes from prioritizing the outcome over personal validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. This involves sublimating one's ego and acknowledging that others possess valuable information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:54">[01:11:54]</a>.

> [!quote] Embracing Curiosity
> Working with Amy, it was like watching an alien because she could have the most profound disagreement in the world with somebody and they would say something that she thought was not just wrong but crazy wrong and she would respond fascinating you have to tell me more why you think that and she meant it from the core of her being she saw this Schism and rather than reacting as if it was a threat she reacted with the most genuine and profound curiosity I just watched it absolutely tear down walls between points of view embracing curiosity in those moments of challenge has completely changed my life and I owe that to amior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>

This approach transforms disagreements into opportunities for learning and discovery, making work more interesting and leading to better collective outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:12">[01:12:12]</a>. The key is to reinterpret visceral reactions to disagreement as chances to learn more, fostering an "open" rather than "closing" mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>. A simple pause can help calm the mind and lead to a more constructive response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:29">[01:16:29]</a>.

### The Hill Climb Metaphor
Amy uses the "hill climb" metaphor to explain the difference between a local optimum and a global optimum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:58">[00:36:58]</a>.
It illustrates the difficult decision to abandon a comfortable, optimized current system (the top of a hill) to cross an "unknown chasm" and climb a much higher "mountain" (a better, but riskier, future state) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:02">[00:27:02]</a>. This applies to big strategic shifts, like transitioning from desktop to mobile business models, or even personal career changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:51">[00:27:51]</a>. The struggle in the "valley" is normal, and remembering the feeling of the "summit" helps get through it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a>.

### Leveraging Metaphors and Imagery
Amy advocates for using metaphors and imagery to unify and [[unique_teambuilding_and_operational_strategies | rally teams]], convey complex ideas, and ensure consistent product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
*   **User Feeling as Metaphor Source**: When developing a product, consider what feeling you want users to experience and connect that to an existing real-world analogy. For instance, for WhatsApp, the guiding metaphor was "face-to-face communication" to convey intimacy and ease, like sitting around a kitchen table with family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:09">[00:31:09]</a>.
*   **"Putting on the Coat of the Job"**: To assess a potential role, mentally "put on the coat of the job" to envision the daily routine, interactions, and problems to solve, gauging the emotional response rather than relying solely on a spreadsheet of career projections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.
*   **"Dinosaur Brain" for Executives**: To explain why executives need concise recommendations, Amy uses the "dinosaur brain" metaphor, suggesting senior leaders can only hold about three facts at once due to the breadth of information they process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>. This encourages team members to make clear recommendations rather than simply presenting all available data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>.
*   **Building Emulators for Different Thinkers**: To broaden her own strategic toolkit, Amy imagines how different successful leaders (like Eric Antino for user feeling, or Rob Goldman for metrics) would approach a problem, effectively "loading" their thinking into her mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:19">[00:30:19]</a>.

## The Role of Execution in Strategy

> [!quote] Execution Beats Strategy
> "Customers don't care about your fancy strategies and like your Five-Year Plan they care about the product that's in their hands." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:43">[00:38:43]</a>
> "If you have great strategy perfect strategy but poor execution you don't win because your strategy never makes it to the market and what's even worse is that you have learned nothing." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:05">[00:39:05]</a>

Amy strongly believes that "[[creating_a_winning_product_strategy | execution eats strategy for breakfast]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>. While strategy is fun and philosophical, it's the on-the-ground execution that directly impacts customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:37">[00:38:37]</a>. A good-enough strategy with perfect execution is more valuable than a perfect strategy with poor execution because it allows for learning and iteration in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:24">[00:39:24]</a>.

> [!tip] Proportion of Time on Strategy vs. Execution
> For product managers, Amy suggests spending about 20% of time on strategy and the bulk of the time on confirming that strategy makes sense for customers, building the machine to constantly improve it, and getting it out there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:00">[00:42:00]</a>. Even at senior levels, a significant portion of time should be spent understanding what's slowing people down, unblocking issues, and continuously improving the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:05">[00:43:05]</a>.

### Strategic Shifts and Behavior Change
For strategy to be truly useful, it must change team behavior to create better customer outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:59">[00:43:59]</a>. A shiny five-year plan is meaningless if it doesn't lead to concrete changes in product development or resource allocation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:21">[00:44:21]</a>.

## Effective Goal Setting and Team Alignment

Amy is recognized for her ability to set goals and align incentives well across teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:08">[00:56:08]</a>, particularly in [[engineering_leadership_and_management_strategies | building product organizations]] and fostering collaboration.

> [!tip] Decouple Goals to Avoid "Toddler Soccer"
> Instead of giving all teams the same high-level goal (e.g., "get revenue" or "get GMV"), which leads to everyone "tripping on each other" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:56">[00:56:56]</a>, decouple goals. Assign different, distinct goals to each team that ladder into a broader framework, covering the entire customer journey and matching individual team contributions to overall success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:23">[00:57:23]</a>. This means focusing on input metrics that lead to the desired output, ensuring clarity and allowing teams to make progress in their own "lanes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:39">[00:58:39]</a>.

### Managing Healthy Tension and Disagreement
It's crucial to acknowledge that teams, even within the same cross-functional unit, will have different incentives and information, leading to disagreements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:03">[01:00:03]</a>. This is often a sign of healthy tension and diverse knowledge, not poor intent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:29">[01:00:29]</a>. If teams agree on the ultimate company or customer outcome, then discussions become about finding the best way to achieve that goal using everyone's different information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:54">[01:00:54]</a>.

### Product Reviews
For product reviews, the goal should be to calibrate on principles, not just get specific decisions approved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:31">[00:20:31]</a>.
*   **Focus on Principles**: Reviews should aim to establish principles for future decision-making, empowering teams to make consistent choices without constant oversight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:53">[00:20:53]</a>.
*   **Keep it Simple**: Present the minimal amount of information needed to make a clean recommendation, forcing opinionated thinking and deep understanding of the material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>.
*   **Discuss Trade-offs**: Focus on *why* decisions were made, the trade-offs considered, who is being optimized for, timelines, and risk levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:35">[00:21:35]</a>.
*   **Fewer People, Informal Setting**: Smaller, more informal meetings often lead to faster progress, as they lower the bar for how "complete" a conversation needs to be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>.
*   **Cross-Functional Accountability**: Ensure both the presenting team and leadership are cross-functional to foster shared accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:15">[00:24:15]</a>.

## Personal Growth and Leadership

Amy's journey highlights the challenges and evolution in [[building_a_longterm_career_strategy | career growth]], particularly for women in tech.

### Overcoming Imposter Syndrome and Finding Your Voice
Amy struggled with imposter syndrome, feeling she couldn't "declare a strategy" without knowing everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:50">[00:45:50]</a>. Overcoming this involved:
*   **Direct Customer Interaction**: Gaining unique knowledge of customers by talking to them directly and building an "emulator" for their perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:32">[00:46:32]</a>.
*   **Product Iterations**: Thinking through product portfolios in three to five years to see which outcomes feel rational and right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:55">[00:46:55]</a>.
*   **Seeking Diverse Opinions**: Running surveys or engaging leadership to understand different perspectives on future trends and strategic ramifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:12">[00:47:12]</a>.
*   **Trusting Iteration**: Becoming comfortable with having an opinion, knowing that an "execution machine" exists to test, iterate, and improve based on feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:50">[00:47:50]</a>.

### Navigating Feedback as a Woman in Tech
Amy notes that women often receive feedback focused on "style" rather than "content" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:59">[00:52:59]</a>, sometimes presenting a "narrow tightrope" of diametrically opposite expectations (e.g., "be more directive" vs. "be less directive") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:38">[00:52:38]</a>. The key is to learn to *interpret* and *choose how to respond* to feedback, deciding whether to act on it immediately, look for themes, or acknowledge it but continue operating in a preferred style while providing more context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:20">[00:53:20]</a>. Instead of "shrinking yourself," the goal should be to expand your toolkit, adding more ways to operate and express yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:38">[00:55:38]</a>.

### The "Suboptimal" Nature of Senior Decisions
As one gains seniority, the problems encountered are often fundamentally unsolvable in a perfect way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:08">[01:02:08]</a>. Leaders are often choosing the "least bad" or "best possible for the time" suboptimal decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:58">[01:02:58]</a>. Recognizing this helps normalize the difficulty of the role and allows leaders to focus on having impact despite visible imperfections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:44">[01:03:44]</a>.

## Final Advice

*   **Focus on the Customer**: The most important thing for product professionals, especially as organizations scale, is to constantly think about and advocate for the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:31">[01:15:31]</a>. Creating value for the customer is almost always aligned with company value in the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:41">[01:16:41]</a>.
*   **Energy or Ambition**: A powerful piece of advice: "You can either have more energy or less ambition" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:43">[01:19:43]</a>. To achieve significant impact, one must be willing to put in the work, try new things, and embrace discomfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:59">[01:19:59]</a>.

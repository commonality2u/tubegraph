[[candor_and_feedback_in_professional_growth | Candor and feedback]] are crucial for professional growth and effective [[leadership_and_communication_in_tech | leadership]]. Kim Scott, author of "Radical Candor," offers a framework and practical advice for cultivating a culture of direct yet caring communication in the workplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:10">[01:13:10]</a>. Her book, which has sold over 1 million copies and been translated into 23 languages, is a frequently referenced resource for improving professional interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>.

## What is Radical Candor?

Radical Candor is defined as the intersection of caring personally and challenging directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. It's a 2x2 framework where the vertical axis represents "care personally" and the horizontal axis represents "challenge directly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

The framework identifies four quadrants:
*   **Radical Candor**: Occurs when you both care personally and challenge directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
*   **Obnoxious Aggression**: Characterized by challenging directly but failing to show personal care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. This style hurts others and is inefficient because it puts people in a "fight or flight" mode, making them unable to hear the message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. It's not the spirit of Radical Candor, but rather acting like "a garden variety jerk" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.
*   **Ruinous Empathy**: Occurs when you care personally but fail to challenge directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. This is the most common problem, with about 90% of mistakes falling into this category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. It creates a "false harmony" that is detrimental in the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>.
*   **Manipulative Insincerity**: The worst quadrant, where there is neither personal care nor direct challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. This often stems from self-protective behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

## Why Radical Candor Matters

Practicing Radical Candor builds better relationships, leads to better work, increases success, and promotes happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

### The "Um" Story: The Power of Direct Feedback
Kim Scott recounts an experience at Google where her boss, Sheryl Sandberg, provided direct feedback about her excessive use of "um" during presentations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. Initially dismissive, Scott eventually recognized the value of the feedback when her boss directly stated that saying "um" every third word made her "sound stupid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. This bluntness, combined with genuine care (demonstrated by offering to pay for a speech coach and showing support during a family crisis), motivated Scott to improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>. This experience highlighted that effective feedback, tailored to the individual, can be a profound act of kindness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.

### The "Bob" Story: The Dangers of Ruinous Empathy
Scott also shared a story about "Bob," a charming but underperforming employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>. Despite liking Bob, Scott gave him unspecific, sugar-coated feedback, fearing to hurt his feelings (ruinous empathy) and concerned about her own reputation (manipulative insincerity) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:51">[00:22:51]</a>. This went on for ten months, negatively impacting the entire team as their deliverables were late and they had to redo Bob's work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a>. Ultimately, Scott had to fire Bob, who then asked, "Why didn't anyone tell me? I thought you all cared about me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:11">[00:25:11]</a>. This painful experience underscored that kindness in the short term can lead to unkind outcomes in the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:31">[00:25:31]</a>. Not addressing poor performance can lead to losing top performers who become frustrated by carrying underperformers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>.

## Practical Application of Radical Candor

### Giving Feedback
The "HIP CORE" framework provides guidelines for giving effective feedback:
*   **H**umble: Go into the conversation knowing you might be wrong. Candor is a dialogue, not a monologue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>.
*   **I**ntention (Helpful): State that your intention is to help the person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.
*   **I**mmediately: Give feedback right away, unless you or the other person are too upset to receive it productively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>. Delaying often means it never happens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>.
*   **P**erson/Phone (Synchronously): Deliver feedback in person or synchronously via phone or video call, not email or text. This allows you to gauge how it's landing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>. Phone calls can be particularly effective as they encourage listening to words over misinterpreting non-verbal cues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>.
*   **P**ublic/Private: Praise in public, criticize in private <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>.
*   **P**ersonality (Not about): Focus on behavior, not personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>.

Use the **CORE** framework for structuring feedback:
*   **C**ontext: Where and when did it happen? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a> (e.g., "In the meeting...")
*   **O**bservation: What did you observe? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a> (e.g., "...when you said 'um' every third word...")
*   **R**esult: What was the impact? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a> (e.g., "...it made you sound stupid.")
*   **E**xt Step: What's the suggested action? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a> (e.g., "Go to the speech coach.")

### Soliciting Feedback
This is the most important step to improving relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:17">[00:37:17]</a>.
1.  **Ask a Good Question**: Avoid generic questions like "Do you have any feedback for me?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Instead, ask something specific that sounds authentic to you, like "What could I do or stop doing that would make it easier to work with me?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a> or "Tell me why I'm wrong" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:46">[00:38:46]</a>. Managers should solicit feedback weekly from direct reports, cross-functional peers, and their own boss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:31">[00:39:31]</a>.
2.  **Embrace Discomfort (Count to Six)**: People will feel uncomfortable giving you critical feedback. The simplest way to encourage them is to close your mouth and count to six. Most people cannot endure six full seconds of silence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:47">[00:43:47]</a>.
3.  **Listen with Intent to Understand**: Manage your natural defensiveness. Ask follow-up questions to ensure you truly understand what they are saying, rather than jumping to conclusions or preparing your response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:21">[00:44:21]</a>.
4.  **Reward Candor**: If you agree with the feedback, fix the problem and make your listening tangible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:58">[00:45:58]</a>. Be loud about the change you made, crediting the person who gave the feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:03">[00:46:03]</a>. If you disagree, acknowledge the part you agree with (even 5-10%), state that you need to think about the rest, and then follow up with a respectful explanation of your disagreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:56">[00:46:56]</a>. Disagreement itself does not harm relationships; *unspoken* disagreement does <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:37">[00:47:37]</a>.

## Overcoming Challenges

### For People-Pleasers
For those who struggle with the need to be liked, the key is to shift focus from pleasing people to genuinely caring about them and doing what's right for their growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:08">[00:28:08]</a>. It's about demonstrating care, which ultimately creates the conditions for a good relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:14">[00:33:14]</a>. Understanding their career aspirations and how feedback aligns with their goals can also help frame the conversation as supportive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:55">[00:33:55]</a>.

### [[challenging_leadership_styles_and_seeking_feedback | Challenging Leadership Styles and Seeking Feedback]] in a Difficult Culture
It's unrealistic to expect everyone to be "ready" for direct feedback, as it's inherently difficult for most people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:45">[00:36:45]</a>. The most effective way to change a culture is to start by soliciting criticism yourself, especially if you are a manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:20">[00:37:20]</a>. This builds trust and makes it easier to give feedback later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:28">[00:37:28]</a>.

### Dealing with Leaders who Use Obnoxious Aggression
For leaders who are low on the "care personally" dimension or believe obnoxious aggression is effective, explain the impact their behavior has <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:03">[00:58:03]</a>. Show them that their approach is inefficient because it silences people and hinders results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:50">[00:59:50]</a>. Sharing personal stories of your own mistakes can encourage them to reflect on their behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:09">[01:00:09]</a>. Often, these leaders *do* care about results and their own careers, so framing it in terms of "enlightened self-interest" can be persuasive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:36">[00:58:36]</a>.

### Time Commitment
While it seems like a lot of work, practicing Radical Candor saves time in the long run by preventing bigger problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>. Two-minute impromptu conversations, or scheduling "slack time" between meetings, can integrate feedback into the daily flow without adding extra meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>. It's about "relationship hygiene" – small, consistent efforts prevent major issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:51">[00:53:51]</a>.

## Misconceptions and Nuances

A common misconception is that Radical Candor means being a jerk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:13">[01:11:13]</a>. This is wrong; it is obnoxious aggression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:29">[01:11:29]</a>. True Radical Candor always balances challenge with genuine personal care.

While figures like Steve Jobs were known for directness, Scott argues that his relationships were built on deep care, exemplified by Tim Cook's offer to donate part of his liver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:12">[01:04:12]</a>. This differs from leaders like Ray Dalio or Elon Musk, who Scott suggests make "far more and worse and more egregious mistakes" and exhibit lower "care personally" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:24">[01:06:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:28">[01:06:28]</a>. There's a false dichotomy that one must choose between being a competent jerk or a nice but incompetent person; Radical Candor offers a third, more effective path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:53">[01:06:53]</a>.

### [[role_of_respect_and_inclusivity_in_feedback_culture | Role of Respect and Inclusivity in Feedback Culture]]
Scott highlights that her original book did not fully address the impact of bias, prejudice, and bullying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:23">[01:13:23]</a>. The importance of [[role_of_respect_and_inclusivity_in_feedback_culture | respect]] became clear when a Black woman CEO colleague explained that offering "gentle, compassionate criticism" led to her being labeled an "angry black woman" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:24">[01:12:24]</a>. This led to Scott's next book, "Radical Respect."

## Radical Respect

Kim Scott's upcoming book, "Radical Respect," serves as a prequel to "Radical Candor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:34">[01:14:34]</a>. It emphasizes that if you don't respect someone, you can't truly care about them or effectively challenge them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:51">[01:11:51]</a>. The book includes chapters for leaders, those harmed by bias/bullying, those seeking to be better colleagues (upstanders), and those who have been culprits themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:07">[01:15:07]</a>.

## Key Takeaways and Actionable Advice

*   **Practice your Go-To Question**: Write down your go-to question for soliciting feedback (e.g., "What could I do or stop doing that would make it easier to work with me?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:01">[01:16:01]</a>. Practice it and refine it so it sounds [[authenticity_and_leadership_in_tech | authentic]] to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:07">[01:16:07]</a>.
*   **Schedule Feedback Time**: Put five minutes on your calendar to ask this question to someone, or add it to the bottom of your next one-on-one agenda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:23">[01:16:23]</a>.
*   **Read More Novels**: To build compassion and improve the "care personally" dimension, read more novels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:20">[01:17:20]</a>.
*   **"It's not mean, it's clear."**: This motto emphasizes that directness, when delivered with care, is beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:43">[01:21:43]</a>.
*   **Don't Choose Between Success and Being a Jerk**: You can be successful and a kind person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:54">[01:16:54]</a>.

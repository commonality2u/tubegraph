Public speaking can be a daunting experience, often triggering a "fight or flight" instinct in individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:45">[00:56:45]</a>. This means the body and mind perceive stepping onto a stage as a threat, similar to being attacked by an animal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:50">[00:56:50]</a>. However, those who are thoughtful and contemplative about speaking often have excellent content, as they tend to deeply consider their material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:07">[00:56:07]</a>. The biggest challenge for such individuals is simply getting onto the stage to share their valuable message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:37">[00:57:37]</a>.

## Understanding the Root Cause of Nerves

Nervousness in public speaking stems from a feeling of being threatened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:45">[00:56:45]</a>. Speakers often imagine scowling, judgmental, or doubting faces in the audience, but these perceptions are usually just in their heads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:26">[00:57:26]</a>.

## Pre-Talk Rituals and Preparation

Developing a pre-talk ritual can significantly help manage nerves. Different approaches work for different people.

### Visualizing Success

One technique is to sit in an audience seat in the auditorium, looking at the stage and setting, to visualize yourself speaking successfully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>. When you get on stage, recall seeing yourself in the audience, smiling and happy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:17">[00:57:17]</a>. This practice helps shift your visual model away from anticipating judgment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:23">[00:57:23]</a>.

### Calming Techniques

For those with naturally high energy, finding a dark, quiet corner backstage away from distractions can be beneficial. Focus on deep breathing exercises, such as taking a deep breath, then another gulp of air, and slowly releasing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:08">[00:58:08]</a>.

### Humor and Chemical Shift

To chemically shift your body from nervousness to a more relaxed state, try to induce laughter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:34">[00:58:34]</a>. This could involve having a playlist of funny videos or memories that make you laugh just before stepping on stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:26">[00:58:26]</a>. This deliberate chemical shift helps reset your mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:33">[00:59:33]</a>.

### Physical Activity (with a caveat)

Some speakers find that playing heavy metal music and engaging in physical activity like skipping or jumping helps them get "fired up" before a talk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:58">[00:57:58]</a>. However, for those who naturally have high energy, this might lead to uncontrolled breathing and heightened anxiety, so it's important to understand your own body's response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:15">[01:00:15]</a>.

## Mindset Shift: Audience as Hero and Passion

To reduce nerves, it's crucial to adopt an empathy-first approach where the [[Techniques for developing impactful speeches | audience is the hero]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>. By thinking about how you can help them get unstuck, you shift focus away from your own performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:16">[00:20:16]</a>.

Additionally, to improve as a presenter, choose a topic you are deeply passionate about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:20">[01:15:20]</a>. Work on this talk or volunteer to speak on it, as it will allow you to present from your soul, from a place of genuine passion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:45">[01:15:45]</a>. This experience of tapping into your passion will then apply to future business presentations, even if you are not as enthusiastic about the topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:35">[01:15:35]</a>. This is a key characteristic of great presenters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:48">[01:15:48]</a>.

Building AI products presents both unique [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_implementing_ai_solutions | challenges and opportunities]]. Risa Martin, Product Lead for NotebookLM, discussed the journey of developing this "delightful and inspiring" new AI product within Google Labs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:47">[01:04:47]</a>.

## Origin and Development
NotebookLM began as a "20% project" at Google, though the actual effort significantly exceeded that <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>. The initial team was very small, consisting of Risa, an engineer, and later Stephen Johnson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52:00">[06:52:00]</a>. The engineer was the only full-time contributor at the start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03:00">[07:03:00]</a>. When Project Tailwind was announced, there were only three engineers, a designer, Risa, and Stephen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:49:00">[07:49:00]</a>. Up until recently, the team only comprised about eight engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:07:00">[08:07:00]</a>.

The audio overview feature, called "Deep Dive," was previewed at Google I/O in May <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:00">[08:27:00]</a>. Its development leveraged new Google models like Gemini 1.5 Pro and powerful audio models from another team within Google Labs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03:00">[09:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:15:00">[13:15:00]</a>. The core idea was to take any source (e.g., URL, resume) and generate an AI-powered audio summary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:21:00">[09:21:00]</a>.

## Unique Approach to [[AI product development challenges | Product Development]]
Traditionally, product development starts with identifying a problem and then devising solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:58:00">[09:58:00]</a>. However, Google Labs, where NotebookLM was incubated, adopts a different approach: starting with the technology itself and exploring its practical applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:00">[10:07:00]</a>. This method is hypothesis-driven, aiming to maximize learning about how people use and interact with new AI capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:25:00">[10:25:00]</a>.

Risa discovered that experimenting with voice modality fundamentally changed how she interacted with the technology and even her thought process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:51:00">[10:51:00]</a>. The goal became to introduce this technology in a way that provides value and is "fun" and "cool" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:07:00">[11:07:07]</a>. This approach mirrors the impact of ChatGPT, where existing technology gained widespread attention through a new, engaging medium and interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:22:00">[11:22:00]</a>. A key insight is the need to "shape [technology] and bring it closer to people" to achieve that "wow, I get it" moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:05:00">[12:05:00]</a>.

The "secret sauce" behind NotebookLM's quality is a proprietary "Content Studio" built by the team, which allows the AI to take an opinionated approach to content and generate new forms of output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:31:00">[13:31:00]</a>.

## Operating Within Google
Operating within Google Labs, which is only about three years old, provided the team with the environment to move fast and operate differently from traditional Google teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:53:00">[19:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:05:00">[21:05:00]</a>. The mandate from the VP of Google Labs, Josh Woodward, was clear: "It's AI, we're going to ship AI products and we're going to build businesses out of them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:28:00">[20:28:00]</a>.

This startup-like environment meant:
*   **Fewer processes:** The team could work directly on mocks and PRDs while simultaneously doing implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:13:00">[21:13:00]</a>.
*   **Small team:** Starting with a very small team proved crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:21:00">[22:21:00]</a>.
*   **Experimentation with public engagement:** The team was able to try new things like creating a Discord server, which now has 60,000 members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:33:00">[22:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:16:00">[23:16:00]</a>.

## Impact and Future Vision
NotebookLM has seen positive traction, with increased daily, weekly, and monthly retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:50:00">[24:50:00]</a>. Its user base has expanded from primarily educators and learners to include a significant number of professionals who want to use it for work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:13:00">[25:13:00]</a>. The number of businesses using NotebookLM has been "astronomical," leading to the need for a business development person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:57:00">[25:57:00]</a>.

The long-term vision for NotebookLM is to become an "AI editor surface," fully remixable with any input and any output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:10:00">[28:10:00]</a>. This means taking diverse inputs like video, audio, emails, or social media content, and transforming them into different outputs such as blog posts, tutorial videos, or chatbots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:19:00">[28:19:00]</a>. The goal is to empower users to reshape information into their preferred medium, whether it's text, audio, or video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:01:00">[31:01:00]</a>.

Tactically, the team is interested in bringing NotebookLM to mobile, recognizing that the mobile experience is a significant gap today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:57:00">[28:57:00]</a>. They are also exploring more intuitive ways to give users control over the output, beyond simple "knobs" or sliders, to maintain a "magical and delightful" experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:43:00">[29:43:00]</a>.

## Lessons from Stephen Johnson's Role
Stephen Johnson, a New York Times best-selling author and journalist, joined the team and became "the product" in a way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:00:00">[38:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:41:00">[40:41:00]</a>. Risa observed his processes for researching, thinking about language, and sharing knowledge, aiming to "de-densify information" for everyday people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:28:00">[37:28:00]</a>. This unique collaboration highlighted the importance of deeply understanding and working with users to identify core workflows that can be enhanced by technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:55:00">[39:55:00]</a>.

## Red Teaming and Safety
Google has large teams dedicated to red teaming AI products, testing for as many areas as possible to ensure safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:22:00">[45:22:00]</a>. While users might push the boundaries of what the AI can do (e.g., "poop fart" audio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:08:00">[34:08:00]</a>), the team monitors public reactions and addresses concerns publicly. The goal is to build the product in a way that minimizes the need to "pull it back" due to safety issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:51:00">[45:51:00]</a>.

## Conclusion
The development of NotebookLM exemplifies the [[Impact of AI on product development | evolving landscape of AI technology]] and the [[leveraging_ai_in_product_development | opportunities in leveraging AI in product development]]. By adopting a technology-first, agile, and user-centric approach within Google Labs, the team has been able to create a highly engaging and useful AI product that is still in its early stages of growth and exploration. Continued user feedback is crucial for guiding its future development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:28:00">[46:28:00]</a>.

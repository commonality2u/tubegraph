Effective product management heavily relies on the ability to simplify complex situations and prioritize diligently. The best product managers (PMs) excel at breaking things down and identifying the single, most crucial task to focus on at any given moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. This skill is critical whether operating within a large enterprise with numerous priorities or a startup environment facing countless opportunities and "fires" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

## Why Simplification and Prioritization are Essential

Maggie Crowley, VP of Product at Toast, emphasizes that simplification is a core differentiator for top PMs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. In essence, the entire job of a PM can be boiled down to prioritizing and guiding the team on "what is next" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.

Key reasons for its importance include:
*   **Focus and Completion** The best PMs not only identify the one thing to work on but also stay with it long enough to actually finish it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. This resilience and energy are vital for seeing projects through, which can take weeks, months, or even a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
*   **Clarity and Impact** Simplifying ensures that the team is aligned on the most impactful work. Without it, teams can become bogged down in complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. A strong strategy is only valuable if the PM can actually ship products and create impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.
*   **Decision-Making Confidence** Getting to "the one thing" is extremely difficult, requiring confidence in decisions and the "gumption to say no" to numerous other potential tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>.

## How to Cultivate Simplification Skills

While some people may naturally be simplifiers, there are tangible practices to develop this muscle:

### Written Communication
*   **Read Aloud:** When writing product documents (specs, one-pagers, strategies), read them out loud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. Often, this reveals unnecessary complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.
*   **"Just Say That":** If you can articulate the core message simply in conversation, that's what should be written. The goal is to get things done, not adhere to formal prose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. This aligns with [[conciseness_and_clarity_in_writing | conciseness and clarity in writing]].
*   **Lead with the Conclusion:** Employ the Minto Pyramid principle, placing the full conclusion first, followed by supporting arguments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>. Avoid "buildup" in your writing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:49">[00:18:49]</a>.
*   **Ruthless Editing:** Assume the first two paragraphs of any document can be deleted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>. Cut anything that isn't necessary, such as excessive adjectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>.
*   **Rule of Three:** Aim to limit strategies, conclusions, or next steps to three items or fewer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:18:54]</a>.

### Strategic Approach
*   **Seek Feedback:** Regularly ask others to review your work and help you simplify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. Maggie Crowley utilizes a small Slack group with other product leaders for this purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>.
*   **Pick the Most Impactful Thing:** Avoid lumping too many ideas together, as it dilutes focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>. Choose the single item with the most impact and cut less important tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>. This connects to [[importance_of_focusing_on_core_challenges | focusing on core challenges]].
*   **"Why Now?":** When defining a problem or opportunity, explicitly address "why this problem matters now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:02">[00:51:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:52">[00:53:52]</a>. This helps to prioritize urgent and perishable opportunities.

## The Challenge of Staying Focused

Despite the benefits, staying disciplined and focused is hard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:44">[00:53:44]</a>. There are often 10 things a team *could* do, but attempting all of them leads to lack of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>.

## Carrying the Water: Beyond Core Responsibilities

A crucial aspect of PM success that ties into prioritization is the willingness to "carry the water" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. This means being willing to do the "hard, boring, unglamorous work" like customer support, sales, marketing, copywriting, or project management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.

*   **Ownership of Outcomes:** As a PM, you are responsible for delivering business results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:46">[00:29:46]</a>. Unlike engineers who write code or designers who create interfaces, a PM's role isn't solely defined by one output. You fill in the gaps because no one else is incentivized to ensure the problem gets solved for the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:53">[00:29:53]</a>.
*   **Emotional Center:** PMs are often the emotional center of the team, responsible for keeping people motivated and excited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:22">[00:28:22]</a>. Taking on tasks, even if they aren't "your job," helps maintain optimism and forward momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:44">[00:28:44]</a>.

Ultimately, people who are willing to "just get the work done" will move faster, lead more successful products, and avoid carrying negative emotions like frustration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:05">[00:28:05]</a>. If you find yourself saying "that's not my job," it's probably something you should consider doing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

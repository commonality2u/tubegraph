Matt Mohari, an executive coach, shares insights on how large organizations can foster [[invention_and_systematic_innovation | innovation]] and effectively build new products, often drawing parallels to the efficiency observed in smaller, more nimble teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

## Challenges to Innovation in Large Companies
Large companies face significant hurdles when trying to innovate, primarily due to their scale and established operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:50">[00:53:50]</a>.
Once a product is scaled to millions of users, the primary concerns become site uptime and security, requiring thorough testing of any new code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:39">[00:55:39]</a>. This extensive review process makes it incredibly slow for innovators to get new features approved or deployed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:04">[00:56:04]</a>. Additionally, seeking approvals from product teams or heads of departments further delays the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:26">[00:56:26]</a>.

Mohari observes that companies that perform layoffs often see an improvement in operational efficiency, even on an absolute scale, meaning more features, better code, and higher NPS scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:23">[00:45:23]</a>. This is attributed to fewer people, which reduces coordination issues, information friction, and morale problems that grow with size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:42">[00:21:42]</a>. The ideal is to keep teams super small <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:38">[00:22:38]</a>.

## Strategies for Internal Innovation
Mohari suggests that large companies can overcome these challenges by creating internal "YC startup" like entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:47">[00:54:47]</a>. These entities should embody specific characteristics:

*   **[[Transitioning from Large Companies to Startups | Founder Mentality]] Leadership**
    *   The team should be headed by someone with a "founder mentality" â€“ a person willing to "break glass" and relentlessly pursue solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:57">[00:54:57]</a>.
    *   Such individuals can often be found among YC alumni whose startups may have failed, but who still possess the drive and desire to build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:06">[00:55:06]</a>.
*   **Small, Decoupled Teams**
    *   Keep the internal team "really small" to minimize bureaucracy and ensure everyone is aligned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:24">[00:55:24]</a>.
    *   This entity should not touch the core product code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:18">[00:56:18]</a> to avoid lengthy approval processes and allow rapid prototyping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:08">[00:56:08]</a>.
*   **Direct Reporting Lines**
    *   The innovation team should report directly to the CEO, bypassing traditional departmental heads (like engineering or product) who might slow down progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:36">[00:56:36]</a>.
*   **Creating Separate Legal Entities (C-Corps)**
    *   A radical but effective approach is to create separate C-Corps for new products. This clearly establishes them as distinct entities, allowing teams to iterate quickly without fear of damaging the core brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:59">[00:56:59]</a>.
    *   Wei Dang, CEO of Clipboard Health, successfully implemented this strategy, creating five C-Corps in two months to foster rapid iteration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:44">[00:57:44]</a>.
    *   This strategy also allows for parallel experimentation, such as having one engineering-focused team build custom code and another customer-relationship focused team use off-the-shelf solutions, then observing which progresses faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:03">[00:58:03]</a>.

## Motivation and Incentives
While equity and financial incentives are often seen as key motivators for founders, Mohari argues that what truly motivates people in these internal innovation teams is the joy of **building** and seeing their creations used in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:17">[00:59:17]</a>. Autonomy and "ownership over decision-making" and "creation" are more significant drivers than financial stake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:34">[00:59:34]</a>. Amazon, for example, is known for fostering [[invention_and_systematic_innovation | innovation]] by giving teams significant resources and autonomy to pursue new ideas, without necessarily offering large equity packages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:47">[00:59:47]</a>.

Fear can be a powerful short-term motivator, driving rapid and intense work. However, Mohari believes that working for joy is more sustainable, leading to long-term, consistent motivation and a more fulfilling experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:21">[01:00:21]</a>.

## Successful Examples
Beyond Clipboard Health, Mohari mentions Scale AI and Attentive Mobile as companies successfully applying these principles of internal innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:31">[01:01:31]</a>. He notes that as more examples of this method's success emerge, more companies he coaches are adopting it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:35">[01:01:35]</a>.

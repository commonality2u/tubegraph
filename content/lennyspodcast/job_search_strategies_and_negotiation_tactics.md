Phil Terry, author of "Never Search Alone," advocates for a product-lens approach to the job search, helping individuals find roles they love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:38">[01:37:38]</a>. This method, developed over 25 years with leaders in Silicon Valley's product community, is applicable to anyone seeking employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:28">[02:37:28]</a>.

## [[importance_of_job_search_councils_and_support_groups | Job Search Councils]]

A Job Search Council (JSC) is a support group of six to eight job seekers who commit to supporting each other through the job search process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:49">[02:57:49]</a>. While originating from the product community, these councils are for everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:54">[03:00:54]</a>.

### Purpose and Impact
JSCs help individuals understand their candidate market fit and learn how to "play to win" rather than "play not to lose" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:15">[03:14:15]</a>. The job search can be intimidating, and doing it alone magnifies feelings of insecurity and anxiety, which are common even among senior professionals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:19">[03:52:19]</a>. By bringing anxious people together to be open and vulnerable, JSCs can transform fear into hope, motivation, accountability, and confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:43">[04:10:43]</a>.

Phil Terry's "Never Search Alone" method is designed to disrupt the traditional job search process by fostering a sense of community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:57:35">[15:57:35]</a>. This approach builds a "private safety net" for those affected by creative destruction, a core economic concept where new products and services displace old ones, leading to job anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:43:08">[18:43:08]</a>.

### How to Join a Council
Phil Terry's organization has launched over 2,000 free, volunteer-driven councils <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:15:37">[09:15:37]</a>. All book sales from "Never Search Alone" (and more) fund these operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:06">[09:56:06]</a>.

To join:
1.  Apply at `phil.org` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:32:04">[10:32:04]</a>.
2.  Indicate if you are a "slow seeker" (employed and looking) or a "fast seeker" (unemployed and looking); groups are separated based on their different cadences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:48:07">[10:48:07]</a>.
3.  Consider volunteering as a moderator for faster matching and additional training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:03:52">[11:03:52]</a>.
4.  Participate in an orientation program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:31:94">[11:31:94]</a>.
5.  Receive a free 100-page workbook with templates and guides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:46:17">[11:46:17]</a>.
6.  Attend "meeting zero" to build trust and share stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:01:21">[12:01:21]</a>.
7.  Meet regularly (twice a week for fast seekers, every two weeks for slow seekers) until a job is found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:12:11">[12:12:11]</a>.

The average job search duration for those in JSCs is 3 months, compared to the national average of 3-6 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:25:21">[22:25:21]</a>.

## Candidate Market Fit

Candidate Market Fit is a crucial job search tactic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:29:43">[20:29:43]</a>. It's about understanding your place in the job market, which is characterized by supply and demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:51:71">[20:51:71]</a>. In a down market, your "fit" might be lower than anticipated due to increased competition (e.g., VPs seeking Director roles) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:30:17">[21:30:17]</a>. Recognizing this is a market reality, not a personal failing, provides a sense of relief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:52:03">[21:52:03]</a>.

### Determining Your Fit

1.  **The Manukan Two-Pager:** Start by clearly defining what you want and don't want in a job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:22:92">[22:22:92]</a>. Most people "spray and pray" when laid off, but slowing down to clarify your desires is a "radical step" that leads to faster results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:49:10">[22:49:10]</a>. This document is a draft to be shared with your council for collective refinement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:51:30">[23:51:30]</a>.
2.  **The Listening Tour:**
    *   **Purpose:** As the "product" in the job search, you need to understand what the market wants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:52:43">[24:52:43]</a>. This involves speaking with trusted friends, colleagues, and recruiters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:57:33">[24:57:33]</a>.
    *   **Golden Question:** Ask, "If you were in my shoes, how would you approach this?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:16:32">[25:16:32]</a>. This question opens the conversation and encourages honest feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:23:44">[25:25:35]</a>.
    *   **Types of Conversations:**
        *   **Reverse Exit Interviews:** Talk to former colleagues about your strengths and what roles they see you fitting into <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:16:66">[27:16:66]</a>.
        *   **Broader Network:** Engage your wider professional connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:34:64">[27:34:64]</a>.
        *   **Recruiters:** Instead of asking for a job, ask recruiters for their advice on what roles you might be a good fit for, given market conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:42:33">[27:42:33]</a>. Building relationships with recruiters *before* you need a job is vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:06:05">[28:06:05]</a>.
    *   **Benefits:** Beyond market feedback, the listening tour lights up your network, turning contacts into "listening posts" invested in your success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:36:56">[29:36:56]</a>.
3.  **Refining Your Fit:** After the listening tour, create a *narrow, clear, focused* candidate market fit statement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:13:30">[31:13:30]</a>. Think of it like a "spear, not a net" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:01:85">[32:01:85]</a>.
    *   **Attributes:** Typically, three to four attributes are sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:33:02">[33:33:02]</a>. Examples include: stage of company (e.g., Series B startup), industry (e.g., healthcare), role level (e.g., Director of Product), function, and specific cultural needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:45:94">[31:45:94]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:39:75">[35:39:75]</a>.
    *   **Expansive vs. Reductive:** A narrow definition allows others to be expansive on your behalf (e.g., if you specify healthcare Series B, they might think of fintech Series B if it's a good fit) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:31:85">[32:31:85]</a>. A broad statement, however, makes it harder for people to remember you or reduce options for you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:46:17">[32:46:17]</a>.
    *   **Post-Definition:** Share your refined candidate market fit statement with your network and on LinkedIn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:16:32">[34:16:32]</a>.

### Adapting to Market Conditions
Market conditions can change rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:39:35">[34:39:35]</a>. Your candidate market fit statement may need to be iterative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:32:08">[34:32:08]</a>. For example, in a tough tech market, there might be more opportunities in startups than in large companies that are shedding employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:06:09">[37:06:09]</a>. Sometimes, a "two-step strategy" is necessary, accepting a lower-level or individual contributor (IC) role to gain experience at a leading company before pursuing a more senior role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:39:09">[39:39:09]</a>. This requires accepting market realities without compromising your inherent worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:43:24">[41:43:24]</a>.

## [[techniques_for_preparing_for_interviews | Playing to Win]] and Negotiation

### Job Mission with OKRs
When interviewing, don't just react to job descriptions; take charge by creating your own "Job Mission with OKRs" (Objectives and Key Results) privately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:27:82">[50:27:82]</a>. Most job descriptions are vague, so this exercise helps you:
1.  **Develop insightful interview questions:** Clarify the role's true nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:21:05">[51:21:05]</a>.
2.  **Impress the hiring manager:** After a few interviews, share your draft Job Mission with the hiring manager (preferably live, not via email) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:38:64">[51:38:64]</a>. This demonstrates initiative, accountability, and a focus on outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:53:57">[59:53:57]</a>. Hiring managers are often blown away by this proactivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:57:95">[51:57:95]</a>.
3.  **Ensure alignment:** This process helps you understand if your perception of the job aligns with the company's, preventing situations where "job A turns out to be job B" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:00:07">[53:00:07]</a>.

### Negotiation Tactics
Use the Job Mission with OKRs as a basis for negotiation. This is not about being antagonistic but about ensuring you are set up for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:36:06">[53:36:06]</a>.

1.  **Discuss Resources for Success:** Before talking about salary, discuss the resources you believe are necessary to achieve the OKRs. This could include:
    *   Addressing technical debt (e.g., requesting a budget for a $20 million tech debt problem) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:46:95">[54:46:95]</a>.
    *   Training for the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:50:88">[55:50:88]</a>.
    *   Hiring additional staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:26:08">[56:26:08]</a>.
    *   Professional development or conference attendance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:17:81">[56:17:81]</a>.
    *   Companies often love this approach, as it demonstrates your commitment to success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:12:06">[56:12:06]</a>. If they are unwilling to discuss these needs, it's a significant red flag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:14:14">[57:14:14]</a>.
2.  **Ask for More Money:** After discussing resources, ask for your desired salary. Most of the time (historically 87%), asking for more money results in getting it, or at least a partial increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:17:51">[01:00:17:51]</a>. Phrase it collaboratively: "Are you open to [desired salary]? That was really what I was hoping for when I think I'm worth. Is that something we can talk about?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:02:80">[01:01:02:80]</a>.
3.  **Debrief After Interviews:** Immediately after interviews, debrief with your job search council or a trusted friend. This helps you gain perspective and avoid being swayed by your "inner critic" or impostor syndrome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:11:51">[01:07:11:51]</a>.

## The Art of Asking for Help

Asking for help is a critical skill for career success and is foundational to the JSCs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:20:00">[01:11:20:00]</a>.

### Why Ask for Help?
*   **Confidence, Not Weakness:** Asking for help is a sign of confidence, not weakness; it requires confidence and strengthens it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:57:17">[01:14:57:17]</a>.
*   **Giving Activity:** When done well, asking for help is a giving activity. People feel valued and honored when asked for their expertise and perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:07:07">[01:15:07:07]</a>.
*   **Increased Independence:** It fosters independence by connecting you to resources and insights you might not find alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:34:77">[01:16:34:77]</a>.
*   **Improved Reputation:** It enhances your reputation, showing thoughtfulness and initiative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:37:94">[01:16:37:94]</a>.
*   **Universal Practice:** Many highly successful leaders, from CEOs to investors, actively seek advice and collaborate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:48:02">[01:18:48:02]</a>. Data shows 85% of people in senior roles credit asking for help to their success, while 85% in junior roles avoid it due to fear of appearing weak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00:87">[01:19:00:87]</a>.

### How to Ask for Help Effectively
*   **Do Your Homework:** Don't ask for someone to do the work for you; seek advice, support, and perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:36:00">[01:13:36:00]</a>.
*   **Be Clear and Honest:** Be upfront about what you're asking for. Avoid hiding your intentions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:56:56">[01:27:56:56]</a>.
*   **Consider the Relationship:** The nature of the request should align with your relationship with the person. Close colleagues or friends are more likely to offer extensive help than cold contacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:16:79">[01:26:16:79]</a>.
*   **Trust Your Emotions:** If you don't trust someone, don't be fully open and vulnerable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:11:79">[01:27:11:79]</a>.
*   **Practice in a Safe Environment:** Job search councils provide a safe space to practice asking for help without fear of missteps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:19:03">[01:27:19:03]</a>.

### Examples of Asking for Help
*   **"Defining Reality":** As a leader, constantly ask others, "How do you see things?" and "What do you think? Help me understand your perspective." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:36:26">[01:19:36:26]</a>
*   **Reviewing Important Communications:** Ask a trusted colleague to review crucial emails, especially if you have a history of miscommunication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00:60">[01:20:00:60]</a>.
*   **Peer Coaching Calls:**
    *   **"First 90 Days" Call:** When starting a new job, talk to people in similar roles (not necessarily at your company) about challenges, mistakes to avoid, and strategies for your first 30, 60, or 90 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:56:79">[01:20:56:79]</a>.
    *   **"Career Evolution" Call:** To advance your [[career_development_and_growth_strategies | career]], talk to individuals in the role you aspire to (e.g., a Director wanting to become a VP) to understand the path forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:31:00">[01:21:31:00]</a>.

## General Mindset and Approach

### Emotional Balance
Managing your emotional balance is the most important aspect of a job search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:05:00">[01:14:05:00]</a>. When anxiety and fear erode confidence, it negatively impacts [[techniques_for_preparing_for_interviews | interviewing performance]] and can lead to paralysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:52:00">[01:09:52:00]</a>. Remembering that everyone feels insecure in a job search and that you are not alone is crucial for maintaining mental well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:26:93">[01:29:26:93]</a>. This perspective, coupled with community support, helps overcome the inner critic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:46:17">[01:07:46:17]</a>.

### "I in Village"
While "there's no 'I' in team," there is an "I" in village <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:05">[00:35:05]</a>. This means while you should ask for help and be part of a community, you must also be independent, accountable, and responsible for your job search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:03:00">[01:01:03:00]</a>. Don't become passive; continuously network and update your candidate market fit as conditions change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00:00">[01:04:00:00]</a>.

### Continuous Learning
*   **Reading:** Phil Terry emphasizes the importance of reading widely, calling "books machines to think with" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:52:00">[01:33:52:00]</a>. Product leaders, in particular, should read beyond their immediate field for inspiration and to stay at the "technology frontier," where most new job creation occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:11:00">[01:39:11:00]</a>.
*   **Mentorship:** Develop "dead or distant mentors" by deeply studying influential figures like Steve Jobs or Warren Buffett <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:24:00">[01:35:24:00]</a>. Their life experiences and strategic decisions can serve as valuable lessons and guidance.
*   **Visual Literacy:** Engage with art and other non-digital products to develop new perspectives and foster empathy, which can enhance product design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:04:00">[01:37:04:00]</a>.

By combining the structural support of JSCs with a proactive, product-oriented approach to defining fit, interviewing, and negotiating, individuals can significantly improve their job search outcomes and find fulfilling roles.

Nikita Beer is known for building and launching several highly successful consumer apps that have reached the top of the App Store charts. His first major hit, TBH, was sold to Facebook, and his second, Gas, was sold to Discord, both focusing on positive social interaction for teens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:47">[02:04:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:44">[02:10:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:47">[02:14:47]</a>.

### The Genesis of TBH: Identifying Latent Demand

The insight for TBH came from observing trends on the App Store and social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>. Nikita noticed that the number one app in the United States was Saraha, an anonymous messaging app, but it was entirely in Arabic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>. This was a strong signal of [[latent_demand_identifying_product_opportunities | latent demand]] for anonymous communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:36">[00:26:36]</a>. Simultaneously, teens were playing a game on Snapchat called "TBH" where they would post emojis and receive positive feedback on their style, intelligence, or smile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:22">[00:25:22]</a>.

Nikita recognized that while anonymous apps often led to negative messages and bullying, there was a clear desire for positive self-affirmation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:17">[00:27:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:50">[00:27:50]</a>. TBH addressed this by only allowing positive feedback through pre-authored polls (e.g., "who has the best smile," "who's most likely to be president") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:37">[00:27:37]</a>. This unique mechanic made users feel better and resulted in an "explosive adoption" and high message volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:22">[00:28:22]</a>. For example, one school sent 450,000 messages in its first seven days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:33">[00:28:33]</a>.

### [[viral_growth_strategies_for_consumer_apps | Viral Growth Strategies for Consumer Apps]]: Why Teens?

Nikita's experience building many apps led him to focus on teens as a target audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. The key reasons include:
*   **Malleable Habits**: Older individuals tend to be fixed in their communication habits and less likely to adopt new products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.
*   **High Invitation Rates**: The number of invitations sent per user declines by 20% for every additional year of age from 13 to 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>. Adults typically require paid acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>.
*   **Daily Interaction**: Teens see each other daily, leading to serendipitous hanging out and greater urgency to connect on new platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>.

### Testing and Seeding Apps

To understand what people want and how to make apps grow, Nikita and his team developed a reproducible testing process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:54">[01:13:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:11">[01:19:11]</a>.
*   **Targeted Seeding**: They would seed apps into specific schools and affinity groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:36">[01:19:36]</a>. For TBH, they chose a school in Georgia with an early start date to launch quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:03">[02:16:03]</a>.
*   **Saturation Marketing**: To ensure adoption density, they saturated areas with marketing. This included targeted ads for a particular school and creating dedicated Instagram accounts that followed students whose bios identified their school (e.g., "rhs") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:58">[02:59:58]</a>. This early manual work ensured enough intensity for the social network flywheel to start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:03">[03:01:03]</a>.
*   **Eliminating Confounding Variables**: The goal was to test the "best possible version" of the app. By ensuring early users had enough friends on the app, they could definitively tell if the product was working or not, rather than attributing failure to lack of network effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>.
*   **Live Chat Customer Support**: Implementing 24/7 live chat provided a "white glove experience" and, more importantly, served as an invaluable user research tool. Users would directly articulate their problems and ideas, enabling rapid iteration and ensuring positive word-of-mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>.

### [[lessons_from_building_and_selling_viral_apps | Lessons from Building and Selling Viral Apps]]: Navigating Rapid Success

Rapid growth of a consumer app brings "absolute chaos" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:17">[01:30:17]</a>. Systems break constantly, requiring ruthless prioritization and frequent substitution of infrastructure (e.g., customer support systems breaking every few days) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:55">[01:34:55]</a>.
*   **Geofencing for Control**: To manage growth and allow server scaling, TBH was initially geofenced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:58">[02:59:58]</a>. This controversial decision provided crucial "slack" to keep the app online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>.
*   **Product-Market Fit Indicators**: When an app has product-market fit, "you'll know." Things will be breaking, users will be fighting to get in, and new metrics like "hourly active users" emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>. If there's uncertainty, it's not working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>.

### Re-inventing Growth: Gas

After TBH's sale to Facebook, Nikita sought to address the question of monetizing a positive polling app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>. The top support message for TBH was "Can I pay to reveal who sent me polls?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>.

Gas, the spiritual successor to TBH, faced a new challenge: regulatory changes prevented server-side text invites via Twilio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>. This meant re-inventing the entire growth system, as users now had to manually "pop the compose window and hit send" for each invite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>. This required nine launches and significant development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>.

*   **Ethical Growth**: Nikita emphasizes operating "by the book" with growth systems, never misusing user data (e.g., automatically inviting contacts on behalf of users). He believes the "Internet" (users and platform ecosystems) will "get even" if treated unethically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:00">[06:08:00]</a>.
*   **Combatting Hoaxes**: Gas faced a widespread human trafficking hoax, a common problem for rapidly growing apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:00">[06:42:00]</a>. To combat this existential threat, Nikita took a multi-pronged approach:
    *   Insisting on specific headlines for media interviews (e.g., "Gas App Is Not For Human Trafficking" in the Washington Post) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:00">[07:38:00]</a>.
    *   Calling school superintendents and police chiefs to retract false public statements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48:00">[07:48:00]</a>.
    *   Requesting Apple to remove review bombs from the App Store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:00">[07:54:00]</a>.
    *   Creating a TikTok video explaining the hoax, which was shown to users attempting to delete their accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:07:00">[08:07:00]</a>. This reduced account deletions from 3% to 0.1% daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:20:00">[08:20:00]</a>.
    *   The crucial lesson: the app's viral spread (`K-factor`) must be greater than the hoax's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:00">[08:35:00]</a>.
*   **The Power of Naming**: The app's name and icon significantly impacted its [[viral_growth_strategies_for_consumer_apps | viral growth]]. An earlier rebrand to "Crush" with a pink icon saw invitations drop significantly because boys didn't want to invite their friends to an app with such a feminine association. Changing the name to "Gas" with a black flame icon boosted invite rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>.

### Philosophy on Durable Consumer Apps

Nikita views the creation of a durable, long-lasting social or communication product as a "Black Swan event" driven by tremendous randomness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:50">[01:18:50]</a>. However, the *growth* of a product can be a science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:26">[01:19:26]</a>. His motivation is the "thrilling drug" of watching an app take over the internet, preferring this high-impact creation over managing large organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:42">[01:19:42]</a>. Financially, the proceeds from successful, quick apps can be comparable to those from long-term, venture-backed companies after years of dilution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:04">[01:22:04]</a>.

### Key Product Design Principles

*   **Time to Value (Aha Moment)**: Users must experience the "aha moment" and value within seconds, ideally three <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:24">[01:27:24]</a>. If value isn't demonstrated quickly, users will churn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:39">[01:27:39]</a>. This requires ruthless prioritization and cutting unnecessary features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:13">[01:30:13]</a>.
*   **Targeted Validation**: In [[development_of_facebooks_news_feed | zero-to-one product development]], focus on executing at 100% for the specific thing being validated at each stage (e.g., core flow, then in-group spread, then inter-group spread). Other aspects can be "half-assed" initially to get clear signal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:03">[01:12:03]</a>.
*   **Leveraging APIs Creatively**: Extraordinary product people are deeply aware of every possible API and how it can be used in non-traditional ways to activate a user. An example is using a very short, memorable domain (e.g., `dp.com`) as a prefix to a URL to instantly access a specific feature (like finding the cheapest version of a product) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:51">[01:30:51]</a>.
*   **Seamless Social Graph Activation**: Avoid forcing users to manually exchange usernames. Design systems that allow for one-tap exposure to value, such as leveraging contact sync to instantly connect users with friends already on the app, reducing thousands of taps to one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:07">[01:31:07]</a>.
*   **Aligning Marketing and Product**: Marketing efforts (ads, imagery for specific communities) and in-app experience (community joining, invitation flows) must be perfectly aligned for successful user acquisition and flywheel spin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:55">[01:33:55]</a>.

Nikita continues to advise companies on [[viral_growth_strategies_for_consumer_apps | viral growth strategies]], product design, and product development processes, often getting deeply involved in the "pixels" to refine user flows and conversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:31">[02:29:31]</a>.

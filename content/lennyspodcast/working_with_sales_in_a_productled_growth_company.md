Figma, a company widely recognized for its [[productled growth strategy | Product-Led Growth]] model, views its expansion not just through the product itself, but significantly through "community-led growth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:48">[00:52:48]</a>. This approach emphasizes empowering passionate users within companies to become advocates for the product, with the sales team playing a crucial supporting role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:05">[00:53:05]</a>.

## The Role of Sales in a Community-Led Model
Figma is fortunate to have a sales team that deeply understands its product and can engage effectively with design and product leaders among customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:25">[00:52:25]</a>. In this model, the sales team's primary function is to:
*   **Empower Internal Champions**: The sales team helps individuals within a company who are already passionate about Figma to build a stronger case for its adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:05">[00:53:05]</a>.
*   **Foster Human Connections**: They create crucial human connections and equip designers with the necessary data and stories to advocate for Figma internally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:20">[00:53:20]</a>.
*   **Facilitate Wider Deployment**: This support helps these internal advocates connect with the rest of their company to achieve broader deployment or secure leadership buy-in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:05">[00:53:05]</a>.

The ultimate goal is for the internal designer, not the sales team, to be the primary "sales team" for Figma within their organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:39">[00:53:39]</a>. This partnership between sales and product aims to enable these internal champions as much as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:19">[00:54:19]</a>.

## Product Team's Contribution to Sales and Growth
The [[role_of_product_teams_in_sales | product team]] at Figma supports this community-led growth by:
*   **Providing Visibility**: Giving the sales team and internal champions insights into product development, such as current thinking about product evolution, or what other customers are doing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:08">[00:54:08]</a>.
*   **Cultivating Product Love**: Fostering an "irrational emotional response" or deep love for the product, both internally and externally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:01">[00:57:01]</a>. This love compels users to passionately evangelize Figma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:15">[00:57:15]</a>.

## Early Growth Strategies
A significant part of Figma's early success stemmed from its intentional focus on building a strong community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:05">[00:55:05]</a>. Key strategies included:
*   **Enabling Sharing**: Figma's ability to easily share files allows users to effectively "open source" their work, demonstrating how different companies utilize the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:16">[00:55:16]</a>. This transparency generated significant interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:35">[00:55:35]</a>.
*   **Influencer Targeting**: Early on, Figma strategically identified and aimed to "win over" influential designers on platforms like Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:48">[00:27:48]</a>.
*   **Friends of Figma Program**: More recently, Figma has focused on programs like "Friends of Figma," which brings together passionate users from various geographies in regular meetings and Discord channels to further evangelize the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:40">[00:55:40]</a>. These human connections build loyalty, which in turn fuels internal champions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:59">[00:55:59]</a>.

## Beyond the Tool: Championing a New Way of Working
For [[understanding_productled_sales | Product-Led Sales]] (or community-led growth), it's crucial for users to feel an emotional connection to the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:01">[00:57:01]</a>. Figma achieved this by not just offering a tool, but by promoting a "new way of working" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:36">[00:57:36]</a>. Controversial ideas, such as "everyone can see what you're doing" or "multiple designers can be in the file at the same time," were initially met with strong reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, this tension signaled a "revolution" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, and by equipping customers with this philosophy, Figma enabled them to champion not just a tool, but a paradigm shift in design collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:17">[00:58:17]</a>. This deep connection and shared mission are vital for fostering the evangelism that drives [[differences_between_productled_growth_and_productled_sales | product-led growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:30">[00:58:30]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Love Drives Growth
> This concept aligns with the philosophy that "love drives growth, not the other way around," a tagline popularized by early Airbnb growth teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:41">[00:58:41]</a>.

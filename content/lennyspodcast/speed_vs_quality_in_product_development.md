From: [[lennyspodcast]] <br/> 

The common perception is that there's a trade-off between speed and quality in product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. However, companies like Linear operate on the principle that this trade-off doesn't actually exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. People often mistakenly [[balancing_speed_and_quality_in_software_development | over-index on rushing or being sloppy]] when they think about speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Instead, the focus should be on competence and expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. At the pinnacle of any craft, the quality of work product is often directly correlated with how fast someone is moving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Redefining Speed and Quality

For Linear, [[balancing_speed_and_quality_in_software_development | speed in product development]] looks like having a workable solution very early in the development process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. If a rough time budget is set for a feature, a functional solution should be ready by the time 10% of that budget has passed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. This early prototype tests a key hypothesis, allowing for rapid validation of assumptions and avoiding costly delays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

This approach is facilitated by:
*   **High-quality talent:** Engineers who can quickly create workable solutions without getting bogged down by every design choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.
*   **No expectation of perfection:** The first version is considered the "best guess" in the general direction, not a polished final product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. The goal is to validate or invalidate major assumptions, not to have a pixel-perfect design or solve all UI bugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.

The ultimate goal is to get working software out to interact with and learn from, allowing for real user validation through early betas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>. This phased release strategy, starting with internal users and expanding to beta groups, ensures that most wasted time building unwanted features is avoided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>.

## Operationalizing Quality by Saying "No"

A critical aspect of [[operationalizing_quality_in_product_design | maintaining quality and avoiding bloat]], particularly in enterprise software, is a clear stance on feature requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>. Linear has a firm policy of rejecting customization features requested by middle managers for reporting purposes, especially if they make Individual Contributor (IC) workflows worse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>.

This commitment is a core promise of Linear, ensuring the product remains fast and enjoyable to use for the ICs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>. The rationale is that if the IC user experience is degraded, they will disengage, leading to inaccurate data and ineffective reporting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>. Buyers are convinced that making their teams more effective is the true value proposition, not just adding more reporting features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:32">[00:20:32]</a>.

## Understanding Customer Problems through Empathy

Linear's approach to [[common_problems_faced_by_product_teams | understanding customer problems]] involves deep digging into their emotional experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:32">[00:30:32]</a>. The goal is to "feel bad in the same way that customers feel bad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:10">[00:31:10]</a>. This goes beyond analytical "five whys" or "jobs to be done" frameworks to uncover the underlying emotional valence motivating a request <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:24">[00:31:24]</a>.

For example, when users requested fully customized fields, digging deeper revealed the true pain point was tracking customer-specific feature requests to show evidence of work for key accounts like Walmart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:38">[00:28:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>. Linear's solution, "customer requests," automates this by integrating with support tools and CRMs, automatically tagging requests, thereby making ICs' lives easier rather than harder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:33">[00:29:33]</a>.

## Systematizing Creativity with Extreme Versions

To foster creativity and find non-obvious solutions, Linear employs a method of exploring "extreme versions" of product features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:07">[00:45:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:31">[00:45:31]</a>. This involves asking what the most outrageous or luxurious version of something would be, disregarding constraints like cost or practicality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:59">[00:45:59]</a>. The purpose is to break past existing mental defaults and constraints, expanding the search space for potential solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:26">[00:46:26]</a>.

For instance, when designing an issue draft saving feature:
1.  **Extreme Speed:** Initially, they built the fastest possible version, where closing the draft without saving meant losing changes (no pop-ups) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:08">[00:49:08]</a>. This felt "super unsafe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:31">[00:49:31]</a>.
2.  **Extreme Safety:** The next extreme was auto-saving everything, which felt safe but led to a "paper trail" of unwanted "untitled documents" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:50">[00:50:50]</a>.
3.  **The Balance:** The final solution was a balance: interrupting for new issues to confirm saving a draft, but auto-saving modifications to existing drafts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:13">[00:51:13]</a>.

This process involves building and testing these extreme versions, often internally, to deeply understand how they feel and learn about what the *right* answer truly is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:40">[00:47:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:13">[00:53:13]</a>.

## Software as a Teacher and Opinionated Products

B2B software isn't just a tool; it often teaches users *how to work* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:29">[00:54:29]</a>. When a company adopts a new tool, they're not just getting software, but also the underlying practices and ideas it embodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:06">[00:55:06]</a>. Linear, for example, has an "opinionated" stance on how product teams should operate, based on observed successful practices of high-performing teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:50">[00:56:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:39">[00:57:39]</a>.

Rather than offering endless customizations, Linear integrates these consensus best practices as native features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:49">[00:57:49]</a>. This means the tool guides companies towards more effective workflows, such as systemized triage management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:32">[00:36:32]</a>.

## The Double Triangle: PM's Role in Go-to-Market

Product management at Linear is viewed as a "go-to-market discipline" alongside sales and marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:52">[00:58:52]</a>. This contrasts with the typical PM-Engineering-Design triad model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:01">[00:59:01]</a>. The Product Manager (PM) acts as a bridge, connecting the "building" side of the organization (engineering, design) with the "selling" side (sales, marketing) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:32">[01:01:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:57">[01:01:57]</a>.

PMs are encouraged to:
*   **Participate in sales calls:** To understand customer pain points and provide intelligence for the sales team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>.
*   **Originate messaging:** Leveraging their deep customer understanding to help marketing teams pick the right words and phrasing that resonate with the target audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:36">[01:03:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:55">[01:03:55]</a>. This includes being heavily involved in product marketing, writing emails, headlines, and website copy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:59">[01:03:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:11">[01:04:11]</a>.

## Deadlines and Commitment

Linear takes deadlines extremely seriously, treating them as "P-zero" problems where everything else becomes secondary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:02">[01:10:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:07">[01:10:07]</a>. This approach ensures accountability and signals commitment to stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:12">[01:10:12]</a>.

Key principles for deadlines:
*   **Fewer deadlines:** Don't have too many, but when you do, commit fully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:17">[01:10:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:19">[01:11:19]</a>.
*   **External triggers:** Deadlines are typically set for external marketing launches or communications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:32">[01:11:32]</a>.
*   [[decision_making_in_product_management | Scope cutting]]: The PM's primary job is to aggressively cut scope to ensure the deadline is met with a shippable product, even if it lacks desired features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:32">[01:10:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:52">[01:10:52]</a>.
*   **No extensive estimating:** Instead of lengthy estimation, the focus is on shipping early and using the remaining time for iteration and polishing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:18">[01:13:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:24">[01:13:24]</a>.

Missing a launch opportunity means it's lost forever, as there's a limited number of opportunities to communicate with the audience within a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:25">[01:12:25]</a>.

## Key Takeaways

Linear's success in building a beloved and fast-growing B2B product stems from several core principles:
*   **Prioritize early, workable solutions:** Get features out to users (internal and beta) as quickly as possible to gather feedback and validate direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:23">[01:13:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>.
*   **Focus on the Individual Contributor (IC):** Prioritize the end-user experience over middle manager requests for custom reporting that can bloat the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:48">[01:16:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:14">[01:39:14]</a>. Identify and address misaligned incentives within the user base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:01">[00:40:01]</a>.
*   **Deeply understand specific user problems:** Go beyond general requests to uncover the emotional motivations and real-life use cases of specific individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:13">[00:31:13]</a>.
*   **Use extreme thinking to innovate:** Explore the wildest possibilities for a feature to break conventional thinking and uncover optimal solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:31">[00:45:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:13">[00:53:13]</a>.
*   **Be opinionated about workflow:** Recognize that B2B software teaches a way of working, and build in best practices rather than allowing endless customizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:58">[00:55:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:50">[00:56:50]</a>.
*   **Integrate product management with go-to-market:** PMs should actively engage with sales and marketing, particularly in shaping the product's external messaging and understanding customer language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:52">[00:58:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:55">[01:03:55]</a>.
*   **Treat deadlines as P-zero problems:** When a deadline is committed, commit fully, cut scope aggressively, and ensure the team is solely focused on hitting it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:02">[01:10:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:01">[01:13:01]</a>.

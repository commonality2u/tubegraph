At Airbnb, a significant shift has occurred in how design, marketing, and engineering functions are integrated, moving away from traditional models to foster greater clarity, speed, and product excellence. Brian Chesky, CEO and co-founder of Airbnb, champions a highly involved, functional approach that prioritizes a cohesive product story and efficient team collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:38">[01:37:38]</a>.

## Challenges of Traditional Organizational Structures

Brian Chesky observed several issues in traditional company structures that hindered product development:
*   **Lack of Clarity and Direction** Founders often apologize for how they want to run a company, seeking a midpoint between their vision and their team's desires, which leads to misery for everyone involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. What people truly desire is clarity and the ability to "row in the same direction" quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.
*   **Micromanagement vs. Detail Involvement** There's a distinction between micromanagement (telling people exactly what to do) and being in the details (understanding the work to ensure quality) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:29">[00:29:29]</a>. Leaders must be in the details to know if people are doing a good job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
*   **Siloed Operations** Companies often operate with different groups running on slightly different technical stacks, accumulating technical debt and creating dependencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:44:07">[09:44:07]</a>. This leads to teams building their own services, becoming separate divisions, fostering internal advocacy and politics, and ultimately resulting in bureaucracy and a lack of accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:15:00">[10:15:00]</a>.
*   **Disconnection Between Engineering and Marketing** In many companies, engineering and marketing operate in "different universes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:48:00">[11:48:00]</a>. Marketing is like the waiters talking to customers and knowing how to sell, while engineers are the chefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:59:00">[11:59:00]</a>. They need to be "enjoined at the hip" for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:10:00">[12:10:00]</a>.
*   **Ineffective Growth Strategies** Relying heavily on performance marketing (lasers) rather than building brand (chandeliers) can lead to non-accumulating advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:39:00">[12:39:39]</a>. If new products aren't marketed effectively, there's little purpose in shipping them, leading to incremental development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:35:00">[13:35:00]</a>.
*   **Design as a Service** Silicon Valley often treats design as a service organization, catching issues before product launch rather than integrating it into the development process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:20:00">[09:20:00]</a>. This is detrimental to designers, product managers, and engineers alike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:00">[09:30:00]</a>.
*   **Excessive AB Testing** While important, un-hypothesized AB testing (e.g., blue vs. green buttons) can lead to fragmented product experiences and prevent holistic system design, akin to designing a house by AB testing individual sofas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:00:00">[19:00:00]</a>.

## Airbnb's Transformative Approach

After facing significant challenges, including an 80% business loss in eight weeks during the pandemic, Brian Chesky initiated a radical restructuring of Airbnb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:20:00">[24:20:00]</a>. His model, inspired by Apple under Steve Jobs, shifted from a divisional to a purely functional structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:00:00">[22:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:52:00">[25:52:00]</a>.

### Key Changes Implemented:

*   **CEO as Chief Product Officer** Chesky believes the CEO of a product or tech-led company should effectively be the chief product officer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:38:00">[16:38:00]</a>. He became deeply involved in every product and marketing detail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:49:00">[24:49:00]</a>.
*   **Functional Model** Airbnb moved from 10 different divisions (e.g., flights, homes, business travel) operating independently to a single functional model with integrated design, engineering, product marketing, marketing, communications, sales, and operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:25:00">[22:25:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:52:00">[25:52:00]</a>.
*   **Streamlined Product Management**
    *   The traditional product management function was eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:49:00">[06:49:00]</a>.
    *   Inbound product development responsibilities were combined with outbound/marketing responsibilities, creating a **Product Marketing** role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03:00">[07:03:00]</a>.
    *   Many program management duties were offloaded to dedicated program managers, now a high-status job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:02:00">[28:02:00]</a>.
    *   The new product marketing group is smaller and more senior, requiring a deep understanding of how to talk about the product, as one cannot build a product without knowing how to market it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42:00">[07:42:00]</a>.
    *   Product marketing manages by influence, not control, over design and engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:00">[08:21:00]</a>.
*   **Centralized Roadmap and Launches**
    *   A single, rolling two-year product roadmap is updated every month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:52:00">[13:52:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:24:00">[27:24:00]</a>.
    *   Products are released in two major launches annually (May and October/November), with everything shipped requiring a place on the roadmap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:18:00">[14:18:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:19:00">[28:19:00]</a>.
    *   The "story" of the product often dictates its development, ensuring a cohesive output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:54:00">[14:54:00]</a>.
*   **Deep Involvement in Details and Accountability**
    *   Chesky reduced the number of projects significantly, ensuring teams work together on fewer, more impactful initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:30:00">[25:30:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:32:00">[36:32:00]</a>.
    *   Layers of management were removed to foster closer ties between leaders and teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:46:00">[25:46:00]</a>.
    *   Executives are expected to be experts in their functional domain, managing work first and people second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:31:00">[26:31:00]</a>.
    *   Decision-making was centralized, creating one "shared consciousness" among the top 30-40 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:10:00">[27:10:00]</a>.
    *   CEO reviews are held weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly to track project progress, identify bottlenecks, and ensure collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:31:00">[28:31:00]</a>.
*   **Integrated Creative and Writing Functions**
    *   An in-house creative agency was built to manage all brand touchpoints, from ads to product creative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:15:00">[30:15:00]</a>.
    *   UX writing was combined with marketing writing to ensure a single, consistent voice across all communications (emails, app, ads) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:41:00">[30:41:00]</a>.
*   **Shifting Growth Strategy** Instead of relying solely on paid growth (like performance marketing), Airbnb is betting that building the best possible product and telling people about it will drive growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>. They still use performance marketing to balance supply and demand but emphasize brand building and product education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:50:00">[12:50:00]</a>.

### Benefits of the Integrated Approach

This new model has led to significant improvements:
*   **Clarity and Shared Direction** Teams are more aligned and can "row in the same direction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:51:00">[31:51:00]</a>.
*   **Faster Execution and Reduced Bureaucracy** By cutting down projects, removing layers, and maintaining CEO involvement, the company moves faster with less internal politics and fewer "meetings about meetings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:50:00">[20:50:00]</a>.
*   **Enhanced Product Quality and Cohesion** The focus on an overall cohesive system, rather than fragmented A/B tests, leads to a better user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:01:00">[20:01:00]</a>. This approach allowed for significant product updates, such as "Guest Favorites" (a collection of the top 2 million homes based on 370 million reviews and other data) and a completely overhauled host tab to improve listing management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:15:00">[39:15:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:11:00">[41:11:00]</a>.
*   **New Design Aesthetic** Airbnb is pushing a new, more three-dimensional, colorful aesthetic in its interfaces, moving away from flat design. This includes AI-powered photo tours that automatically organize listing photos by room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:51:00">[43:51:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:59:00">[44:59:00]</a>.
*   **Increased CEO Efficiency** Paradoxically, deeper involvement initially increased work but ultimately led to more free time for the CEO, as the culture became self-sustaining and proactive, with fewer crises and conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:41:00">[50:41:00]</a>.

## Advice for Founders and Leaders

Brian Chesky believes this methodology can work for most companies, though not necessarily to the extreme degree Airbnb has adopted. Key recommendations include:
*   **CEO as Chief Product Officer** The CEO, if they are a product person, should embody the role of chief product officer and be deeply involved in the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:36:00">[35:36:00]</a>.
*   **Close, Interconnected Teams** Whether fully functional or not, ensure that all product managers (and other relevant functions) are interconnected and aware of each other's work, avoiding silos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:50:00">[35:50:00]</a>.
*   **Expert Leaders** Every leader should be an expert in the domain they are leading, avoiding "people managers" whose sole responsibility is people, not the work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:02:00">[36:02:00]</a>.
*   **Lean and Focused Teams** Aim for fewer employees, grow slowly, and prioritize having five teams work on one thing rather than one team working on five things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:25:00">[36:25:00]</a>.
*   **Strategic Launches** Consider doing planned product launches to package and tell a cohesive story, even if shipping continuously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:42:00">[36:42:00]</a>.
*   **Balanced Decision-Making** Use data, but also incorporate research and intuition, as intuition comes from deep understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:51:00">[36:51:00]</a>.
*   **Organizational Structure for Design** Ideally, have engineering and design report directly to the founder or product-led person, and avoid having design report under product unless the product person is also a designer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:12:00">[37:12:00]</a>.
*   **Expanded Product Management** Product managers should expand their responsibilities to include distribution, understanding the customer, and storytelling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:28:00">[37:28:00]</a>. They need a combination of "art and science" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:37:00">[37:37:00]</a>.
*   **Interconnected Functions** Ensure [[the_importance_of_aligning_incentives_for_engineering_and_product_management_teams | marketing and engineering]] are interconnected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:55:00">[37:55:00]</a>.
*   **Fewer Layers of Management** Strive for as few layers as possible between the CEO and other employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:59:00">[37:59:00]</a>.
*   **Story-Driven Development** Think of each release as a chapter in a long-term story, guiding the company's evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:18:00">[38:18:00]</a>.
*   **Unified Direction** The most critical element is getting "everyone to row together in the same direction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:33:00">[38:33:00]</a>.

### The "Add a Zero" Mindset and Leadership

Chesky emphasizes setting ambitious goals with the "add a zero" mindset, challenging teams to think 10x bigger or better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:33:00">[46:33:00]</a>. This forces [[systems_thinking_in_engineering | thinking differently about the problem]], breaking it down to first principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:00:00">[47:00:00]</a>. Leaders must set the pace through decisive action and a bias for action, avoiding "circling back" on issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:40:00">[47:40:00]</a>. The role of a leader is to see potential in people they may not see in themselves, fostering a growth mindset rather than demoralizing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:50:00">[48:50:00]</a>.

## Personal Growth and Avoiding Burnout

Brian Chesky's personal strategies for [[developing_engineering_strategy_and_its_importance | continuous learning]] and avoiding burnout include:
*   **Structured Time Off** Taking every other weekend completely off work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:19:00">[53:19:00]</a>.
*   **Physical Health** Consistent exercise (daily cardio, weights), healthy eating (bodybuilding diet of 5-6 meals a day), and sufficient sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:35:00">[53:35:00]</a>.
*   **Nurturing Relationships** Prioritizing healthy relationships, including regular contact and shared experiences with old friends, aligning with the Harvard study on human happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:02:00">[54:02:00]</a>.
*   **Proactive Prioritization** Shifting from reacting to emails and meetings to proactively scheduling time based on strategic goals and meaningful relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:40:00">[56:40:00]</a>. This means saying no to "fake work" that doesn't move the ball forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:38:00">[57:38:00]</a>.
*   **Beginner's Mindset and Curiosity** Maintaining a "beginner's mindset" and curiosity, seeing everything with fresh eyes, and being shamelessly open to asking for help from others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:19:00">[59:19:00]</a>.
*   **Learning by Teaching** Chesky believes that teaching others, as he does by advising founders like Sam Altman, is a way to continue learning himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>.

## The Artist's Influence on Airbnb

Brian Chesky's background as an artist and industrial designer heavily influences Airbnb's unique approach to product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:51">[01:11:51]</a>. From drawing as a child and studying architecture to industrial design, he developed a holistic understanding of creation, engineering, and market accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:22">[01:05:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:34">[01:09:34]</a>. This foundation, combined with meeting co-founder Joe Gebbia at art school, laid the groundwork for Airbnb's design-led ethos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:14">[01:10:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:22">[01:10:22]</a>. He believes that intuition, imagination, and curiosity, often associated with art and design, are crucial qualities needed in leadership, and that companies should be more "whole well-rounded" in their approach, not just biased towards one side of their "head" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:02">[01:12:02]</a>.

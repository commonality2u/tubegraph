37signals, co-founded and led by Jason Fried, operates as a distinct model in the tech industry. Unlike many startups, 37signals does not have investors, a board, plans to go public, or intentions to sell the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:06">[01:03:06]</a>. The company has maintained profitability for 24 consecutive years, serving over 100,000 customers and generating tens of millions of dollars in annual profit, a feat often not achieved by many venture-backed companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:50">[01:00:50]</a>. This profit directly benefits its founders and employees due to the absence of investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>.

## Focus on Efficiency Over Growth

37signals, with approximately 75 employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, stands in stark contrast to its competitors in the project management space. For example, Asana has 1,600 employees, ClickUp has 1,000, [[scaling_strategies_for_startups_and_lessons_from_stripes_growth | Slack]] has 2,500, Smartsheet has 3,000, and Monday has 1,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Despite these large discrepancies in team size, 37signals serves a similar number of customers (around 100,000 to 150,000) and achieves significant profits, while many competitors do not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

This success is attributed to a focus on efficiency rather than aggressive growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:06">[01:03:06]</a>. The company avoids common scaling practices such as:
*   Employing salespeople <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.
*   Offering numerous product versions or tiers (e.g., Basecamp primarily has one price point at $299 for unlimited users) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.
*   Chasing enterprise clients, which typically incur high support and customization costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

By keeping operations simple and tightly focused, 37signals avoids the complexity that often accompanies attempts to serve diverse customer needs at varied price points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

### Operational Methodology: Shape Up

37signals employs a unique development framework called "Shape Up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, detailed in a free book available on basecamp.com/shapeup. Key principles include:
*   **Six-Week Cycles and Appetites**: Projects are strictly limited to a maximum six-week "appetite" rather than an estimated time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This means the company decides how much time it is *willing* to spend on a feature, forcing focus on the simplest, most effective version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Work is explicitly defined as expanding to fill the time available, so limiting time limits scope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.
*   **Small Teams**: Every feature is developed by a team of two people: one programmer and one designer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This prevents large, slow-moving projects with numerous meetings and delayed decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.
*   **Shaping the Work**: Ideas are "shaped" ahead of time by management, then teams are given latitude to figure out how to execute the work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Teams are not given detailed specs or tickets; they define their own tasks to fulfill the shaped idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.
*   **Trading Concessions**: If a project encounters unforeseen complexity, teams discuss trade-offs and potential "concessions" with management to complete it within the allocated time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.
*   **Project Termination**: If a project is not nearing completion ("on the Downs slope" of the "Hill chart") by the end of its six-week cycle, it is typically abandoned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This prevents demoralizing, never-ending projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.
*   **Cooldown Periods**: After each six-week cycle, a two-week "cooldown" period allows employees to work on internal projects, fix bugs, or explore ideas that wouldn't fit into a cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This prevents burnout common in continuous "sprint" models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

### Decision-Making and Culture

37signals explicitly rejects long-term business planning, financial goals, OKRs, and KPIs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Decisions are largely driven by intuition, gut feeling, and judgment, believing that human decision-making inherently incorporates thousands of indescribable factors beyond mere data points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This approach is rooted in the belief that "everything's a judgment call" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This mindset is fostered throughout the company, encouraging employees to share their "feelings" about products and flows rather than demanding data-backed justifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

The company fosters a culture where "work isn't war" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:16">[01:09:16]</a>. This philosophy rejects military metaphors common in business (e.g., "conquer the market," "target customers," "destroy the competition") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:16">[01:09:16]</a>. Instead, the focus is on creating value, building great products, and fostering a spirit of creation rather than destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:16">[01:09:16]</a>.

## The Bootstrap Path and "Stayups"

37signals champions the bootstrapping model, emphasizing that most successful businesses globally are bootstrapped, not venture-funded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While acknowledging that venture capital can be necessary for certain capital-intensive businesses (like car manufacturing or ride-sharing networks), it argues that software businesses often do not require external funding due to low startup costs and high potential margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

A core tenet of this approach is the idea of a "stayup" rather than a "startup" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Starting a business is considered easier than sustaining one, and the focus shifts to resilience and long-term viability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

Key advice for bootstrapping includes:
*   **Stay as small as possible for as long as possible**: Control costs, which is the only controllable factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.
*   **Do it yourself**: Founders should handle as much work as possible before hiring additional team members, as adding people incurs significant costs and complexities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.
*   **Avoid unnecessary expenses**: Do not spend on branding, expensive offices, or custom web design in the early stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.
*   **Embrace simplicity**: Things are often hard, but only become truly complicated when people make them so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

The ability to operate independently, without external expectations or obligations, is seen as the foundation for 37signals' practices and the freedom to pursue projects they are passionate about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## The "Once" Product Line

Reflecting a shift in thinking from purely focusing on Basecamp, 37signals is launching a new line of non-SaaS products called "Once" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:50">[01:00:50]</a>. This initiative is based on the belief that a pendulum swing away from subscription fatigue will occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:33">[01:23:33]</a>.

"Once" products will involve a single payment for software that users download and install on their own servers or cloud, with no recurring subscription fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:33">[01:23:33]</a>. These products aim to be high-quality, simple, essential "generics" in markets where business software has become a commodity but still charges high prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:33">[01:23:33]</a>.

The first product in the "Once" line is a relaunch of "Campfire," a group chat tool originally created in 2006 (predating [[scaling_strategies_for_startups_and_lessons_from_stripes_growth | Slack]] by about eight years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:48">[01:26:48]</a>. This version of Campfire will be available for a one-time fee under $1,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:27">[01:33:27]</a>, and users will receive the source code, allowing for modification and tweaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:57">[01:28:57]</a>. This approach encourages alternatives and can serve niche needs like air-gapped chat for high-security environments or simply a backup system without recurring costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:10">[01:28:10]</a>.

## Personal Growth and Learning

Fried highlights that his personal and professional journey has been a long continuum, starting from reselling electronics at 15 to building software today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:20">[01:18:20]</a>. He views entrepreneurship as a job, aiming to [[building_a_startup_culture | build a company culture]] he wants to work at <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:01">[01:19:01]</a>.

One notable change in perspective was realizing that focusing solely on a single product (Basecamp) for the rest of his career was not as fulfilling as he initially thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:50">[01:00:50]</a>. This led to the creation of Hey, an email service, and now the "Once" product line, rekindling the joy of making new things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:50">[01:00:50]</a>.

His guiding principle, inherited from his father, is that "no one ever went broke making a profit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:03">[01:23:03]</a>. He believes that the constant practice of making money, enforced by bootstrapping, builds a fundamental skill often lacking in venture-backed companies that prioritize spending and growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:54">[01:17:54]</a>.

Fried's life motto is to "worry less," inspired by a Tom Petty lyric: "most of the things you worry about never happen anyway" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:27">[01:44:27]</a>. This philosophy extends to business, encouraging a focus on the present and accepting uncertain outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:06">[01:03:06]</a>. He also finds personal inspiration in "scrappiness" and ingenuity, admiring creations born out of necessity and severe constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:26">[01:38:26]</a>.

Looking ahead, Fried plans to write a new book exploring the role of gut and intuition in business and decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:20">[01:45:20]</a>.

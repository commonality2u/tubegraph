Notion, co-founded by Ivan Zhao, endured a challenging initial period, described by Zhao as the "Lost Years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. This phase, lasting three to four years, involved extensive experimentation and a significant pivot to find [[the_role_of_struggling_moments_in_product_innovation|product-market fit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:14">[01:13:14]</a>.

## The "Lost Years" and Initial Vision
Notion began in 2013 with a vision to enable anyone to create their own software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The first iteration was an easy-to-use developer tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. However, after a couple of years, the team realized that most people "just don't care" about creating software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. They found that users were primarily focused on getting their daily jobs done, not optimizing workflows through software creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:08">[01:12:08]</a>. This initial version was built more on what Ivan Zhao wanted rather than what people needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:19">[01:19:19]</a>.

## Pivoting and Hiding the Vision
The realization that people wouldn't adopt a direct developer tool led to a strategic shift: "let's hide our vision which is everybody can create their software in the form factor that people do care" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. It took two years to understand they needed to build a productivity tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. Zhao uses the analogy of "sugar and broccoli": people don't want to eat broccoli (the software creation vision), but they like sugar (productivity software), so Notion gives them "the sugar that hide your broccoli inside of it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. Notion is now understood as a productivity suite, but its underlying intent includes no-code developer power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:46">[01:22:46]</a>.

## Technical Challenges and Rebuilds
Beyond the product vision, Notion faced significant technical hurdles. The team rebuilt the code many times, effectively throwing away the code base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. After two years of working on the developer product, they realized they were building on the wrong technical foundation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:23">[01:14:23]</a>. They had bet on "Web Component" technology from Google, which was unstable due to its novelty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:32">[01:14:32]</a>. This instability forced them to "restart a company" and rebuild the entire system on a more stable technology like React <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:55">[01:14:55]</a>.

## Financial Struggles and Perseverance
During these [[journey_and_challenges_of_early_employees_in_a_startup|early years]], Notion faced financial difficulties. Ivan's mother initially helped kickstart the company, and he had to borrow money from her again to bridge financial gaps when they ran out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:21">[01:15:21]</a>. At one point, with Notion at five people, they decided to lay off everyone, leaving only Ivan and his co-founder Simon to rebuild <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:37">[01:17:37]</a>. Morale was low, prompting them to move to Japan, sub-leasing their apartment and office in San Francisco, which surprisingly helped them save money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:53">[01:17:53]</a>. They spent time traveling and "just coding every day and design every day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:13">[01:18:13]</a>. This intense, focused period, where they could "cross through the problem space really quickly," was described as some of the happiest moments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:36">[01:18:36]</a>.

### Advice for Founders on Perseverance
Ivan Zhao offers several pieces of advice for founders struggling to find their product-market fit or facing long periods without success:
*   **Believe in the vision**: You must believe the product "needs to exist in the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:14">[01:19:14]</a>. Notion's founders were driven by the desire for "Lego for software," a usable mass-market concept that didn't exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>.
*   **Stay lean**: Being able to operate with a small team and minimal overhead is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>.
*   **Disconnect and reset**: Changing the scenario, like moving to Japan, can help reset perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:26">[01:26:26]</a>.
*   **Prioritize sleep**: "Whenever I feel down I just go to sleep then next day I'm I'm just reset" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:47">[01:48:47]</a>.
*   **Don't be afraid to reset**: Have the courage to restart, even if it means throwing away previous work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:34">[01:58:34]</a>. Progress can be achieved through "better abstractions" that compound faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:07">[02:07:07]</a>.
*   **Balance business with values**: Building a product involves optimizing for users and revenue, but also for what you want the world to have based on your values and aesthetic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:49">[02:09:49]</a>. While too much self-focus leads to an "art project" with no users, too much business focus leads to a "commodity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:54">[02:21:54]</a>. Building for value is a "more durable energy source" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:16">[02:14:16]</a>.
*   **Beware of momentum**: Don't let existing momentum take you in a wrong direction; be willing to rethink and "start again" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:03">[02:44:03]</a>.

## Finding Product-Market Fit
Finding [[elements_of_breakthrough_startup_ideas_inflections_insights_founder_future_fit|product-market fit]] for Notion was not a "binary state" or a single milestone, but a gradual realization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:21">[02:25:21]</a>. It manifested as a growing number of people caring about the product, reaching out, and paying for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:05">[02:29:05]</a>. A key indicator was when investors started "knocking on the door" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:59">[02:29:59]</a>, with one even sending dog food to their non-public office address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:46">[02:35:46]</a>. However, Zhao realized external validation didn't necessarily help make a better product, leading him to prioritize building based on customer feedback over excessive investor meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:55">[02:40:55]</a>.

## Evolution of Leadership and Product Strategy
As Notion grew, Ivan Zhao had to adapt his leadership style from one-to-one influence to being a one-to-many storyteller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>. He views this, and all aspects of building Notion, as a "craft," applying "value to some technical know-how" to make "clever tradeoffs" and create something new and useful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:38">[03:37:38]</a>.

Notion also learned that building a "Lego for software" (a horizontal product) required finding a popular "horizontal use case" as a top-of-funnel strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:38">[05:37:38]</a>. For Notion, this was notes and documents, a use case with over a billion users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:54">[05:56:54]</a>. Many B2B customers started as personal users who then brought Notion to work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:23:46">[05:23:46]</a>.

The development of Notion's project management features exemplified a deviation from their core "Lego" value. They initially "hard coded" features like Milestones, which felt "underpowered compared to other competitive products" and didn't fit with Notion's modular system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:53">[04:56:53]</a>. It took a year and a half to realize this was not aligned with their value of being "Lego for software," leading them to return to building modular components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:57">[04:57:57]</a>. This experience reinforced the [[importance_of_first_principles_thinking_in_product_development|importance of building according to their core values]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>.

## Surviving Crises
Notion also faced a near-catastrophic [[navigating_crises_and_scaling_infrastructure_at_notion|crisis during COVID]], when their single PostgreSQL database instance, containing all Notion data, was running out of space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:01">[05:00:01]</a>. They stopped all new feature development, and nearly every engineer worked to solve this sharding problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:10">[05:10:10]</a>. They were "weeks" away from a complete shutdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:00">[05:24:00]</a>. This highlighted the lesson to "plan ahead a little bit" for scaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a>.

## Philosophy of Tools
Ivan Zhao believes that tools are "extensions of us" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:16">[01:13:16]</a>, and once shaped, "they can come back to shape us" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:22">[01:13:22]</a>. His goal with Notion is to amplify human creativity and beauty in software, aligning with his personal values and shaping users towards a better version of themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:41">[01:04:41]</a>. The ultimate fulfillment comes from seeing people, even non-programmers, use Notion to create and make a living by selling templates and apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:22">[01:05:22]</a>.

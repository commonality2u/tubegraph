A strategy is fundamentally a design for overcoming a high-stakes challenge, combining policy and action to address an issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. This challenge can be positive, like discovering a new opportunity, or negative, such as a new innovation threatening market position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. The term "strategy" originates from the Greek "stratos," referring to elected leaders who dealt with the day's issues, whether military invasions or societal problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

## The Kernel of Good Strategy

According to Richard Rumelt, author of [[good_strategy_vs_bad_strategy | *Good Strategy Bad Strategy*]], a successful strategy is built upon three essential components, often referred to as "the kernel": diagnosis, guiding policy, and coherent actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:28">[00:26:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. If any of these three elements are missing, it's not truly a strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>.

### 1. Diagnosis

The first step in crafting a strategy is a clear diagnosis of the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. This involves understanding the challenge faced and deciding what specific aspects to focus attention on, forming hypotheses about how things connect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. It's crucial to identify what makes the problem *hard* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:46">[00:56:46]</a>. A common pitfall is mistaking ambitions or simple goals for a diagnosis; for example, stating a company hasn't grown fast enough is a statement of values, not a diagnosis of what's holding it back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:45">[00:19:45]</a>.

### 2. Guiding Policy

Following a clear diagnosis, a guiding policy outlines how the organization intends to deal with the identified challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:28">[00:26:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. This policy dictates what the organization *will* do and, importantly, what it *will not* do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>. A key aspect of a good guiding policy is focus, avoiding the trap of listing numerous, unprioritized objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. Having 17 priorities, for instance, is the opposite of a coherent policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. Concentration on a few things is more effective and is a fundamental source of power in strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:03">[00:25:03]</a>.

### 3. Coherent Actions

The final, and most easily overlooked, component is a set of coherent actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[01:03:10]</a>. These actions must directly address the diagnosis and align with the guiding policy, avoiding self-contradictory efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. For example, simultaneously aiming to burn less oil and import more oil makes no sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>. Actions should also be concise, ideally a few steps rather than a long list of desired outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a>.

## The Role of Power and Asymmetry

A successful strategy exploits an "asymmetry" of some kind, providing a unique advantage or leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:17">[00:29:17]</a>. This "power" can manifest in various forms:
*   **Being first**: Recognizing an opportunity or developing something new ahead of others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:38">[00:29:38]</a>.
*   **Reputation**: A strong reputation in a certain area can provide power, though a well-established reputation can also hinder new ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:47">[00:29:47]</a>.
*   **Relationships**: Existing relationships, like IBM's deep connections with large corporate clients, can be a source of power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:13">[00:30:13]</a>.
*   **Specialized knowledge or resources**: Possessing unique insights, inventions, or customer bases that competitors cannot easily access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:18">[00:32:18]</a>.
*   **Network effects**: The more users a product or service has, the more useful it becomes, creating a powerful advantage for leaders (e.g., social media platforms, Amazon) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:16">[00:35:16]</a>. This is evident in Google's ability to improve search with vast amounts of data, making it hard for competitors like Bing to catch up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:43">[00:38:43]</a>.

To identify sources of power, consider how your company or team is different from others—what unique knowledge or possessions do you have <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:52">[00:32:52]</a>? Sometimes, redefining your market to a smaller, more focused space can reveal existing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:16">[00:33:16]</a>.

## The Crux: Focusing on the Hardest Challenge

The term "crux" refers to the hardest part of a mountain climb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:01">[01:03:01]</a>. In strategy, the crux is the most challenging problem that, if solved, can unlock significant progress toward ambitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:21">[01:03:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:17">[01:04:17]</a>. The advice for a climber is often, "If you can't do the crux, don't do the climb" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:46">[01:03:46]</a>.

To find the crux, start with your ambitions and then identify what specific barriers or problems are preventing you from making progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:11">[01:00:11]</a>. The chosen challenge must be both important and achievable, something that can actually be addressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:44">[01:01:44]</a>.

### The Role of Insight

Solving a strategic problem, particularly the crux, often requires "insight" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:52">[01:08:52]</a>. Insight is not magical; it arises from deep immersion in the problem's nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:24">[01:09:24]</a>. It's about looking at what makes a problem hard and then seeing a way to overcome it, often through a surprising solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:48">[01:08:48]</a>.

## Overcoming Organizational Challenges

Many organizations struggle with strategy not because of a lack of knowledge, but due to internal dynamics and politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:47">[01:40:47]</a>.
*   **Diverse interests**: Senior executives often disagree on the importance of different issues, and their personal interests can conflict with collective goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:17">[01:15:17]</a>.
*   **Fear of action**: Implementing strategy involves changing what people do and altering power relationships, which can lead to hesitation among leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:55">[01:15:55]</a>.
*   **Lack of decisive leadership**: In complex organizations, a clear hierarchy is needed for someone to ultimately decide on a path forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:06">[01:11:06]</a>. When everyone wants their ideas included, the strategy becomes a list of everything, leading to diffusion of effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:40">[01:11:40]</a>.

The challenge is to coalesce a group around a focused "action agenda" that addresses a specific, achievable problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:05">[01:14:05]</a>.

## "Action Agenda" vs. "Strategy"

To simplify and clarify the purpose of strategy, it's often more effective to call it an "action agenda" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This shift in terminology emphasizes concrete actions to be taken, rather than abstract, high-level concepts like mission, vision, or values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:09">[00:58:09]</a>. An action agenda is not a set of goals to achieve, but rather specific things the organization will *do* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:36">[01:02:36]</a>.

## Strategic Thinking for Startups

For founders and startups, strategy involves making a clear "bet" about a particular product-market solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:05">[01:21:05]</a>. Given the inherent uncertainty, successful startups often "switch" or pivot, adapting their approach as reality is revealed in bits and pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:28">[01:22:28]</a>. The key is to be convinced of eventual success while remaining willing to adapt when things aren't working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:14">[01:23:14]</a>.

A useful exercise for startups and individuals alike is to identify "value denied" – things people should be able to buy or experience but cannot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:40">[01:26:40]</a>. Thinking about how something *ought* to be, like a "perfect window," can lead to innovative business ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:48">[01:27:48]</a>.

Ultimately, strategy is not mysterious; it's about solving the most important, achievable problem you're facing, staying focused, and being consistent in your actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:20">[01:31:20]</a>. For those interested in [[becoming_more_strategic | becoming more strategic]], immersing oneself in history, biographies, and real-world stories can provide invaluable insights for strategic thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:29">[01:47:29]</a>.

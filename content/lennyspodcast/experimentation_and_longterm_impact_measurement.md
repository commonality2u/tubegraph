Shopify, a significant player in e-commerce, differentiates its approach to product development and growth by focusing on long-term impact rather than traditional short-term metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. This philosophy is deeply ingrained in its organizational structure and decision-making processes, emphasizing a 100-year vision for the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

## Unique Approach to Product and Growth

Shopify's leadership recognizes the pitfalls of optimizing for local conversion rates, which can lead teams to inadvertently make the previous funnel step harder to increase their own conversion rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:51">[00:27:51]</a>. Instead, the company encourages thinking about the *total number* of people who complete a journey, not just rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a>. This encourages reducing friction to get more people in the door, even if it might lower a conversion rate, as it can lead to more overall users or sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:49">[00:28:49]</a>.

### The 100-Year Vision
Shopify's priorities and product roadmap are driven by a 100-year vision articulated by CEO Toby <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:20">[00:42:20]</a>. This long-term outlook shapes everything from capital investment to product decision-making, ensuring that short-term gains do not compromise the company's future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:12">[00:44:12]</a>.

### Metrics and Accountability
Unlike many companies where [[developing_and_using_northstar_metrics | Northstar metrics]] and KPIs are central, Shopify's core product teams deliberately operate without them; they are "banned" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:31">[00:48:31]</a>. Decisions are based on "taste and intuition" and building towards the [[longterm_vision_and_entrepreneurship | long-term vision]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. While data is consulted, it's not the sole or overriding factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:56">[00:48:56]</a>. This approach aims to ship features that are "for-facing" and allows for taking more risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:31">[00:49:31]</a>, though it can lead to subjective discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:42">[00:49:42]</a>.

For core product development, success is determined by the "conviction that this is the right technical foundation to build the future of Commerce" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:49">[00:48:49]</a>. This strong emphasis on the "how" (technical architecture) is unique, as the founder believes it dictates strategy more than the "what" or "who" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:01">[00:45:01]</a>. This sometimes means taking longer to ship a feature but results in a more adaptable and flexible platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:39">[00:45:39]</a>.

For growth teams, the focus is on the total cohort value in terms of Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV) produced by merchants over years, rather than per-merchant metrics or short-term retention rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:25">[00:33:25]</a>. This aligns with Shopify's mission to foster entrepreneurship, understanding that many businesses may fail, but the few highly successful ones ("winners") generate substantial revenue through payments tied to GMV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.

## [[importance_of_ab_testing_and_experimentation | Experimentation]] and Long-term Holdouts

Shopify maintains a robust [[experimentation_and_datadriven_decision_making | experimentation platform]] to track the impact of changes over extended periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.

### Long-term Monitoring
Experiments at Shopify include long-term holdouts for certain segments of users (e.g., 5% across the board or 50% for new merchants) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>. The winner of an experiment is shipped to 100% of users, but the original cohorts are monitored for their GMV curve and distribution one, two, and three years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a>. This feedback loop helps refine input metrics and ensures accountability to long-term GMV growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.

Experimenters receive automated updates at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, detailing the updated results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:55">[00:21:55]</a>. This makes it impossible to "hide from" the long-term impact of their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:35">[00:35:35]</a>.

### Counterintuitive Discoveries
Long-term holdouts often reveal surprising insights:
*   **Short-term lift, no long-term impact**: Approximately 30-40% of experiments that show a short-term lift (e.g., in paying shops or first sales) actually yield no incremental long-term GMV lift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>. This often indicates the effect was merely pulling forward success or attracting incremental users with low long-term value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:07">[00:38:07]</a>. An example is optimizing payment failure notifications, which showed short-term lift but no long-term GMV increase because the users were not dedicated to entrepreneurship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:26">[00:39:22]</a>.
*   **Neutral short-term, positive long-term impact**: In some cases, experiments showing neutral or no short-term lift can have a massive long-term positive impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:47">[00:40:47]</a>. This might happen when a change unlocks a pocket of highly valuable merchants who otherwise might have given up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:26">[00:26:26]</a>. An example is offering pre-configured sections in the online store editor; it showed no immediate conversion lift but significantly increased long-term sales and GMV, as it helped merchants create better, higher-converting stores, leading to early sales and sustained momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:50">[00:41:20]</a>. This leads to a culture of shipping neutral experiments if the intuition feels right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:22">[00:41:22]</a>.

### Key Levers for Growth
Shopify has found success through:
*   **Reducing "Monetary Friction"**: This involves exploring trial dynamics, trial length, pricing, and incentives (e.g., app store credits) to lower barriers for new entrepreneurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:29">[00:29:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:29">[00:23:29]</a>. By providing a "monetary boost," Shopify enables entrepreneurs to have more time to try their business idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:17:18]</a>.
*   **Onboarding and Personalization**: Nailing the sign-up flow, collecting the right information, and using it to personalize guidance for diverse users is crucial for long-term success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:50">[00:24:09]</a>.

## Organizational Structure and Collaboration

Shopify's product organization is divided into three major groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>:
1.  **Core Product**: Focuses on building the "hundred-year" right things for commerce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. Decisions are taste-driven and heavily influenced by the founder's vision for technical architecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:46">[00:41:46]</a>.
2.  **Merchant Services**: Builds tools like payments and shipping with a shorter-to-medium-term horizon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.
3.  **Growth**: Manages the end-to-end customer journey, focusing on bringing users on and ensuring their success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.

The Growth organization itself comprises:
*   **Growth R&D**: Traditional product, design, engineering, and data teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:04">[00:30:04]</a>.
    *   **Growth Products**: Covers landing pages, sign-up, onboarding, monetization, and engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>.
    *   **Platform (Ad) Pillar**: Builds internal tools for growth and other Shopify teams, including the [[challenges_and_strategies_in_building_an_experimentation_platform | experimentation platform]], communication platform, and business intelligence tooling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:57">[00:31:10]</a>.
    *   **Customer Support Group**: Sits within growth, focusing on building tools and experiences (e.g., Help Center, AI features) to support merchants throughout their journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:17">[00:31:28]</a>.
*   **Growth Marketing**: Handles paid acquisition, media buying, affiliate marketing, email, content, and SEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:10">[00:30:19]</a>.

Collaboration between the taste-driven core product teams and the metric-driven growth teams relies on "human trust" and a shared commitment to shipping high-quality products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:17">[00:55:45]</a>. They openly debate differences in quality bars to learn and iterate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:03">[00:56:06]</a>.

## Implications for Other Companies

For companies considering a similar approach, it's crucial to have either:
*   Strong metrics as accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:05">[01:00:05]</a>.
*   An "extremely strong founder or set of folks who have extremely strong opinions on what good is and what taste is" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:12">[01:00:17]</a>.

Without either, simply allowing teams to "just build a bunch of cool stuff" can lead to a "very bad state" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:54">[00:59:59]</a>. While the Shopify model allows for significant risk-taking and potentially game-changing innovations, it requires strong central guidance on product quality and direction to maintain coherence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:51">[00:51:27]</a>.

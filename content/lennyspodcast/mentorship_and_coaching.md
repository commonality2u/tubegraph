From: [[lennyspodcast]] <br/> 

Nikhail Singall, who has led large teams at influential consumer product companies such as Facebook, Credit Karma, Google Hangouts, and Google Photos, is deeply passionate about [[mentorship_and_team_leadership | coaching and mentoring]] professionals. He shares his knowledge through his newsletter and podcast, "The Skip" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:15">[01:42:15]</a>.

## Defining Mentorship and Coaching

Singall views [[mentorship_and_team_leadership | mentorship]] broadly, stating he has mentored "hundreds" of product managers, often focusing on helping and [[coaching_strategies_for_ceos_and_leaders | coaching]] individuals through career transitions or dilemmas, which he calls "911 calls" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:07">[05:26:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>. These moments of "dilemma or forks in the road" are when he finds the most substantive opportunities to help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:00">[05:49:00]</a>.

## The Importance of Feedback in Professional Growth

Effective [[candor_and_feedback_in_professional_growth | feedback]] is crucial for [[leveraging_mindset_and_personal_growth_in_professional_settings | personal growth]] and career advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. Singall emphasizes the need to seek "real feedback" rather than just formal feedback, especially in larger companies where formal systems might not capture the true sentiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>.

Key strategies for obtaining good feedback:
*   **Listen Actively:** Avoid justifying or dismissing feedback; instead, listen and understand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>.
*   **Repeat and Internalize:** Demonstrate understanding by repeating the feedback back to the person, even better than they presented it. This helps create a safe environment for sharing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.
*   **Create Safety:** Ensure people feel there is "no worry about retaliation or concern" when giving feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>.
*   **Publicly Acknowledge:** Managers can foster a culture of feedback by publicly thanking individuals who provide valuable feedback, demonstrating that their input is recognized and valued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>.

## Challenges in Management and the Need for Training

Singall observes that the tech industry has historically lacked proper [[coaching_and_leadership_in_product_management | management training]], often promoting individuals based on their technical skills rather than their ability to lead people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>. This contrasts with more mature industries like the military, which prioritize manager training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>. He believes this is a "massive epidemic" causing numerous challenges, from bias to ineffective [[mentorship_and_team_leadership | coaching]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>.

For new managers, two common pitfalls are:
1.  **Not sharing the steering wheel:** Managers often adopt a "divide and conquer" or "teaching to ride a bike" approach, when management is more like a "sidecar on a motorcycle," where the manager is attached but has a specific role of giving counsel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>.
2.  **Not being invited in:** Managers have organizational power but must "earn the right" to manage. They should ask their direct reports how they can help, acting as a "vampire knocking on the door," waiting to be invited in to assist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>.

## The Role of Community in Learning and Development

Given the weakness of structured training, Singall posits that [[mentorship_and_team_leadership | community]] is the most powerful answer for [[leveraging_mindset_and_personal_growth_in_professional_settings | learning and development]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>. Communities provide:
*   Safety for authentic conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>.
*   A sense of not being alone in challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>.
*   Opportunities to share best practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:00">[04:34:00]</a>.

He created a CPO (Chief Product Officer) community called "The Skip CPO community" for product leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>. This community, which grew from six to 28 members, fosters trust and allows CPOs to share experiences and solutions in a safe environment, acknowledging that being "lonely at the top" is a reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>.

## "Shadows of Superpowers" and Executive Coaching

Singall highlights a phenomenon he calls "shadows of superpowers," where senior leaders' greatest strengths can, at higher levels, become their biggest development areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a>. What "got you there isn't what got you here" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:00">[05:55:00]</a>. For example:
*   A great collaborator might struggle when their opinions are challenged, as their collaboration skill was previously only effective when others agreed with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>.
*   Strong growth drivers might struggle with innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:00">[05:34:00]</a>.
*   World-class storytellers might struggle with details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>.
*   Excellent listeners might be weak at decisiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>.

Recognizing these "shadows" is difficult because the strength is part of one's identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>. To overcome this, individuals must listen to contradictory feedback and examine discarded feedback, as it often reveals these hidden development areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>.

## The Long-Term Career and the Need for a "Second North Star"

Many successful individuals face [[leadership_and_personal_growth_as_a_ceo | mental health challenges]] after achieving their career goals, as they haven't considered "what's next" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>. Using the analogy of dog racing, where dogs stop running once they catch the fake rabbit because "what's next?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:11">[01:04:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:21">[01:05:21]</a>, Singall argues that people focus intently on career milestones like becoming a Vice President or starting a company but fail to plan for the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:25">[01:05:25]</a>.

Given that careers can now be 60 years long, it's crucial to cultivate a "second North Star" or "skip" â€“ something important and motivating to pursue beyond initial goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:47">[01:04:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:05">[01:08:05]</a>. This often falls into two categories:
1.  **Scaled Economics:** Continuing to focus on financial growth through investing or private equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:09">[01:09:09]</a>.
2.  **Giving:** Pursuing opportunities to give back, which Eastern philosophies identify as a path to happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:41">[01:09:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:22">[01:10:22]</a>.

Singall encourages people to proactively think about this "Act 3" of their career, as it can be more fulfilling than earlier stages and is tremendously beneficial for society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:10">[01:10:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:40">[01:10:40]</a>. His own Act 3 will focus on [[coaching_and_leadership_in_product_management | coaching and giving to others]], leveraging his product background to scale authentic help to those who can benefit from timely advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:32">[01:11:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:51">[01:11:51]</a>.

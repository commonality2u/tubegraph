Building [[AIdriven software development | AI-driven products]] comes with unique challenges and requires specific strategies for success. It's crucial to approach [[AIs impact on software development | AI]] development with a problem-first mindset, ensuring that the technology serves a genuine need rather than being implemented for its own sake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Avoiding the "Shiny Object Trap"

One significant pitfall is the "shiny object trap," where companies pursue [[AIs impact on software development | AI]] without a clear purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.
Before implementing [[AIs impact on software development | AI]], product leaders should ensure there's a specific problem or pain point that needs to be solved in a smart way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Only after identifying the problem and a high-level solution should the implementation of [[AIs impact on software development | AI]] be considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.
The focus should be on solving the right problem, rather than just building the right product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>.

## When Not to Use AI

[[Impact of AI on software development | AI]] is not a universal solution and can be a low ROI investment if misused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>.

### Don't Use AI For:
*   **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**: It makes "zero sense" to use [[AIs impact on software development | AI]] for an MVP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>. Training models takes significant time and resources from data scientists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. Instead, for an MVP, "fake it" with a Figma prototype to gauge user interest in a potential [[AIs impact on product development and skills | AI-enhanced feature]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>.
*   **Proving a Market**: Do not use [[AIs impact on software development | AI]] to prove that a market exists for your idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>.

### When to Consider AI:
*   Use [[AIs impact on software development | AI]] when you already have relevant data, or data from an adjacent product that can be leveraged to create something meaningful, such as recommendations or automation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>.

## Data Requirements and Challenges

The amount of data needed for an [[AIdriven software development | AI]] or ML model to contribute effectively varies greatly depending on the task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>.
*   Simple classification tasks, like distinguishing between a cat or a dog photo, might work with 15-20 labeled examples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>.
*   More complex applications, such as voice recognition or complicated Natural Language Processing (NLP), require thousands of data points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>.

[[AIdriven software development | AI]] systems are not easy to develop, and a significant challenge in the machine learning project lifecycle is determining how much data is needed and where to find it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>. Some projects even resort to synthesizing their own fake data to have something to train and test models with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>.

It's likely that most startups will not have enough data to build and train their own models effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>.

## Building vs. Using Existing Models

### When to Build Your Own Model:
*   Large tech companies offering services like speech recognition or their own GPT-like capabilities should aim to use more diverse data to train and re-train their models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>. This is because if everyone uses the exact same data sets from agencies selling data packages, the quality of all companies' outputs will be the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>. Diversifying and collecting proprietary data is crucial for unique product quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>.
*   A key decision for an [[AIs impact on product development and skills | AI PM]] is determining when the product's quality is "good enough" to launch (e.g., 70% or 80% accuracy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>.

### When to Use Existing Models:
*   For smaller entities or MVPs, leveraging pre-trained models like GPT or Midjourney can be more efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>.

## Core Challenges in AI Product Management

[[Challenges and strategies for senior leaders | AI product management]] involves navigating several distinct hurdles:

1.  **Uncertainty**: Research-driven [[AIdriven software development | AI projects]] often involve significant uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:38">[00:29:38]</a>. Hypotheses may not yield optimal results after model training, requiring the product manager to encourage and guide the team through unpredictable outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:43">[00:29:43]</a>.
2.  **Changing User Adoption**: Product managers must proactively manage and adapt to changes in user adoption, which can be challenging from a leadership perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:11">[00:30:11]</a>.
3.  **Data Acquisition**: Obtaining good data is difficult, often requiring creative approaches to data collection, even if it means directly engaging users to contribute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:23">[00:30:23]</a>.
4.  **Career Trajectory**: Traditional product management career progression often hinges on product launches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:45">[00:30:45]</a>. In research-heavy [[AIdriven software development | AI]] roles, launches may be less frequent, so it's essential to clarify assessment criteria and career progression expectations with hiring managers upfront <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:50">[00:30:50]</a>. This role encourages developing a "zero-to-one muscle" for building new things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:09">[00:31:09]</a>.

## Strategies for Gaining Buy-in and Investment

Securing investment for [[AIdriven software development | AI]] and ML initiatives can be difficult due to their uncertain and long-term nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:55">[00:31:55]</a>.

*   **Leverage Adjacent Product Successes**: Use examples of successful [[AIdriven software development | AI-first products]] within the company or similar companies as inspiration and a way to de-risk new proposals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:10">[00:32:10]</a>.
*   **Propose Controlled Tests**: For big bets, propose small, controlled tests (e.g., a "mini-cl") with clear rollback plans and an understanding of the maximum negative impact, to mitigate perceived risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:39">[00:32:39]</a>.
*   **Build Trust and Embrace Failure**: Trust with leadership grows over time within a company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:56">[00:32:56]</a>. In cultures that welcome failure, it's easier to propose and execute risky [[AIdriven software development | AI]] initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>.
*   **Bridge Academia and Production**: Companies should invest in staffing roles that bridge academic research and productization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:04">[00:34:04]</a>. Product managers are essential to take research ideas and figure out how to monetize them and turn them into meaningful user cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:20">[00:34:20]</a>.

While many ML investments may not succeed, the increased availability of pre-built tools and public models can potentially reduce the time and effort required to develop useful [[AIdriven software development | AI]] features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:11">[00:33:11]</a>.

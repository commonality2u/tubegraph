Bengali Sabbah, known for his roles as an early [[growth_teams_and_misconceptions | growth PM]] at [[growth_strategies_and_frameworks_used_at_facebook | Facebook]], Head of [[building_and_scaling_a_growth_team | Growth]] at Instagram, VP of Product at Instacart, and Director of Product Management at YouTube, has developed and applied several frameworks for both career and product growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. His approach emphasizes understanding and strategic alignment to drive significant impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Impact as the Core Metric

Sabbah's central philosophy revolves around **impact** as the most important output to optimize for in a career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. Compensation and leveling are seen as reflections or derivatives of the impact one drives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

### Defining Impact for Product Managers

For product managers, impact means:
*   Driving extreme clarity about product problems and opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.
*   Establishing the right focus and prioritization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.
*   Creating clarity that an investment area is strategically and structurally important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.
*   Delivering on that impact by making quick progress and consistently showing results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.

## Framework: How to Choose Where to Work and What to Work On

This framework, born from a personal struggle at [[growth_strategies_and_frameworks_used_at_facebook | Facebook]], posits that the impact an individual can have is a product of their **environment** and their **skills** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>, or *Impact = Environment x Skills* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.

### Environment Variables
Six key variables define the environment:
1.  **Manager**: The most crucial variable, as a great manager can address issues in other areas like scope or team composition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>.
2.  **Resources**: Adequacy of team staffing, budget, etc. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.
3.  **Scope**: The breadth and depth of one's responsibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.
4.  **Team**: The skills and effectiveness of the team members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.
5.  **Compensation**: Feeling fairly compensated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.
6.  **Company Culture**: Feeling supported, included, and able to do one's best work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.

Sabbah recommends scoring these variables annually to identify areas hindering impact and assess the likelihood of change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. For instance, at [[growth_strategies_and_frameworks_used_at_facebook | Facebook]], an overloaded scope and manager changes led to a realization of needing a better fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>. When managers are not ideal, understanding their optimization goals can help align personal objectives with broader team priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>.

### Skills for Impact
Key skills for product and career growth include:
*   **Communication**: Arguably the most impactful skill, enabling effective storytelling and clarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:59">[00:18:59]</a>.
*   **Influence**: Ability to persuade and align others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>.
*   **Leadership**: Guiding and motivating teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>.
*   **Strategic Thinking**: Ability to see the big picture and set direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>.
*   **Execution**: Consistently getting things done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a>.

To develop these skills, Sabbah suggests being a voracious reader, consuming content from thought leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:55">[00:19:55]</a>. He also advocates for a "stable of mentors" (three to four people) to ensure consistent guidance, meeting with each monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:18">[00:20:18]</a>. Finding mentors is most effective when approaching them with a specific challenge or learning objective, rather than a general request <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>.

Observational learning is also crucial; watching how other successful individuals "hone their craft" and lead teams provides practical insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:23">[00:21:23]</a>. For example, at Instagram, Sabbah learned from a colleague named George Le, who excelled at active listening, recasting discussions, and crystallizing action items with team buy-in and trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:32">[00:22:32]</a>.

## Understand-Identify-Execute: The Power of "Understand Work"

Sabbah heavily advocates for **understand work**, a concept from [[growth_strategies_and_frameworks_used_at_facebook | Facebook]] that he has championed at Instagram, Instacart, [[advising_and_growth_hacking_for_startups | Twitter]], and YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:06">[00:26:06]</a>. This contrasts with the "identify-justify-execute" anti-pattern, where teams build based on assumptions without deep understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:17">[00:27:17]</a>.

> "First you have to really understand from first principles what is actually going on."<cite><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:42">[00:27:42]</a></cite>

Understand work is an *intentional affordance* in the execution process, meaning dedicated time is planned for activities that de-risk a project and facilitate learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:55">[00:27:55]</a>. It's not an assumption that this work will happen in the background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:18">[00:28:18]</a>.

### Operationalizing Understand Work
*   **Allocate Time**: Teams should explicitly allocate time for understand work within sprints or roadmaps, ensuring cross-functional partners (engineering, data science, design, marketing) are involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:21">[00:37:21]</a>.
*   **Balance**: While initial phases might have a higher percentage of understand work (e.g., 40% or more), as understanding grows, the mix shifts towards more execution (e.g., 80-85% execution) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:53">[00:31:53]</a>.
*   **Parallel Paths**: Understand work runs in parallel with execution, meaning teams are simultaneously shipping high-conviction items and gathering insights for future iterations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:56">[00:29:56]</a>. This creates a "velocity multiplier" over time, leading to higher win rates on shipped products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:32">[00:30:32]</a>.
*   **Examples**:
    *   For engineers: Code refactoring analysis, data instrumentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:27">[00:36:27]</a>.
    *   For data scientists: Activation metrics, proxy metrics analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:51">[00:36:51]</a>.
    *   For product managers: Partnership strategy, dogfooding the product in new user states, mapping funnels to identify gaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:04">[00:37:04]</a>.

A notable example from Instagram: When Sabbah joined in 2016, the signup flow lacked granular logging beyond start/end points. The initial understand work involved instrumenting the entire eight-step funnel to pinpoint drop-off points, allowing for targeted fixes and experiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>.

## Managing Complex Change Framework

This framework, derived from business school, consists of five critical components necessary for change to occur:
*   **Vision**: Clarity on the desired future state.
*   **Skills**: The capabilities needed to achieve the vision.
*   **Incentives**: Motivation and alignment for individuals and teams.
*   **Resources**: Adequate tools, people, and budget.
*   **Action Plan**: Clear steps for execution.

If any component is missing, it leads to a specific negative outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:37">[00:42:37]</a>:
*   Missing Vision -> Confusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:43">[00:42:43]</a>
*   Missing Skills -> Anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:51">[00:44:51]</a>
*   Missing Incentives -> Resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:50">[00:42:50]</a>
*   Missing Resources -> Frustration
*   Missing Action Plan -> False Starts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:54">[00:42:54]</a>

Leaders can use this framework to diagnose challenges within teams and focus their efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:08">[00:43:08]</a>. Sabbah often brings a "deck of different skills and frameworks" to help uplevel teams quickly and establish a shared language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:49">[00:43:49]</a>.

## Bloom's Taxonomy for Coaching Teams

Drawing from his background in education, Sabbah applies Bloom's Taxonomy to assess and develop team members' critical thinking and skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:02">[00:48:02]</a>. The pyramid-like structure outlines levels of understanding:
1.  **Knowledge**: Core understanding of facts.
2.  **Comprehension**: Ability to explain concepts.
3.  **Application**: Using knowledge in different scenarios.
4.  **Analysis**: Breaking down information.
5.  **Synthesis**: Combining information to create new ideas.
6.  **Evaluation**: Judging the value of information.

By identifying where individuals or teams struggle (e.g., they have knowledge but can't apply it across scenarios, or they apply it but can't synthesize its business impact), leaders can provide targeted support to fill gaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:33">[00:48:33]</a>.

## Product as a Team Sport and Coaching Trees

Sabbah views product management as a team sport, emphasizing the role of a product leader as a coach who helps team members maximize their potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:01">[00:52:01]</a>. Not everyone needs to be a "star player"; strong "role players" are equally valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:23">[00:52:23]</a>.

Inspired by college basketball "coaching trees," Sabbah believes product leaders should take pride in the success of those they've mentored and helped grow, reinforcing a mentality of coaching people up to greatness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:54">[00:52:54]</a>.

## Flywheels and the Adjacent User Theory for Growth

Sabbah's approach to [[lessons_on_company_growth_and_innovation | company growth]] centers on understanding **flywheels** within a product or marketplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:41">[00:55:41]</a>. This involves dissecting the value proposition at every point of the user experience, especially in multi-sided marketplaces (e.g., YouTube's creators and viewers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:48">[00:55:48]</a>.

A key concept is the **Adjacent User Theory**, which focuses on understanding the users *just outside* the current power user base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:23">[00:56:23]</a>. While power users have a deep understanding of a product, newer users (or those who *could* be using it but aren't) often have different needs and experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:42">[00:56:42]</a>.

> "You have to be the adjacent user, you have to use the product like them and see how it's working, what's broken with it."<cite><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:04">[01:06:04]</a></cite>

### Applying Adjacent User Theory
*   **Dogfooding**: Product teams should actively use their product from the perspective of a new or less tech-savvy user to uncover friction points (e.g., creating a fresh Gmail account to experience YouTube as a new user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:54">[00:56:54]</a>).
*   **Job-to-be-Done**: Understand the real "job to be done" for users. At Instacart, it wasn't just buying groceries, but putting together specific meals (e.g., taco Tuesday) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>.
*   **Identify Missed Opportunities**: Instacart, for example, made it difficult to reorder past purchases, despite 90% of repeat orders being similar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:59">[01:00:59]</a>. Simplifying reordering became a significant growth driver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>.
*   **User Research**: Observing and speaking directly with adjacent users helps reveal their needs and pain points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:47">[01:06:47]</a>.

This theory is mandatory for hypergrowth companies, where the user base rapidly changes, but also highly valuable for companies seeking to expand their audience or capture more market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:11">[01:07:11]</a>.

### Compounding Growth Loops
Beyond understanding the value prop, growth often stems from building **compounding growth loops** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:05">[01:10:05]</a>. This means having multiple ways to acquire users that layer onto and magnify each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:09">[01:10:09]</a>.

At Instagram, growth was not solely from direct invitations or word-of-mouth. Key compounding loops included <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:23">[01:10:23]</a>:
*   **Celebrity Partnerships**: A dedicated team taught celebrities how to use Instagram to build their brand, which set cultural norms for the platform and generated media buzz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:52">[01:10:52]</a>.
*   **SEO**: News articles linking to celebrity Instagram accounts and the launch of Instagram Web provided canonical SEO tables and inbound links, greatly boosting search visibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:33">[01:11:33]</a>. Instagram Web alone increased growth by 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:46">[01:13:46]</a>.
*   **Paid Media**: Utilized signals from other channels to drive paid acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:21">[01:12:21]</a>.

### The "Connections Pivot" at Instagram

A crucial insight at Instagram was the "connections pivot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:21">[01:18:21]</a>. Initially, the algorithm treated all follows equally (e.g., following Kim Kardashian vs. a friend). Data revealed that users were dropping off after 7-9 months because, while they followed celebrities, their *friends* weren't following them, leading to a "posting in a soundless echo chamber" experience when they made their first post <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:35">[01:17:35]</a>.

The pivot involved prioritizing regular human connections for new users. This meant shifting recommendations to focus on friends over celebrities, ensuring that when new users made their first post, their friends would see it, validating their experience and encouraging retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:47">[01:18:47]</a>. This change literally doubled Instagram's retention over a year and a half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:36">[01:19:36]</a>.

### Solving Account Access Issues at Instagram

Another significant growth win involved addressing account churn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:54">[01:20:54]</a>. Millions of users, particularly in South and Southeast Asia, were logging out (often to save data or share phones) and unable to log back in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:03">[01:21:03]</a>.

Solutions included:
*   **Omni-box Login**: A unified input field for email, phone, or handle, simplifying the login process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:01">[01:22:01]</a>.
*   **Trusted Device SMS**: If a user failed to log in twice on a trusted device, an SMS link was sent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:11">[01:22:11]</a>.
*   **Save Credentials Prompt**: When logging out, users were prompted to save their credentials or set up a passcode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:26">[01:22:26]</a>.

These changes led to 15-20 million additional monthly active users per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:03">[01:23:03]</a>. Unexpectedly, solving account access also increased content creation, as users could more easily access and create content from multiple accounts (e.g., personal, business, niche) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:22">[01:23:22]</a>. This insight led to the creation of a dedicated "multiple accounts team" to streamline navigation between accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:11">[01:24:11]</a>.

### Discovering Problems at [[growth_strategies_and_frameworks_used_at_facebook | Facebook]] India

At [[growth_strategies_and_frameworks_used_at_facebook | Facebook]] in 2014, the "people recommendations" feature was broken in India, with fewer common friends per connection compared to the US, and frequent friending/unfriending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:11">[01:26:11]</a>. Extensive [[growth_strategies_and_frameworks_used_at_facebook | understand work]], including on-the-ground visits to users' homes in India, revealed critical cultural context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:48">[01:26:48]</a>:
*   **Irrelevant Profile Information**: [[growth_strategies_and_frameworks_used_at_facebook | Facebook]]'s profile fields (school, job title, affiliations) were Western-centric and not relevant to many Indian users, who often lacked formal education or had occupations not easily categorized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:57">[01:27:57]</a>.
*   **Common Names**: Many Indian names were extremely common (e.g., "Amit Kumar" had 250,000 users monthly), making it impossible to identify friends based on name and Western profile details alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:43">[01:28:43]</a>. Users resorted to looking at photos to recognize friends' cars or animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:25">[01:28:25]</a>.

This highlighted the need for culturally sensitive product design and data collection.

## Lessons on Company Fit

Sabbah reflects on his time at Instacart as a period where he felt his vision for product evolution (building systems, people, processes) didn't align with the company's immediate need for tactical, "in the weeds" execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:38">[01:29:38]</a>. This mismatch in expectations led to a less impactful experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:06">[01:31:06]</a>.

The lesson learned is to conduct thorough "understand work" before joining a company, not only by speaking with current employees but also with those who have left. Former employees often provide a more "raw and different" perspective that can help triangulate the true culture and needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:21">[01:31:21]</a>.

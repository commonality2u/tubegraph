From: [[lennyspodcast]] <br/> 

Katie Dill, Head of Design at [[operational_principles_at_Stripe | Stripe]], has built and led design teams at three hyper-growth companies: Lyft, [[airbnbs_unique_company_culture_and_growth | Airbnb]], and [[scaling_strategies_for_startups_and_lessons_from_Stripes_growth | Stripe]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:09">[01:11:09]</a>. Her roles have encompassed product design, brand and marketing creative, web presence, user research, content strategy, and design operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:20">[00:58:20]</a>. These companies are recognized for having some of the world's best design products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>.

## Early Days at Airbnb: The Intervention

Upon joining [[airbnbs_unique_company_culture_and_growth | Airbnb]] as Head of Experience Design (product design team), Katie found an organization of 10 people who had been reporting directly to one of the founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:04">[05:32:04]</a>. Her interview process revealed room for improvement in how engineering, product management, and design collaborated, alongside low engagement scores within the design team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:33">[05:50:33]</a>.

About a month into her tenure, half of the design team, along with an HR partner, staged an intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>. They presented a list of everything they perceived she was doing wrong and disliked about her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:13:00">[07:13:00]</a>. This difficult moment became the biggest learning experience of her leadership career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:00">[07:22:00]</a>.

The core issue was a lack of trust; she hadn't brought the team along with her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>. She realized that while inflicting change *on* people is possible, achieving change *with* them requires trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:00">[09:09:00]</a>. In response, she immediately shifted her approach to prioritizing listening, understanding individuals' motivations and goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:46:00">[08:46:00]</a>. This led to [[airbnbs_unique_company_culture_and_growth | Airbnb]]'s design team achieving the best engagement scores in the company within a couple of months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:00">[09:16:00]</a>. Katie now emphasizes "coming in listening" instead of "coming in swinging" when joining new companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:00">[09:30:00]</a>.

## The Value of Design and Quality

A common challenge in business is prioritizing design and high quality when ROI seems unclear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:00:00">[11:00:00]</a>. Katie outlines levels of quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:55:00">[11:55:00]</a>:
1.  **Baseline**: The product works and provides value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:59:00">[11:59:00]</a>.
2.  **Well-Rounded**: Error-free and functions well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:12:00">[12:12:00]</a>.
3.  **Exceeds Expectations**: Surprises users and offers more than sought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:20:00">[12:20:00]</a>.

The "seduced by the chase of another feature" often overrides the desire to make existing features great <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:47:00">[12:47:00]</a>. Companies that view quality as non-negotiable understand that high quality in features leads to great usability and desirability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:30:00">[13:30:00]</a>. Quality, she argues, *is* growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:43:00">[15:43:00]</a>. Making a product easier to use and more understandable drives adoption and positive word-of-mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:52:00">[15:52:00]</a>.

At [[operational_principles_at_Stripe | Stripe]], the growth team is "maniacally focused" on building better experiences because it directly ties to business metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:09:00">[16:09:00]</a>. For example, improvements to the onboarding flow increased activations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:22:00">[16:22:00]</a>.

### Impact of Quality on Business Metrics: Checkout Experience

A significant example of business impact through quality is [[operational_principles_at_Stripe | Stripe]]'s checkout experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:39:00">[16:39:00]</a>. Research showed that 99% of top e-commerce sites have errors in their checkout flows that hinder seamless, quicker transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:51:00">[16:51:00]</a>. By maniacally focusing on improving the quality of the checkout experience, [[operational_principles_at_Stripe | Stripe]] saw a 10.5% increase in business revenue when moving from older to newer checkout forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:22:00">[17:22:29]</a>.

[[operational_principles_at_Stripe | Stripe]] powers payments for millions of businesses globally, including Amazon, Hertz, Shopify, Spotify, and X (formerly Twitter) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:00:00">[18:00:00]</a>.

## Defining Great Design and Beauty

Katie challenges the idea of "business goals" versus "design goals," asserting that impactful products are quality products that serve customers positively, leading to a stronger business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:15:00">[19:15:00]</a>. While designers may focus more on emotional experience, cross-disciplinary teams act as checks and balances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:00:00">[20:00:00]</a>.

Beauty is not opposite to functionality; it enhances it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:45:00">[22:45:00]</a>. Beautiful things are:
*   **Easier to use**: More approachable and compelling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:54:00">[22:54:00]</a>.
*   **Increase trust**: Painstaking detail shows care for how something works, assuring care for unseen details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:23:00">[24:23:00]</a>.
*   **Improve user outcomes**: Helps businesses make better decisions and be more successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:40:00">[24:40:00]</a>.
*   **Begets beauty**: The care and creativity inspire others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:01:00">[25:01:00]</a>.
*   **A matter of pride**: Attracts talent who want their craft recognized and utilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:47:00">[25:47:00]</a>.

Katie cites the book *Beauty* by Stefan Sagmeister and Jessica Walsh, which notes a dramatic decrease in the word "beauty" in digitized books from the 1800s to 2000s, aligning with the "functionality is King" mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:12:00">[22:12:00]</a>. She also references the contrast between Penn Station (negative tweets) and Grand Central (positive tweets) as an example of how environments affect feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:34:00">[23:34:00]</a>.

## Operationalizing Quality and Beauty

At [[operational_principles_at_Stripe | Stripe]], there's a strong focus on melding "Art and Science" in website design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:37:00">[27:37:00]</a>. This involves close collaboration between design, engineering, product, and product marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:53:00">[27:53:00]</a>. Notably, for the website, engineering and design often report into the design organization, promoting rapid iteration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:10:00">[28:10:00]</a>.

Katie identifies key themes for building quality:
*   **Group Effort**: Quality is not the responsibility of a single person or team (e.g., QA); it requires organizational effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:29:00">[29:29:00]</a>. Internal clarity and standards reflect externally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:56:00">[29:56:00]</a>.
*   **Vision and Alignment**: Even with talented people, a shared vision (like architectural plans for a house) ensures individual contributions fit into a cohesive whole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:22:00">[30:22:00]</a>.
*   **Editing and Courage**: There must be an "editor" (like [[brian_cheskys_leadership_style_and_organizational_changes_at_airbnb | Brian Chesky]] at [[airbnbs_unique_company_culture_and_growth | Airbnb]]) to refine and remove misfitting elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:21:00">[31:21:00]</a>. Leaders need the courage to say "no, this isn't good enough" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:55:00">[31:55:00]</a>.
*   **User Perspective**: Quality requires understanding the user's journey, as they rarely experience parts of a product in isolation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:37:00">[32:37:00]</a>.

### "Walk the Store" Process

To combat quality regression over time, [[operational_principles_at_Stripe | Stripe]] implemented a "Walk the Store" program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:44:00">[33:44:00]</a>.
*   **Journey Ownership**: 15 critical user journeys are identified, with dedicated engineering, product, and design leaders responsible for their quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:56:00">[34:56:00]</a>.
*   **Regular Review**: These leaders review the journeys regularly (quarterly for formal scorecards, ideally weekly ad-hoc) from a user's perspective, starting from an internet search to product usage (e.g., Google search > website > docs > dashboard) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:32:00">[35:32:00]</a>.
*   **Friction Logging**: They "friction log" their experiences, noting what works and what doesn't, filing bugs, and collaborating with owning teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:39:00">[35:39:00]</a>.
*   **Scoring and Calibration**: Journeys are scored based on a rubric for usability, utility, desirability, and "surprisingly great" moments, using a color system rather than numbers to avoid getting "tied around the axle" on subjective measurement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:40:00">[45:40:00]</a>. These scores are calibrated in "Product Quality Review" (PQR) meetings with senior leaders (e.g., Katie, David Singleton, Will Gabr) to ensure consistent quality standards across the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:10:00">[43:10:00]</a>.

This process increases leader awareness and accountability for user journeys, provides upstream impact by revealing broader opportunities, and converts people from various functions to become advocates for quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:40:00">[37:40:00]</a>. It leverages personal judgment as a valid form of input, alongside user research and data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:20:00">[39:20:00]</a>.

At [[operational_principles_at_Stripe | Stripe]], quality improvements are often directly tied to metrics. For instance, clarifying a button's purpose reduced support calls, improving the bottom line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:04:00">[49:04:00]</a>. Prioritizing quality is baked into performance evaluation by defining "impact" broadly, beyond just moving business metrics in a single quarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:55:00">[50:55:00]</a>. [[operational_principles_at_Stripe | Stripe]]'s operating principles include "meticulous craft," which is expected from everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:34:00">[52:34:00]</a>.

## Team Building and Leadership Lessons

Katie uses a formula to think about leading and growing teams:
**Performance = Potential - Interference** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:05:00">[55:05:00]</a>

*   **Increasing Potential**: Focus on hiring well and developing talent to help them grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:37:00">[55:37:00]</a>.
*   **Decreasing Interference**: Remove obstacles that hinder great work. At Lyft, the design team was physically separated by a locked door from engineering and product, leading to wasted work and misalignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:04">[01:02:04]</a>. Learning from her [[airbnbs_unique_company_culture_and_growth | Airbnb]] experience, Katie evolved the team's working style at Lyft, physically bringing design, engineering, and product together for daily work while retaining dedicated creative spaces for critical sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:07">[01:04:07]</a>. This led to faster iteration cycles and better clarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:04">[01:06:04]</a>.

Katie also emphasizes improving awareness across the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:12:00">[57:12:00]</a>. At [[airbnbs_unique_company_culture_and_growth | Airbnb]] and [[operational_principles_at_Stripe | Stripe]], designers share screenshots or prototypes of their work in a shared Google Slide deck monthly (formerly bi-weekly) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:42:00">[57:42:00]</a>. This allows designers to see what's happening across the team, identify similar projects, and share patterns, and helps leaders understand overall progress and how pieces fit together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:00:00">[58:00:00]</a>. The low-maintenance format (Google Slides) ensures accessibility for all functions, not just designers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:30">[01:00:30]</a>.

## Fighting the Fear of Bold Ideas

Companies often fall into incrementalism due to fear of bold ideas, as big changes are hard to measure and feel less safe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:01">[01:08:01]</a>. Katie advises to "reach for the stars and land on the moon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:02">[01:09:02]</a>. This means engaging in vision work that looks at the entire user journey, sketching out the ideal, "11-star experience" (a concept also discussed by [[brian_cheskys_leadership_style_and_organizational_changes_at_airbnb | Brian Chesky]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:30">[01:09:30]</a>. Knowing the ideal future state allows teams to work backward, even if shipping incrementally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:02">[01:10:02]</a>.

## Hiring Designers

When hiring designers, Katie suggests focusing on:
*   **Taste and Character**: These are harder to teach than tools and process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:31">[01:11:31]</a>. Look for innate inclination for great things and strong judgment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:41">[01:11:41]</a>.
*   **Humility**: Essential for teamwork, respecting others, empathy, and being open to user feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:05">[01:12:05]</a>.
*   **Hustle or Hutzpah**: The courage to create, propose new ideas, say "this isn't good enough," and rapidly execute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:42">[01:12:42]</a>.

For younger companies, it's often better to hire a "doer" (executor) in early stages, potentially alongside a senior design advisor to bring strategic, user-focused organizational thinking from the start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:43">[01:13:43]</a>.

## Favorite Project: Stripe Press

A notable project at [[operational_principles_at_Stripe | Stripe]] is [[operational_principles_at_Stripe | Stripe]] Press, which prints books considered "ideas of progress" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:26">[01:15:26]</a>. These books don't always relate to financial infrastructure but align with [[operational_principles_at_Stripe | Stripe]]'s mission to increase the GDP of the internet by fostering innovation beyond financial tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:19">[01:18:19]</a>. A recent example is the reprinting of *Poor Charlie's Almanac*, accompanied by an engaging teaser site (press.stripe.com) that showcases the company's commitment to "Art and Science" and meticulous craft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:02">[01:16:02]</a>.

## Design as Intentionality

At its core, design is intentionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:35">[01:19:35]</a>. It's about bringing care and thoughtful decisions to every aspect of work, from designing a doorknob to structuring an organization or crafting a strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:42">[01:19:42]</a>. While design expertise brings creative skills and great taste, anyone can bring intentionality and care to their work, leading to better outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:10">[01:20:10]</a>.

## Personal Lessons

### Parental Influence
Katie's parents instilled in her the belief that accomplishment is based on merit and hard work, regardless of physical attributes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:47">[01:28:47]</a>. This upbringing, which included childhood tasks like chopping wood and mixing cement, fostered a willingness to pursue leadership and feel comfortable in diverse environments, even when outnumbered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:06">[01:29:06]</a>.

### Learning to Fly: The Trust Analogy
Learning to fly has been a transformative experience for Katie. She recalls a pivotal moment when her instructor, during a landing lesson, physically moved his seat back, demonstrating his trust in her ability to take on the challenge alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:22">[01:31:22]</a>. This experience taught her the importance of showing trust in her team, even if she can't literally "move her seat back," as a way to empower them to embrace challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:15">[01:32:15]</a>.

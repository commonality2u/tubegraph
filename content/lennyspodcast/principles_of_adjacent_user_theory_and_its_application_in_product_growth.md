Adjacent user theory is a framework that helps drive growth by focusing on understanding users who are "just outside" the current user base [02:06:56]. This approach is particularly effective for [[frameworks_for_growth_in_product_management | hypergrowth companies]] and can also be beneficial for products not meeting desired growth targets [02:07:07].

## Core Principles of Adjacent User Theory

The theory emphasizes that sustained product growth often comes from these nearby user segments rather than solely catering to existing power users [02:06:56]. Key principles include:

1.  **Identify the Next User** [02:05:59]: It's crucial to understand who is using the product today and why, but equally important to identify who the next potential user is. This involves understanding their persona, motivations, and reasons for not yet adopting the product [02:04:25].
2.  **"Dogfooding" in the Adjacent State** [01:56:23]: Product teams should intentionally use the product as if they were these adjacent users [01:56:23]. This means experiencing the product without the "informed knowledge" or history of a long-term user [01:56:47]. Often, the experience for a new or adjacent user can be significantly worse than for a power user [01:56:51].
3.  **Proactive Understanding** [02:08:20]: This theory champions [[importance_of_user_feedback_in_product_development | understand work]]—a planned, intentional time for teams to delve into what is happening and what needs to be learned [02:08:20], rather than just executing on ideas [01:48:49]. This includes:
    *   **Data Analysis**: Pulling funnels and looking at different types of connections for various user segments [02:54:55].
    *   **Instrumentation**: Ensuring logging is in place to gather necessary data to tell the story [02:09:01].
    *   **User Research**: Observing how potential users interact with the product in real-time, talking to them, and visiting them to understand their needs and what is missing [02:06:47].
    *   **Testing**: Running cheap tests to learn quickly and inform future iterations [02:09:01].
    *   **Clarifying Root Causes**: Using understand work to identify the core problem, job-to-be-done, or use case [02:09:01].

## Application in Product Growth

Applying adjacent user theory helps drive growth by:

*   **D-risking Projects**: Intentional understand work helps to mitigate risks associated with new features or product changes by revealing key components, pain points, and alternatives early on [02:00:01].
*   **Improving Conviction**: By deeply understanding the problem space, teams gain higher conviction in what they are building, leading to more impactful execution [02:04:05].
*   **Increasing Velocity**: By planning parallel paths of work (execution and understand work), teams gain insights and clarity in each sprint, leading to a "velocity multiplier" over time [02:09:01]. This results in faster execution and a higher win rate for shipped products [02:04:05].
*   **Strategic Prioritization**: It enables teams to focus on areas where data is lacking or where user feedback is needed, ensuring that development efforts are aligned with actual user needs [02:04:05].
*   **Adapting to User Evolution**: For hypergrowth products, user demographics and needs change rapidly. Adjacent user theory ensures the product continues to serve newer cohorts by understanding their unique challenges, such as less tech-savvy users or those in new markets [02:04:05].
*   [[building_usercentric_products_in_diverse_markets | Building User-Centric Products in Diverse Markets]]: The theory ensures that product development considers the varying contexts, preferences, and technical environments of new user segments [02:04:05].

## Examples

### Instagram

Instagram experienced hypergrowth, leading to a constant change in its user base [02:03:36]. Early on, every "follow" was treated as equally important in the recommendation algorithm, whether it was a celebrity or a friend [02:16:30]. This led to a problem where new users would follow many celebrities but, months later, when they made their first post, none of their friends would see it, leading to a drop in retention [02:17:33].

By applying adjacent user theory and understanding this issue, Instagram prioritized "human-to-human" connections for new users. This "connections pivot" was critical, literally doubling retention over a year and a half [02:18:21]. This strategic shift, along with other growth engines like [[implementing_productled_growth | celebrity partnerships]], SEO, and web presence, significantly contributed to Instagram's massive scale [02:10:05].

### Instacart

At Instacart, initial insights revealed that reordering groceries was difficult for users [02:01:00]. While existing users might be power users who understood the system, the "adjacent user" needed a smoother experience. The product didn't reflect the real "job to be done"—like buying ingredients for "taco Tuesday" rather than just individual items [02:00:07]. By making it easier to reorder common items, even though users get the same groceries 90% of the time after five orders, Instacart significantly improved retention [02:01:00]. This demonstrated the power of understanding the daily habits and practical needs of different user segments [02:00:07].

Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is often an undervalued growth channel, with companies frequently under-resourcing SEO efforts while over-resourcing advertisements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. For large companies like Zillow or eBay, spending tens or hundreds of millions on ads while only allocating minimal funds to SEO, despite its potential to drive equal traffic, "doesn't make sense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

Ethan Smith, CEO of Graphite, a leading growth agency specializing in SEO, emphasizes that effective SEO is one of the most powerful and least understood growth levers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## When to Invest in SEO as a Company
[[when_and_how_to_invest_in_seo_as_a_company | Deciding when to focus on SEO]] as a growth channel involves two primary considerations:
1.  **Large Addressable Market**: For most categories, the addressable market for SEO is significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. To assess this, examine competitors (both product and audience competitors) using tools like SimilarWeb to gauge their total traffic and traffic by channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>. The heuristic is to compare potential SEO traffic with conversions to other channels to determine its relative value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>.
2.  **Existing Authority/Traction**: Google prefers to rank credible domains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>. Indicators of sufficient authority include:
    *   **Non-SEO Traffic**: At least 1,000 daily visits from direct, paid, email, or social channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. This signals that the site is not "just an SEO site" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>.
    *   **Referring Domains**: Approximately 1,000 referring domains (unique websites linking to yours), checked using tools like Ahrefs or Semrush <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. More referring domains and non-SEO traffic increase credibility and authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>.

While these benchmarks provide a guideline, a company with less than these numbers can still grow with SEO, but it will be "much harder" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.

### Product Attributes Favoring SEO
Certain product attributes can make SEO easier to implement due to reduced "scope" (effort):
*   **User-Generated Content (UGC)**: Companies with extensive UGC, like Glassdoor (for reviews) or Zillow (for addresses), have a built-in content base, lowering the effort to compete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>.
*   **SKUs/Products**: E-commerce sites with many SKUs or products similarly have a large pool of items for programmatic page generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>.

## Types of SEO Strategies
[[types_and_implementation_of_seo_programmatic_vs_editorial | There are three main types of SEO]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:45">[00:18:45]</a>:
1.  **Programmatic SEO**: Involves pages automatically generated from a database of information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>.
    *   **Examples**: Product pages on eBay, address pages on Zillow, UGC pages on Glassdoor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a>.
    *   **Page Types**: Typically "category pages" (grids/lists of items) and "item pages" (single product/address/video pages) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>.
    *   **Benefit**: Doesn't require spending money for each individual page created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>.
    *   **Expertise**: Requires specialized knowledge due to nuances in indexation logic, clustering keywords, and dealing with UGC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:05">[00:46:05]</a>.
2.  **Editorial SEO**: Refers to content (articles, guides, listicles) manually written by a person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>.
    *   **Examples**: MasterClass articles about classes, BetterUp content on career development, NerdWallet guides on financial information, HubSpot's productivity content, and Dotdash publishers like Investopedia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:28">[00:21:28]</a>.
    *   **Trend**: Has increasingly overtaken programmatic SEO in driving traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>.
    *   **Benefit**: Always an opportunity if an addressable market exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>.
    *   **Expertise**: Easier to find people capable of executing than programmatic SEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:56">[00:45:56]</a>.
3.  **Technical SEO**: Focuses on the underlying infrastructure, including internal link architecture, tags, redirects, and page speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>. While essential for hygiene, it is "not how you grow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

## How to SEO: A Workflow
An effective SEO strategy follows a systematic workflow:
1.  **Define the Addressable Market**: Identify the relevant topics and keywords to acquire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:49">[00:23:49]</a>.
2.  **Determine Page Type**: Based on keyword research, observe patterns in Google's search results to determine the optimal page type (e.g., article, address page, category page) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>.
3.  **Define Product Requirements**: Identify necessary components for the page type (e.g., map, phone number for an address page, recipe for an article) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:16">[00:24:16]</a>.
4.  **Develop Content Strategy**: Outline specific subtopics and themes to ensure comprehensiveness, fulfilling the intent of all relevant keywords within a topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a>.
5.  **Build Infrastructure**: Implement technical aspects like internal linking to help Google efficiently find and crawl pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:30">[00:24:30]</a>.

## Key Concepts for SEO Success
[[elements_of_a_successful_strategy | Success in SEO]] hinges on understanding several core concepts:

### Topics vs. Keywords
*   **Shift in Google's Algorithm**: Google's algorithm has evolved from keyword-based ranking to understanding "topics" semantically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>. A single page can now rank for hundreds to thousands of related keywords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:50">[00:32:50]</a>.
*   **Benefits of Topic Focus**:
    *   **Accurate Search Volume**: The search volume for a topic can be 10x or more than a single keyword, enabling better prioritization decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:14">[00:33:14]</a>.
    *   **Cost Efficiency**: Avoids wasting resources by writing multiple articles for semantically similar keywords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:47">[00:33:47]</a>.
    *   **Fulfilling User Intent**: Ensures the content addresses the full spectrum of user queries related to a topic, leading to better rankings and engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:06">[00:34:06]</a>.
*   **Identifying Topics**: Group keywords where Google's search results show significant overlap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:01">[00:36:01]</a>. The most common keyword within a cluster usually serves as the topic label <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:17">[01:14:17]</a>.

### User Intent and Engagement
Google's ultimate goal is to provide useful content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:58">[00:27:58]</a>. SEO success is directly tied to user engagement signals:
*   **Click-Through Rate (CTR)**: The rate at which users click on your result versus competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:43">[00:28:43]</a>.
*   **Return-to-SERP Behavior**: If users click your page and then immediately return to Google's search results to click another link, it's a negative signal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:50">[00:28:50]</a>.
*   **Time on Page**: Google tracks if users stay on your page for a long time and find their answer, indicating high satisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a>. Higher engagement leads to higher rankings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:20">[00:28:20]</a>.

### Topical Authority
*   **Evolution of Authority**: Beyond traditional PageRank (links), Google now considers multiple inputs to determine a domain's authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:49">[01:09:49]</a>.
*   **Key Inputs**:
    *   **External Links**: Number of referring domains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:54">[01:09:54]</a>.
    *   **Non-SEO Traffic**: Volume of traffic from other channels (direct, paid, social) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:01">[01:10:01]</a>.
    *   **Social Shares**: Activity and content of what is shared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:12">[01:10:12]</a>.
    *   **Branded Search**: How often users search for your brand name on Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:14">[01:10:14]</a>.
*   **Niche Expertise**: Google disproportionately rewards sites known for specific, narrow expertise (e.g., MasterClass for Gordon Ramsay content, rather than just general food) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:50">[01:10:50]</a>. This allows newer companies to outrank larger competitors in specific niches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:55">[01:12:55]</a>.

### Internal Link Architecture
*   **Crucial Lever**: Internal linking is often an underappreciated and under-optimized lever for SEO growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:44">[01:16:44]</a>.
*   **How it Works**: Google crawls sites through links <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:30">[01:18:30]</a>. More internal links provide more paths for Google to find and regularly crawl pages, giving them more credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:41">[01:18:41]</a>. Aim for at least 10 internal links to a page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:51">[01:18:51]</a>.
*   **Common Problems**: Many sites exhibit a "power curve" in internal linking, where a small percentage of pages receive most of the links (e.g., 5% of pages get 95% of links) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:17">[01:20:17]</a>. This leaves many pages with zero or very few links, hindering their discoverability and ranking potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:26">[01:20:26]</a>.
*   **Ideal Structure**: A "very flat graph" where pages are few clicks away from "crawl points" (like the homepage or popular pages) is ideal, as opposed to a deep hierarchical structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:24">[01:21:24]</a>.
*   **Impact**: Fixing internal link spread can lead to significant opportunities, often a 25% or even 100% increase in traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:07">[01:22:07]</a>. Links should be placed in the body or at the bottom of content, not primarily in the footer, as Google differentiates navigational links <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:47">[01:22:47]</a>.

## Tools and Operations
[[tools_and_techniques_for_seo_analysis_and_growth | Effective SEO requires the right tools and operational setup]]:

### Recommended Tools
*   **Google Search Console**: Free, provides real traffic information, and free SERP (Search Engine Results Page) tracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:58">[00:37:58]</a>.
*   **Clearscope**: Best for content analysis and scoring, helping identify content gaps and ensure comprehensiveness of subtopics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:16">[00:38:16]</a>.
*   **Keyword Research Tools (Ahrefs/Semrush)**: Used to identify keywords, analyze competitor pages, and gather search volume data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:41">[00:38:41]</a>.
*   **Screaming Frog**: A crawling tool useful for auditing sites (finding error codes, redirect loops) and analyzing internal link coverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:31">[00:39:31]</a>.

### Operational Approach and Timelines
*   **Initial Ramp-up**: Typically, it takes 3 months to develop, build, and launch initial content (e.g., 20-30 articles) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:01">[00:41:01]</a>.
*   **Time to See Results**: Generally, results appear within 6 to 9 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:35">[00:40:35]</a>. This timeline varies based on existing authority: Netflix might see results in days, while a new company could take a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:44">[00:40:44]</a>.
*   **Leading Indicators**: Look for early signs of progress, such as pages ranking in positions 15-20, then gradually improving to higher positions (e.g., 5-8) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:41">[00:42:41]</a>. Once these indicators are present, it signals opportunity for scaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:24">[00:43:24]</a>.
*   **Scaling Content**: Once leading indicators are positive, scale content production. Initial targets might be 10-25 articles per month, but companies can scale to 100+ articles per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:01">[00:58:01]</a>.
*   **Testing**: A/B testing or sequential testing can be implemented around month six or later, once initial content has launched and shown some traction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:02">[00:52:02]</a>.

### Team Structure
[[understanding_seo_resource_allocation | Hiring for SEO]] depends on the strategy and company stage.
*   **Programmatic SEO**: Requires a growth person with strong technical ability and prior experience in building scalable systems and indexation logic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:43">[00:47:43]</a>. Look for individuals who have achieved high SEO growth at less well-known companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:02">[00:48:02]</a>.
*   **Editorial SEO**: An SEO manager (who might not have deep prior SEO expertise but can learn a workflow) responsible for topics, outlines, and managing publishing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:05">[00:56:05]</a>. They should work with writers who are ideally domain experts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:55">[00:55:55]</a>.
*   **Minimum Viable Team**: One SEO person and one writer can be the smallest effective team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:27">[00:59:27]</a>.

## Common Pitfalls and Learning
### Misconceptions about SEO
*   **Technical Audits**: A common myth is that a technical audit (a list of bugs to fix) is a growth strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. Companies actually want growth, which requires a broader SEO strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.
*   **Over-indexing on Technical SEO**: People often focus too much on technical SEO, while editorial and programmatic SEO are the primary drivers of growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

### Getting Things Done
*   **Resource Constraints**: A "dirty secret" in SEO is that most recommendations never get launched due to resource limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:31">[01:06:31]</a>.
*   **Integration with Product Org**: SEO efforts are often disproportionately blocked because they are not integrated into the core product organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:10">[01:07:10]</a>. [[writing_effective_product_strategies_and_onepagers | Product-led SEO]] is the ideal approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:17">[01:07:17]</a>.
*   **Executive Buy-in**: Essential to overcome resource challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:40">[01:07:40]</a>.
*   **Complexity**: SEO is often seen as mysterious, and its high scope requires significant resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:53">[01:07:53]</a>.

### Learning SEO
*   **Data Analysis**: The best way to learn is by conducting data analysis on your own site and, more importantly, on competitor sites to generate hypotheses about what works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:33">[01:03:33]</a>.
*   **Testing**: Validate hypotheses through A/B or sequential testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:03">[01:04:03]</a>.
*   **Networking**: Contacting SEO managers at successful companies and asking about their strategies and test results can provide invaluable insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:50">[01:04:50]</a>.

### AI and SEO
[[shifts_in_seo_strategies_in_the_age_of_ai | The use of AI in SEO]], specifically for content generation (like GPT-3), is generally not recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:52">[01:24:52]</a>.
*   **Risk of Factual Inaccuracy**: AI models generate sentences based on patterns, not factual understanding. Content may sound good but be factually incorrect, which is problematic for users, especially in sensitive domains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:35">[01:25:35]</a>.
*   **Where AI is Useful**: AI excels at supporting the content creation workflow by:
    *   Extracting structure from data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:50">[01:27:50]</a>.
    *   Deciding which topics to write about (clustering keywords, identifying sub-themes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:53">[01:27:53]</a>.
    *   Analyzing topical authority and sorting topics by priority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:01">[01:28:01]</a>.
The ideal approach is for AI to provide the structure and insights, while a human domain expert writes the actual content, ensuring factual accuracy and wisdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:10">[01:28:10]</a>.

## First Steps for Exploring SEO Opportunity
[[evaluating_seo_opportunities_for_businesses | For a startup considering SEO]], the first steps are to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:39">[01:28:39]</a>:
1.  **Assess Addressable Market Size**: Evaluate if the market is large enough by analyzing competitor traffic data via tools like SimilarWeb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:46">[01:28:46]</a>.
2.  **Determine Authority**: Quantify current authority by checking non-SEO traffic and the number of referring domains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:57">[01:28:57]</a>.
3.  **Compare Channels**: Objectively compare SEO's potential cost and opportunity against other growth channels (paid, social, etc.) to decide where to allocate resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:09">[01:29:09]</a>.

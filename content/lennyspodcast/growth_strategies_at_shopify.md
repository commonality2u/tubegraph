Shopify, a significant force in e-commerce, accounts for approximately 10% of e-commerce in the United States, generating about $235 billion in Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV) globally in 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>. This GMV figure is roughly equivalent to the economy of Finland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>. Despite its massive scale, many users are unaware they are interacting with Shopify-powered stores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>.

Archie Abrams, VP of Product and Head of Growth at Shopify, leads an organization of over 600 people across product, design, engineering, data operations, and growth marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>. Shopify's unique approach to product building and growth provides significant insights for other companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>.

## Core Growth Philosophy: Optimizing for Entrepreneurship

Unlike most companies that prioritize increasing retention and reducing churn, Shopify's growth philosophy is deeply tied to its mission: to increase entrepreneurship on the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:56">[06:51:56]</a>.

Shopify aims to lower the barriers to getting started with an online store, encouraging as many people as possible to try their hand at entrepreneurship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:00">[07:10:00]</a>. While many new businesses will fail, the company's business model, which primarily derives revenue from payments tied to merchant success rather than just subscriptions, means that a few highly successful merchants can make an entire cohort profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:36:00">[07:36:00]</a>. This approach is likened to [[angel_investing | Angel Investing]], where a few big wins compensate for many non-successful ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:47:00">[09:47:00]</a>.

## Metrics and Long-Term Thinking

Shopify's approach to metrics is unique, with different parts of the organization operating on varying time horizons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:28:00">[11:28:00]</a>.

### Measuring Success: Total Cohort GMV

For growth, the primary metric is the total GMV produced by a cohort of merchants over extended periods (one, two, three, four, or five years), rather than individual merchant success or traditional retention rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:18:00">[10:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:00:00">[30:00:00]</a>. This metric, which is power law-based, directly translates into revenue and gross profit that can be reinvested into the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:49:00">[10:49:00]</a>.

The company focuses on the *absolute number* of activated merchants or people who complete a journey stage, rather than conversion rates or percentages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:58:00">[25:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:34:00">[28:34:00]</a>. This prevents teams from inadvertently "constricting the funnel" by making earlier steps harder, which might artificially boost their local conversion rate but reduce the overall number of successful users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:21:00">[25:21:00]</a>.

### Long-Term Experimentation

Shopify maintains long-term holdouts for nearly all experiments, automatically reviewing their impact on the business one, two, and even three years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>. This allows them to reassess decisions and refine their understanding of input metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:37:00">[12:37:00]</a>.

Surprising findings from long-term analysis:
*   **Short-term lift doesn't always translate to long-term impact**: Approximately 30% to 40% of experiments that show a short-term lift in metrics (e.g., first sale, paying shop conversion) result in *no incremental long-term GMV lift* a year later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:00:00">[15:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:50:00">[17:50:00]</a>. This often indicates the experiment merely pulled forward success that would have happened anyway or attracted low-value users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:26:00">[15:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:06:00">[38:06:00]</a>. An example is payment failure notifications, which showed short-term lift but no long-term GMV impact because those users were less dedicated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:26:00">[38:26:00]</a>.
*   **Neutral short-term results can lead to long-term wins**: Some experiments with no immediate short-term impact can have significant long-term positive effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:42:00">[15:42:00]</a>. For example, providing pre-filled sections in the online store editor showed no short-term lift in merchant conversion but had a "massive impact" on long-term GMV by helping merchants create better, higher-converting stores, leading to early sales and sustained engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:47:00">[40:47:00]</a>. This encourages Shopify to ship neutral experiments if the intuition is strong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:41:00">[41:41:41]</a>.

For experiments affecting new merchants, Shopify uses a 50/50 split, shipping the winner to 100% of new users after a few weeks but continuing to monitor the original cohort for long-term effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:11:00">[21:11:00]</a>. Experimenters receive automated updates at three, six, nine, and twelve months with the updated results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:55:00">[21:55:00]</a>.

## [[organizational_structure_of_shopifys_growth_team | Organizational Structure of Shopify's Growth Team]]

The growth organization at Shopify is divided into two main groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:59:00">[29:59:00]</a>:

1.  **Growth R&D**: This traditional product-design-engineering-data team focuses on building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:01:00">[30:01:00]</a>. It has three pillars:
    *   **Growth Product**: Covers the full merchant lifecycle, from landing pages, sign-up, and onboarding to monetization (trials, incentives) and engagement through the home feed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:28:00">[30:28:00]</a>. Its goal is to help merchants grow into larger businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:46:00">[30:46:46]</a>.
    *   **Platform (formerly 'Ad')**: Builds internal tools for both growth and other parts of Shopify, including the experimentation platform, communication platform, business intelligence tooling, and marketing technology (MarTech) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:57:00">[30:57:00]</a>.
    *   **Customer Support**: Uniquely, the customer support group sits within growth. This aligns with the goal of thinking about the entire merchant journey, from starting a business to receiving support as they scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:14:00">[31:14:00]</a>. This team builds tooling and experiences for self-serve support and for support advisors to become "superheroes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:42:00">[32:42:00]</a>.

2.  **Growth Marketing**: This group handles traditional marketing channels, including paid acquisition (media buying), affiliate marketing, email, content, and SEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:10:00">[30:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:38:00">[31:38:00]</a>. They focus on driving new users to Shopify.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:05:00">[32:05:00]</a>.

## Key Growth Levers and Insights

### 1. Reducing "Monetary Friction"

Shopify has found significant success by reducing "monetary friction," which includes trial dynamics, trial length, incentives (e.g., App Store credits), and price points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:29:00">[29:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:56:00">[32:56:00]</a>. Lowering these barriers, such as providing a monetary boost, can causally enable merchants to succeed by giving them more time to try an idea or migrate their business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:10:00">[17:10:00]</a>.

### 2. Onboarding and Personalization

Optimizing the onboarding process is a consistent area of opportunity for growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:49:00">[24:49:00]</a>. This involves:
*   Collecting the right information during sign-up to personalize guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:50:00">[23:50:00]</a>.
*   Building trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:21:00">[24:21:00]</a>.
*   Providing the right amount of personalized guidance to a diverse user base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:02:00">[24:02:00]</a>.
*   Avoiding "wizards" (onboarding carousels or steps that abstract the product) in favor of integrating guidance directly into the product experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:05:00">[57:05:00]</a>.

### 3. Collaboration with Sales

Shopify has layered on a sales motion to its historically [[productled_growth_strategy | product-led growth strategy]], primarily to bring larger enterprise businesses onto the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:00">[10:00:00]</a>.

Key learnings from integrating sales:
*   **Qualitative Insights**: Sales engagements involve different scales than self-service, making quantitative data harder to use for decision-making. Building empathy and gathering qualitative insights from sales and merchant success teams about challenges faced by large customers is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.
*   **Hybrid Journeys**: Shopify is breaking down rigid sales and self-service funnels to create "hybrid journeys." This allows merchants to choose their preferred path (self-service or sales assistance) without being forced into one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.
*   **Attribution Challenges**: Hybrid journeys complicate metric tracking. For example, an ad campaign driving a self-service sign-up that later converts to a sales-driven merchant might lose attribution for that high-value merchant in a segmented system, leading to suboptimal investment decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>. Shopify is working on more sophisticated incrementality testing across these different outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>.

### 4. Distributed Marketing Organization

Shopify does not have a CMO; instead, marketing functions are embedded across the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48:00">[06:48:00]</a>. Growth marketing sits within growth, revenue marketing is closer to sales, a brand team operates under the president, and product marketing managers (PMMs) are embedded with product teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>.

The benefits of this structure include:
*   **Proximity to Goals**: Marketers are closer to the primary goals they are trying to achieve, allowing for faster movement and less coordination overhead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:28:00">[07:28:00]</a>.
*   **Strong Founder Intuition**: This model works because CEO Tobi Lütke and President Harley Finkelstein possess strong intuition about the brand and cohesive vision, fulfilling the strategic role often held by a CMO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:59:00">[07:59:00]</a>.

The downside can be a "messy" organizational structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:36:00">[08:36:00]</a>. This structure exemplifies how a founder's background and skills can significantly influence organizational design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:00">[08:41:00]</a>.

## Cultural Principles and Leadership

### "Aim Heavy" and 100-Year Vision

Shopify's leadership, particularly Tobi, instills an "aim heavy" culture centered around building a "100-year company" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:07:00">[42:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:19:00">[42:19:00]</a>. This long-term vision prioritizes the success of merchants and Shopify over short-term gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:26:00">[42:26:00]</a>.

A core principle is to "make the best product in the world, make money to do more of one, and never reverse principles two and three" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:36:00">[42:36:00]</a>. This guides investment and product decisions, encouraging focus on the entrepreneur segment even if large enterprise deals offer immediate revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:30:00">[43:30:00]</a>.

### Technical Architecture Determines Strategy

A unique aspect is the emphasis on *how* products are built, not just *what* is built. Tobi believes that technical architecture determines strategy in a technology company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:16:00">[45:16:00]</a>. Prioritizing adaptable and flexible platforms, even if it means taking longer to ship features or not chasing certain deals, provides long-term value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:46:00">[45:46:00]</a>. This is reinforced through bi-weekly reviews where leaders, including Tobi, delve into the technical details of every project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:42:00">[44:42:00]</a>.

### Taste-Driven Product Development (Core Product)

For the core product teams, traditional metrics and OKRs are "banned" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:31:00">[48:31:00]</a>. Instead, decisions are based on conviction regarding the right technical foundation for the future of commerce, qualitative data, and "taste" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:43:00">[48:43:00]</a>. This allows for shipping more impactful, forward-facing features and taking more risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:28:00">[49:28:00]</a>.

Accountability is maintained through rigorous review processes. Every shipped project requires a video review and "OK2" approval from a group lead (e.g., Glenn for Core, Archie for Growth) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:21:00">[52:21:00]</a>. This ensures a consistent bar for quality and taste, even in a subjective environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:51:00">[50:51:00]</a>.

This approach of building great product without strict metrics requires either:
*   A strong, opinionated founder or set of leaders who define "good taste" and maintain a high bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:41:00">[59:41:00]</a>.
*   Metrics as the primary accountability driver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:05">[01:00:05]</a>.

### Collaboration and Trust

Despite different time horizons and metric approaches, Growth and Core product teams maintain a strong partnership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:41:00">[54:41:00]</a>. This relationship is built on respect and trust, allowing for productive disagreements and ensuring that growth initiatives, while potentially faster, maintain high quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:01:00">[55:01:00]</a>.

## Insights from Discounting (from Udemy Experience)

Archie's experience at Udemy highlighted the power of discounting as a [[marketplace_growth_strategies | growth strategy]], especially for new product categories like online courses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:06">[01:09:06]</a>:

*   **Signaling Value**: High list prices (e.g., $100 for a course) can signal high quality or association with traditional education (like a college course), while deep discounts (e.g., to $10) make it affordable and align with perceived value (like a book) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:33">[01:09:33]</a>.
*   **Tapping into Aspiration**: Education is aspirational. The act of purchasing a course, even if not fully completed, can fulfill an emotional need for progress in one's educational journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:20">[01:10:20]</a>.
*   **Driving Retention**: Enticing, high-value, cheap, and urgent offers can encourage repeated purchases by consistently tapping into this emotional job-to-be-done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:52">[01:10:52]</a>.

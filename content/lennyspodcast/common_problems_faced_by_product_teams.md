Melissa Perri, with extensive experience consulting, teaching at Harvard Business School, and leading product organizations, has observed more product organizations up close than perhaps anyone alive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. She has worked with over 4,000 product managers and more than 30 companies in deep consulting roles, in addition to hundreds of training engagements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. Her observations highlight recurring [[trends_and_challenges_in_product_management | challenges and pitfalls in product management]] that most organizations face.

## Core Problem: Strategy Deployment and Goal Setting

Many organizations incorrectly assume their primary issues lie in training their people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. However, 99% of the time, the real problem is in how goals are set and how strategy is deployed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Without proper context or direction, even well-trained individuals struggle to know what to work towards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

For SaaS companies that understand software's critical role in their strategy, a major issue emerges at the pivotal scale-up phase when they transition from finding product-market fit to rapid scaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. At this stage, they must:
*   Rethink their entire strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.
*   Focus and prioritize, rather than just building everything on the backlog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.
*   Formulate and deploy a comprehensive, prioritized strategy to hundreds, potentially thousands, of employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

This challenge often comes down to: "How do I set strategy, how do I deploy strategy, and how do I make sure it's well-communicated and that everything we're doing on the tech teams, on the product teams, is laddered up into a company strategy that's well prioritized?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>

## Signs of Missing or Poor Strategy

Several indicators suggest a team or company lacks or isn't effectively using its strategy:
*   **Overworked Teams, Stagnant Metrics** Teams are working excessively (80 hours a week), constantly crunching and releasing, but key metrics are not improving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>. This leads to the executive team questioning the productivity of product and tech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:10">[00:22:10]</a>.
*   **"Black Box" Operations** Product and tech functions appear as a "black box" to executives, who don't understand what's happening or if goals are being achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:13">[00:22:13]</a>.
*   **Missing Middle** There's a disconnect between high-level company vision and the day-to-day work of product teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a>. Teams know what features they're building, but executives don't understand how it contributes to the business or vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>.
*   **Lack of Alignment** Different departments or even executives have conflicting goals, leading to internal infighting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:51">[00:28:51]</a>. If you ask various individuals about the company's vision, you'll get different answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:50">[00:23:50]</a>.
*   **Lack of Context** Product managers often ask "why are we building this?" indicating a failure in leadership to clearly explain the purpose and objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:28">[00:28:28]</a>.
*   **Spreading Teams Too Thin** Without clear priorities, teams are often spread across too many initiatives, diluting their impact and preventing significant movement in business metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>.

> "If your executives and your board are telling you that the person who's communicating those things to them are usually not Chief Product Officer level... if your executives don't know what you're doing, that's a big problem." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>

## Solving Product Team Problems

Addressing these issues requires a holistic approach, often starting with strong product leadership.

### When to Hire a Chief Product Officer (CPO)

A CPO becomes critical when a company transitions from a single product to a multi-product portfolio, especially when managing complex portfolios or scaling rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. Key indicators include:
*   **Lack of Executive Communication** Executives and the board don't understand what's happening in tech or product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.
*   **Disconnected Teams** Product teams don't understand how their work ladders up to the company strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.
*   **Difficulty Hiring PMs** A lack of senior leadership can make it hard to attract and retain product managers who seek mentorship and growth opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.
*   **Complex Company Strategy** Expanding into new markets, undergoing major transformations, or mergers necessitate a CPO to formulate and deploy overarching product strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.
*   **Increased Revenue/Team Size** While flexible, companies often consider a CPO around $20-30 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a> or when product management teams reach around seven to eight individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>.

A CPO differs from a VP or Head of Product by demonstrating the ability to interface with the board, deeply understand financials, create revenue projections from product strategy, and confidently project to stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>. They can oversee multiple functions like product, design, product operations, and sometimes analytics or engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>.

### Crafting a Clear Strategy and Vision

*   **Documenting Strategy** A robust strategy should be clearly articulated, often through short documents (e.g., two-pagers) at different levels:
    *   **Executive Level**: Focus on strategic intents â€“ big business movers for the next 2-3 years (e.g., expanding geographically, entering new markets) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:53">[00:24:53]</a>.
    *   **Product Leadership Level**: Define product initiatives, which are problem-oriented and often comprise multiple epics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:42">[00:31:42]</a>.
    *   **Product Teams**: Focus on solutions (epics/options) that address product initiatives and contribute to strategic intents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a>.
    *   These documents should connect and be accessible (e.g., in Google Docs or a wiki) so anyone can trace work back to the overall strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:40">[00:32:40]</a>.
*   **Developing Vision** A good product vision should be:
    *   **Concrete and Picturable**: People should be able to visualize what it means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:14">[00:36:14]</a>. Avoid vague taglines like "be the backbone of healthcare" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:01">[00:24:01]</a>.
    *   **Lofty and Future-Oriented**: It should be far enough away that it requires iteration and testing, not something achievable with just one feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:37">[00:36:37]</a>.
    *   **Differentiated**: Clearly explain how the company or product will be different and better than competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:09">[00:37:09]</a>.
    *   **Definitive about what NOT to do**: A strong vision also states what the company won't pursue or copy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:16">[00:38:16]</a>.
    *   **Visual Communication**: Combine written explanations with prototypes, diagrams, or sketches to make the vision more compelling, especially for visually-oriented executives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:46">[00:34:46]</a>.

### The Role of Product Operations

As product management scales, [[understanding_work_for_product_development | product operations]] becomes essential to maintain efficiency and alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>. It addresses [[building_a_successful_product_management_team | challenges with product management at scale]], such as:
*   **Standardization**: Ensuring consistency in roadmaps, meetings, and processes across teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:29">[00:44:29]</a>.
*   **Career Ladders**: Defining clear paths for product managers' growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:47">[00:44:47]</a>.
*   **Data Access and Insights**: Helping surface internal data (from financial systems, user analytics) and external data (market research, customer insights) to inform strategy and track OKRs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:16">[00:45:16]</a>.
*   **Customer Research Management**: Standardizing approaches to customer interviews to avoid over-contacting the same users and making research insights searchable and reusable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:28">[00:46:28]</a>.
*   **Process Cadence**: Establishing consistent cadences for strategy check-ins, roadmap reviews, and executive planning sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:31">[00:47:31]</a>.
*   **Inter-Divisional Relationships**: Standardizing interactions between product and other divisions like sales and marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:53">[00:47:53]</a>.

Product operations focuses on scaling efficiency, enabling product managers, and streamlining processes, rather than centralizing functions like user research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:49">[00:46:49]</a>.

### Advice for Product Managers

To get better at strategy and navigate the overwhelming amount of information available:
*   **Focus on Execution First**: The most significant learning comes from actively doing your job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:34">[00:49:34]</a>.
*   **Identify Skill Gaps**: Analyze what's working and not working in your current role, then deep-dive into specific areas where you need to improve, such as user research or data analytics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:40">[00:49:40]</a>.
*   **Talk to Others**: Engage with leaders (including your CPO) to understand their thought processes for setting strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:50">[00:39:50]</a>. Talk to other departments like sales to gain market and competitive insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:24">[00:40:24]</a>.
*   **"Pretend You're the CPO"**: Even without the formal role, imagine what you would do if you were in charge of strategy. This provides valuable practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:18">[00:39:18]</a>.
*   **Embrace Data**: Leaders need internal and external data to make informed decisions. Seek out data analysts or develop your own analytical skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:17">[00:41:17]</a>.
*   **Make Decisions and Iterate**: Strategy often involves making the best-informed guess at a given time, then being willing to correct course if new information suggests a different path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:20">[00:42:20]</a>.
*   **Adapt Frameworks**: Understand that no single framework works for every company. Be willing to adapt processes like Agile if they don't serve your team's needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:38">[00:51:38]</a>. If a process isn't helping you improve, change it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:01">[00:52:01]</a>.
*   **Learn from Others' Strategies**: Analyze how successful companies developed and executed their strategies, recognizing that each approach is unique but rooted in data and market understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:22">[00:43:22]</a>.

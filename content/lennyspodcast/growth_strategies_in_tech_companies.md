Bengali Kaba, an experienced product leader, has held significant roles in prominent tech companies, including early growth PM at [[Growth tactics at Facebook and Meta | Facebook]], Head of Growth at Instagram, VP of Product at Instacart, and Director of Product Management at YouTube. He has also advised numerous startups, such as Twitter, on [[Growth strategies for startup apps | growth strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. His career path demonstrates a consistent focus on driving substantial impact across different organizational cultures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Foundational Principles for Growth

Kaba emphasizes several core principles that underpin effective [[Growth hacking and sustainable growth strategies | growth strategies]] in tech companies.

### The "Understand, Identify, Execute" Framework

A key concept championed by Kaba is the "Understand, Identify, Execute" framework, which he has integrated into companies like Instagram, Instacart, Twitter, and YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:08">[00:26:08]</a>. This framework counters the "Identify, Justify, Execute" anti-pattern, where teams might build something they *think* is a good idea, then pull data to justify it, only for it to fail post-launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:51">[00:26:51]</a>.

Instead, the recommended approach is:
1.  **Understand**: Deeply comprehend what is actually happening from first principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:02">[00:41:02]</a>. This involves intentional "understand work" – dedicated time to de-risk projects and gain knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>.
2.  **Identify**: Pinpoint the real problems or opportunities based on the understanding.
3.  **Execute**: Build and launch solutions with higher conviction.

Kaba notes that "understand work" is an intentional allowance in the execution process, meaning it must be planned and assigned as a task, not just assumed to happen in the background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:04">[00:28:04]</a>.

> "If you don't make an affordance for understand work then the work doesn't get done and everyone's just sprinting on execution." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:21">[00:28:21]</a>

*   **Benefits of "Understand Work"**:
    *   **Clarity and De-risking**: Helps clarify root causes, "jobs to be done," and use cases, thus de-risking projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:10">[00:29:10]</a>.
    *   **Velocity Multiplier**: By pursuing "understand work" in parallel with execution (e.g., 60% execution, 40% understand work initially, shifting to 80% execution, 20% understand work over time), teams gain a "velocity multiplier" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:56">[00:29:56]</a>. This means every subsequent sprint benefits from deeper insights, leading to faster movement and higher win rates on shipped products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:37">[00:30:37]</a>.
    *   **Empowered Teams**: Enables teams to challenge assumptions and ask for more understanding before committing to building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:36">[00:29:36]</a>.

*   **Operationalizing "Understand Work"**:
    *   It can involve different functions:
        *   **Engineers**: Examining code for refactoring or instrumenting data for visibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:27">[00:36:27]</a>.
        *   **Data Scientists**: Analyzing activation metrics or understanding proxy metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:51">[00:36:51]</a>.
        *   **Product Managers**: Dogfooding the product, figuring out partnership strategies, or deep diving into user funnels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:53">[00:33:53]</a>.
    *   Teams are encouraged to identify key themes and ask what else needs to be understood during planning sessions, involving cross-functional partners like marketing and go-to-market teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:22">[00:37:22]</a>.
    *   Even low-effort, high-impact tests can be considered "understand work" as they help accelerate learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:04">[00:39:04]</a>.

### Managing Complex Change

To improve cultures and drive change, Kaba uses a framework with five components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:51">[00:41:51]</a>:
*   **Vision**: A clear understanding of the desired future state.
*   **Skills**: The capabilities needed to achieve the vision.
*   **Incentives**: Motivation for individuals to perform the right work.
*   **Resources**: Adequate staffing, budget, and tools.
*   **Action Plan**: A clear roadmap of steps to take.

Missing any component leads to specific negative outcomes:
*   Missing Vision -> Confusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:43">[00:42:43]</a>
*   Missing Skills -> Anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:51">[00:44:51]</a>
*   Missing Incentives -> Resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:50">[00:42:50]</a>
*   Missing Resources -> Frustration
*   Missing Action Plan -> False Starts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:54">[00:42:54]</a>

This framework allows leaders to diagnose the root cause of team struggles and intervene effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:08">[00:43:08]</a>. For example, if a team struggles with execution, it might indicate a lack of proper PRD frameworks or team meeting structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:28">[00:43:28]</a>. Kaba notes that changing vision and skills is harder and takes more time than implementing action plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:41">[00:43:41]</a>. He actively builds a "deck of skills" and frameworks to help uplevel teams quickly and establish a shared language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>.

## Specific Growth Mechanisms

### The Adjacent User Theory

A concept developed during Kaba's time at Instagram, the "adjacent user theory" is crucial for hypergrowth products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:21">[01:04:21]</a>. It emphasizes understanding not only your current users but also the "next user" – those who *could* be using your product but aren't, or for whom the product doesn't quite work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:33">[01:04:33]</a>.

*   **Identifying Adjacent Users**: Growth in hypergrowth companies often comes from new cohorts whose understanding of the product differs from existing users, leading to declining cohort curves if not addressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:50">[01:04:50]</a>.
*   **Application**: It's essential to "dogfood" the product as the adjacent user, observing their behavior, talking to them, and literally seeing how they use the product in real time to identify missing functionality or pain points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:04">[01:06:04]</a>.

### Flywheels and Compounding Growth Loops

Kaba highlights the importance of identifying and optimizing flywheels, especially in multi-sided marketplaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:41">[00:55:41]</a>. This involves understanding the value proposition at every point of the experience for all stakeholders (e.g., creators and viewers on YouTube, or shoppers and retailers on Instacart) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:48">[00:55:48]</a>. Flywheels help teams prioritize what to work on and what not to work on, providing clarity and purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:16">[00:58:16]</a>.

Beyond single flywheels, the goal is to build "compounding growth loops" – multiple ways of acquiring and retaining users that layer onto and supercharge each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:05">[01:10:05]</a>.

## Case Studies in Growth

### Instagram's Growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:09">[01:09:09]</a>

At Instagram, Kaba and his team helped scale the platform to over 1 billion users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:11">[01:11:11]</a>. Key [[scaling_strategies_for_startups_and_lessons_from_stripes_growth | scaling strategies]] and [[Growth tactics at Facebook and Meta | growth tactics]] included:

*   **Understanding "Account Churn"**: Millions of users were logging out and not returning because they couldn't easily log back in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:23">[01:20:23]</a>. This "account access churn" was a significant problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:54">[01:20:54]</a>.
*   **Solving Login Friction**:
    *   **Omnibox Experience**: Consolidated email, phone, and username login fields into a single, simple "Omnibox" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:01">[01:22:01]</a>.
    *   **Trusted Device Text Messages**: If a user failed to log in twice on a trusted device, a text message was sent to confirm login <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:10">[01:22:10]</a>.
    *   **Save Credentials**: Implemented a feature to save credentials and later passcodes on the device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:24">[01:22:24]</a>.
    These changes alone added 15-20 million monthly active users annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>.

*   **Connections Pivot**: Early on, Instagram treated all follows equally (e.g., celebrity vs. friend) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:30">[01:16:30]</a>. Data showed users would follow many celebrities, but when they made their first post, none of their friends were following them, leading to attrition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:01">[01:18:01]</a>. The "connections pivot" prioritized getting new users connected with their actual friends first, leading to significantly improved retention, even doubling it over 18 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:51">[01:19:51]</a>.

*   **Multiple Accounts Team**: Solving login issues revealed an unexpected surge in content creation, often from users' second or third accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:55">[01:23:55]</a>. This insight led to the creation of a dedicated "multiple accounts team" to make it easy for users to navigate between personal, business, or fan accounts, further fueling engagement and content creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:11">[01:24:11]</a>.

*   **Compounding Growth Engines**: Instagram's hypergrowth was fueled by multiple, reinforcing channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:05">[01:10:05]</a>:
    *   **Invitations**: Core component where users invited friends.
    *   **Celebrity Partnerships**: A savvy team taught celebrities how to use the platform to tell their stories and build their brands, setting norms for platform use and driving media attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:52">[01:10:52]</a>.
    *   **SEO**: News articles linking to celebrity Instagram accounts or posts, combined with the launch of a web presence (which increased growth by 10% immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:46">[01:13:46]</a>) and Instagram embeds on other sites, created a powerful SEO engine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:33">[01:11:33]</a>.
    *   **Paid Media**: Utilized signals from other channels to optimize paid acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:21">[01:12:21]</a>.
    *   **Original Content**: Instagram's own content initiatives.

### Instacart's Growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:38">[00:58:38]</a>

At Instacart, Kaba focused on how the product reflected users' daily lives, emphasizing the "job to be done" over surface-level convenience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:47">[00:58:47]</a>.

*   **Reorder Experience**: Initially, Instacart made reordering incredibly difficult, requiring many clicks to find past orders and forcing users to reorder an entire cart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>. Recognizing that 90% of orders after five uses were the same, improving the reorder experience was a significant opportunity to drive better retention and [[Product-led growth strategies | product-led growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:29">[01:01:29]</a>.

### Facebook's Global Growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:42">[01:25:42]</a>

As an early [[Growth tactics at Facebook and Meta | growth PM at Facebook]], Kaba was responsible for people recommendations globally, focusing on South Asia and Southeast Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:57">[01:25:57]</a>.

*   **Cultural Context for Friending**: In India, Facebook's people graph appeared "broken," with significantly fewer common friends per connection compared to the US (e.g., 7 vs. 22) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:14">[01:26:14]</a>. Extensive "understand work" involving on-the-ground research revealed:
    *   **Irrelevant Profile Information**: Western-centric profile fields (school, job title) were not relevant in many Indian contexts, where common names like "Amit Kumar" could have hundreds of thousands of Facebook profiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:52">[01:27:52]</a>.
    *   **Visual Identification**: Users often relied on photos to identify friends' cars or animals, rather than profile details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:25">[01:28:25]</a>.
This deep understanding led to creative solutions for friending in culturally diverse environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:09">[01:29:09]</a>.

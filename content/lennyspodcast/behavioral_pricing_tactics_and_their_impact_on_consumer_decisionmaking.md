[[psychology_in_marketing_and_decisionmaking | Behavioral pricing]] is a strategy that taps into the irrational modes of human decision-making, influencing purchasing patterns without necessarily changing the product itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:35">[01:16:35]</a>. It acknowledges that people's decisions are not always rational, even when presented with economically equivalent options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:40">[01:16:40]</a>. This approach focuses on how products are framed and presented to appeal to both the rational and irrational sides of the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:01">[01:17:01]</a>.

## Key Behavioral Pricing Tactics

Several tactics leverage human psychology to influence purchasing decisions:

### The Decoy Effect
The decoy effect involves introducing a third, less attractive option (the "decoy") to make another option seem more appealing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:32">[01:18:32]</a>.

*   **Example 1: Software Product Pricing**
    A company with three software products priced at $49, $79, and $149 initially saw 60-70% of customers choose the $49 product because it offered many features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:41">[01:17:41]</a>. By moving the middle price to $99 (finding a [[psychology_in_marketing_and_decisionmaking | psychological threshold]] between $79-$99) and the highest to $199, they introduced a new product at $299 as a decoy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:20">[01:18:20]</a>. This made the $99 product look more attractive, leading to a 30%+ increase in monthly recurring revenue (MRR) and average revenue per user (ARPU) with no product changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:02">[01:19:02]</a>.
*   **Example 2: Movie Theater Popcorn**
    A small popcorn priced at $7 acts as a decoy for an extra-large popcorn with butter at $8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:20">[01:19:20]</a>. Most people will choose the extra-large, perceiving it as a better deal for just one more dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:27">[01:19:27]</a>. Without the $7 decoy, customers might question the $8 price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:33">[01:19:33]</a>.

### The Compromise Effect
This effect states that people tend to avoid extremes and often choose the middle option when presented with a "good, better, best" pricing structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:12">[01:20:12]</a>. If an entry-level product is too generous with features, it can undermine sales of higher-tier products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:01">[01:20:01]</a>. By designing packaging to steer customers toward a middle option, companies can maximize value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:41">[01:20:41]</a>.

### Pennies A Day Effect
Framing a price in smaller, more frequent units can make it seem more affordable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:14">[01:21:14]</a>. For example, a $30 per month price might feel less substantial when framed as "one dollar per day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:20">[01:21:20]</a>. Similarly, showing an annual subscription as a monthly price (e.g., $29.99/month for annual vs. $40/month for monthly) makes the annual option appear more attractive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:57">[01:21:57]</a>.

### Razor-Razor Blade Model
This model involves offering a base product at a low initial price to encourage adoption, while making profits on recurring consumables or add-ons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:34">[01:22:34]</a>.

*   **Example: Razors and Printer Cartridges**
    Razor handles are cheap, but the blades are expensive and add up quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:40">[01:22:40]</a>. Similarly, printers are often inexpensive, but ink cartridges are costly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:52">[01:22:52]</a>.
*   **Application in SaaS**
    For a SaaS product, this means making the base platform attractive and affordable to onboard users, then monetizing through usage-based fees or add-on features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:58">[01:22:58]</a>. This strategy appeals to customers sensitive to upfront costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:17">[01:23:17]</a>.

### The Panini Effect
The Panini Effect leverages people's psychological compulsion to complete tasks or puzzles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:43">[01:23:43]</a>.

*   **Application:**
    By visually presenting products or services as parts of a "puzzle" or a checklist that customers can "complete," companies can encourage the purchase of multiple items or services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:51">[01:24:51]</a>. For example, showing a customer they've used some features but have empty "slots" for others can compel them to engage with more offerings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:31">[01:25:31]</a>. Starbucks' bingo card promotions use a similar principle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:44">[01:25:44]</a>. This can significantly increase attachment rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:07">[01:25:07]</a>.

### Psychological Thresholds
These are specific price points where consumer perception of value changes significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:36">[01:26:36]</a>. Crossing these thresholds can lead to a steep drop in demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:27">[01:27:27]</a>.

*   **Identification:**
    Companies can identify these thresholds by asking customers about "acceptable," "expensive," and "prohibitively expensive" prices for an innovation after clearly communicating its value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:41">[01:26:41]</a>.
*   **Common Examples:**
    Price points like $29 (equating to roughly a dollar a day) or $9.99 are common [[psychology_in_marketing_and_decisionmaking | psychological thresholds]] that have been validated across various consumer and B2B SaaS products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:55">[01:26:55]</a>. Understanding these helps in [[understanding_willingness_to_pay_in_pricing_strategy | pricing strategy]] and packaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:41">[01:27:41]</a>.

## Conclusion
[[psychology_in_marketing_and_decisionmaking | Behavioral pricing]] acknowledges the irrational side of consumer decision-making. By applying tactics like the Decoy Effect, Compromise Effect, Pennies A Day Effect, Razor-Razor Blade Model, and Panini Effect, companies can frame their products and prices to appeal to psychological biases, leading to increased revenue and customer engagement without necessarily altering the product itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:07">[01:19:07]</a>. These methods are crucial for effective [[different_pricing_models_and_when_to_use_them | pricing strategy]] and should be considered during product development, not as an afterthought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:27">[01:22:27]</a>.

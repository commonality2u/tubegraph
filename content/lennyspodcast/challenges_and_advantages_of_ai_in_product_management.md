## The [[the_role_of_ai_in_product_management | Role of AI in Product Management]]

The role of a product manager involves bringing together design, engineering, business, and operations to deliver impact and represent the customer in solving their problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>. With the rise of AI, it has become easier to break into [[the_future_of_product_management_in_the_ai_era | AI product management]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>. Previously, a deeper background in machine learning was often required to work at companies building AI products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>. Now, there are three primary flavors of AI product managers:

1.  **AI Platform PMs** These individuals build tools for AI engineers. An example is Arise AI, which provides observability and evaluation platforms for artificial intelligence, helping AI engineers understand the [[impact_of_ai_on_product_development | impact]] and ensure their applications meet business expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:02:00">[07:02:00]</a>.
2.  **AI Product PMs** For these roles, the core product is centered around AI. Examples include products like ChatGPT or Notebook LM, where the core experience is enabled by underlying models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:28:00">[08:28:00]</a>. The PM's job is to package this advanced technology and make it consumable for businesses, enterprises, or consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:00">[09:06:00]</a>.
3.  **AI-Powered PMs** These product managers are enabled by AI technology across their entire role, rather than building the core model from the ground up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:00">[09:32:00]</a>. They utilize large language models or other models to build better experiences for their customers, leveraging AI as a common component, similar to a database for SaaS applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:05:00">[10:05:00]</a>. In the near future, most product managers are likely to fall into one of these categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31:00">[10:31:00]</a>.

### Becoming an AI Product Manager

To pivot into an AI product management role, it's crucial to be "in love with the problem" you're trying to solve and push the boundaries of technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:36:00">[14:36:00]</a>. For AI product managers, this means designing the best customer experience and solving customer problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:27:00">[15:27:00]</a>.

One of the most effective ways to stand out is by building a portfolio of products you've attempted to create, even if they are just prototypes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:51:00">[20:51:00]</a>. This demonstrates interest, capability, and how you approach problems, effectively "shortcutting" the hiring process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:46:00">[21:46:00]</a>.

#### Recommended Skills and Learning
*   **Fundamentals**: Understand what machine learning and AI are, and the underlying knowledge that has driven this technological evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:10:00">[19:10:00]</a>. Resources like Andrej Karpathy's videos on AI foundations can be helpful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:40:00">[19:40:00]</a>.
*   **Hands-on Tool Usage**: Actively use AI [[tools_and_tips_for_ai_product_management | tools]] to explore and push the boundaries of what's possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:04:00">[20:04:00]</a>.
*   **Application to Industry**: Learn how to apply AI knowledge to problems and industries that interest you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:39:00">[20:39:00]</a>.

#### [[tools_and_tips_for_ai_product_management | Tools for AI Product Management]]
AI has made it "super feasible" for product managers to arrive at meetings with prototypes or mocks, raising the resolution of starting points for discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. Tools that enhance PM productivity include:
*   **Cursor** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:07:00">[11:07:00]</a>
*   **Replit** (especially its agent for building and hosting websites rapidly) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:07:00">[11:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:45:00">[24:45:00]</a>
*   **Vercel / Vzer** (for quickly generating landing pages and UIs from prompts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:33:00">[11:33:00]</a>
*   **Midjourney / DALL-E** (for graphic design, logos, or visual storytelling) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:20:00">[12:20:00]</a>
*   **Webson** (for playful or experimental prototypes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:10">[01:10:10]</a>
*   **Gong** (to analyze customer calls and extract common problems using large language models) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:09">[01:02:09]</a>

These tools allow PMs to show up with functional prototypes, even if they're not ready for production, making it easier to communicate ideas to design and engineering teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:18:00">[11:18:00]</a>.

### Advantages of AI in Product Management

AI significantly increases a product manager's leverage and influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>. Since AI tools excel at building things when given clear instructions, the core value of a PM—knowing *what* to build, identifying problems, and articulating solutions—becomes even more critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. This positions PMs as best-suited to thrive in the AI era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>.

AI helps product managers:
*   **Communicate ideas effectively**: By quickly generating prototypes, PMs can better convey concepts to design, engineering, and leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>.
*   **Scale themselves**: AI tools enable PMs to be "in so many places at once" by automating tasks like analyzing customer feedback from transcripts, providing a "superpower" for gathering signal through noise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>.
*   **Lower the barrier to creation**: It's much easier and faster to build applications or prototypes than it was even a year ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. This allows PMs to experiment more rapidly.
*   **Be a "Wanderer"**: Rather than "waiting" for AI trends to crystallize, PMs can actively "wander" and explore new directions, pushing the boundaries of what their company considers possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>.

### Challenges in AI Product Management

Despite the advantages, AI introduces several challenges:

*   **Higher Bar for Impact**: While tools make building easier, the expectation for a product manager's [[impact_of_ai_on_product_management | impact]] within a company increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>.
*   **Avoiding "Me Too" Products**: A significant challenge is the tendency to simply replicate popular AI interfaces (like building "another ChatGPT" on internal data) without deeply considering if it's the right solution for the business problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>. Top AI product managers avoid this, focusing on what the business truly needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>. The ideal AI interface might look very different from a chatbot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>.
*   **Problem-First Approach**: The core advice is to "focus on the problem you're solving, and AI is a tool to solve it, not AI for blank just because" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>. There's a risk of trying to fit technology to a problem rather than understanding the problem first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>.
*   **Identifying the Right Problems**: It can be difficult to identify which problems are best suited for AI solutions, as some, like complex customer support routing based on evolving context, may be harder than they appear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>. Hackathons can help teams experiment and discover where ideas "stick" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>.
*   **Measuring Impact**: There isn't a standard metric for measuring the [[impact_of_ai_on_product_management_and_development | impact of AI]] within a business, especially if it's not directly tied to revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>. PMs need to determine how many "shots" they are taking to understand what's working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>.
*   **Balancing Exploration with KPIs**: A key skill for top AI product managers is "walking and chewing gum"—continuously delivering customer value and moving business metrics while simultaneously making space to prototype, experiment, and learn from failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>.
*   **Rapidly Changing Technology**: The AI landscape changes extremely fast. Product managers must accept that experiments may not work, but the process of iteration and learning is crucial for improving AI products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>.
*   **User Control vs. Full Automation**: Successfully leveraging AI means understanding that users often want some level of control over the experience, rather than complete automation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>. The "Ikea effect" suggests users feel more empowered when they have an [[impact_of_ai_on_product_development | impact]] on the end product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>. AI should make a product easier to use and lower the barrier to creation, not necessarily automate the problem away entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:00">[04:34:00]</a>.
*   **Navigating Hype**: The intense "buzz" and excitement around AI can make it difficult to determine the right things to build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>.

Successful AI product managers are driven by curiosity, constantly learning about the latest tools, and willing to experiment to find impactful solutions for customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.

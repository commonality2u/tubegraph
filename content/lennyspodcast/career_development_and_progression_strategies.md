His insights, drawn from 15 years at Amazon, offer practical strategies for [[career_growth_and_personal_development | career advancement]].

## The Magic Loop for Career Growth

The "Magic Loop" is a five-step framework designed to foster [[career_development_and_advice | career growth]] in nearly any circumstance, even with a challenging manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. Its success is attributed to its simplicity and effectiveness, as people reported rapid promotions and new opportunities after applying it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

### Steps of the Magic Loop
1.  **Do your current job well** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>: You must be performing at a solid level so your manager doesn't wish you were different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. This means checking in with your manager and addressing any performance issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
2.  **Ask your boss how you can help** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>: This simple question sets you apart and begins to build a collaborative relationship, showing you're part of their organization to make them successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. Managers rarely get asked this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>.
3.  **Do whatever they ask** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>: Follow through on their requests, even if the work isn't your favorite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.
4.  **Go back to your manager and ask how you can help them achieve their goals while also helping you reach your own** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>: This is where the "magic" happens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. Managers are generally open to meeting you halfway and helping you achieve your goals, such as changing roles, getting a raise, or learning a new skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. For this step to work, you must be clear about your own career goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.
5.  **Repeat** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>: Continuously engage in this loop, building trust and a mutually beneficial relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.

### Why It Works and Common Considerations
The Magic Loop fosters a partnership with leadership, moving away from an adversarial relationship where employees might do the minimum to get by <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:45">[00:18:45]</a>. Most managers are not "that good" at thinking about their employees' [[Career development and planning | careers]] due to their own busy schedules and priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. The Magic Loop puts the control in your hands, allowing you to drive your own advancement rather than waiting for a perfect manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.

> "What your manager should do and $4 will get you a cup of coffee at Starbucks. The point of this loop is it's in your control." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>

This process also implicitly helps identify the gaps keeping you from the next level, ensuring you and your manager are aligned on what needs to be worked on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>. It's crucial to explicitly share your goals, as managers often assume you either want to stay in your current role or become a manager like them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>. The Magic Loop is useful even if your goal isn't promotion, but rather changing projects, teams, or rebalancing your life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:28">[00:22:28]</a>.

### Applicability and Evolution
The Magic Loop is effective from the start of a [[career_development_and_advice | career]] up to senior levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>. At executive levels, it becomes less about explicit conversations and more about proactively anticipating needs, suggesting solutions, and keeping leaders informed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>. This "advanced mode" requires a high level of rapport and trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>.

## Breaking Through the Senior Manager Plateau

Many individuals get stuck at the senior manager level (e.g., L7, M1, M2 in Amazon's system) due to several factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>:
*   **Choke point:** Fewer director positions exist compared to senior manager roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a>.
*   **Economic conditions:** A lean environment with flattening organizations and layoffs reduces available spots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:53">[00:27:53]</a>.
*   **Shift in required skills:** Progressing beyond senior manager requires a shift from functional expertise and "getting things done" to influence, coordination, and strategic thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>. As Marshall Goldsmith's book states, "What Got You Here Won't Get You There" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:04">[00:25:04]</a>.

### Strategies for Breaking Out
While some patience is required, as promotions at this level depend on the availability of appropriate roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:43">[00:25:43]</a>, much is still within your control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:11">[00:26:11]</a>:
*   **Practice Next-Level Skills:** Start working with leadership on strategic projects and developing inventiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:16">[00:26:16]</a>.
*   **"Do the Job Before You Have the Job":** Demonstrating capability for the next level makes leaders more comfortable promoting you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:08">[00:28:08]</a>. Leaders want the best people under them and are selfishly motivated to promote capable direct reports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:20">[00:28:20]</a>.
*   **Be the Chosen Person:** In situations where organizations are restructured or downsized, ensure you are the person with potential who gets retained and given more responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a>. The Magic Loop can help you become this indispensable person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:45">[00:27:45]</a>.

## Cultivating Inventiveness

Jeff Bezos himself identified most with being an inventor, striving to build Amazon into the most inventive company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a>. Ethan Evans, initially not considering himself an inventor, went on to hold over 70 patents during his 15 years at Amazon by systematically approaching invention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:10">[00:30:10]</a>.

### How to Be Systematically Inventive
1.  **Become an Expert:** You need a solid knowledge base in the area you wish to innovate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>.
2.  **Dedicate Time for Thinking:** Invention requires dedicated, focused time away from distractions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:57">[00:30:57]</a>. Even two hours once a month can be sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:40">[00:33:40]</a>.
3.  **Combine Existing Ideas:** The most straightforward way to invent is often by putting two existing concepts together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:19">[00:31:19]</a>. Ethan's drone delivery patent, for example, combined drones with the concept of an aircraft carrier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:30">[00:31:30]</a>.

> "You don't need very many good ideas to be seen as tremendously invented." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:18">[00:34:18]</a>

It's important to distinguish between invention and optimization. While a core idea is essential, much of the innovation and hard work comes from optimizing and expanding on that initial idea, making it cheaper, better, and faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:42">[00:34:42]</a>. Amazon Prime is a prime example of continuous optimization, expanding from two-day shipping to include numerous services and features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:17">[00:35:17]</a>.

## Standing Out in Interviews

Ethan Evans, having interviewed over 2,200 people, highlights key factors for standing out as a candidate and securing a job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:14">[00:36:14]</a>:

### Top Factors for Success
1.  **Appearance and Enthusiasm:** Show up interested in the job and be enthusiastic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:37">[00:36:37]</a>. People want to work with those who want to work with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:51">[00:36:51]</a>. In virtual interviews, be fully present, use your camera, maintain eye contact, and project energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:40">[00:38:40]</a>.
2.  **Focus on Impact, Not Just Tasks:** Candidates, especially at higher levels, often describe what they've done but fail to explain *why it mattered* or the impact it had <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:24">[00:37:24]</a>. Leaders hire to solve problems, so demonstrating how your actions made a difference, solved big problems, and positively changed the company or customer outlook is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">[00:37:37]</a>. This emphasis on impact reflects the shift towards leadership, even for individual contributors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:54">[00:37:54]</a>.

## Lessons from Failure: The Jeff Bezos App Store Launch

Ethan Evans shares a significant failure from his time at Amazon: the troubled launch of the Amazon App Store, which was supposed to be heralded by a letter from Jeff Bezos emphasizing a "test drive" feature that was not working on launch day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:09">[00:41:09]</a>. Bezos became "clearly angry" as the launch stalled and a critical database issue was revealed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:01">[00:44:01]</a>.

### Key Takeaways from Navigating Failure
*   **Own the Mistake:** Immediately take ownership and state that the problem is your fault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:28">[00:44:28]</a>.
*   **Proactive, Timely Communication:** Provide frequent updates on the situation, the plan, and when the next update will be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:39">[00:44:39]</a>. This buys time and rebuilds trust by showing you are on top of the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:14">[00:51:14]</a>.
*   **Work Hard and Fast:** Go "all out" to fix the problem, even if it means working through weekends and pulling in external help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:55">[00:51:55]</a>.
*   **Meet in Person:** When dealing with anger or conflict, a face-to-face meeting can be more effective than email, as it's harder for people to maintain extreme anger in person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:13">[00:49:13]</a>.
*   **Resilience and Stubbornness:** Don't let shame or impostor syndrome derail you. Even after a huge mistake, it's possible to recover and succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:51">[00:52:51]</a>. Ethan's continued success and eventual promotion to VP after this incident highlight this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:44">[00:49:44]</a>.
*   **Learn from the Experience:** Ethan learned to "Fear the New York Times headline," emphasizing the need for robust launches and avoiding public mistakes, especially at Amazon's scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:49">[00:56:49]</a>. He shifted from "surprise launches" to extensive beta testing to identify problems pre-launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:18">[00:58:18]</a>.
*   **Support Your Team:** A regret was not reaching out to the junior engineer responsible for the bug, who left the company due to the perceived shame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:22">[00:59:22]</a>. It's crucial to reassure team members that system failures are not solely their fault and to provide human support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:26">[00:59:26]</a>.

## Amazon Leadership Principles

Ethan Evans contributed to drafting one of Amazon's 14 core leadership principles: **Ownership** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:02">[01:01:02]</a>. He proposed the impactful phrase: "an owner never says that's not my job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:27">[01:02:27]</a>. This principle encourages employees at all levels to take responsibility beyond their immediate tasks and influence the company regardless of their position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:59">[01:05:59]</a>.

Other significant Amazon leadership principles include:
*   **Bias for Action:** Emphasizes that speed matters in business, and many decisions are reversible, so it's important to move quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:30">[01:03:30]</a>.
*   **Leaders are Right a Lot:** While initially interpreted as simply being correct, this principle evolved to include actively seeking diverse perspectives and working to disconfirm one's own beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:42">[01:07:42]</a>. This encourages leaders to be open, question assumptions, and consider broader viewpoints for better decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:03">[01:08:03]</a>.

## Contrarian Opinions

Ethan Evans holds several contrarian views:
*   **Return-to-Office Movement:** He believes that remote work has far more room for improvement and innovation than traditional offices, which have been optimized for 300 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:14">[01:09:14]</a>. He has "so much more faith in the opportunity to improve the remote experience" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:35">[01:10:35]</a>.
*   **Doing Business on a Handshake:** He advocates for building trust and relying on one's word rather than overly formal contracts and legal agreements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:42">[01:10:42]</a>. While there's a risk of being let down occasionally, he believes the cost of constant suspicion outweighs the benefits of trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:17">[01:11:17]</a>. This aligns with Sam Altman's philosophy of trusting people, as it generally leads to better overall outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:32">[01:11:32]</a>.

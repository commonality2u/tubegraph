## Understanding the Core Concept

In product management, "discovery" refers to the process of figuring out what to build. This process is crucial because "people don't buy the problem they buy your solution" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The primary goal is to solve a problem better than competitors so that customers choose your product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

Discovery technically encompasses two main types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:29">[00:25:29]</a>:
*   **Problem Discovery** – Identifying which problems are worth solving and ensuring enough users care about them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:33">[00:25:33]</a>. While important, it's often overemphasized, especially when founders already know the core problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:50">[00:25:50]</a>.
*   **Solution Discovery** – Devising the winning solution to the identified problem. This is where most time should be spent, as it determines whether people will actually buy the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:53">[00:26:53]</a>. Steve Jobs, for instance, was deeply focused on [[continuous_product_discovery | solution discovery]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:16">[00:27:16]</a>.

## Feature Teams vs. Real Product Teams: The Discovery Difference

A significant distinction exists between how "feature teams" and "real product teams" approach discovery:

*   **Feature Teams** are typically given a roadmap consisting of a prioritized list of features and projects by stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. Their job is primarily to design, code, QA, and deploy these predefined features, essentially serving the business by producing output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. The product manager in such a team acts more like a project manager, organizing requirements and herding cats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.
*   **Real Product Teams** are instead given problems to solve, whether they are customer or company problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. These teams are empowered with the skills and knowledge to come up with the best solution to that problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. Their focus is on achieving outcomes by solving problems, not just producing output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. They celebrate when a problem is solved, not just when a release is made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

The job of a product manager on a real product team is "radically different" from that on a feature team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. This requires discovering solutions that are valuable, usable, feasible, and viable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

## The Product Manager's Role in Discovery

On an empowered product team, the product manager's [[the_role_of_product_managers | role]] is to discover solutions that are valuable and viable, two of the most challenging aspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. This means contributing to the "how" of the product, not just the "what" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:42">[00:28:42]</a>.

To succeed in this, a product manager needs to:
1.  **Be an expert on users and customers** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:25">[00:39:25]</a>. This often means directly interacting with customers and understanding their needs deeply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:38">[00:39:38]</a>.
2.  **Be an expert in data** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:14">[00:40:14]</a>. Understanding how the product is used, sales analytics, and user analytics is crucial for informed decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:16">[00:40:16]</a>.
3.  **Learn the different parts of the business** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:30">[00:40:30]</a>. This includes understanding marketing, sales, monetization, compliance, regulatory, privacy, and security issues to build trust with stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:41">[00:40:41]</a>.
4.  **Know the competitive landscape, industry, and trends** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:15">[00:41:15]</a>.

These four areas of knowledge are what the product manager brings to the team, enabling them to collectively come up with great solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:29">[00:41:29]</a>.

For a team to transition from a feature team to a real product team, the product manager must gain these skills, which can take two to three months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:36">[00:36:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:36">[00:43:36]</a>.

## Misconceptions and Best Practices in User Research

A common misconception is that user research simply tells you exactly "what to build" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:21">[00:30:21]</a>. Instead, user research primarily informs your "model of the user and the customer," which then guides what you build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:33">[00:30:33]</a>.

When conducting user research during [[continuous_product_discovery | solution discovery]] (e.g., testing prototypes):
*   The goal is *not* to find out if users like the product, but to find "all the reasons they don't like it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:32">[00:32:32]</a>, or "all the reasons they won't use your product" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:39">[00:32:39]</a>. This is known as evaluative user research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:05">[00:33:05]</a>.
*   The product manager and designer *must* be present during product tests; relying solely on reports from user researchers can lead to insights being ignored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:26">[00:33:26]</a>. Engineers' involvement is also super important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:13">[00:34:13]</a>.

## Importance of Leadership and Culture

Companies with a strong product culture foster an environment where true product discovery thrives. Conversely, many companies struggle because they lack understanding of how real product teams operate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

Steve Jobs identified "diseases" that can hinder product innovation as companies grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:44">[00:20:44]</a>:
*   **Prioritizing Sales, Marketing, and Finance over Product** – As companies get bigger, product historically becomes less important, and leaders from sales, marketing, or finance are celebrated and promoted. This leads to good product people leaving for companies that value product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>.
*   **Fear of Innovation** – After founders leave, companies often become scared to take risks, focusing only on low-risk optimization or A/B tests rather than real discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:38">[00:21:38]</a>. This fear stems from not knowing "what is essential and what is incidental" in the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>.
*   **"Disease of Managers/Stakeholders"** – Executives may mistakenly believe that an idea is 90% of the work, undervaluing the "craftsmanship" of going from an idea to a product through discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:24">[00:23:24]</a>. They tell teams what to build, even though only about 20% of such features generate positive returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:16">[00:24:16]</a>.
*   **"Disease of Processed People"** – Scaling with process (e.g., rigid methodologies like SAFe) is a harmful trend that leads to repackaged waterfall models and stifles innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:49">[00:55:49]</a>. Scaling effectively requires leaders, not just processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:10">[00:56:10]</a>.

### Coaching and Empowerment
Good product companies value coaching and empowering teams to make decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>. Modern successful companies like Microsoft, Google, Netflix, and Apple emphasize leaders who are good coaches and empower their teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:16">[00:46:16]</a>. The ideal is to push decisions down to the people with the knowledge to best solve the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.

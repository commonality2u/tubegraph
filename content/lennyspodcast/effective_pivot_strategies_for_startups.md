Dalton Caldwell, a managing director and group partner at Y Combinator, is often referred to as the "king of the pivot" due to his expertise in guiding startups through successful changes in direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>. His insights into effective pivots emphasize building upon existing strengths and knowledge.

## Characteristics of a Good Pivot

A successful pivot is often described as "going home" because it feels warmer and closer to something the founders are already experts at <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>. Crucially, a good pivot builds on what was learned from the prior idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>. It should also involve exploring areas of expertise that might not seem obvious or fashionable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>.

## Examples of Successful Pivots

Several companies exemplify these [[examples_of_successful_productmarket_fit_pivots | effective pivot strategies]]:

*   **Brex**
    *   Initially named Vyond, Brex started as a VR headset company, despite its founders having little expertise in optics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>.
    *   They successfully pivoted to fintech, an area where the founders had prior experience from working on a fintech company in Brazil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>. This move brought them closer to their area of expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>.

*   **Retool**
    *   Began as Cashew, a P2P Venmo competitor in the UK, which struggled to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>.
    *   The pivot to Retool, a platform for building internal tools, leveraged the founders' experience building internal dashboards for Cashew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>.

*   **PostHog**
    *   Pivoted into their current idea because the founders had deep knowledge and strong opinions about analytics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>.

*   **Zip**
    *   The founders, known for their strong business execution instincts, initially struggled to find the right market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>.
    *   They intentionally sought out a large, knowable market by looking for publicly traded or private equity-owned companies with "hated" software and low NPS scores to disrupt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>. This led them to discover the procurement software market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>.
    *   Their [[Growth strategies and achieving productmarket fit in startups | customer acquisition strategy]] involved direct messaging people on LinkedIn for advice, which turned into early beta testers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>.

*   **Segment**
    *   Started with software designed to help students indicate confusion in class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>.
    *   They then pivoted to a Mixpanel competitor and eventually to a JavaScript tool for sending events to multiple endpoints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>.
    *   The final successful idea emerged after years of grinding and becoming experts in how analytics worked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>. This illustrates that relevant experience can be gained *during* the startup journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>.

## When to Consider a Pivot

Deciding when to pivot is a nuanced decision, but a key indicator is when the founders are **out of ideas** on how to grow the current product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>. If there are still several promising growth ideas untried, it's generally advisable to persist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>. A lack of genuine, unique growth ideas (e.g., resorting to generic tactics like "maybe we should pay influencers") often signals it's time to pivot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>.

## Avoiding "Tarpit Ideas"

Founders should be wary of "tarpit ideas"â€”startup concepts that seem like unsolved problems and garner positive initial feedback but have historically trapped countless startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>. These ideas can be deceptive because they offer early validation, drawing founders in and making it difficult to pivot away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>.

Examples of tarpit ideas include:
*   Apps to coordinate with friends for social outings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.
*   Music discovery platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.
*   Foursquare clones, which were prevalent for a time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>.

These ideas are hard because they appear to solve a problem people want solved, but they often lack sustainable business models or widespread adoption.

## The Importance of Conviction and Persistence

A recurring theme in successful [[approach_and_benefits_of_pivoting_in_startups | startup pivot and adaptation in tech space]] is the founders' irrational intent to keep going, even when rationality suggests giving up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a>. Almost every successful startup goes through a near-death experience where founders feel like all hope is lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:51">[39:51]</a>. It's rare for companies to fail purely from running out of money; more often, it's due to founders losing hope or internal conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:30">[38:30]</a>.

While it's important to keep going, founders should also ask themselves if they are still enjoying the work, their co-founders, and their customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:10:00">[09:10:00]</a>. If the answer is profoundly negative, it might be the right time to shut down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:28:00">[09:28:00]</a>. However, if there's still love for the product and the problem, that's a strong signal to persist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:12:00">[10:12:00]</a>.

The belief that one is "the one" to make the company work, despite external data suggesting otherwise, is a common trait among founders of large companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>. This deep internal conviction can "warp the world to bend to that will" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>. This conviction isn't present from day one but grows as the product gains traction and customers provide positive feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>.

## Importance of Customer Interaction

A primary reason startups fail is not talking to customers and failing to find [[Growth strategies and achieving productmarket fit in startups | product-market fit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>. Founders should actively engage with potential customers in person rather than relying solely on online methods like landing pages or ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>. It's recommended that 20-30% of a founder's time be dedicated to customer meetings or calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>. The "Collison install" story of Stripe highlights the importance of the last mile: even after a "yes" from a customer, founders must ensure implementation and continued engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>.

## Avoiding Over-Delegation and Early Growth Hacking

Founders should avoid over-delegating early on and resist the temptation to hire highly senior people with impressive resumes from large tech companies too early <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>. Founders must stay deeply involved in product development and continue talking to customers, as caring about users and product quality cannot be delegated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>.

For very early-stage startups, focusing on "growth hacking" and extensive A/B testing is often a waste of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>. This advice, often geared towards later-stage companies, can confuse seed-stage founders who need to prioritize getting their first customer and building a product people want <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:19:00">[06:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>. Instead, early startups should look at what successful companies did when they were acquiring their first thousand users, not what they do today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:21:00">[09:21:00]</a>.

## Y Combinator's "Request for Startups"

Y Combinator publishes a "Request for Startups" (RFS) list to encourage founders to explore different ideas beyond common themes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>. This initiative aims to diversify the "information diet" of founders, leading them to contemplate less conventional but potentially high-impact areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>.

Examples of ideas YC is interested in funding include:
*   ERPs (Enterprise Resource Planning software) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>.
*   Open-source companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>.
*   Space companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>.
*   Cures for cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a>.
*   Spatial computing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>.
*   New defense technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>.
*   Bringing manufacturing back to America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>.
*   Better enterprise glue (software to connect business systems) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:00">[05:49:00]</a>.
*   Small, fine-tuned AI models as alternatives to gigantic generic ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>.

These areas are seen as having significant potential and are less saturated with applications compared to more common ideas.

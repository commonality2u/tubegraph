Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is often under-resourced by companies, especially when compared to advertising budgets. For large companies like Zillow or eBay, who spend tens of millions on ads, failing to invest in a robust SEO team is a missed opportunity, as the potential traffic from SEO can be comparable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Ethan Smith, CEO of Graphite, highlights that SEO is one of the most powerful yet least understood growth levers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:59">[01:00:02]</a>.

## When to Focus on SEO

Deciding when to invest in SEO involves assessing a company's market and current traction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.

### Key Attributes for SEO Growth

1.  **Large Addressable Market**: For most categories, the addressable market for SEO is significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. To assess this, one can look at product or audience competitors using tools like Similarweb. By inputting competitor domains, you can see their total traffic and traffic by channel, gaining a sense of potential reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. For example, a shopping site like Wish.com could look at Walmart or Wayfair's traffic to gauge its own potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. The idea is to understand the total addressable market that is already being served by search, and then estimate your potential share based on conversion rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>.

2.  **Existing Authority and Traction**: Google prioritizes credible domains over sites that appear to exist solely for SEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.
    *   **Non-SEO Traffic**: A key signal is non-SEO traffic (direct, paid, email, social). A company should ideally have at least 1,000 visits per day from non-SEO sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. This indicates that the brand has existing credibility and users are finding it through diverse channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>.
    *   **Referring Domains**: Look at the number of referring domains (websites linking to yours) using tools like Ahrefs or Semrush. Aim for at least 1,000 referring domains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. The more authority a site has, the easier and faster it can grow through SEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.

### Comparing with Other Channels
Before investing, it's crucial to compare SEO's potential impact and cost with other channels like paid advertising or social media. This helps prioritize where to allocate resources for the best return on investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:54">[00:22:54]</a>.

## How to Invest in SEO: Strategy & Operations

An [[key_elements_of_an_effective_seo_strategy | effective SEO strategy]] involves several key components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a>:

### Defining the Market and Page Types
1.  **Topics and Keywords**: Identify the relevant topics and keywords that align with the addressable market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:48">[00:23:48]</a>.
2.  **Page Types**: Determine the appropriate page types to target those keywords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:11">[00:24:11]</a>.
    *   **[[types_and_implementation_of_seo_programmatic_vs_editorial | Programmatic SEO]]**: Involves automatically generated pages from a database, such as product pages (eBay), address pages (Zillow), or user-generated content (UGC) pages (Glassdoor) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>. These can include category pages (grids or lists of items) and item pages (single products, addresses, videos) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>.
    *   **[[types_and_implementation_of_seo_programmatic_vs_editorial | Editorial SEO]]**: Refers to manually written content, such as articles, guides, or listicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>. This type of SEO has increasingly driven more traffic than programmatic SEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>. Examples include Masterclass's class-related content, BetterUp's career advice, NerdWallet's financial guides, and HubSpot's productivity articles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>.
    *   **Technical SEO**: Focuses on the site's underlying infrastructure, including internal link architecture, tags, redirects, and page speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>.

To determine the best page type, put target keywords into Google and observe the patterns of ranking pages. For example, if searching "how to poach an egg" consistently yields articles with recipes, an article page is likely the correct approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:58">[00:24:58]</a>. Similarly, identifying the common components of top-ranking pages (e.g., maps, phone numbers) helps inform product requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:42">[00:26:42]</a>. The goal is to provide genuinely useful content, rather than just optimizing for algorithms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:56">[00:27:56]</a>.

### The Shift from Keywords to Topics
Initially, SEO was keyword-based, with one page per keyword <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:58">[00:31:58]</a>. Today, Google's algorithm has evolved to understand semantics, targeting broader "topics" that encompass many related keywords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:31">[00:32:31]</a>. A single page can rank for 200 to 2,000 different keywords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:52">[00:32:52]</a>.

Thinking in terms of topics offers several advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:01">[00:33:01]</a>:
*   **Accurate Search Volume**: The true search volume for a topic (e.g., "best cameras") is often 10 times higher than for a single keyword variation (e.g., "best digital cameras") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:04">[00:33:04]</a>.
*   **Efficiency**: Avoids wasted resources by preventing the creation of multiple articles for semantically similar keywords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:46">[00:33:46]</a>.
*   **Comprehensive Intent Fulfillment**: Ensures content covers all subtopics relevant to a broader theme, improving content comprehensiveness and user engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:06">[00:34:06]</a>.

To define a topic, identify clusters of keywords for which the search results are consistently similar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:58">[01:13:58]</a>. The highest search volume keyword often becomes the topic's label. To identify adjacent topics, think of hierarchical relationships (e.g., in food, "jello shots" relate to "alcoholic drinks," then "drinks," then "food") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:55">[01:14:55]</a>. Google itself dynamically generates these relationships by looking at co-occurrences on web pages and search refinements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:38">[01:15:38]</a>.

### Building Topical Authority
Google's ranking isn't just based on overall domain authority but increasingly on "topical authority" â€“ what a site is known for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:01">[01:09:01]</a>. This is influenced by links (anchor text), non-SEO traffic, social shares, and branded searches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:52">[01:09:52]</a>. For example, a recipe site gaining viral success for "jello shots" may see its entire domain benefit from related "vodka recipes" authority, even if those pages weren't directly linked from the viral post <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:29">[01:11:29]</a>. By focusing on adjacent topics where you have existing strength (e.g., Masterclass leveraging Gordon Ramsay's authority for specific food topics), even smaller companies can outrank larger competitors that lack that specific topical focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:20">[01:12:20]</a>.

### Operationalizing SEO
Once the strategy is defined, the operational aspects involve:
*   **Content Generation**: For programmatic SEO, this means building systems to automatically generate millions of pages from databases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:46">[00:29:46]</a>. For editorial SEO, it means producing high-quality, manually written articles. The goal is to generate 10-25 articles per month initially, then scale up to 100+ once positive leading indicators are observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:27">[00:57:27]</a>.
*   **Internal Link Architecture**: This is a crucial, often under-optimized lever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:18">[01:18:18]</a>. Pages with more internal links (links from within the same site) consistently get more traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:41">[01:17:41]</a>. Google crawls sites through links, and if pages aren't adequately linked (ideally 10+ internal links per page), they may not be regularly found and credited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:30">[01:18:30]</a>. This often reveals a power curve where a small percentage of pages receive most of the links <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:17">[01:20:17]</a>. Fixing this can lead to 25% or even 100% traffic increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:07">[01:22:07]</a>. Links should be placed within the body of the content, not just the footer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:47">[01:22:47]</a>.

### [[tools_and_techniques_for_seo_analysis_and_growth | Tools and Techniques for SEO Analysis and Growth]]

Essential tools include:
*   **Google Search Console**: Free tool for real traffic information and SERP tracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:58">[00:37:58]</a>.
*   **Clearscope**: Best for content analysis and scoring, helping identify content gaps and subtopics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:16">[00:38:16]</a>.
*   **Keyword Research Tools**: Ahrefs or Semrush are top choices for identifying keywords and competitor analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:41">[00:38:41]</a>.
*   **Screaming Frog**: A crawler useful for getting all URLs from competitor sites, auditing your own site for errors, and analyzing internal link coverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:24">[00:39:24]</a>.

### Timelines and Measuring Success
SEO results typically take 6 to 9 months to materialize, with faster results for sites with higher existing authority (e.g., Netflix can see changes in days, a new company might take a year) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:44">[00:40:44]</a>. Google tests new pages on less popular keywords to gauge engagement, and if engagement (click-through rate, time on page) is good, it will gradually rank the page higher for more competitive terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:13">[00:41:13]</a>.

Founders should look for leading indicators to determine if their SEO efforts are on the right track. This includes whether pages are beginning to rank (even at position #20 or lower) and showing signs of progress over time. If these early signals appear, it indicates an opportunity to scale the investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:30">[00:42:30]</a>. It's common for initial attempts to fail due to incorrect implementation, leading to false negatives, so perseverance and strategic adjustments are key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:41">[00:43:41]</a>.

### Hiring for SEO Success
The ideal hiring approach depends on the strategy and company stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:41">[00:45:41]</a>:
*   **[[programmatic_vs_editorial_seo | Programmatic SEO]]**: Requires a specialized "growth person with technical ability" who has experience building scalable systems and dealing with nuances like indexation logic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:50">[00:45:50]</a>. It's often more effective to look for individuals who have achieved significant SEO growth at less well-known companies, as they've likely overcome harder challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:05">[00:48:05]</a>. This role involves analyzing competitor sites, defining product requirements, clustering keywords, and working with engineers to build pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:18">[00:49:18]</a>.
*   **[[programmatic_vs_editorial_seo | Editorial SEO]]**: While it's easier to find talent, a good SEO manager for editorial content needs to focus on identifying the right topics and creating comprehensive outlines, rather than just writing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:40">[00:54:40]</a>. This role can often be filled by someone with strong content or editorial strategy skills who then learns SEO workflows and tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:52">[00:56:52]</a>. The smallest effective team would be one SEO person (manager) and one writer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:07">[00:59:07]</a>.

### Overcoming Blockers: Getting Things Done
A common issue in SEO is that many recommendations never get launched due to resource constraints or lack of executive buy-in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:27">[01:06:27]</a>.
*   **Product-Led SEO**: Integrating SEO within the product organization, rather than as a separate team, helps prioritize SEO changes as core product initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:10">[01:07:10]</a>.
*   **Demystifying SEO**: SEO can seem mysterious, making it harder to prioritize against more tangible projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:53">[01:07:53]</a>. Demonstrating the potential impact through data and leading indicators is crucial.
*   **Scope**: SEO efforts can be high-scope, requiring significant resources to achieve at scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:13">[01:08:13]</a>.

### [[shifts_in_seo_strategies_in_the_age_of_ai | SEO Transformations with the Rise of AI]]
While AI tools like GPT-3 can generate grammatically correct sentences that sound human, they often lack factual accuracy or underlying wisdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:25">[01:25:25]</a>. This makes AI-generated content risky, especially for sensitive topics like finance or health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:03">[01:27:03]</a>. AI is best used to assist in the SEO workflow by performing data analysis, clustering keywords, identifying subtopics, and extracting structure from data, allowing human experts to then craft factual and useful content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:33">[01:27:33]</a>.

## Next Steps for Companies Considering SEO

For a company looking to [[evaluating_seo_opportunities_for_businesses | evaluate SEO opportunities]], the first steps are:
1.  **Assess Addressable Market Size**: Determine if the market is large enough by analyzing product and audience competitors' traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:46">[01:28:46]</a>.
2.  **Evaluate Authority**: Check your current non-SEO traffic and number of referring domains to understand your existing traction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>.
3.  **Prioritize Against Other Channels**: Compare the potential impact and required investment of SEO with other growth initiatives to make an informed decision on resource allocation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:09">[01:29:09]</a>.

Ultimately, successful SEO is about being a "detective" to understand and reverse-engineer what Google values by observing top-ranking sites, then focusing on creating truly useful content that fulfills user intent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:02">[00:27:02]</a>. Engaging with other SEO professionals and learning from their experiences can also provide invaluable insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:50">[01:04:50]</a>.

Interviewers often use specific questions to understand a candidate's past behavior, how they've handled various situations, and what they've learned from those experiences. These [[effective_interviewing_and_candidate_selection | interview techniques]] are designed to reveal a candidate's self-awareness, problem-solving skills, and collaboration abilities.

## Assessing Self-Awareness and Introspection

Several [[interview_questions_for_candidates | interview questions]] aim to gauge a candidate's [[measuring_selfawareness_and_introspection_in_interviews | self-awareness]] and capacity for introspection:

*   **"To what do you attribute your success and you can't say luck?"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>
    *   **What to look for:** This question, favored by Aika deManos (former Head of Product at Roll, ex-PM at Stripe), helps assess [[measuring_selfawareness_and_introspection_in_interviews | self-awareness]] and curiosity, revealing how candidates reflect on their journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.
*   **"Fast forward three years, what's different about you then?"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>
    *   **What to look for:** Ben Williams (former VP Product at Snyk) uses this to find signals of humility and [[measuring_selfawareness_and_introspection_in_interviews | self-awareness]] regarding personal and professional growth, looking for candidates who are open about areas they need to develop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.
*   **"What would your siblings say about you?"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a> (or parents if no siblings)
    *   **What to look for:** Meelum Quan Burwitz (Head of Growth at Deel) seeks sincerity and [[measuring_selfawareness_and_introspection_in_interviews | self-awareness]]. An honest answer acknowledging flaws, rather than just positive traits, indicates humbleness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>.
*   **"Tell me something you did that worked out but not for the reason that you thought it would work," or "Tell me something you did that was a good decision that didn't work."** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>
    *   **What to look for:** IO Omalo (Chief Product Officer at Carbon Health) uses these questions to tease out introspection, seeking individuals who are reflective about their decisions and incorporate learnings into future actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>.
*   **Asking about a personal limitation:** Scott Belsky (Chief Strategy Officer at Adobe) likes to ask about something people have learned about themselves that reveals a limitation in how they work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>.
    *   **What to look for:** This tests introspection and whether the person can be open about their limits rather than blaming others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>.
*   **"Do you consider yourself lucky?"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>
    *   **What to look for:** This question can reveal insecurity if candidates decline to admit luck, as comfortable individuals typically acknowledge it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>.

## Navigating Challenges and Ambiguity

Interviewers want to see how candidates handle difficult or uncertain situations:

*   **"What's the hardest thing you've ever done?"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>
    *   **What to look for:** Jeff Charles (Head of Product at Ramp) asks this to understand what "hard" means to the candidate, how they overcame difficulty, and their agency in the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.
*   **"Describe to me a time when you're part of a controversial product decision."** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>
    *   **What to look for:** Yuki Yamashita (Chief Product Officer at Figma) looks for the ability to articulate conflict, understand both sides of an issue, and take on different perspectives in an even-keeled manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.
*   **Questions about navigating ambiguity:** Jae-Z (Head of Product at Webflow) focuses on how candidates navigate ambiguous situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.
    *   **What to look for:** Good answers involve putting structure and a clear path forward, seeking help and inputs, and setting milestones to evaluate progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.
*   **"Tell me about a time something went wrong."** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>
    *   **What to look for:** Paige Castello (Co-Head of Product Management at Asana) uses this to evaluate a candidate's mindset, how they discuss failure, and how they perceive themselves when things don't go well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>.

## Understanding Motivations and Values

Interviewers also use questions to uncover what truly drives a candidate:

*   **"Tell me what work you are most proud of."** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>
    *   **What to look for:** This shared favorite question among Katie Dill (Head of Design at Stripe), Ki Sarin (CEO of Linear), and Camille Hurst (Product Leader at Spotify) helps interviewers understand a candidate's taste, judgment, motivations, what they value, and what "good" work looks like to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.
*   **"Tell me about the diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging initiatives that you've recently personally been involved with."** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>
    *   **What to look for:** Ben Williams highlights this question, asked by a candidate, as a brilliant way to test the alignment of personal values with those of potential colleagues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>.
*   **"Tell me about a time that you delivered something that was impactful."** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:25">[00:19:25]</a>
    *   **What to look for:** Lauren Isford (Head of Growth at Notion) uses this to understand how candidates define impact and their intrinsic motivation for business impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>.

## Identifying Unique Perspectives and Curiosity

Some questions aim to uncover a candidate's originality and inherent curiosity:

*   **"What unfair secrets have you learned to improve the velocity and energy level of a product?"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>
    *   **What to look for:** Noah Weiss (Chief Product Officer at Slack) seeks non-obvious, practical learnings and how they are applied, often leading to interesting inspirations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.
*   **"What's something that everyone takes for granted that you think is essentially hogwash or inaccurate?"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>
    *   **What to look for:** Nel Singal (VP of Product at Facebook) uses this question to break the "interview mindset" and test for authenticity and genuine, opinionated responses, as it's difficult to answer without being truthful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>.
*   **General Curiosity:** Ben Williams also emphasizes looking for curiosity throughout the interview, noting that good PMs ask "why" constantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>.

## Hypothetical Problem-Solving

While not strictly behavioral, some hypothetical questions reveal problem-solving approaches:

*   **The Teleportation Device Problem:** "A group of scientists have invented a teleportation device. They've hired you... to bring this to market. What do you do?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a> This often leads candidates to ask many questions. The follow-up is: "They've decided that they will answer only two of your questions. After that, they expect a plan. What two questions do you ask?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>
    *   **What to look for:** Shashir Marocha (CEO and co-founder of Coda) uses this to identify individuals who can quickly pinpoint the most impactful questions (e.g., "Is it safe enough for humans?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a> and "Is it more expensive capex or Opex?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>). This reveals strategic thinking and the ability to simplify complex problems to their core <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

## Reference Calls

For post-[[effective_interviewing_and_candidate_selection | interview]] validation, Paul Adams (Chief Product Officer at Intercom) suggests a killer reference call question:

*   **"What feedback will I be giving this person in their first performance review?"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>
    *   **What to look for:** This question is effective because it forces the referee to provide honest, specific feedback, rather than just praise, revealing potential growth areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:15">[00:20:15]</a>.

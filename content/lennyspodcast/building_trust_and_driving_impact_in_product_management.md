In the realm of [[role_of_product_managers | product management]], two attributes consistently separate top performers: the relentless pursuit of impact and the cultivation of trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:10">[01:03:10]</a>. These qualities are not only crucial for individual career growth but also for the overall success of a product and its business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>.

## Driving Impact as a Guiding Principle

Being driven by impact means consistently waking up every day trying to have the biggest impact possible for your business, rather than focusing solely on career advancement or organizational politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:18">[01:14:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:38">[01:25:38]</a>. This focus on maximizing business outcomes will naturally lead to greater success and promotion opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:27">[01:25:27]</a>.

### For New Product Managers
For new [[role_of_product_managers | Product Managers]], impact is often tied to specific projects or features they are tasked to ship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:09">[01:09:09]</a>. While they might not be given much latitude to define the roadmap, choosing to work on "offense" projects that directly drive revenue or customer growth can significantly contribute to perceived impact and career trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:30">[01:28:30]</a>. The most important skills for new [[role_of_product_managers | PMs]] are to [[improving_product_management_skills | communicate]], prioritize, and execute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:07">[01:15:07]</a>.

### For Senior Product Managers
As [[getting_into_and_growing_in_product_management | product managers]] grow more senior, the expectation for driving impact intensifies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:34">[01:27:34]</a>. Senior [[role_of_product_managers | PMs]] should seek opportunities to influence prioritization and roadmaps, always asking if an idea or solution could be bigger and more impactful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:26">[01:27:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:25">[01:23:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:02">[01:24:02]</a>. This means thinking like a general manager (GM) of the product, taking a wider view of what success entails beyond just product or tech, and identifying constraints or barriers to success regardless of which function "owns" them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:17">[01:30:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:51">[01:30:51]</a>.

## Earning Trust as a Product Manager

Trust is the "currency" of a [[role_of_product_managers | product manager]] and [[getting_into_and_growing_in_product_management | product leader]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:30">[01:13:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:06">[01:24:06]</a>. Without trust, it becomes challenging to secure resources, gain influence, or advance in one's career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:19">[01:24:19]</a>.

### Building Trust
Trust is built by consistently setting and meeting expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:38">[01:24:38]</a>. Key practices include:
*   **Honesty**: Telling the truth without fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:01">[01:25:01]</a>.
*   **Delivery**: Launching products when promised and with the features committed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:03">[01:25:03]</a>.
*   **Accountability**: Owning mistakes and learning from them rather than repeating them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:06">[01:25:06]</a>.
*   **Forecasting and Validation**: Successfully forecasting outcomes, setting goals, hitting them, and then measuring and validating results to build instincts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:08">[01:10:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:50">[01:24:50]</a>.
*   **Understanding Others**: Taking time to understand the goals of other individuals and organizations, and striving for alignment rather than simply pushing one's own agenda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:58">[01:33:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:04">[01:34:04]</a>.

### Eroding Trust
Behaviors that can erode trust include lying, being evasive, failing to ship committed products, or ignoring and repeating mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:11">[01:25:11]</a>.

### Personal Reflection on Trust
Reflecting on his time at Airbnb, Ian McAllister shared a valuable [[challenges_and_strategies_in_product_management | lesson]] about trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:28">[01:38:28]</a>. While focused on building out a customer support technology platform with his team, he realized he could have spent more time truly partnering with and building support from the customer support leadership team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:02">[01:35:02]</a>. He learned that even if a chosen approach is correct, it may not be executed effectively without forging strong alliances and gaining the support of key stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:24">[01:36:24]</a>. This highlights the importance of mitigating the risk that even the "right product in the right direction" might not succeed without the necessary organizational backing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:50">[01:36:50]</a>. This continuous improvement mindset, including self-awareness about what could have gone better, is vital for building this muscle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:10">[01:37:10]</a>.

Ultimately, these core skills are foundational for [[improving_product_management_skills | improving product management skills]] and achieving leadership in the field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:33">[01:13:33]</a>.

From: [[lennyspodcast]] <br/> 

Katie Dill, Head of Design at Stripe, has built and led design teams at three hypergrowth companies: Lyft, [[indepth_product_management_at_airbnb | Airbnb]], and Stripe. Her roles have encompassed product design, brand and marketing creative, web presence, user research, content strategy, and design operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:33">[00:57:33]</a>. She has seen teams scale at least 10x in two of these companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:23">[01:15:23]</a>, which are recognized for having some of the best design products globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:23">[01:22:23]</a>.

## The Importance of Beauty and Quality in Design

The concept of "beauty" in products has seen a dramatic decrease in usage in digitized books since the 1800s, aligning with a focus solely on functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. However, Katie Dill argues that beauty is not opposite to functionality; instead, it enhances it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:45">[00:22:45]</a>.
*   **Enhanced Functionality**: Beauty makes products easier to use, more approachable, and more compelling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:51">[00:22:51]</a>. There is objectivity to how beauty enhances things, as wide audiences often prefer the same design versions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>.
*   **Increased Trust**: Beautiful design signals that painstaking detail and care have been put into the product, assuring users that even unseen details are considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>.
*   **Emotional Impact**: Products that are well-designed evoke positive feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>. An example comparing user tweets from Penn Station (negative) versus Grand Central Station (positive) illustrates how the environment impacts user sentiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>.
*   **Growth Driver**: Quality **is** growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>. Making a product easier to use and more understandable drives adoption and positive word-of-mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>. For example, at Stripe, improved onboarding flows due to design quality increased activations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.
*   **Business Impact**: Stripe's focus on improving the checkout experience, which is used by millions of businesses including Amazon, Shopify, and Spotify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>, led to a 10.5% increase in business revenue by fixing quality issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>. This demonstrates how small design details can have a material impact on revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>.
*   **Talent Attraction**: Quality and beauty foster pride, attracting more people who want their craft recognized and utilized in impactful ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.

## Operationalizing Quality and Design

Katie Dill shares several strategies for [[building_highfunctioning_design_teams | operationalizing quality]] and great design:

### Overcoming Gravitational Pull to Mediocrity
It's easy for products to regress in quality over time, especially as new features are added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>. Organizations often focus on specific business areas, leading to specialized teams that may neglect how their part fits into the larger user journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>.

### Key Principles for Building Quality
1.  **Group Effort**: Quality is a collective responsibility, not just for one person or a QA team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. Internal communication and standards reflect in external product quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.
2.  **Vision and Alignment**: Even talented individuals need a shared vision to ensure their contributions fit together as a cohesive whole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. The analogy of building a house with an architect and general contractor highlights the need for a unified plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>.
3.  **Editing and Courage**: Leaders must have the resolve to say "no, this isn't good enough" even when teams have put in significant effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>. This "almost but no" decision is crucial for achieving excellence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>.
4.  **User Perspective**: Truly understanding quality requires empathy for the user's end-to-end experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>.

### "Walk the Store" Program at Stripe
To address quality regression and organizational silos, Stripe implemented a "Walk the Store" program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>:
*   **Focus Areas**: They identified 15 critical user journeys that deeply matter to users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>.
*   **Ownership**: Each journey has dedicated engineering, product, and design leaders responsible for its quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>.
*   **Regular Review**: Leaders regularly "walk the store" by experiencing the product as a user, starting from internet searches and navigating through different touchpoints (website, docs, dashboard) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>.
*   **Friction Logging**: They log friction points, note what's working or not, file bugs, and reach out to relevant teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>.
*   **Scoring and Calibration**: Journeys are scored based on a rubric covering usability, utility, desirability, and surprising delight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:00">[04:19:00]</a>. Scores are qualitative (color-based) rather than numerical to avoid overthinking subjective measurements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>. Leaders calibrate these scores in "PQR" (Product Quality Review) meetings to ensure consistent understanding of the quality bar across the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>.
*   **Benefits**: This process increases awareness and accountability, identifies upstream opportunities, and fosters empathy across disciplines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>. It leads to better business outcomes by reducing support cases and improving conversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.

### Website Design and Co-creation
The [[stripes_approach_to_product_development_and_cocreation | Stripe website]] is a product of meticulous care, blending art and science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. The web team consists of design, engineering, product partners, and product marketing working in close proximity, enabling rapid iteration and leveraging each other's expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. This collaborative model is critical for achieving high standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>.

## [[leadership_and_communication_in_tech | Leadership and Team Building Lessons]]

Katie Dill emphasizes several key [[lessons_in_hiring_and_team_building | lessons in hiring and team building]]:

*   **Performance = Potential - Interference**: This formula guides her [[leadership and communication in tech | leadership approach]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>. Leaders should focus on increasing team potential (through hiring and development) and decreasing interferences (obstacles hindering great work) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>.
*   **Decreasing Interferences: Co-location and Alignment**: At Lyft, Katie encountered a design team physically separated from engineering and product by a locked door <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:19">[01:02:19]</a>. This led to wasted work and misalignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:18">[01:03:18]</a>. Her solution was to co-locate designers with their respective engineering and product teams (e.g., driver, rider, safety teams) while maintaining separate creative spaces for crit and working sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:07">[01:04:07]</a>. This change reduced interference, leading to faster iteration cycles and better clarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:08">[01:06:08]</a>.
*   **Improving Awareness**: To combat the loss of touch between growing teams, design teams at Airbnb and Stripe regularly share screenshots or prototypes of their work in a shared Google Slide deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>. This visual communication helps all designers and leaders (product, engineering) understand what's being built across the organization, identify overlaps, and ensure pieces fit together like a journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>. While designers might prefer Figma, a low-maintenance format like slides ensures accessibility for all functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>.
*   **Fighting the Fear of Bold Ideas**: Companies often default to incremental changes because they are easier to measure and feel safer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:01">[01:08:01]</a>. However, this approach is unlikely to make the "whole thing better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:55">[01:08:55]</a>. Instead, leaders should "reach for the stars and land on the Moon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:02">[01:09:02]</a>. This means investing in "vision work" that sketches out the ideal, comprehensive experience, even if the full solution isn't shipped at once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:06">[01:09:06]</a>. This North Star guides measured, thoughtful progress and inspires teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:40">[01:10:40]</a>.

## [[lessons_in_hiring_and_team_building | Hiring Design Talent]]

When hiring designers, prioritize these qualities:
*   **Taste and Character**: It's easier to teach tools and processes than to teach great taste and character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:28">[01:12:28]</a>. Look for a natural inclination towards great things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.
*   **Humility**: Great talent combined with humility ensures respect, empathy, and an eagerness to learn from users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:57">[01:15:57]</a>.
*   **Hustle/Chutzpah**: Design involves the "scary act of creation" and the courage to fight for excellence, even if it means redoing work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>. Look for individuals who will rapidly execute on that vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:15">[01:17:15]</a>.
*   **Startup Hiring**: For early-stage companies, while a "doer" is essential, it's also important to have a strategic, user-focused lens from the start. Consider a senior design advisor alongside a full-time executor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:28">[01:18:28]</a>.

## Design as Intention

At its core, design is about bringing intentionality to decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:39">[01:51:39]</a>. This applies to anything, from designing a doorknob (considering push/pull, comfort, manufacturing ease) to structuring an organization or defining a strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>. By thinking about who is impacted and used, anyone in any function can bring more care and intentionality, leading to better outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>.

### Stripe Press: A Manifestation of Design Philosophy
Stripe Press, which publishes books on "ideas of progress" that are not always directly related to financial infrastructure, showcases Stripe's commitment to creativity and excellence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. These books embody the identity and care Stripe puts into its work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>. The website for *Poor Charlie's Almanac*, in particular, is a testament to the seamless collaboration between design and engineering, creating a highly engaging and unique experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.

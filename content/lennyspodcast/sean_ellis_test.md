The [[Sean Ellis Test]] (sometimes called the Product-Market Fit test) is a seemingly simple yet profoundly impactful idea for the startup world, designed to help companies understand if their product is a "must-have" for users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

## What is the Sean Ellis Test?

The test centers around a single, crucial question posed to users: "How would you feel if you could no longer use this product?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:10">[00:36:10]</a>. Users are given several response options:
*   Very disappointed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>
*   Somewhat disappointed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>
*   Not disappointed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>
*   Not applicable (I've already stopped using the product) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>

The goal is to identify the percentage of users who would be "very disappointed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. Historically, products where a high enough percentage of users (typically 40% or more) selected "very disappointed" tended to perform well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. Conversely, products with low scores tended to struggle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

### Origin Story
Sean Ellis developed this question because he wanted a filter to differentiate valuable customer feedback from less critical input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:29">[00:27:29]</a>. He initially used a standard satisfaction question but found it yielded lukewarm responses, especially from senior management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:34">[00:28:34]</a>. By flipping the question to focus on disappointment if the product were gone, he believed he could elicit a more honest and impactful answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:19">[00:29:19]</a>.

The 40% benchmark emerged from observing patterns across numerous Silicon Valley startups, particularly YC companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. This threshold serves as a "leading indicator" of product-market fit, helping teams decide when to aggressively focus on growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>.

## When to Use the Test and Interpret Results

The [[Sean Ellis Test]] is a leading indicator of product-market fit, meaning it can provide early insights before extensive retention data is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>. Retention cohorts are considered the "lagging indicator" or ultimate test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>.

### Ideal Timing and Sample
It's recommended to survey a random sample of users who have:
1.  **Really used the product:** They didn't just sign up but have engaged beyond initial steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:30">[00:44:30]</a>.
2.  **Hit an "activation moment":** Used the product two or more times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:47">[00:47:47]</a>.
3.  **Used it recently:** Within the last week or two, ensuring they haven't churned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:08">[00:48:08]</a>.

A minimum of 30 responses is suggested for a reliable sample size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:53">[00:53:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:53">[00:53:53]</a>.

### Interpreting Scores
*   **Below 40%:** Indicates a lack of strong product-market fit. This doesn't mean failure, but rather a need to refine the product or its positioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:22">[00:40:22]</a>.
*   **At or above 40%:** A strong signal that the product resonates with a significant segment of users. It suggests the business has a valuable core that can be scaled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:31">[00:31:31]</a>.

The 40% threshold is a guideline, not a rigid rule. Cultural differences can influence scores (e.g., Brazilians might be more optimistic, leading to a higher target like Nubank's 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:22">[00:27:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:54">[00:27:54]</a>). The main purpose of the target is to provide a clear objective for the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a>.

## Leveraging the Test for Growth

The true power of the [[Sean Ellis Test]] lies not just in the score, but in the deeper qualitative insights it provides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.

### Digging Deeper into "Very Disappointed" Users
When a product receives a low "very disappointed" score (e.g., 7% to 15%), the focus should be on understanding *why* the small segment of highly satisfied users loves the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:31">[00:40:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>.
1.  **Identify Primary Benefit:** Use an open-ended survey question to ask, "What is the primary benefit that you get?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:12">[00:44:12]</a>.
2.  **Categorize Benefits:** Turn common open-ended responses into a multiple-choice question for a new survey, forcing users to select one distinctive benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:27">[00:44:27]</a>.
3.  **Understand "Why":** For the selected benefit, ask, "Why is that benefit important to you?" This reveals the underlying context and pain points (e.g., for Zenbe, users were "drowning in email" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>).

This deep understanding allows companies to:
*   **Refine Positioning:** Align marketing and messaging with the core value proposition that resonates most strongly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.
*   **Streamline Onboarding:** Design the initial user experience to deliver the "must-have" value quickly (speed to value) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.
*   **Inform Product Roadmap:** Double down on features important to must-have customers, and potentially cut features that dilute the core value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>.
*   **Target Acquisition:** Focus campaigns on users who have the identified need and are likely to value the must-have benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>.

### The "Somewhat Disappointed" Fallacy
Sean Ellis advises to generally "ignore the people who say they'd be somewhat disappointed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>. These users are essentially signaling the product is a "nice-to-have" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:28">[00:28:28]</a>. Focusing on their feedback and tweaking the product based on it risks diluting the experience for "must-have" users, making the product "good for everyone but not great for anyone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:01">[00:42:01]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Superhuman's Refinement
> The Superhuman team found a nuanced approach: they identified the core benefit for "must-have" users, then asked "somewhat disappointed" users who also valued that *same* benefit what they needed for the product to become a "must-have" for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:25">[00:42:25]</a>. This approach allowed them to expand their "must-have" base without diluting the core experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:50">[00:42:50]</a>.

### Limitations
*   **One-off Products:** The test may not be suitable for products that are consumed once (e.g., a movie, a workshop) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:13">[00:24:13]</a>. For such products, a Net Promoter Score (NPS) might be more appropriate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:36">[00:24:36]</a>.
*   **Investment/Switching Costs:** A high score can sometimes be influenced by the user's significant investment in the product (e.g., building a website, setting up an event), rather than pure utility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:50">[00:49:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:30">[00:53:30]</a>. While still valuable, it's important to understand the drivers behind the "disappointment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:30">[00:53:30]</a>.
*   **Market Size:** A high percentage of "very disappointed" users doesn't guarantee a massive market. The highly loyal group might be small, necessitating a strategic decision on targeting a niche or broadening appeal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:01">[00:55:01]</a>. Sean Ellis prefers a more passionate, niche customer base for long-term success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:48">[00:55:48]</a>.

## Impact on Growth Strategy

The [[Sean Ellis Test]] and the insights it provides are foundational for building sustainable growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:56">[00:45:56]</a>. The core strategy is to get as many of the *right* people to experience the product in a way that makes it a "must-have" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:47">[00:48:47]</a>.

### Growth Priority Order
Sean Ellis advocates for a specific order of focus when growing a product that has achieved product-market fit:
1.  **Activation/Onboarding:** This is the most critical starting point, as users are at the highest risk of churn at this stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:03">[00:51:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:59">[00:53:59]</a>. The goal is to quickly guide users to their "aha moment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:14">[00:54:14]</a>.
    *   **Example: LogMeIn:** By focusing engineering, product, and marketing on improving signup-to-usage rate, LogMeIn increased it by 1,000% (from 5% to 50%) in three months. This made previously unprofitable acquisition channels viable, scaling from $10,000/month to $1 million/month in profitable spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:24">[00:55:24]</a>.
    *   **Tactics for Activation:**
        *   **Deeply Understand Obstacles:** Ask users *why* they aren't progressing in the onboarding flow (e.g., "Why didn't you download the software?"). This qualitative insight informs solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:02">[00:58:02]</a>.
        *   **Increase Desire & Reduce Friction:** Continuously remind users of the benefits they will gain, and simplify the path to experiencing that value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:36">[01:01:36]</a>.
        *   **Define an Activation Metric:** Choose an experience-based metric that can be achieved early in the user journey (e.g., in the first session or day), correlating to long-term retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>.
2.  **Engagement:** How to keep users coming back and using the product regularly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:35">[00:51:35]</a>.
3.  **Referral:** Activating existing users to bring in new ones, especially powerful if organic word-of-mouth already exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:35">[00:51:35]</a>.
    *   **Example: Dropbox:** The successful referral program was an accelerator for an already strong word-of-mouth product, rather than a fix for a lack of sharing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:58">[01:14:58]</a>.
4.  **Monetization/Revenue Model:** Ensuring the business can profitably generate revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:39">[00:51:39]</a>.
5.  **Customer Acquisition (Top-of-Funnel Growth):** Only after the internal "growth engine" (activation, engagement, referral, monetization) is efficient should companies aggressively invest in broader acquisition channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:41">[00:51:41]</a>.

### Northstar Metric
A critical step is defining a Northstar metric that captures "units of value being delivered" to the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:53">[00:49:53]</a>. This metric should:
*   Reflect the must-have value identified through the [[Sean Ellis Test]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:51">[01:19:51]</a>.
*   Be an aggregate number that can go "up and to the right" over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:40">[01:20:40]</a>.
*   Correlate to revenue growth, but not *be* revenue itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:46">[01:20:46]</a>. (e.g., for Airbnb, "nights booked" instead of revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:39">[01:22:39]</a>; for Amazon, "monthly purchases" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:32">[01:21:32]</a>).
*   Ideally, include a time component (e.g., daily active users, weekly rides) to encourage engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:25">[01:23:25]</a>.

### Customer Feedback
A key to effective growth is consistently talking to customers and using qualitative insights to inform experiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:16">[01:10:16]</a>. Asking questions like "How did you find this product?" and "How do you typically find products like this?" can reveal crucial acquisition opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:19">[01:10:19]</a>. This blend of [[customer_interviewing_techniques | qualitative research]] and quantitative analysis leads to much better experiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:16">[01:12:16]</a>.

### ICE Prioritization Framework
Sean Ellis also developed the ICE prioritization framework (Impact, Confidence, Effort) to help teams choose which experiments to run first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:12">[01:21:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:19">[01:27:19]</a>. Its simplicity allows for quick comparison of ideas and fosters broader team participation in suggesting growth initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:59">[01:28:59]</a>.

## Conclusion

The [[Sean Ellis Test]] provides a powerful framework for understanding product-market fit and guiding growth strategy. By focusing on the "very disappointed" users, deeply understanding their needs, and systematically optimizing the entire user journey from activation to monetization, companies can build sustainable growth engines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:45">[01:41:45]</a>. The core insight remains: asking the right question at the right time is paramount to uncovering growth opportunities and overcoming challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:14">[01:33:14]</a>.

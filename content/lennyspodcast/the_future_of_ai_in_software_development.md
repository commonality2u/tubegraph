The future of software development, particularly with the advent of AI, is envisioned as a significant shift from traditional coding practices towards a more intent-driven, high-level approach. This transformation aims to create a world "after code" where engineers operate more as "logic designers" rather than solely as coders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## A World After Code

Michael Tru, co-founder and CEO of Any Sphere (the company behind Cursor), believes the goal is to invent a new type of programming, a very different way to build software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This future involves engineers specifying their intent for how everything should work, moving beyond the meticulous details of current programming languages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The vision is a process distilled into describing intent to the computer in the most concise way possible, defining how software should work and look <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. This method is expected to be "legions higher level and more productive," and in some cases, more accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

### Contrasting Visions

Michael identifies two popular but, in his view, problematic visions for the future of software development:
1.  **Status Quo:** Some believe software building will remain largely the same, focusing on text editing formal programming languages like TypeScript, Go, C, and Rust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. However, this view is considered "wrong" because technology will "get much much much better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.
2.  **Chatbot-style Interaction:** Others imagine simply typing requests into a bot, akin to a chatbot or Slackbot, asking it to build or change something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. This approach is problematic due to a lack of precision, which limits human control over the software's appearance and functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

### Michael's Alternative Vision

Instead, the future is likely to look "weirder than both" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. It will involve a representation of software logic that resembles English, perhaps in a "doctrine form" or an "evolution of programming language towards pseudocode" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. This "much terser and easier to navigate" representation will replace impenetrable millions of lines of code, making it more human-readable and human-editable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.

This shift means people will move away from thinking in specific coding languages like JavaScript or Python <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. The human will remain in the "driver's seat," maintaining significant control over all aspects of the software and having the ability to make changes very quickly with a "fast duration loop" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

## Evolving Roles and Skills in Software Development

The transition to an AI-powered software development paradigm will redefine the skills and roles of professionals.

### The Role of an Engineer

*   **Logic Designer:** Being an engineer will increasingly feel like being a "logic designer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. The focus will shift from the "how" of implementation to the "what" of desired functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.
*   **Emphasis on Taste:** "Taste" will become increasingly valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. While this includes visual design (UI/UX), it extends to the "logic of and how the thing works" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. Taste, in this context, means "having the right idea for what should be built" and effortlessly translating that vision into a functional and aesthetic product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.
*   **Less Careful, More Creative:** Software engineers will be able to be "less careful," moving from meticulousness towards taste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. This contrasts with current "vibe coding," where generating code without understanding details can lead to limitations and unmanageable outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. The goal is to provide continued human control over details even when not fully understanding the underlying code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.

### Impact on Product Development Roles

The speaker describes a future where, with the rise of AI engineers, humans might become "engineering managers with a lot of reports that are just like not that not that smart," requiring extensive reviewing, approving, and specifying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:46">[00:22:46]</a>. However, successful users of AI tools today "chop things up" into smaller tasks, allowing for frequent specification, work, and review cycles, which makes the process more manageable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:08">[00:24:08]</a>.

## The Role of AI in Software Development Tools

Tools like Cursor are at the forefront of changing how engineers and product teams build software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:07">[01:06:07]</a>. Cursor, an [[role_of_ai_in_software_development | AI code editor]], was developed by focusing on the eventual maturity of AI technology and the deep transformation it would bring to knowledge work, specifically software development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:15">[01:14:15]</a>.

### Architectural Approach: IDE vs. Agent vs. Model

Cursor's creators deliberately chose the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) path over solely focusing on AI agents or models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>.
*   **Human Control in IDE:** The decision was driven by a commitment to giving humans "control over all the decisions" in the end tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>, contrasting with visions of full AI automation where the AI makes all decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>.
*   **Realism about AI Limitations:** A "intense realist" view of current AI technology, despite excitement for its future, confirmed that "the AI cannot do everything" and humans need to remain in the driver's seat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>.
*   **Beyond Plugins:** Building a full IDE, rather than just a plugin for existing environments, was deemed necessary because the "act of programming is going to change a lot" and existing environments have "limited extensibility" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:49">[00:20:49]</a>. Control over the entire application is crucial if the UI and form factor of programming are expected to change significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>.
*   **Flexibility with Agents:** While an IDE is central, the future may involve the ability to "move between all of these things fairly effortlessly," including AI agents spinning off work and then being pulled back into the human-controlled environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>. Background tasks, like bug fixes, are especially suited for AI agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>.

### Custom Models and the Ensemble Approach

Contrary to initial expectations of relying solely on external models, Cursor does "a ton of model development" internally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:10">[00:33:10]</a>. "Every magic moment in Cursor involves a custom model in some way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:22">[00:23:22]</a>.

*   **Complementing Foundation Models:** Cursor uses a "ensemble of models" approach, leveraging large generative models (like GPT, Claude, Gemini) for their capabilities but also developing custom models for specific tasks where foundation models are too slow, costly, or not specialized enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:45">[00:37:45]</a>.
*   **Autocomplete Example:** A core part of Cursor is a "souped-up autocomplete experience" that predicts the next actions across multiple files, often hours of work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:32">[00:35:32]</a>. This requires custom models to be extremely fast (300ms completion) and cost-effective, specialized for completing "series of diffs" rather than generic text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:45">[00:35:45]</a>.
*   **Input/Output Layer Models:** Smaller, specialty models also assist the larger foundation models:
    *   **Input Side:** Models search through codebases to find relevant parts to show big models, acting like a "mini Google search" for code context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:46">[00:36:46]</a>.
    *   **Output Side:** After big models suggest high-level changes, smaller, incredibly fast models "fill in the details," turning sketches into full code diffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:03">[00:37:03]</a>.

This dual approach, combining open-source models with internal fine-tuning or custom development, helps push product quality and speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:01">[00:38:01]</a>.

## Market Dynamics and Future Outlook

The AI-powered software development market is unique, with parallels to the early internet (search engines) or personal computer development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:46">[00:39:46]</a>.

*   **Defensibility:** The "moat" or defensibility in this space is less about lock-in (like traditional enterprise software) and more about consistently building the "best thing possible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:41:00]</a>. The "ceiling is incredibly high," meaning there's a long way to go in terms of useful innovation, rewarding sustained R&D <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:05">[00:40:05]</a>.
*   **Market Size:** The market for these tools is "really, really big," far larger than past markets for developer tools because AI enables automation of vast amounts of busy knowledge work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:03">[00:43:03]</a>.
*   **"General Tool" Winner:** While there will be many specialized solutions, Michael predicts "one company that builds the general tool that builds almost all the world's software," which will be a "generationally big business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:38">[00:43:38]</a>.
*   **Incumbent Disadvantage:** This market is "not super friendly to incumbents" because users can easily switch to more innovative products, and there's less incentive to buy bundled, commoditized solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:06">[00:45:06]</a>.

## Misconceptions and Long-Term Impact

A common misunderstanding is the pace of change: people are "occupied too much either end of a spectrum" – either expecting it to happen very fast or dismissing it as hype <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:48">[01:02:48]</a>.

*   **Consequential but Gradual:** [[impact_of_ai_on_software_development_and_deployment | AI]] is a "technology shift that's going to be incredibly consequential" – more so than the internet or any tech shift since computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:06">[01:03:06]</a>. However, it will take "decades" to unfold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:18">[01:03:18]</a>.
*   **Continued Need for Engineers:** Despite AI writing code, there will be "more demand for engineers" in the long future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:50">[01:08:50]</a>. [[impact_of_ai_on_developer_productivity | AI]] will enable engineers to "do much more," addressing the vast, unmet demand for software that is currently too expensive and labor-intensive to build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:24">[01:07:24]</a>. The "physics of working on computers are so great" that much more can be done once the current friction is removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:30">[01:08:30]</a>.
*   **Integration of AI in Business and Product Development:** Companies that succeed will integrate [[integration_of_ai_in_business_and_product_development | AI]] by both building underlying technology (integrating best parts from providers, sometimes in-house) and developing the product experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:13">[01:04:13]</a>. These companies will not only provide value but also push the technology forward as they scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:41">[01:04:41]</a>. This highlights the [[role_of_ai_in_enhancing_and_transforming_software_development | role of AI in enhancing and transforming software development]].

The long-term [[future_of_ai_in_consumer_and_enterprise_applications | future of AI]] lies in its ability to automate busy knowledge work, transforming various fields to be much higher-leverage and more productive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:03">[01:03:03]</a>. This emphasizes the profound [[impact of AI on coding practices and developer productivity | impact of AI on coding practices and developer productivity]].

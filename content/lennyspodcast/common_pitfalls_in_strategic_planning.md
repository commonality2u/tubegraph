Many approaches to strategy fall into common pitfalls that prevent effective execution. Understanding these traps is crucial for developing a truly effective strategy.

## What Not to Call a Strategy
Instead of calling it a strategy, it's often more productive to call it an "action agenda" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This emphasizes concrete steps over abstract concepts.

## Misconceptions About Strategy Prerequisites
A common misconception is that a mission, vision, and values must be in place before a strategy can be developed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This is not true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:03">[00:59:03]</a>. While these elements are part of a different "literary form" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:45">[00:58:45]</a>, they are not prerequisites for strategic thinking.

## Signs of a Bad or Non-Existent Strategy
Richard Rumelt, author of "Good Strategy Bad Strategy" and "The Crux," outlines several characteristics of bad strategy:

### Lack of a Clear Diagnosis
A significant pitfall is the absence of a clear diagnosis of the situation or the core problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>.
*   **Stating ambition as strategy** It's not a strategy to simply say, "Our diagnosis is that we haven't grown fast" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>. This is merely a statement of values or ambition, not an understanding of *what's holding you back* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>.
*   **Avoiding the "Why"** An example is the strategy for U.S. intelligence agencies stating they should "work together more effectively" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>. This identifies a problem (lack of coordination) but fails to diagnose *why* it's hard to coordinate or what the barriers are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>.
*   **Jumping to solutions without understanding** Similarly, a president identifying that the U.S. is "falling behind in education" (a correct statement based on test scores) and immediately concluding "therefore we're going to have more people go to college" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:21:26]</a>, misses the diagnosis of *why* students are falling behind in elementary math <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:11">[00:22:11]</a>.
*   **Unresolved arguments over diagnosis** In organizations and public policy, there are often disagreements about the root cause of a problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a>. A strategy cannot move forward unless these arguments are resolved and a decision is made on the diagnosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:37">[00:23:37]</a>.

### Fluff and Word Salad
Bad strategies often use fancy words or "word salad" to describe their situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>. This abstract language may seem "strategic" but lacks concrete meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:49">[00:20:49]</a>.

### Incoherent Actions
A strategy requires coherent actions; that is, actions that align with the diagnosis and don't contradict each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. For example, simultaneously aiming to burn less oil and import more oil doesn't make sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>. Many companies have strategic goals like increasing both growth and profit, which can often battle each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.

### Mistaking Goals for Strategy
A common pitfall is to present a list of performance or profit goals as a strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>. Goals are important for company operations, but abstract, high-level goals are not a strategy; they are ambitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>. A list of things you wish would happen is also not strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>.

### Lack of Focus (Too Many Priorities)
An effective strategy requires focus. Trying to do too many different things at once leads to diffusion of effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:14">[00:25:14]</a>.
*   **The "Lottery List"**: Having "17 priorities" is the opposite of a coherent policy; it's a "lottery list" of all the things an organization wishes would happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. The word "priority" means the first thing, not a grab bag of everything that might matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.
*   **Consequences of diffusion**: In large organizations, different interests can lead to a diffusion of effort, making it hard to focus energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:56">[00:27:56]</a>. This was seen in U.S. efforts in Afghanistan, where multiple, sometimes conflicting, objectives led to ineffective outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00">[00:45:00]</a>.
*   **"Saying yes" too often**: Each time an organization says "yes" to another initiative, it risks turning a nascent good strategy into a bad one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:23">[00:25:23]</a>.

### Organizational Dynamics and Politics
Even with a clear strategy, organizational dynamics and politics can be major hindrances to successful execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:45">[01:10:45]</a>.
*   **Diversity of interests**: Inside organizations, people have different opinions and private interests that may not align with the overarching goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:10">[01:11:10]</a>. Information often comes with an agenda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:25">[01:13:25]</a>.
*   **Fear of action and changing power relationships**: Implementing a strategy involves people changing what they do and can alter power relationships within the organization, which can be "heavy stuff" and lead to hesitancy from leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:55">[01:15:55]</a>.
*   **Lack of a "decider"**: Organizations need a mechanism for deciding what actions to take. A clear hierarchy of power is often necessary because someone, in the end, has to make choices and tell people what to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:24">[01:16:24]</a>.
*   **Displaced by "leadership" literature**: The focus on "leadership" and self-perfection, as opposed to direct management and decision-making, can displace the necessary authoritative choices required for strategy implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:30">[01:17:30]</a>.

## Strategy in Startups: Dealing with Uncertainty
For startups, especially pre-product market fit, the strategy involves dealing with significant uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:57">[01:20:57]</a>.
*   **Making a bet**: Founders are essentially making a bet on a particular product-market solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:05">[01:21:05]</a>.
*   **Failure to adapt**: Research on Silicon Valley startups shows that many start with a particular aim but the ones that survive and prosper are those that are willing to "switch" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:35">[01:22:35]</a> their target customer or solution as reality is revealed in bits and pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:23">[01:22:23]</a>. Founders need to be committed but also willing to shift when things aren't working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:19">[01:23:19]</a>.

### Overcoming Challenges
The most important intellectual tool is to "think again" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:03">[00:52:03]</a>, constantly questioning initial diagnoses and looking for alternative perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:16">[00:52:16]</a>. [[Common mistakes in earlystage startups | Richard Rumelt]] suggests that the job of a founder is to find an important and achievable problem, and then solve it for many people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:26">[01:26:26]</a>. This is a journey of continuous adaptation.

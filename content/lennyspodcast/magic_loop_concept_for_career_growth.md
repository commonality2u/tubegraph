The "Magic Loop" is a five-step framework developed by Ethan Evans, a former Vice President at Amazon, executive coach, and course creator, designed to help individuals [[career_advancement_strategies | grow and advance in their career]] in almost any circumstance, even with a challenging manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>. It is based on the principle of forming a partnership with leadership to achieve mutual success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:00">[09:41:00]</a>. The framework's goal is to help individuals gain satisfaction in their careers, move up, earn more, or change roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:25:00">[09:25:00]</a>.

## The Five Steps of the Magic Loop

1.  **Do Your Current Job Well**
    *   It's essential to be performing at a solid level in your current role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:00]</a>. Your boss shouldn't wish you were different, so communicate with your manager to address any performance issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:15:00">[06:15:00]</a>. The aim is to ensure your manager isn't thinking "do your job" when you approach them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:24:00">[19:24:00]</a>.
2.  **Ask Your Boss How You Can Help**
    *   Very few people proactively ask their manager, "What can I do to help you? What do you need?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:00">[06:37:00]</a> This simple question immediately sets you apart and starts building a relationship where you are seen as part of their success, not just your own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:00">[06:42:00]</a>. Managers often feel overwhelmed and welcome offered assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:46:00">[17:46:00]</a>.
3.  **Do What They Ask**
    *   Whatever your manager requests, commit to doing it, even if it's not your preferred work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:00">[06:55:00]</a>. Declining tasks or expressing disinterest can damage the trust you're trying to build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03:00">[07:03:00]</a>.
4.  **Propose a Mutual-Benefit Project**
    *   After helping your manager a few times, return to them and suggest a way to help them that also aligns with your [[building_a_longterm_career_strategy | career goals]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18:00">[07:18:00]</a>. Clearly state your objective (e.g., changing roles, getting a raise, learning a new skill) and ask if there's a need they have that could help you achieve it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:28:00">[07:28:00]</a>. This step leverages human nature: managers help those who help them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:00">[07:47:00]</a>. This also implicitly helps identify the gaps keeping you from the next level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:30:00">[20:30:00]</a>.
5.  **Repeat**
    *   Once you're working with your manager towards your goal, continue to go through the loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15:00">[08:15:00]</a>. This consistent engagement builds trust and a strong working relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:11:00">[20:11:00]</a>.

### Why it's Called the "Magic Loop"

Ethan Evans coined the term because the process worked so effectively for his audience, with people reporting rapid promotions and feeling "in over their heads" with new opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:00">[08:47:00]</a>. It seems to work "like magic" in almost every circumstance, with exceptions only for very exploitative managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:10:00">[09:10:00]</a>.

## Benefits and Effectiveness

*   **Rarity of Proactive Help:** Managers are often overwhelmed and rarely receive unsolicited offers of help from their reports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:34:00">[17:34:00]</a>. Offering assistance makes you stand out and positions you as an ally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:56:00">[17:56:00]</a>.
*   **Leveraging Human Nature:** The loop is built on the simple social engineering principle of "you help me, I'll help you," which is fundamental to human interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:06:00">[18:06:00]</a>.
*   **Shifting Relationships:** It transforms the manager-report relationship from potentially oppositional ("I'm doing the least to get by") to a collaborative partnership focused on mutual success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:26:00">[18:26:00]</a>.
*   **Clarifying Goals:** Many managers assume employees either want to stay in their current role or follow the manager's career path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:07:00">[21:07:00]</a>. The loop forces you to articulate your goals, removing this ambiguity and enabling your manager to help you achieve them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:40:00">[21:40:00]</a>.
*   **Identifying Gaps:** The process implicitly encourages the identification of skills or experience gaps necessary for the next career level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:30:00">[20:30:00]</a>.

## Applicability and Evolution

The Magic Loop can be applied from the start of one's career to very senior levels, including for managers and leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:34:00">[15:34:00]</a>.

*   **For Managers/Leaders:** Managers can initiate the Magic Loop with their employees by discussing [[career_advancement_strategies | career goals]] and offering to form a partnership where employees take on new challenges to meet their objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:09:00">[12:09:00]</a>.
*   **Goals Beyond Promotion:** While often associated with promotions, the loop is also effective for other goals such as changing roles, learning new skills, joining a different team, or rebalancing work-life commitments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:00:00">[23:00:00]</a>.
*   **Advanced Mode (Executive Levels):** At executive levels (e.g., VP), the explicit conversation of the Magic Loop may peter out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:47:00">[15:47:00]</a>. Instead, leaders are expected to be proactive, anticipate needs, and just keep their managers in the loop rather than constantly asking what they can help with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:07:00">[16:07:00]</a>. This "advanced mode" requires high [[building_and_using_influence_in_a_career | rapport and trust]] with leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:53:00">[16:53:00]</a>.

## Common Pitfalls and Clarifications

*   **"My Manager Should Notice/Help":** Many people feel their manager "should" be more proactive in their [[navigating_career_transitions_and_promotions | career growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:17:00">[11:17:00]</a>. However, not all managers are good, and many are simply too busy focusing on their own work and careers to prioritize individual employee development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:36:00">[10:36:00]</a>. The Magic Loop puts the control of your [[career_growth_and_strategic_positioning | career growth]] squarely in your hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:50:00">[11:50:00]</a>.
*   **"Too Much Work":** The framework is particularly useful for individuals whose managers are not highly engaged or proactive in employee development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31:00">[10:31:00]</a>. If you have an excellent manager, you might not need as much formality.
*   **"Stuck at Senior Manager Level":** The transition from senior manager to director (or similar executive levels) is often a choke point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:48:00">[23:48:00]</a>. This is because the skills required shift from functional strength and execution to [[building_and_using_influence_in_a_career | influence]], coordination, and strategic thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:49:00">[24:49:00]</a>. While patience is sometimes required due to limited higher-level roles, you can still actively practice these next-level skills, making yourself the obvious choice when an opportunity arises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:11:00">[26:11:00]</a>. This aligns with the advice to "do the job before you have the job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:07:00">[28:07:00]</a>.

## Social Proof

The Magic Loop has yielded significant positive changes for 93% of its members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>.

*   **Entry-Level Success:** One individual, initially struggling at a company and facing redundancy, applied the Magic Loop. They received a $30,000 raise and a larger job offer from their current company, which they turned down for an even better offer at another company. They were subsequently promoted there, feeling "in over their head" with opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:08:00">[13:08:00]</a>.
*   **Executive Trajectory:** An Amazon employee, starting as a mid-level engineer (SDE2), followed the Magic Loop principles. Over eight years, they were promoted to senior engineer, then small team manager, senior manager, and ultimately director, running an office of hundreds of people. They later founded and sold their own startup and now serve as an Executive Vice President at a major online bank, with their career exceeding Ethan Evans's own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:07:00">[14:07:00]</a>.

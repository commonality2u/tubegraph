Shopify's approach to monetization and churn optimization is unique, diverging significantly from typical SaaS companies by prioritizing long-term merchant success and total gross merchandise volume (GMV) over traditional retention metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>. This strategy is driven by a "100-year vision" for the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>.

## Shopify's Unique Approach to Churn

Unlike most companies that focus heavily on reducing churn and increasing retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>, Shopify's growth team optimizes for churn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>. Their mission is to increase entrepreneurship on the internet by making it as easy as possible to start an online store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>. Recognizing that most businesses ultimately fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:00">[07:08:00]</a>, Shopify aims to lower the barriers to getting started, allowing more people to try entrepreneurship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:00">[07:10:00]</a>.

The core idea is that while many initial attempts might not be successful, the few merchants who do go on to become extremely large businesses, like Allbirds or Figs, will make the entire cohort of merchants successful for Shopify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:28:00">[07:28:00]</a>. This is likened to [[marketplace_growth_strategies | Angel Investing]], where a few successful outliers drive the overall portfolio's success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:47:00">[09:47:00]</a>.

### Monetization Model

Shopify's business model is key to this strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:36:00">[07:36:00]</a>. While they charge a subscription, most of their revenue comes from payments, which is directly tied to a merchant's success and the gross merchandise volume (GMV) they produce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:39:00">[07:39:00]</a>. This means their net dollar retention for successful merchants is "absurd," making up for those who don't succeed long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:36:00">[09:36:00]</a>.

### Measuring Success: Cohort GMV

Instead of focusing on traditional retention curves, Shopify measures success by the total GMV produced by a cohort of merchants over multiple years (e.g., one, two, three, four, or five years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:18:00">[10:18:00]</a>. This [[Growth Hacking and Strategies | power law-based metric]] is what drives the success of each cohort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:51:00">[10:51:00]</a>.

## Long-Term Experimentation

To assess impact on long-term GMV, Shopify employs extensive long-term holdout experiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>. They constantly re-evaluate experiments a year, two years, or three years later to see the true impact on GMV distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Short-Term vs. Long-Term Impact
> Archie Abrams, VP of Product and Head of Growth at Shopify, encourages companies to look at downstream metrics of experiments years later, noting that initial "biggest winners" might not show long-term lift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>.
>
> *   **Common Finding**: A short-term lift in a metric (e.g., becoming a paying shop, first sale) often results in *no incremental long-term lift* on GMV for that cohort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>. This suggests that the early lift is often a pull-forward effect or comes from incremental users who are not very valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>. Approximately 30-40% of experiments showing early impact have no effect after a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>.
> *   **Rare Finding**: In some cases, experiments initially showing neutral or no short-term lift can have a massive impact on GMV long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>. This is often because the change helps a group of valuable entrepreneurs succeed who might have given up otherwise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>.

Shopify's internal experimentation system allows them to re-look at experiments at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, emailing all involved experimenters with updated results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.

### Monetary Friction

A significant lever for growth identified is "monetary friction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>. This includes:
*   Trial dynamics (length, amount) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>
*   Incentives (e.g., App Store credits) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>
*   Actual price points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>

Lowering monetary friction can causally change a business's ability to become successful by giving them more time to try an idea or move their business to Shopify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>.

## Focus on Absolute Numbers, Not Rates

Shopify teams are incentivized to think about the *absolute number* of people who complete a stage in the journey, rather than local conversion rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>.
*   **The Problem with Rates**: When teams optimize for conversion rates within their part of the funnel, it's often easier to "make it harder to do the thing right before your step" to increase their rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>. For example, making it harder to sign up will increase the sign-up-to-activated rate because only higher-intent users make it through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.
*   **The Benefit of Absolutes**: By focusing on the total number of activated people, teams are incentivized to reduce friction and get more people in the door, even if it temporarily hurts conversion rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>. This allows for increased overall volume, leveraging a potentially lower Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) to acquire more users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.

## Optimizing [[Customer Onboarding and Activation | Onboarding]] and User Journey

[[Customer Onboarding and Activation | Onboarding]] is consistently identified as a major area for success and opportunities, even for a company that doesn't traditionally optimize for retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>. Key strategies include:
*   **Information Collection**: Collecting the right information during sign-up to personalize guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.
*   **Personalization**: Providing personalized guidance based on user needs, especially for a diverse product like Shopify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>.
*   **Avoiding Wizards**: Shopify has a "no wizard" principle, avoiding onboarding flows that guide users without letting them interact with the actual product. Instead, they integrate simplifying principles (like pre-filled sections) directly into the product experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>.

## Integrating Sales Motion

Shopify, traditionally product-led growth, has successfully layered on a sales motion to serve larger businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>.
*   **Qualitative Insights**: Working with sales requires more qualitative insights and empathy to understand challenges faced by larger customers, as quantitative data is harder to use at that scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>.
*   **Hybrid Journeys**: A key learning has been to create hybrid journeys where merchants are not forced to choose between self-service or sales. This means building connections between self-service and sales channels, which can break existing metrics and attribution models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>. For example, a merchant starting via an ad (self-service) but then converting via sales might not have their value attributed back to the ad campaign, leading to suboptimal investment decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>.
*   **Incrementality**: The focus is on rebuilding [[startup_scalability_and_demand_generation | attribution]] and LTV modeling, and moving towards incrementality testing, to properly value different types of outcomes across channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.

## [[Different pricing models and strategies for products | Discounting]] as a Growth Lever (Udemy Example)

From his experience at Udemy, Archie Abrams highlights the power of [[utilizing_lowcost_growth_channels | discounting]] as a [[Growth Hacking and Strategies | growth lever]]:
*   **Signaling Value**: Discounting can signal high value with a high list price, then bring the product down to an affordable price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:31">[01:09:31]</a>. For online courses, a high list price ($100) associated with a college course, when discounted to a lower price ($10), signaled quality while making it affordable like a book <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:51">[01:09:51]</a>.
*   **Emotional Job-to-be-Done**: Beyond the practical use of the product, education is aspirational. The act of purchasing a course (or book) can be progress in itself, fulfilling an emotional job to be done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:20">[01:10:20]</a>. Discounting with urgency allowed Udemy to leverage this emotional journey, leading to good retention by allowing users to repeatedly engage with that emotional job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:49">[01:10:49]</a>.

Being strategic involves two core components: articulating a compelling "why" behind decisions and acting as a change agent for long-term company or product interests, even when execution is challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:13">[00:19:13]</a>. If one component is missing, an individual may not be perceived as strategic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>.

## What Does "Strategic" Mean?

When people ask for someone who is "strategic," they are generally looking for an individual who can:
1.  **Articulate a Compelling and Simple "Why"**: Explain the rationale behind company and product decisions and direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>.
2.  **Champion and Be a Change Agent**: Drive actions that may be difficult but are ultimately beneficial for the long-term interests of the product or company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>.

## How to Cultivate a Strategic Mindset

### Tactical Steps

*   **Master Summarization**: Effectively summarize discussions in meetings, synthesizing what various stakeholders are saying to highlight potential directions or check for agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:10">[00:21:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:53">[00:21:53]</a>. This tactic can also be used in Zoom chats or on whiteboards as a low-stakes way to intervene and clarify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:20">[00:26:20]</a>. This also helps people feel heard, which is especially important with diverse voices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:21">[00:24:21]</a>.
*   **Focus on "One Click Better"**: Instead of aiming for radical changes, take existing ideas and make them incrementally better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:11">[00:22:11]</a>. This approach considers external factors like customer problems and market entry, rather than just technical implementation difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:27">[00:22:27]</a>.
*   **Deeply Understand the Business**: As a leader, don't shy away from understanding the granular details of the business, including financial goals, what's working, and what's not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>. This depth of understanding allows you to identify where significant or small course corrections are needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>.
*   **Champion Big Ideas**: Identify and advocate for a few significant ideas that can fundamentally change the company's direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:15">[00:20:15]</a>. These should align with the biggest opportunities and threats to the business, regardless of execution difficulty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>.
*   **Manage Your Energy**: Prioritize managing your mental and emotional energy over just managing time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. Simple actions like taking lunch or scheduling difficult tasks during high-energy times can help maintain an abundant mindset, preventing operations from a place of scarcity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

### Supporting Principles

*   **Learn from History**: Understand past decisions, product launches (successful or not), and the reasons behind them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:28">[00:28:28]</a>. Being a "historian" helps learn from past mistakes and understand potential "baggage" people carry regarding similar initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:03">[00:29:03]</a>. This knowledge is crucial for making better future decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a>.
*   **Embrace Decisiveness**: Avoid analysis paralysis by making decisions even with incomplete information (e.g., 70% certainty) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:42">[00:30:42]</a>. Committing to a decision allows for learning from real-world outcomes, moving beyond hypotheticals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>.
*   **Foster a Culture of Learning**: When making decisions, clearly define hypotheses and assumptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:21">[00:32:21]</a>. If outcomes don't meet expectations, focus on what was learned about the business or customers, rather than punishing "bad" decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:12">[00:33:12]</a>. This encourages risk-taking and continuous improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:24">[00:33:24]</a>.

### Misconceptions about [[creating_a_winning_product_strategy | Becoming Strategic]]

New product managers (PMs) often misunderstand what it means to be strategic, mistakenly focusing on learning tools like Figma or specific processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:31">[00:55:31]</a>. The true skill required is the ability to take ambiguous situations and consistently drive clarity over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:46">[00:55:46]</a>. This involves a mindset shift rather than just acquiring technical skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:21">[00:56:21]</a>.

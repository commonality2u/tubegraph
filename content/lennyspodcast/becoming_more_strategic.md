## Defining "Strategic"

When people seek someone "strategic," they are looking for two key abilities:
1.  **Articulating a Compelling and Simple "Why"**: The ability to explain the rationale behind company and product decisions and direction. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>
2.  **Championing Change**: Being a change agent willing to pursue difficult actions that are ultimately in the long-term interest of the product or company, even if execution is challenging. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>

## How to Become More Strategic

[[improving_strategic_thinking_through_practice_and_betterment | Improving strategic thinking]] involves specific tactics and mindsets:

### The "Why" and Championing Ideas
The core of being strategic involves clearly articulating *why* decisions are made and championing big ideas that can shift the company's direction. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>

### The Power of Summarization
An effective tactic for developing and demonstrating strategic thinking is summarization. In meetings, actively listen to diverse voices and periodically summarize what people are saying, and what that implies for the direction. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>
This approach acts as a checkpoint, ensuring alignment and helping synthesize complex discussions. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:34">[00:21:34]</a> Summarization makes people feel heard and helps navigate conflict by getting to the heart of an issue. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:21">[00:24:21]</a>
To apply this:
*   Pause conversations to capture what has been said, then present it back as a synthesized understanding. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:16">[00:25:16]</a>
*   End with a question to invite further discussion and ensure collective agreement or identify dissent. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:48">[00:25:48]</a>
*   Use visual aids like whiteboards or chat functions (e.g., Zoom chat) to summarize, especially if interrupting the flow is difficult. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:20">[00:26:20]</a>

### Focusing on Betterment
Rather than always seeking radical innovation, focus on making existing ideas "one click better." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:14">[00:22:14]</a> This concept aligns with [[improving_strategic_thinking_through_practice_and_betterment | betterment]] in strategy, where continuous small improvements to key constraints lead to significant long-term progress. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:22">[00:23:22]</a> When considering improvements, maintain an "outside-in perspective," focusing on customer problems and go-to-market strategies, rather than getting bogged down by technical implementation difficulties. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:27">[00:22:27]</a>

### Deep Business Understanding
For [[developing_engineering_strategy_and_its_importance | developing engineering strategy]] and product strategy, it's crucial to deeply understand the business's details:
*   What's working and what's not. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>
*   Financial goals and decision-making processes. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>
This in-depth knowledge allows leaders to identify where to intervene for course corrections, big or small. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a> When working with teams, invite them to present their strategies, ask questions, and offer suggestions to make their thinking even better, rather than dismissing their work. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>

### Learning from the Past: Be a Historian
To make better decisions, actively learn from past successes and failures within the organization. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:22">[00:28:22]</a> This involves:
*   Understanding why past products were or weren't successful. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:30">[00:28:30]</a>
*   Investigating the rationale behind historical decisions, good or bad. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:54">[00:28:54]</a>
Being a "historian" provides context, helping to learn from mistakes and understand why individuals might be hesitant about similar initiatives ("baggage"). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:29">[00:29:29]</a>

### Making Decisions Quickly
For [[executing_strategy_effectively_in_product_management | executing strategy effectively]], prioritize making decisions rather than falling into analysis paralysis. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:42">[00:30:42]</a>
*   Operating with imprecise information is normal for product leaders. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:54">[00:30:54]</a>
*   Committing to a decision, even if only 70% right, allows for learning and iteration based on real-world information. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>
*   Speed in decision-making and iteration is crucial for organizational progress. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:27">[00:31:27]</a>
To foster a culture that encourages quick decision-making and risk-taking, reward learning over outcome. If a decision doesn't work out, the focus should be on what was learned and how it can inform future actions. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:20">[00:33:20]</a>

## Common Misconceptions

A common [[challenges_and_misconceptions_in_strategic_thinking | misconception]] among aspiring product managers is that being strategic means mastering specific tools or processes (e.g., Figma). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:31">[00:55:31]</a> However, the true skill lies in the ability to take ambiguous situations and consistently drive clarity over time. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:46">[00:55:46]</a>

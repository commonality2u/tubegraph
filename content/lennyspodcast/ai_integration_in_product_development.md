[[AI integration in product management | AI integration]] is transforming product development, with companies like Superhuman demonstrating its impact on product velocity and feature delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:50">[01:13:50]</a>. Rahul Vora, founder and CEO of Superhuman, discusses lessons learned from building scaled products on top of [[AI]] and Large Language Models (LLMs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>.

## Impact of AI on Product Velocity
Superhuman observed a significant increase in its product velocity, leading to frequent feature shipments involving [[AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:50">[01:13:50]</a>. This surge suggests that [[AI]] has unlocked a new stage in what can be achieved with products like email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:36">[01:09:36]</a>. Rahul Vora considers how aggressively to lean into [[AI]] and its implications for financial metrics like gross margin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:54:00">[28:54:00]</a>.

### Flagship AI Features in Superhuman
Superhuman has launched multiple flagship [[AI]] features that enhance the email experience:

*   **Write with [[AI]]**: This feature allows users to jot down a few words, which are then turned into a fully written email that matches the user's voice and tone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:09">[01:10:09]</a>. This feature is highly popular, used by users an average of 37 times per week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:24">[01:10:24]</a>. The percentage of emails written and sent with [[AI]] has grown fourfold in one year (2024) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:09">[01:11:09]</a>.
*   **Auto Summarize**: This feature provides a one-line summary above every conversation, which updates instantly as new emails arrive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:33">[01:10:33]</a>. Unlike some other tools, these summaries are pre-computed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:44">[01:10:44]</a>.
*   **Instant Reply**: This feature drafts replies for incoming emails, allowing users to simply edit and send them, or sometimes send them without any edits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:53">[01:10:53]</a>.
*   **Ask [[AI]]**: Leveraging email as a "treasure trove" of information, Ask [[AI]] allows users to query their inbox for specific details, such as project statuses, flight details, or customer responses, enabling tasks that previously took 20-30 minutes to be completed in less than 5 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:22">[01:11:22]</a>.
*   **Auto Labels**: Users can set short prompts (e.g., "job applications" or "requests to review work") to automatically label matching emails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:20">[01:12:20]</a>.
*   **Auto Reminders**: If an email requires a response, Superhuman automatically sets a reminder, helping users avoid dropping the ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:35">[01:12:35]</a>.
*   **Autodrafts**: Superhuman automatically drafts follow-up emails and will soon draft replies to nearly every email requiring a response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:50">[01:12:50]</a>.
*   **Workflows**: Users can automate repeatable email processes (e.g., replying to job applicants and forwarding resumes to HR) even while on vacation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:02">[01:13:02]</a>.

### Lessons from Building with AI Models
The biggest surprise in building deeply on top of [[AI]] models has been the unpredictability of user love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:26">[01:14:26]</a>. Features that seemed like commodities, such as "Write with [[AI]]", garnered unexpectedly high usage and affection, while others expected to be popular received less engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:35">[01:14:35]</a>. This suggests that user response to [[AI]] features can be counter-intuitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:22">[01:15:22]</a>.

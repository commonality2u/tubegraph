Communicating effectively, especially in spontaneous situations like giving [[importance_of_giving_and_receiving_feedback | feedback]] or apologies, is a vital skill that can be developed through preparation and practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:11">[00:35:11]</a>. Matt Abrahams, a professor at Stanford University's Graduate School of Business, emphasizes that while this might seem counterintuitive, preparing to be spontaneous is key to successful communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>.

## Effective Feedback Structures

Feedback should be viewed as an opportunity to problem-solve and collaborate with the other person, rather than simply bestowing an opinion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:53">[00:52:53]</a>. It's about inviting the other person to work together on the issue or challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:07">[00:53:07]</a>.

Matt Abrahams, a proponent of Kim Scott's [[developing_leadership_skills_and_understanding_feedback | Radical Candor]] approach, suggests using structures to package information, making it easier for the receiver to digest and helping the giver formulate their thoughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:25">[00:53:25]</a>.

### What, So What, Now What

This three-part structure is highly versatile and effective for giving [[techniques_for_effective_feedback_and_communication | feedback]]:
*   **What** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:57">[00:53:57]</a>: Describe the specific behavior or observation.
*   **So What** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:57">[00:53:57]</a>: Explain the importance or relevance of the behavior, including its impact on you or the situation.
*   **Now What** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:57">[00:53:57]</a>: Suggest a clear action or next step.

**Example:**
*   **What:** "When you talked about the implementation plan, you spoke a little quicker than you did with the other parts and you didn't go into the same level of detail." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:08">[00:54:08]</a>
*   **So What:** "When you speak quickly without a lot of detail, people might think you're not as prepared or you're really concerned about this part." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:16">[00:54:16]</a>
*   **Now What:** "Next time, I suggest you slow down and you include these two three bits of data so that people see you really are knowledgeable on this area." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:23">[00:54:23]</a>

### The Four I's Structure

This structure helps provide comprehensive [[techniques_for_effective_feedback_and_communication | feedback]], akin to "glasses" that help you see more clearly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:58">[00:54:58]</a>:
*   **Information** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:04">[00:55:04]</a>: Set the context and specify the behavior.
*   **Impact** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:10">[00:55:10]</a>: Share the effect the behavior had on you, the feedback giver.
*   **Invitation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:15">[00:55:15]</a>: Invite the other person to problem-solve or discuss.
*   **Implications** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:17">[00:55:17]</a>: Discuss the potential consequences or benefits of changing the behavior.

**Example:**
*   **Information:** "This is the third time that you have showed up late to this meeting." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:24">[00:55:24]</a>
*   **Impact:** "I feel you're not prioritizing this meeting the same way others of us are." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:28">[00:55:28]</a>
*   **Invitation:** "What can we do to help make sure you show up prepared for the next meeting?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:31">[00:55:31]</a>
*   **Implications:** "Because if you do, we're going to finish the project on time and get a new cool project." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:35">[00:55:35]</a>

When giving [[techniques_for_effective_feedback_and_communication | feedback]], selecting one or two structures that resonate with you and practicing them will make it easier to deliver effective communication on the spot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:09">[00:56:09]</a>.

## Effective Apology Structure (AAA)

When apologizing, it's crucial to acknowledge the transgression directly, rather than framing it as "I'm sorry that you feel bad," which avoids responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:40">[01:07:40]</a>.

The "AAA" approach for apologies involves three steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:13">[01:08:13]</a>:
*   **Acknowledge** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:18">[01:08:18]</a>: State specifically what you did wrong.
*   **Appreciate** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:18">[01:08:18]</a>: Express understanding and appreciation for the difficulty or impact you caused the other person.
*   **Amend** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:18">[01:08:18]</a>: Propose a specific action to remedy the situation or prevent it from happening again.

**Example:**
*   **Acknowledge:** "I'm very sorry for interrupting what you were saying. I over-spoke when you were talking." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:28">[01:08:28]</a>
*   **Appreciate:** "I can imagine my doing that made you feel bad and you feel that you didn't get your fair share of sharing your point of view." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:36">[01:08:36]</a>
*   **Amend:** "Next time, I will work not to do this. In fact, I will wait till you're done and I will actually paraphrase what you said before I contribute my point." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:44">[01:08:44]</a>

This structure helps signal understanding and provides a clear path forward, allowing the other person to respond and engage in further discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:56">[01:08:56]</a>.

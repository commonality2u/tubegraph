Many people tend to adopt a specific "public speaking voice" when asked to speak, even if they were just chatting normally moments before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This often results in a different, more "professional" version of themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, speaking conversationally is noted as being far more freeing, powerful, connecting, and effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

[[Improving public speaking skills | Becoming a better speaker]] is considered a significant accelerant for one's professional life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>. Public speaking can be a scary and dreaded activity for many <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:06">[02:06:06]</a>. Even experienced podcasters can get nervous before recording <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.

## Misconceptions About Public Speaking
The biggest misconception about [[Improving public speaking skills | public speaking]] is underestimating how transformative it can be to one's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>. Speaking is not merely a specialized skill, but a "meta-skill" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:00">[06:06:00]</a>. This means that as you improve at speaking, your overall life improves, similar to how improving physical fitness can boost energy, confidence, and overall well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:18:00">[06:18:00]</a>. Breakthroughs in speaking can positively impact interactions at work, among friends, with strangers, and even within family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>.

Humans are naturally evolved to speak, possessing "incredible hardware" for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:00">[07:54:00]</a>. However, throughout life, various situations can introduce "bugs in the software," leading to overthinking, anxiety, and self-consciousness, causing individuals to avoid speaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:17:00">[08:17:00]</a>. The key is to debug and upgrade this software to unleash the inherent "superpower" of communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:43:00">[08:43:00]</a>.

### The Importance of Enjoyment
A core insight is that "if you don't enjoy speaking, you're doing it wrong" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:13:00">[09:13:00]</a>. Enjoyment serves as a barometer: if it's not enjoyable, something is likely being done incorrectly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:29:00">[09:29:00]</a>. When people feel completely like themselves, such as when talking to family or close friends, communication becomes extraordinarily enjoyable, empowering, and a natural means to connect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:27:00">[10:27:00]</a>. The pressure of a business setting can lead to overthinking and attempting to control every word, hindering natural communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:49:00">[10:49:00]</a>. This principle also applies to [[Importance of practicing public speaking | practice]]; it must be enjoyable to ensure consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:30:00">[11:30:00]</a>.

### Speaking as a Subconscious Flow
A fundamental shift in mindset is understanding that speaking is a subconscious, flow-oriented process, not a conscious one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:27:00">[12:27:00]</a>. When speaking optimally, the focus is on conveying the message, not on the act of speaking itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:52:00">[12:52:00]</a>. The goal is to enter and maintain a flow state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:06:00">[13:06:00]</a>.

This perspective changes practice by focusing on root causes rather than symptoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:26:00">[13:26:00]</a>. For example, instead of just counting filler words, address the root cause, which might be struggling to slow down, relax, or pause due to a racing mind under pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:40:00">[13:40:00]</a>. Solving the root cause naturally eliminates symptoms like filler words and racing speech, creating more mental space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:02:00">[14:02:00]</a>. Monotonous or constrained speaking often stems from a lack of certainty or trust in allowing oneself to be expressive under pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:12:00">[14:12:00]</a>.

## Practical [[Strategies for effective public speaking and reducing nervousness | Techniques for Enhancing Public Speaking Skills]]

### 1. Think Up (Look Better)
When gathering thoughts, many people tend to look down, which can appear unconfident, especially on video calls where it suggests looking at notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:25:00">[16:25:00]</a>. Instead, training oneself to "think up" (looking up or to the side) makes one appear thoughtful and confident by default, reducing the likelihood of being interrupted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:57:00">[16:57:00]</a>. It's recommended to place a "think up" note on your computer until it becomes a habit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:34:00">[17:34:00]</a>.

### 2. End Strong (Sound Better)
A common tendency is to "end weak," where speakers trail off or voice their doubts at the conclusion of their statements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:57:00">[17:57:00]</a>. This is similar to how freestyle rappers might lose flow at the very end of a performance, or how a smooth flight can be ruined by a bad landing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:11:00">[18:11:00]</a>. Voicing uncertainty ("I don't really know if that makes sense") forces the audience to view the entire message through a lens of doubt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:03:00">[19:03:00]</a>.

To counteract this, anticipate regaining self-awareness and potential uncertainties at the end of a statement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:51:00">[19:51:00]</a>. Make sure to "land the plane" by consciously making the ending sound conclusive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:10:00">[20:10:00]</a>. Using "summary prompts" like "so to wrap up," "in summary," or "my point here is" can trigger the brain to naturally complete the thought and provide a strong closing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:22:00">[20:22:00]</a>.

### 3. Stay in Character (Feel Better)
Speakers often "self-sabotage" or "leak" their insecurities when perceiving a mistake or feeling off-track, even though the audience usually cannot tell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:35:00">[21:35:00]</a>. Comments like "I'm not making sense right now" or nervous laughter after a perceived misstep break character and impose a filter of uncertainty onto the audience, similar to a pilot announcing a blinking red light in the cockpit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:38:00">[22:38:00]</a>.

The simple solution is to "just don't share your insecurities" and "stay in it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:37:00">[24:37:00]</a>. By staying in character from beginning to end, even when it feels like everything is going wrong, speakers are often surprised to receive positive feedback, reinforcing confidence and proving that their perceived internal struggles were not visible externally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:05:00">[25:05:00]</a>. Most people speaking in meetings feel nervous, but it's usually imperceptible unless the anxiety is extreme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:03:00">[26:03:00]</a>.

## Practice Through Games and Methods
[[Importance of practicing public speaking | You can't get better at speaking without speaking]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:53:00">[29:53:00]</a>. Reading articles or watching videos alone is insufficient; active practice is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:31:00">[30:31:00]</a>. While initially scary, getting started with practice becomes rewarding and enjoyable as skills improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:52:00">[30:52:00]</a>.

### Why Games?
Games are a fun way to practice, providing intrinsic reward necessary for consistent engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:06:00">[31:06:00]</a>. [[Techniques for enhancing public speaking skills | Ultra speaking games]] utilize short, deliberate practice "reps" followed by immediate feedback, allowing for continuous adjustment and internalization of lessons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:18:00">[31:18:00]</a>. These games are designed to create "turbulence" â€“ intentional challenges that highlight areas needing improvement, similar to a flight simulator creating difficult scenarios for pilots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:21:00">[42:21:00]</a>. By navigating these low-stakes challenges, speakers build resilience and learn to recover gracefully from mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:30:00">[43:30:00]</a>.

#### Conductor
This game trains speakers to intentionally shift their vocal energy and emotional state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:00:00">[35:00:00]</a>. The speaker is given a random topic and then instructed to vary their intensity (1-10) or pause based on visual cues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:30:00">[35:30:00]</a>. The insight is that tapping into different energy levels creates different emotions, and words naturally follow these emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:24:00">[47:24:00]</a>. This allows for accessing different insights and stories, proving that the body's state can unlock new thoughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:21:00">[44:21:00]</a>. This exercise also reveals whether a speaker is more comfortable with high-energy or low-energy delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:10:00">[49:10:00]</a>.

#### Triple Step
This game focuses on resiliency and staying on track despite distractions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:10:00">[51:10:00]</a>. The speaker receives a random speech title and then must seamlessly integrate six random words or phrases that appear as they speak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:50:00">[51:50:00]</a>. The goal is to maintain a strong direction for the speech and make the inserted words work within that narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:41:00">[54:41:00]</a>. It builds comfort with imperfections and helps speakers realize they can navigate unexpected challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:05:00">[55:05:00]</a>. This game can also be used as a warm-up before important communication events to light up the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:51:00">[55:51:00]</a>.

These games, by focusing on specific underlying skills, allow for targeted practice that is more effective than simply giving more general talks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:39:00">[56:39:00]</a>. They expand one's comfort zone, helping speakers feel more at ease and unlock their natural communication abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:52:00">[57:52:00]</a>.

### Conviction Prompts
This exercise aims to build executive presence by forcing speakers into a state of more conviction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:50:00">[10:50:00]</a>. Speakers are given a random topic and must integrate specific sentence beginnings (prompts) into their speech, which their brain then completes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33:00">[10:33:00]</a>. Most people need to bring more conviction to their words for their ideas to be heard and valued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:39:00">[11:39:00]</a>. This practice demonstrates how conviction can naturally alter content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:41:00">[11:41:00]</a>, and trusting the brain to fill in the gaps is a powerful outcome of consistent practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:57">[00:46:57]</a>.

### The Accordion Method
This method revolutionizes talk preparation by shifting from writing to speaking as the primary mode of practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:26">[01:26:26]</a>. The "old way" involves dumping all ideas onto paper, rearranging, scripting, and then painfully memorizing, which is often ineffective and leads to anxiety if a line is forgotten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:01">[01:25:01]</a>.

The Accordion Method involves speaking your talk at progressively shorter time intervals (e.g., 3 minutes, then 2 minutes, 1 minute, down to 30 seconds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:41">[01:28:41]</a>. Each reduction forces the speaker to strip away noise and focus on the essential core message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:31">[01:29:31]</a>. After reaching the shortest duration, the speaker then expands the talk back up through the same time intervals (30 seconds, then 1 minute, 2 minutes, back to 3 minutes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:06">[01:30:06]</a>. This allows for intentional reintroduction of only the most relevant supporting elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:26">[01:30:26]</a>.

The result is a talk that is not merely memorized but deeply internalized, with clear pillars and a flexible structure that can adapt to different time frames <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:48">[01:30:48]</a>. This method provides immense clarity and space in the speaker's mind, reducing the need for extensive preparation and memorization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:39">[01:31:39]</a>.

### The Bow and Arrow Technique
This technique emphasizes a mindset shift from focusing on "what I want to say" to "what I want my audience to remember" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:31">[01:38:31]</a>. In most talks, audiences typically remember only "one thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:02">[01:39:02]</a>.

*   The **Arrow** is that single, clear sentence or core idea the audience should remember <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:22">[01:39:22]</a>. This acts as a North Star, providing clarity for the speaker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:42">[01:39:42]</a>.
*   The **Bow** consists of interesting anecdotes, data points, or stories that add weight and emotion to the arrow, enhancing its impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:02">[01:40:02]</a>.

This framework is useful for building an entire talk or for individual slides. For each slide, ask: "What is my one thing?" If a slide doesn't have a clear single takeaway, it either shouldn't exist or should be broken into multiple slides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:22">[01:42:22]</a>. Making the slide title the "one thing" is a practical tip for clarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:23">[01:43:23]</a>.

## Conclusion
Tackling public speaking can be profoundly transformational <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:03">[01:44:03]</a>. The more constrained one feels, the greater the potential for transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:19">[01:44:19]</a>. It can be an exhilarating and energizing journey, leading to increased confidence and a feeling of empowerment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:29">[01:44:29]</a>. The key is to take the first step and start practicing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:37">[01:44:37]</a>.

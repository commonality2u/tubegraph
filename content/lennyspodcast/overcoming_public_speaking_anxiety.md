Public speaking often causes people to adopt an unnatural, "professional" voice, distinct from their normal conversational tone [00:00:00]. However, speaking conversationally is far more freeing, powerful, connecting, and effective [00:00:25]. The co-creator of Ultra Speaking, Tristan de Bello, rapidly reached the finals of the World Championship of Public Speaking in 2017 [00:00:45]. His unique approach helps individuals quickly build skills to become more comfortable speaking in public and, especially, [[effective_spontaneous_speaking_techniques | speaking on the spot]] [00:00:54].

Becoming a better speaker is a significant accelerant for one's professional life, influencing various aspects of personal and professional well-being [00:01:06].

## The Misconception and Meta-Skill of Speaking

The biggest misconception about tackling public speaking anxiety is underestimating its transformative power [00:05:52]. Speaking is not a specialized skill; it is a [[improving_communication_skills | meta-skill]] [00:06:06]. This means that improving one's speaking ability positively impacts many other areas of life, similar to how fitness improves overall well-being and confidence [00:06:12]. Breakthroughs in speaking can change how one feels at work, among friends, in groups of strangers, and even within family dynamics [00:07:09].

Humans are naturally evolved to speak, possessing "incredible hardware" for it [00:07:50]. Over time, however, "bugs in the software" develop due to various life situations, leading to avoidance and a lack of improvement [00:08:13]. Overcoming this involves "debugging and upgrading" the software, which can profoundly change one's life [00:08:43].

## Core Insights for Improvement

### Enjoyment as a Barometer

If you don't enjoy speaking, you might be doing it wrong [00:09:13]. Enjoyment serves as a barometer: if a speaker is doing things correctly, they will likely enjoy themselves [00:09:33]. Since speaking is a natural human ability, it should be rewarding [00:09:41]. Discomfort often signals overthinking or a need to relax and "feel more like myself" [00:10:00]. This principle also applies to practice, which must be enjoyable to ensure consistency [00:11:41].

### Speaking as a Subconscious Flow

A fundamental shift in mindset is understanding that speaking is a subconscious, flow-oriented process, not a conscious one [01:12:27]. When speaking effectively, the focus is on conveying meaning to the audience, not on the act of speaking itself [01:12:52]. The goal is to enter and maintain a flow state [01:13:06]. This understanding transforms the approach to practice and how to think about speaking [01:13:19].

### Addressing Root Causes, Not Symptoms

Instead of focusing on superficial symptoms (e.g., counting filler words), effective improvement targets the root causes [01:13:35].
*   **Filler words or racing speech** often stem from discomfort with slowing down, relaxing, or pausing when under pressure [01:13:48]. Solving this root cause eliminates both filler words and rushing [01:14:05].
*   **Monotonous or constrained speech** may indicate a struggle to "allow yourself to be all of what you are under pressure" [01:14:18]. A lack of certainty or trust in one's ability to express emotions or gather thoughts leads to playing it safe [01:14:26]. Addressing this unlocks freedom and expressiveness [01:14:52].

## Tactical Tweaks for Public Speaking

Tristan de Bello shares three key tactics that focus on underlying causes rather than just symptoms:

### 1. Look Up to Project Confidence
Many people look down when gathering thoughts, which appears uncertain, especially on video calls [01:16:29]. Instead, looking up makes one appear thoughtful by default and more confident [01:16:57]. This reduces the likelihood of being interrupted [01:17:18]. To build this habit, place a reminder (e.g., "think up") where it's visible [01:17:34].

### 2. End Strong
Speakers often "end weak" due to a natural dip in focus or self-awareness as they approach the conclusion [01:18:05]. This is akin to a runner slowing down just before the finish line [01:18:44] or a pilot having a rough landing after a smooth flight [01:19:34]. Ending weak, or expressing doubts (e.g., "I don't really know if that makes sense"), forces the audience to view the entire message through a lens of uncertainty [01:19:14].
*   **Tactic**: Anticipate this mental shift and consciously "land the plane" [01:20:09]. Either make the ending sound definitive, or use summary prompts like "so to wrap up..." or "in summary..." [01:20:25]. These prompts guide the brain to a strong conclusion [01:20:41].

### 3. Stay in Character
People tend to self-sabotage by "leaking" insecurities during speaking, such as nervously laughing or pointing out their own perceived mistakes [01:21:37]. While speakers intensely feel their inner anxieties, audiences generally cannot perceive them unless explicitly revealed [01:22:18]. Breaking character forces the audience to see the speaker through a filter of uncertainty, like a pilot announcing a blinking red light [01:23:16].
*   **Tactic**: Do not share insecurities; project confidence and "stay in it" [01:24:43]. This involves maintaining composure and focus from beginning to end [01:24:49]. When speakers stay in character, the audience reacts positively, reinforcing confidence and diminishing the internal "noise" of self-doubt [01:25:37]. Most people speaking in meetings are nervous, but it's often imperceptible unless they reveal it [01:26:05].

## Practice Techniques: The Power of Games

[[using_games_for_public_speaking_practice | Learning to speak]] effectively requires speaking [00:29:53]. Unlike learning to cook, where practice is intuitive, public speaking often defaults to passive learning (reading articles, watching videos) due to a lack of practice opportunities [00:30:17]. Dedicated, active practice is essential [00:30:47].

Games are an effective practice method because they are fun, provide intrinsic reward, and involve "short reps followed by feedback, followed by another rep" [00:31:06]. This structure, discovered through experimentation, forces immediate speaking responses, preventing overthinking [00:31:48]. Games create "turbulence" like a flight simulator, highlighting areas for improvement and building the ability to "recover gracefully from mistakes" [00:42:13]. This builds confidence for spontaneous scenarios [00:43:51].

### Conductor
This game involves speaking on a random topic while adjusting one's energy and intensity to match a series of fluctuating numbers (1-10) or "breathe" prompts [00:35:00].
*   **Purpose**: It forces speakers to access different emotional states and corresponding ideas [00:47:24]. Tapping into an energy creates emotion, and words naturally follow [00:47:37]. Forcing shifts in energy reveals whether a speaker is more comfortable with high or low intensity [00:49:11]. This game helps develop conviction and encourages taking up space [00:50:50].

### Triple Step
In this game, a speaker delivers a one-minute talk on a random title while seamlessly integrating six random words that pop up during the speech [00:51:48].
*   **Purpose**: It builds [[managing_presentation_nerves_and_stage_presence | resiliency]] and the ability to stay composed amidst distractions [00:55:19]. It teaches speakers to maintain a clear direction (like a tree in a storm) and make unexpected elements work within their narrative [00:54:36]. Triple Step is also an excellent warm-up exercise for important speaking engagements like podcasts or job interviews [00:55:51].

### Conviction Prompts
This exercise involves speaking on a random topic and then integrating specific sentence prompts that force the speaker into a state of higher conviction [01:10:10].
*   **Purpose**: It develops [[managing_presentation_nerves_and_stage_presence | executive presence]] by training speakers to genuinely believe in what they are saying [01:10:51]. Most people do not stand strongly behind their words, which can hinder the impact of their ideas [01:11:43]. These prompts help fast-track that confident, compelling delivery [01:11:19].

## Overcoming the "Bullshitter" Fear

A common fear is sounding disingenuous or like a "bullshitter" when attempting to speak freely or confidently [01:20:34]. This fear often stems from an "immune response" rooted in a strong desire not to be that person [01:20:56]. However, if that thought even occurs, it means the speaker has a "very cute skill set of noticing when people" are disingenuous [01:21:51]. This internal "listener" can serve as a compass, guiding the speaker to stay true to their ideas while communicating with confidence [01:22:55]. By practicing these skills, one can match the confident delivery of a "bullshitter" but with substantive ideas to back it up [01:22:09].

## Methods for Talk Preparation

### The Accordion Method
This method revolutionizes talk preparation by shifting from writing to speaking [01:24:17]. The traditional approach of dumping ideas onto paper, rearranging, scripting, and memorizing is "broken" and excruciating [01:24:49]. Memorization is unreliable and creates a linear chain, leading to getting "lost" if one link is missed [01:26:06].

The Accordion Method involves preparing by speaking, creating extreme clarity, and understanding the essence of a talk [01:26:29]. It starts with all ideas on paper (optional) [01:28:22], but then moves entirely to speaking. Speakers practice their talk at decreasing time constraints (e.g., 3 minutes, 2 minutes, 1 minute, 30 seconds), always staying in character and ending strong [01:28:39]. This forces them to distill content to its absolute essentials, like redecorating a room by removing everything but the most essential pieces [01:27:18].

After reaching the shortest duration (e.g., 30 seconds), speakers then expand the talk back up through increasing time constraints (e.g., 30 seconds, 1 minute, 2 minutes, 3 minutes) [01:30:06]. This intentional process allows them to consciously bring back only the relevant elements [01:27:47]. The result is a clear, intentional talk that is *internalized*, not just memorized [01:31:07]. This plastic structure allows the speaker to adapt to different time frames and reduces the impact of mistakes [01:31:27]. This method can be applied at macro (whole talk) or micro (specific sections) levels [01:36:11].

### The Bow and Arrow Technique
This technique is a mindset shift: stop focusing on what you *want to say* and focus more on what you want your *audience to remember* [01:38:44]. People typically remember only one core idea from a talk [01:39:02].
*   **The Arrow**: This is the "one thing" you want people to remember, a single sentence that, if it's all they take away, you would be satisfied [01:39:22]. This "North star" provides clarity for both the speaker and the audience [01:39:42].
*   **The Bow**: These are the supporting elements that give weight and impact to your arrow [01:40:02]. This includes interesting anecdotes, data points, or stories that add emotion and illustrate the core message [01:40:10].

The process of clarifying the "arrow" and "bow" is often iterative, with each informing the other [01:40:39]. By applying this technique, especially in conjunction with the Accordion Method, speakers gain extreme clarity and require less preparation and memorization [01:41:47]. This can also be applied at a micro-level, where each slide in a presentation has one clear "arrow" (takeaway) as its title, supported by its "bow" content [01:42:26].

## Encouragement

Overcoming public speaking anxiety can be profoundly transformational [01:44:11]. The more constrained one feels, the more impactful the transformation will be [01:44:19]. The journey is "much much much more enjoyable than you think it will be," offering an exhilarating and energizing experience that builds confidence [01:44:26]. Taking the first step and starting to practice is key [01:44:37].

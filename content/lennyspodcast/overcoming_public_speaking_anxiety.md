From: [[lennyspodcast]] <br/> 

Public speaking often induces a "public speaking voice" in individuals, causing them to shift into a different, often perceived as "professional," version of themselves, even when they usually chat normally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, speaking conversationally is actually "more freeing, powerful, connecting and effective" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Many people find public speaking intimidating, with some dreading it and feeling nervous even for routine tasks like podcasting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

## Misconceptions and Mindset Shifts

The biggest [[misconceptions_about_public_speaking | misconception about public speaking]] is underestimating its transformative potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. Speaking is considered a "meta-skill," meaning improvement in it leads to overall life enhancement, similar to fitness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. Breakthroughs in speaking can positively affect feelings at work, among friends, with strangers, and even within family dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

Despite humans being "evolved to speak" and possessing "incredible hardware" for it, self-consciousness, overthinking, and anxiety often constrain natural speaking abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. These accumulated "bugs in the software" from life situations prevent people from upgrading their speaking abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. The goal is to debug and upgrade this software, realizing that the inherent capacity to speak effectively already exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.

A core insight is that if one doesn't enjoy speaking, they're likely "doing it wrong" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. Enjoyment serves as a barometer for effective speaking, as it's a natural, rewarding activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. Dislike indicates overthinking and counterproductive behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. Great communicators appear comfortable and authentic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. Communication is enjoyable and empowering when one feels completely themselves, such as when talking to family or friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. Pressure in business settings often leads to trying to control words, which hinders natural, subconscious communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. Enjoyment is also crucial for consistent practice; otherwise, motivation will wane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.

Another fundamental principle is viewing speaking as a "subconscious flow-oriented process" rather than a conscious one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>. The best speaking occurs when one isn't thinking about the act of speaking, but is fully engaged with the message and audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>. The goal is to enter and maintain a flow state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. This shift in mindset changes how one approaches practice, focusing on root causes rather than symptoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>. For example, filler words or racing speech often stem from discomfort with slowing down or pausing under pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. Addressing this root cause eliminates the symptoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>. Monotonous or constrained speaking often indicates a struggle to be authentic or trust oneself under pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>. The process is about replacing bad habits with new ones to maintain flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>.

## Key Tactical Adjustments

Three key tactical adjustments can [[strategies_for_public_speaking_and_reducing_stage_fright | improve public speaking]]:
1.  **Look Up:** When gathering thoughts, people often look down, which appears unconfident, especially on video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>. Looking up makes one appear thoughtful and confident, reducing interruptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>. A simple reminder like "think up" on a sticky note can help form this new habit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>.
2.  **End Strong:** People tend to "end weak," either by trailing off or expressing self-doubt at the end of their statements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>. This can overshadow an otherwise strong delivery, similar to a bumpy landing after a smooth flight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>. Anticipate self-awareness popping up at the end and either land the plane definitively or use "summary prompts" (e.g., "so to wrap up," "in summary") to guide the brain to a strong conclusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>.
3.  **Stay in Character:** Speakers often self-sabotage by "leaking" their insecurities, such as laughing nervously or admitting they're "not making sense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:38">[00:22:38]</a>. The audience usually cannot perceive internal nervousness unless it's extreme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:18">[00:22:18]</a>. Sharing insecurities creates a negative filter through which the audience perceives the speaker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>. The solution is simply to not share insecurities, maintain composure, and "stay in it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:37">[00:24:37]</a>. This reinforces confidence, as positive audience reactions will confirm that internal feelings of nervousness were not visible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:27">[00:25:27]</a>. Most people speaking up in meetings feel nervous, but it's often imperceptible unless it's "through the roof" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:15">[00:26:15]</a>. The fear of being seen as a "bullshitter" can create an "immune response" that prevents people from speaking freely, but this fear itself indicates an awareness that prevents genuine bullshitting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:04">[01:21:04]</a>.

## Innovative Practice Methods (Games and Exercises)

[[improving_public_speaking_through_interactive_exercises | Public speaking cannot be learned without speaking]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:53">[00:29:53]</a>. Unlike cooking, where practice is intuitive, public speaking often defaults to reading articles, which is insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>. The good news is that the initial fear subsides quickly, replaced by reward and enjoyment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:54">[00:30:54]</a>.

Games are an effective [[innovative_methods_for_preparing_public_speeches | method for practice]] because they are fun, provide intrinsic reward, and facilitate "short, deliberate practice" followed by immediate feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:06">[00:31:06]</a>. The focus is on getting people to speak immediately rather than overthink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:17">[00:32:17]</a>. Games create "turbulence" on purpose, similar to flight simulators, to highlight areas needing improvement and build resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:13">[00:42:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:47">[00:42:47]</a>. This allows speakers to learn to "recover gracefully from their mistakes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:35">[00:43:35]</a>. Practicing hard things in low-stakes environments builds confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:14">[00:45:14]</a>.

### The "Conductor" Game

In "Conductor," a speaker is given a random topic and must speak for a set time (e.g., 70 seconds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:07">[00:35:07]</a>. Numbers from 1 to 10 appear on screen, representing different "intensities or states" the speaker must immediately embody (e.g., 7 for raising voice, 3 for calming energy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:30">[00:35:30]</a>. A "breathe" slide prompts a silent pause for relaxation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:01">[00:36:01]</a>.

*   **Benefits:** This game trains the ability to tap into different energies and emotions, leading to corresponding words and ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:28">[00:47:28]</a>. It reveals whether a speaker is more comfortable with high or low energy levels, or if they're stuck in the middle, providing a mirror to their current speaking habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:13">[00:49:13]</a>. The discomfort ("edge") felt during these exercises often indicates an area of growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:40">[01:06:40]</a>. It also helps speakers learn to "take up space" and be introspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:42">[00:50:42]</a>.

### The "Triple Step" Game

"Triple Step" helps speakers who struggle to stay on a single thought or get easily distracted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:12">[00:51:12]</a>. The speaker receives a random topic and, over a minute, must seamlessly integrate six random words or phrases that pop up on screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:50">[00:51:50]</a>. The goal is to make the words seem like a natural part of the speech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:07">[00:52:07]</a>. Words can be integrated literally or metaphorically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:08">[00:54:08]</a>.

*   **Benefits:** This game builds [[overcoming_anxiety_in_public_speaking | resiliency]] and the ability to stay composed amidst distractions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:19">[00:55:19]</a>. It makes regular talks seem easier by comparison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:38">[00:55:38]</a>. It also serves as a great brain warm-up before important meetings or presentations, engaging various parts of the brain necessary for communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:53">[00:55:53]</a>. The games help expand one's "range" and comfort zone in speaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a>.

### "Conviction Prompts"

This exercise, often part of a course, focuses on building executive presence and conviction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:55">[01:10:55]</a>. The speaker is given a random topic and then prompted with the beginning of sentences (e.g., "this matters a ton," "it astonishes me when") which they must complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:24">[01:10:24]</a>. These prompts are designed to force the speaker into a state of higher conviction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:46">[01:10:46]</a>.

*   **Benefits:** It helps speakers naturally bring out conviction in their words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:17">[01:14:17]</a>. For most people, adding more conviction to their ideas increases their chances of being heard and accepted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:43">[01:11:43]</a>. Speaking [[the_impact_of_confidence_and_mindset_in_public_speaking | out loud]] often helps new insights emerge, as forcing oneself to articulate thoughts can clarify what one truly knows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:11">[01:17:11]</a>.

## Strategic Preparation Methods

Traditional preparation methods often involve extensive writing and memorization, which is inefficient and prone to failure (like forgetting a line in a memorized poem) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:55">[01:25:55]</a>. The focus should shift from preparing *by writing* to preparing *by speaking* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:26">[01:26:26]</a>.

### The Accordion Method

The Accordion Method is a "revolutionizing" way to prepare speeches for scheduled situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:13">[01:24:13]</a>.
*   **Process:** After initial brainstorming (which can be written), the method uses time constraints to refine a talk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:15">[01:28:15]</a>.
    1.  **Going Down the Accordion:** Start with a longer time (e.g., 3 minutes) speaking on the topic, adhering to "stay in character" and "end strong" rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:44">[01:28:44]</a>. The goal is to get ideas into spoken word.
    2.  Repeat the speech, but progressively shorten the time (e.g., 2 minutes, 1 minute, down to 30 seconds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:15">[01:29:15]</a>. Each reduction forces the speaker to eliminate "noise" and identify the "essential pieces" or core message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:33">[01:29:33]</a>. This provides extreme clarity on the talk's essence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:56">[01:29:56]</a>.
    3.  **Going Up the Accordion:** From the shortest version (e.g., 30 seconds), gradually increase the time (e.g., back to 1 minute, 2 minutes, 3 minutes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:06">[01:30:06]</a>. With more time available, the speaker can intentionally reintroduce aligned content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:26">[01:30:26]</a>. This process internalizes the talk, making it flexible for various time frames and less reliant on memorization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:48">[01:30:48]</a>. The talk becomes "plastic," adaptable to different lengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:27">[01:32:27]</a>.

*   **Benefits:** The Accordion Method helps concentrate a talk to its most important nuggets, then expands on those with intentional additions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:59">[01:31:59]</a>. It's applicable for any talk length and can be used at both macro and micro levels (e.g., for specific sections of a speech) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:11">[01:36:11]</a>. It's a powerful tool for quickly developing a great talk, even for short-notice presentations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:45">[01:35:45]</a>.

### The Bow and Arrow Technique

This technique centers on a mindset shift: focus on "what you want your audience to remember" rather than "what you want to say" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:31">[01:38:31]</a>. Most people only remember one key thing from a talk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:02">[01:39:02]</a>.

*   **Process:**
    1.  **The Arrow:** This is the "one thing" you want people to remember, articulated as a single sentence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:19">[01:39:19]</a>. This serves as a "North Star" for the entire presentation, providing clarity for both speaker and audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:42">[01:39:42]</a>.
    2.  **The Bow:** To make the arrow impactful, you need to "pull the bow back" by adding "weight" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:02">[01:40:02]</a>. This weight comes in the form of supporting elements like interesting anecdotes, data points, or stories that add emotion or illustration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:10">[01:40:10]</a>.

*   **Benefits:** The process of clarifying the arrow and developing the bow is iterative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:33">[01:40:33]</a>. It ensures every element supports the main takeaway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:16">[01:41:16]</a>. This technique also applies at a micro level; each slide in a presentation should have "one thing" it wants the audience to remember, potentially as its title <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:26">[01:42:26]</a>. This prevents overwhelming the audience with too much information and ensures impactful delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:46">[01:42:46]</a>.

## Final Encouragement

The journey of tackling public speaking is deeply empowering and can be addictive once improvement is seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:02">[01:05:02]</a>. Because humans possess innate speaking abilities, results can be achieved quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:10">[01:05:10]</a>. The fear primarily lies in "thinking about doing the exercise" rather than the act itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:26">[01:05:26]</a>. [[Overcoming limiting beliefs | The more constrained one feels with speaking]], the more transformative the journey will be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:19">[01:44:19]</a>. It's encouraged to take the first step and begin practicing, as it can be exhilarating and energizing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:26">[01:44:26]</a>.

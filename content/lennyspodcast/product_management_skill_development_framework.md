Vikyath Devaya, Head of Product at Gojek, a company often highlighted for its strong product and design talent, has developed a comprehensive [[career_growth_strategies_for_product_managers | career growth framework]] for product managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:50">[00:54:50]</a>. He is recognized as one of Asia's most prominent product leaders, with his name frequently mentioned when asking for favorite product leaders in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

## Vikyath Devaya's Career Growth Framework: The Three W's

Devaya's framework for [[career_growth_strategies_for_product_managers | product manager career growth]] is built around "Three W's":
1.  **What you produce** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>
2.  **What you bring to the table** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>
3.  **What's your operating model** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>

He notes that successful product managers often excel in at least two, if not all three, of these areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

### What You Produce

This aspect focuses on the tangible outputs of a product manager's work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.
*   **Outputs First**: Early in a product manager's career, the primary focus should be on outputs rather than solely on [[impact_in_product_management | impact]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. This includes tasks like launching products, analyzing experiments, or contributing to go-to-market strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. The emphasis is on "just getting stuff out and done" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.
    *   **Focus on Execution**: When starting out, the goal is to ship products and be helpful by producing tangible results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. People need things done, and a good output means doing things that are helpful to the team and manager, shipping bug-free and on time, and having a clear roadmap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.
    *   **Being Useful**: Product managers should strive to be useful by making their team more effective and helping the company succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>. This includes helping leaders with tasks like preparing briefs, slides for leadership reviews, or legal reviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.
*   **Transition to Outcomes**: As product managers gain comfort with outputs and working with stakeholders, they transition to focusing on outcomes, which involve owning or collaborating on product area goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.
*   **Leadership and Direction**: The final stage involves leadership and directional areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.
*   **Maintain Outputs at All Levels**: Even at senior levels, product managers must not forget their individual contributor (IC) roots and be willing to "pull up their sleeves" and work on outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. This demonstrates commitment and earns credibility with the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.

### What You Bring to the Table

This refers to a product manager's "impact on [[impact_in_product_management | impact]]" â€“ demonstrating how they contribute to the success of a product area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>.
*   **Quality of Artifacts**: This involves producing high-quality [[product_management_competencies | product management competencies]] and artifacts, such as:
    *   Product Requirement Documents (PRDs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>
    *   Product notes for care and marketing teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>
    *   Product strategy documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>
    *   Briefs for design teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>
    *   Effective definition of north stars, experiments, data, and metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>
*   **Beyond Strategy**: While some operating models suggest strategy-only roles, Devaya emphasizes that product managers, especially early to mid-career, must produce these artifacts themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>.
*   **Demonstrating Skills**: The quality of these artifacts is the best way to demonstrate proficiency in key product pillars:
    *   Data and metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>
    *   Design and research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>
    *   Technology skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>
    *   Strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>
*   **"I Got This" Aura**: A product manager should cultivate an aura of reliability, where others feel confident that tasks assigned to them will be handled well and on time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>.

### What's Your Operating Model

This is considered the most crucial aspect for transitioning from mid-senior to senior levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>. It encompasses:
*   Communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>
*   Collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>
*   Organizational skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:13">[00:19:13]</a>
*   Community skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a>

> 1.  Raise difficult issues without being difficult to work with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a>.
> 2.  Bring out important topics without drawing importance to yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>.
> 3.  You are in charge of getting decisions made, not making all the decisions yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>.

*   **Art of Pushing Back**: Product managers should be able to push back on bad ideas in a constructive way, avoiding being seen as an obstacle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:32">[00:24:32]</a>. The key is to shift conversations from an emotional space to a logical one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:53">[00:25:53]</a>.
*   **Earned Influence**: Early in one's career, product managers haven't "earned the right" to inform strategy and vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>. This influence is built over time through consistent output and quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>. This mindset applies even when joining a new team or company at a senior level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>.

## Impediments to [[career_growth_strategies_for_product_managers | Career Growth]]

Vikyath Devaya identifies three main mindset shifts that can hinder a product manager's growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:33">[00:27:33]</a>:
1.  **Focusing on things beyond your control**: As product managers become mid-senior, they sometimes shift focus from personal learning and growth to external factors like organizational strategy, stakeholder actions, or project assignments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:45">[00:28:45]</a>. It's crucial to consistently focus on what *can* be controlled, such as output, artifacts, and operating model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:08">[00:29:08]</a>.
2.  **Relationship with change**: Early career stages often involve rapid skill acquisition and growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:05">[00:30:05]</a>. However, at mid-senior levels, the rate of change can slow down due to reluctance to take on new challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:28">[00:30:28]</a>.
    *   **Continuous Improvement**: To counteract this, product managers should benchmark themselves against the best in the industry or other functions to identify areas for improvement and maintain a high "rate of change" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:53">[00:30:53]</a>.
3.  **How you see yourself (self-stories)**: Product managers can tell themselves stories about their identity (e.g., "high agency PM," "hyper-collaborative person") that can inadvertently excuse weaknesses (e.g., being brash, indecisive) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a>.
    *   **Self-Correction**: It's vital to identify and correct these limiting self-stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:10">[00:33:10]</a>. Being a "learner" is an enabling self-story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:53">[00:35:53]</a>.

## Core [[key_skills_for_product_managers | Product Management Skills]] / [[product_management_competencies | Competencies]]

Product managers are evaluated across several key axes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:31">[00:38:31]</a>:
*   **Data & Metrics**: From defining basic metrics to having ninja-level data analysis skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:38">[00:53:38]</a>.
*   **Design & Research**: From identifying user problems to tying them to business goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:19">[00:54:19]</a>.
*   **Technology Skills**: From understanding basic concepts (HTTP, API) to deep technical debates and writing design documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:42">[00:54:42]</a>.
*   **Strategy**: From relying on others for direction to articulating coherent product strategies that define *how* to achieve corporate and business goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:19">[00:55:19]</a>. This includes defining user segments, their needs, and the product roadmap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:58">[00:55:58]</a>.
*   **Communication**: How effectively you convey information and ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>.
*   **Collaboration**: Working effectively with diverse stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>.
*   **Organizational Skills**: Managing tasks, processes, and people efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:13">[00:19:13]</a>.
*   **Community**: Being a "community enabler" within the team and organization, fostering cohesion towards a common mission, especially in remote or distributed teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:26">[00:52:26]</a>.

> [!tip] Focused Skill Development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:07">[00:39:07]</a>
> Product managers should not try to improve on every area simultaneously. Instead, pick one or two areas that offer the "maximum leverage" for growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:09">[00:39:09]</a>.
> *   If coming from a design/research background, focus on data or technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:22">[00:41:22]</a>.
> *   If coming from a data/tech background, focus on design/research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:27">[00:41:27]</a>.
> *   Once proficient in two of these three, then focus on strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:40]</a>.
> *   For "softer" skills like communication, collaboration, and community, continuous lifelong learning is expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:38">[00:40:38]</a>.

## Defining the Product Manager Role

The product manager role is often ambiguous and varies across companies and teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:56">[00:46:56]</a>.
*   **Unblocking Progress**: A key principle is that if something is blocking product progress, the product manager should work on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:06">[00:48:06]</a>.
*   **Art and Science**: Product management is both an art and a science, with skills that improve with practice and can be taught through frameworks and methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:03">[00:49:03]</a>.
*   **The Connecting Role**: The product manager is the unique discipline that "encircles" and co-collaborates across strategy, technology, design, and data, tying all these functions together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:41">[00:49:41]</a>. They are the only ones pairing with everyone else, gaining unique insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:06">[00:50:06]</a>.
*   **Focus on Role, Not Title**: It's more important to see oneself as playing a specific role within the team rather than being defined by a title or function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:20">[00:51:20]</a>. The PM's role is to elevate the team's overall contribution and energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:27">[00:50:27]</a>.

## Contrarian Views

Devaya shares two beliefs that may be considered contrarian in some circles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:02">[00:57:02]</a>:
1.  **Intent is Not Enough**: While good intentions are important, they are insufficient. Actions, behavior, and communication must also effectively convey the desired message and intent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:34">[00:57:34]</a>.
2.  **Effort and Hours Matter**: Putting in significant effort and hours is often necessary for personal growth and skill development, regardless of company-specific career paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:16">[00:58:16]</a>. This contrasts with views that might downplay the role of sustained hard work.

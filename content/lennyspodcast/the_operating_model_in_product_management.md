The "operating model" is one of three core components of a [[product_management_career_advice | career growth framework for product managers]], alongside "what you produce" and "what you bring to the table" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. According to VR Demon, Head of Product at Gojek, strong product managers who are rising in their careers typically perform well across all three of these areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. The operating model is considered the "most important thing" to focus on when transitioning from mid-senior to senior levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>.

## Defining the Operating Model

An effective operating model in [[product_management_insights | product management]] is essentially about:
*   Communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>
*   Collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>
*   Organizational skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:13">[00:19:13]</a>
*   Community skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a>

It defines how product managers interact and work with other stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:28">[00:19:28]</a>. The prevailing "folklore" that product managers are "mini CEOs" can sometimes lead people astray in how they operate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:56">[00:46:56]</a>.

## Three Tenets for Effective Collaboration

To work well with others, product managers should adhere to three key tenets:

1.  **Raise difficult issues without being difficult to work with.** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:44">[00:20:44]</a>
2.  **Bring out important topics without drawing importance to yourself.** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:48">[00:20:48]</a>
3.  **Be in charge of getting decisions made, not making all the decisions yourself.** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>

These tenets are easy to state but challenging to embody and display daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>. Mastering them is a continuous struggle regardless of one's level in [[product_management_career_advice | product management]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>.

### Pushing Back Effectively

When pushing back against ideas, avoid being perceived as an obstacle or hindrance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:44">[00:24:44]</a>. The goal is to add value and help advance the product and its direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:55">[00:24:55]</a>. Successful pushback involves shifting the conversation from an emotional to a more logical space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:53">[00:25:53]</a>.

## Impact of the Operating Model on Career Growth

A product manager's operating model significantly impacts their [[product_management_career_advice | career growth]]. Mindset shifts, particularly concerning aspects within and beyond one's control, play a crucial role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:33">[00:27:33]</a>.

### Focusing on What You Control

Product managers, especially as they become mid-senior, often shift their focus to things outside their control, such as organizational strategy or stakeholder behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:45">[00:28:45]</a>. To ensure continuous growth, it is vital to keep the focus on what can be controlled, such as:
*   What you produce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:35">[00:29:35]</a>
*   What you bring to the table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:37">[00:29:37]</a>
*   Your operating model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:39">[00:29:39]</a>

These areas offer ample opportunities for development in data, technology, communication, collaboration, design, research, and strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:42">[00:29:42]</a>.

### Relationship with Change

Early in a career, the rate of change and skill acquisition is high, leading to rapid growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:05">[00:30:05]</a>. However, as product managers become mid-senior, they may resist taking on new challenges, slowing down their rate of change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:28">[00:30:28]</a>. It's crucial to continuously seek ways to increase this rate of change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:46">[00:30:46]</a>. Benchmarking against industry bests, not just internal peers, can help identify areas for improvement and maintain a hunger for learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:04">[00:31:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:02">[00:35:02]</a>.

### Self-Perception

The stories product managers tell themselves about their capabilities (e.g., "high agency PM" or "hyper-collaborative person") can inadvertently hinder growth by creating blind spots or excuses for weaknesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a>.

> "Figure out what is the story that you are telling yourself... and then correct those stories and the moment you are able to correct those stories you may be back on the growth paths again." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:24">[00:33:24]</a>

Being a "learner" is an enabling self-story that promotes continuous improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:51">[00:35:51]</a>.

## Navigating Role Ambiguity

The product management role is often ambiguous and not concretely defined across companies and even within different divisions of the same company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:07">[00:47:07]</a>. This confusion extends to stakeholders who may not know what to expect from a product manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:47">[00:47:47]</a>.

The general rule is that if something is blocking product progress, the product manager should work on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:06">[00:48:06]</a>. Product management can be seen as a discipline that improves with practice, much like acting or dancing, with both an "art" and a "science" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:32">[00:48:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:09">[00:49:09]</a>.

Instead of obsessing over a precise definition of the role, focus on your contributions across key areas:
*   **Data:** Understanding metrics, analyzing experiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:32">[00:37:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:57">[00:53:57]</a>.
*   **Design and Research:** Identifying user problems and tying them to business goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:35">[00:37:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:21">[00:54:21]</a>.
*   **Technology:** Understanding technical concepts and engaging in deep debates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">[00:37:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:42">[00:54:42]</a>.
*   **Strategy:** Defining *how* to achieve a broader corporate or business goal, focusing on user segments, needs, and product roadmap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:41">[00:37:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:19">[00:55:19]</a>.

Product managers are the central point that collaborates with and ties together these diverse disciplines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:52">[00:49:52]</a>. They possess a unique insight by virtue of pairing with everyone else on the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:06">[00:50:06]</a>. The role of the PM is not about the title, but about playing a contributing role to elevate the team's overall contribution and energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:20">[00:51:20]</a>.

### The Importance of Community

In today's increasingly remote and distributed environments, the product manager also serves as a "community enabler" within the team and organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:26">[00:52:26]</a>. This soft aspect helps tie everyone together towards a common mission of delivering an output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:35">[00:52:35]</a>.

Tinder and Hinge are both dating applications that share the underlying use case of helping people meet each other. However, their core [[product_strategy_stack | missions and strategies]] diverge significantly, leading to distinct product experiences and business approaches. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:16">[00:30:16]</a>

## Mission Differences

*   **Hinge:** Hinge's mission is "designed to be deleted." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:42">[00:29:42]</a> This implies a focus on helping users find long-term relationships so they can stop using the app, marking success as the app's deletion. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:50">[00:29:50]</a>
*   **Tinder:** Tinder's mission is "to make single life more fun." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:58">[00:29:58]</a> It aims to be an app that remains on users' phones throughout their single life, offering a continuous experience. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>

## Company Strategy Differences

Both companies employ a freemium monetization model, allowing free use with paid features. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:31">[00:30:31]</a> However, their customer acquisition strategies differ:

*   **Hinge:** Relies heavily on television advertisements to reach its target audience. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:46">[00:30:46]</a>
*   **Tinder:** Emphasizes influencer marketing and event-based marketing. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:53">[00:30:53]</a>

### Tinder's Monetization Model
Tinder's monetization has two main components:
1.  **Subscriptions:**
    *   **Tinder Plus:** A base subscription. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:24">[00:35:24]</a>
    *   **Tinder Gold:** A higher tier that allows users to see everyone who has swiped right on them, effectively breaking the standard swipe-to-match rule. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:30">[00:35:30]</a>
    *   **Tinder Platinum:** A third, more expensive tier that bundles additional features and consumables. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:33">[00:38:33]</a>
2.  **A La Carte Products (Microtransactions):** These can be purchased in bulk. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:59">[00:35:59]</a>
    *   **Super Likes:** Allow users to send a special like to an individual, increasing the likelihood of a match threefold. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:08">[00:36:08]</a>
    *   **Boost:** Increases the frequency with which a user's profile appears in others' feeds. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:23">[00:36:23]</a>
    *   **Super Like with a Note:** A more expensive feature that allows users to send an initial message to someone before matching, breaking the traditional no-chat-before-match rule and further indicating strong interest. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:51">[00:38:51]</a>

Tinder observed that a small percentage of users were spending hundreds of dollars a month on Boost and Super Likes. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:39">[00:36:39]</a> These users were often military personnel, sales professionals, or new city residents with an intense use case for meeting people. <a class="yt>timestamp" data-t="00:37:04">[00:37:04]</a> They framed the cost of Tinder not against other subscriptions, but against the cost of dating, seeing it as a small investment to effectively meet people. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:24">[00:37:24]</a>

## Product Strategy & Features Differences

*   **Tinder:** Originated the swipe-based dating experience, designed for a "lightweight experience where swiping is really fast, getting into a match is really easy, chatting is really easy." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:07">[00:31:07]</a> Tinder profiles are generally very simple. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:33">[00:31:33]</a>
*   **Hinge:** Positioned as a "post-swipe dating app," it deliberately avoided the swiping mechanic. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:21">[00:31:21]</a> Instead, Hinge encourages users to spend more time on profiles and provides "prompts" to facilitate deeper connections and conversations, aiming for long-term relationships. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:27">[00:31:27]</a>

### Tinder's Resistance to Filters
Despite almost every dating app offering extensive filters (e.g., occupation, income, religion, height, smoking preference), Tinder largely resisted implementing these. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:05">[00:33:05]</a> This decision stemmed from a product philosophy to encourage users to get to know each other and chat, rather than treating Tinder as a "search engine for people." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:28">[00:33:28]</a> By maintaining a lightweight and serendipitous experience, Tinder allows users to meet people they might not have otherwise encountered. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:57">[00:33:57]</a>

## Similarities in Product Roadmap & Goals

Both Tinder and Hinge had a "significant investment in video chat post pandemic," recognizing the need for online interaction before in-person meetings. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:55">[00:31:55]</a>

Ultimately, both companies share similar high-level goals: they measure success based on "meaningful conversations," aiming for users to match and then chat with each other. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:11">[00:32:11]</a> However, the specific product mechanics used to achieve these conversations differ due to their distinct [[product_strategy_stack | product strategies]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:19">[00:32:19]</a>

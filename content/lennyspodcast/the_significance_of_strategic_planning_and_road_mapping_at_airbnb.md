At [[airbnbs_unique_company_culture_and_growth | Airbnb]], strategic planning and a centralized roadmap have become foundational to the company's product development and overall direction. This approach, heavily influenced by CEO [[brian_cheskys_leadership_style_and_organizational_changes_at_airbnb | Brian Chesky's leadership style]], aims to foster clarity, alignment, and accelerated innovation.

## The Evolution of Strategic Direction

Initially, [[brian_cheskys_leadership_style and_organizational_changes_at_airbnb | Brian Chesky]] observed a common cycle in companies where founders delegate product direction, leading to fragmentation, optimization work, small thinking, and an increase in bureaucracy and politics [00:15:42]. He realized that becoming less involved in projects often led to more "spin," unclear goals, less team advocacy, fewer resources, and slower progress, creating a paradox where delegation resulted in slower movement [00:17:44].

By late 2019, [[airbnbs_unique_company_culture_and_growth | Airbnb]] was experiencing these issues: a slow product, rising costs, increased politics, bureaucracy, and dependencies [00:20:37]. Employees reported working 80 hours but only achieving 20 hours of productive work [00:20:53]. The company had become divisional, with ten different divisions (e.g., flights, homes, experiences) operating in separate directions, leading to a lack of cohesion and making the CEO's role reactive [00:22:27].

The near-death business experience during the pandemic provided the clarity needed for a drastic strategic shift [00:24:39]. [[brian_cheskys_leadership_style_and_organizational_changes_at_airbnb | Brian Chesky]] decided to run [[airbnbs_unique_company_culture_and_growth | Airbnb]] more like a startup again, getting deeply involved in the details [00:24:49].

## A Centralized Product Roadmap and Functional Model

A key element of this new strategy is a single, company-wide product roadmap:

*   **Rolling Two-Year Plan** [[product_strategy_and_vision_development | Product strategy and vision development]]: [[Airbnbs unique company culture and growth | Airbnb]] now operates with a rolling two-year product plan, updated every six months with releases [00:14:10]. This contrasts with previous three-month planning cycles [00:13:58].
*   **Bi-Annual Launches**: Products are released every May and November/October, ensuring the entire company works and "rows in the same direction" towards these specific launch dates [00:14:21].
*   **Mandatory Roadmap Inclusion**: Every single thing developed in the company, with minor exceptions for infrastructure projects, must be on this roadmap [00:28:21].
*   **CEO Review Cycle**: [[brian_cheskys_leadership_style_and_organizational_changes_at_airbnb | Brian Chesky]] personally reviews all product and marketing work on a regular cadence (weekly, bi-weekly, etc.) [00:28:31]. This allows him to identify bottlenecks and ensure teams collaborate [00:29:49]. This direct involvement eliminates the need for managing by influence or extensive bureaucracy, as issues are immediately addressed and resolved [00:29:02].

This centralized roadmap is supported by a shift to a purely functional organizational model, moving away from divisional structures [00:25:52]. Functions like design, engineering, [[the_role_of_product_management_and_marketing_integration_at_airbnb | product marketing]], marketing, communications, sales, and operations now report directly to expert functional leaders [00:25:56].

### The CEO as Chief Product Officer

[[brian_cheskys_leadership_style_and_organizational_changes_at_airbnb | Brian Chesky]] believes the CEO of a product or tech company should essentially be the chief product officer [00:16:41]. His deep involvement, which he distinguishes from micromanagement, means being "in the details" to understand performance and progress [00:32:33]. He pulls decision-making inward, creating "one shared consciousness" among the top 30-40 leaders [00:27:12].

### Integrated Product and Marketing

A critical aspect of this strategy is the integration of product development with marketing. Product managers now also handle product marketing, responsible for both inbound development and outbound marketing responsibilities [00:07:05].

> "You can't build a product unless you know how to talk about the product. You can't be an expert in making the product unless you're also an expert in the market of it." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>

This integration ensures that products are designed with their communication and distribution in mind from the outset [00:08:06]. Product teams now understand the story, demos, and customer touchpoints before launch [00:14:32]. The story of a product often dictates its development, leading to a more cohesive outcome [00:14:57]. This approach allows the company to build a great product and ensure people know about it, avoiding the trap of shipping un-marketed features [00:08:09].

## Driving Growth and Overcoming Challenges

This strategic shift has enabled [[airbnbs_unique_company_culture_and_growth | Airbnb]] to move away from heavy reliance on traditional growth channels like paid advertising [00:01:40]. The bet is that building the best possible product and effectively telling people about it will naturally drive growth [00:01:44].

The benefits of this integrated and centralized strategic planning include:

*   **Reduced Scope**: Cutting down the number of simultaneous projects from potentially thousands to a focused 20% [00:25:30].
*   **Fewer Layers of Management**: Streamlining the organizational structure for faster decision-making [00:25:46].
*   **Smaller, More Senior Teams**: Prioritizing impact over headcount, with fewer than 7,000 employees for an $80 billion global business [00:26:05].
*   **Expert Leadership**: Ensuring every executive is a functional expert in their domain, managing both work and people [00:26:31].
*   **Eliminating Bureaucracy**: Direct CEO involvement and frequent reviews reduce politics, dependencies, and accountability issues [00:29:02].
*   **Cohesive Product Experience**: Preventing fragmentation by having a single roadmap and integrated teams, ensuring a product feels like "10 people did it" rather than a thousand [00:15:08].

## Setting Ambitious Goals and Fostering Growth

A key aspect of this strategic mindset is the "add a zero" philosophy, which encourages teams to think 10x bigger or aim to do something 10 times better or faster [00:46:35]. This forces teams to approach problems differently, applying "first principle thinking" to break down and reconstruct foundational elements [00:47:00]. This also helps set a decisive pace for the company, favoring a "bias for action" over delayed decisions [00:47:56].

[[brian_cheskys_leadership_style_and_organizational_changes_at_airbnb | Brian Chesky]] also emphasizes that leaders must see the potential in their teams that they may not see in themselves, fostering a growth mindset where pushing for better outcomes is seen as a belief in their capabilities [00:49:13]. This strategic thinking allows for continuous improvement and innovation, moving the company forward rather than getting bogged down in "fake work" or reactive tasks [00:57:37].

## Long-Term Vision and Continuous Learning

The company's strategy is framed as a long-term narrative, with each product release considered a "chapter of a story or like an episode of TV series" [00:38:20]. This commitment to a five or ten-year story ensures that product development is purposeful and contributes to a larger vision [00:38:24].

[[brian_cheskys_leadership_style_and_organizational_changes_at_airbnb | Brian Chesky]] maintains a "beginner's mindset" and a strong sense of curiosity to constantly learn and adapt [00:59:19]. He studies the history of organizational structures, seeks help from others (like Sam Altman and Michael Seibel), and believes in teaching as a way to learn [01:00:14]. This continuous learning is crucial for a leader to keep pace with the business's growth and evolving market [01:02:06].

In essence, [[airbnbs_unique_company_culture_and_growth | Airbnb]]'s strategic planning and roadmapping, driven by a centralized vision and integrated functions, allows the company to operate with the agility and coherence of a startup while managing the scale of a global enterprise.

A critical framework for product leaders is the product strategy stack, which aims to clarify terms often conflated like goals, roadmap, and strategy, separating them into distinct, clearly defined parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>. This framework helps product managers (PMs) understand the framework they should use to make decisions and drive value for the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>.

## The Product Strategy Stack

Difficulty in prioritizing or surfacing tactical issues in day-to-day operations can often be traced back to fundamental gaps in a PM's understanding of strategy, or because the strategy itself hasn't been completely defined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>. The product strategy stack is designed to address this by providing a clear hierarchy:

1.  **Company Mission**: This is the overarching "change the company wants to bring to the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:08">[00:20:08]</a>. It's a qualitative, inspirational statement defining the company's purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:15">[00:20:15]</a>. The concept of "vision" can be integrated into the mission, describing the future world and the company's role within it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>.
2.  **Company Strategy**: While the mission is aspirational, the strategy is "rigorously logical" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:34">[00:20:34]</a>. It's the specific, rigorous, logical plan the company uses to achieve its mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:39">[00:20:39]</a>.
3.  **Product Strategy**: This serves as the "connective tissue" between what the company aims to accomplish and the daily activities of the product team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>. The [[Importance of product vision and strategy alignment | product strategy]] should inform the roadmap.
4.  **Roadmap**: Derived from the product strategy.
5.  **Goals**: Ultimately informed by the roadmap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:18">[00:21:18]</a>.

### Debugging Strategy with the Stack

The product strategy stack also serves as a diagnostic tool. If a team struggles to meet its goals, it might be due to an ill-aligned roadmap. If the roadmap isn't right, the [[importance_of_strategy_and_decision_making_in_product_management | product strategy]] might not be clearly articulated. If the product strategy is off, it could stem from a lack of deep understanding of the company's overall strategy and how the product fits into the overarching mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:38">[00:21:38]</a>.

### Example: Tinder vs. Hinge

Comparing Tinder and Hinge illustrates the impact of differing missions and strategies on product development:

*   **Hinge's Mission**: "Designed to be deleted" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:42">[00:29:42]</a>, aiming for users to find a long-term relationship and leave the app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:50">[00:29:50]</a>.
*   **Tinder's Mission**: "Make single life more fun" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:57">[00:29:57]</a>, intending to be a continuous presence on users' phones throughout their single years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:03">[00:30:03]</a>.

These distinct missions lead to different company and product strategies:

*   **Company Strategy**: Both use a freemium monetization model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:31">[00:30:31]</a>, but their customer acquisition differs. Hinge relies on television ads to reach its target audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:46">[00:30:46]</a>, while Tinder utilizes influencer and event-based marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:53">[00:30:53]</a>.
*   **Product Strategy**: Tinder pioneered the lightweight, fast-swiping experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:07">[00:31:07]</a>. Hinge, as a "post-swipe" app, deliberately avoided swiping, encouraging users to spend more time on profiles with prompts to spark deeper conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:21">[00:31:21]</a>.
*   **Roadmap Differences**: This strategic divergence leads to different product features. Tinder's resistance to extensive filters, for example, reflects its goal of promoting serendipitous connections rather than acting as a "search engine for people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:34">[00:33:34]</a>.

Understanding these differences in mission and strategy helps determine when a product decision should align with competitors and when it should diverge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:36">[00:32:36]</a>.

## Aligning Goals with Strategy

A common pitfall is a "goals-first" approach, where a company sets a target (e.g., increase revenue by X) and then expects a strategy to emerge. This often leads to teams focusing solely on moving metrics without a clear understanding of what true success looks like or why <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:05">[00:43:05]</a>.

Instead, the process should resemble planning a road trip: first, decide the destination (the company mission and strategy), and then use goals as a measure of progress towards that destination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:25">[00:43:25]</a>. If achieving a goal pulls the product away from the intended destination, it prompts a crucial conversation about either foregoing that gain or re-evaluating the destination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:57">[00:43:57]</a>.

### Strategic Impact and Business Outcomes

The product strategy area of the competencies framework emphasizes the importance of owning business outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:22">[00:59:22]</a>. Product managers must understand how their product's features contribute to the business and drive value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:31">[00:59:31]</a>. Product [[Developing and communicating a product vision | vision and roadmapping]] involves combining individual pieces of work into a coherent plan that builds toward the product and company strategies over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:42">[00:59:42]</a>. Ultimately, the "strategic impact" is about ensuring that the sequence of business outcomes moves the overall strategy forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:03">[01:00:03]</a>. This highlights the [[Executing strategy effectively in product management | importance of strategy and decision making in product management]].

## Strategic Impact in Practice

At TripAdvisor, the goal was to encourage users to come directly to the site for trip planning, rather than relying on Google searches. While product teams were focused on optimizing for immediate bookings, this often undermined the long-term strategy of building a continuous relationship with the user through comprehensive trip planning features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:22">[00:45:22]</a>. Without a clear strategy, efforts to drive short-term metrics could inadvertently steer the product away from its long-term objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:41">[00:46:41]</a>.

This reinforces the idea that an explicitly defined mission and strategy are paramount for guiding product development, ensuring that all efforts contribute to the desired long-term outcomes and prevent teams from being swayed by short-term gains that may not align with the broader company direction.

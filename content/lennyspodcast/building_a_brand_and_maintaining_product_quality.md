In any domain or industry, the more a product matters, the more its design matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. When new paradigms like mobile or the web emerge, initial product iterations don't necessarily require exceptionally good design because they are the first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. However, as a market matures and becomes crowded (e.g., hundreds of email clients), the bar for design significantly rises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Today, a high level of design is a fundamental requirement for a product to capture attention or be taken seriously from the very beginning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

This philosophy is central to [[building_and_evolving_a_software_product | Linear]], a project and issue tracking system co-founded by Kii Sarin, who previously served as founding designer at Coinbase and principal designer at Airbnb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Linear is recognized for its rapid growth and being a beloved issue tracking tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. Kii Sarin and his team prioritize craft and quality, focusing on taste and opinions rather than A/B tests or metric-based goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

## The Importance of Design and Quality
Kii Sarin believes that [[improving_user_experience_and_product_quality | design]] becomes a critical differentiator in crowded markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:04">[00:25:04]</a>. When consumers have numerous choices, they often gravitate towards what looks best or appears to be the highest quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:51">[00:29:51]</a>. Design also sets user expectations: good design, like attractive packaging for Apple products, can convey a sense of high quality even before the product is used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:10">[00:28:10]</a>. This makes design "very good leverage in the beginning," especially when a company or product is unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:03">[00:29:03]</a>.

While design is essential, it alone doesn't guarantee a company's success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:22">[00:27:22]</a>. The product itself must offer unique value or be inherently better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:31">[00:27:31]</a>. Design functions similarly to technology, enabling certain functionalities and improving the overall user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:37">[00:27:37]</a>.

### Linear's Focus on Quality
Linear prioritizes quality because it directly impacts collaboration and coordination within software development teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. Any friction or "paper cuts" in the user experience can make the tool annoying to use, hindering its primary purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

## Linear's Approach to Maintaining Product Quality
Linear's approach to [[improving_user_experience_and_product_quality | product quality]] and [[the_importance_of_craft_and_values_in_product_development | craft]] involves several key principles:

*   **Hiring for Craft**: The process starts with hiring individuals who inherently care about craft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.
*   **Balancing Perfection and Speed**: While there are occasional trade-offs, like slightly delaying a launch to fix a design issue, these delays are typically a matter of days, not complete reworks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. Linear balances the desire for perfection with the need to ship quickly, continuously improving released features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.
*   **Iterative Development and Feedback**:
    *   **Internal Testing**: New features are initially shipped to production but are only visible to the internal team for testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
    *   **Beta Programs**: Customers can opt into beta programs where features may still be "janky" but allow for early feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.
    *   **Co-creation**: For larger features, Linear works closely with a select group of large companies to co-create and refine the feature, gathering feedback throughout the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.
*   **Empowering Teams**: Linear grants project teams (composed of engineers and designers) significant ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>. This allows them to identify and implement improvements (e.g., an engineer noticing an opportunity to improve the usability of a right-click menu by implementing "safe areas" for diagonal cursor movement) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>.
*   **Leadership and Culture**: [[the_importance_of_craft_and_values_in_product_development | Craft and quality]] must be valued by the company's leadership and ingrained in the company culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. Founders, regardless of their background, need to align on this value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>.
*   **Minimal Product Management**: Linear operates with only one product manager (Head of Product), believing that empowering engineers and designers to take on broader responsibilities, including product thinking, leads to higher quality outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>. Project leads (either an engineer or designer) are responsible for getting projects started, collaborating with the team, and communicating progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:04">[00:35:04]</a>.
*   **No Metric-Based Goals for Features**: Linear does not set specific numerical goals for individual features or launches, though company-level goals (e.g., weekly active users) exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:41">[00:43:41]</a>. The focus is on solving problems, with success measured by customer satisfaction and agreement that the problem is resolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:56">[00:44:56]</a>.
*   **"Magic and Science" Approach**: Linear combines "science" (extensive user research, team understanding of customer problems) with "magic" (intuition and judgment derived from deep customer empathy) to make product decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:34">[00:45:34]</a>. The entire team is encouraged to engage with customers through calls, Slack channels, and by answering questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:16">[00:46:16]</a>. This comprehensive understanding allows them to trust their intuition and make choices without solely relying on data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:41">[00:47:41]</a>. This approach requires a culture that embraces mistakes and views them as fixable opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:52">[00:49:52]</a>.
*   **Product Reviews**: Design reviews occur weekly or bi-weekly, with project sponsors (co-founders, Head of Product) reviewing the work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:38">[00:33:38]</a>. Final approval for release is based on the subjective assessment of whether the product meets the desired quality standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:27">[00:38:27]</a>, often involving hands-on testing by Kii Sarin himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:10">[00:34:10]</a>.

## Building an Opinionated Product
Linear believes that productivity software, especially for companies, should be "opinionated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:40">[00:39:40]</a>. This means providing good defaults and clear workflows, so users and teams don't have to spend excessive time configuring the tool or figuring out how to use it in different ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:27">[00:40:27]</a>. The aim is to offer the most optimized solution, allowing users to focus on their actual work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:01">[00:41:01]</a>.

## Consistent Cycles (The Linear Method)
A core element of the [[building_and_evolving_a_software_product | Linear method]] is the use of "Cycles," which are optional but recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:35">[00:41:35]</a>. Cycles provide a way to define a focused set of priorities for a specific time frame (e.g., one or two weeks) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:12">[00:42:12]</a>. This helps teams concentrate on selected tasks and avoid distractions from an ever-growing list of things to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:59">[00:41:59]</a>. These cycles run on an automated schedule, reducing manual setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:03">[00:43:03]</a>.

## Building a Brand
Kii Sarin emphasizes that a brand should be authentic and communicate a clear message or voice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:59">[00:30:59]</a>. A brand is not built overnight; it develops over time through consistent actions, communication, customer treatment, and the design of the product and website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:33">[00:31:33]</a>. For example, Airbnb's strong brand means people directly go to "airbnb.com" instead of searching for "places to stay" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:50">[00:32:50]</a>. A strong brand can draw people to a company and product, aiding user acquisition and retention, and positively influencing product perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:56">[00:27:56]</a>.

### Early Growth and Product-Market Fit
Linear officially started in April 2019, with initial prototyping and a focus on making the application exceptionally fast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:42">[01:08:42]</a>. They publicly announced the company in mid-April 2019 with a waitlist on their website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:35">[01:09:35]</a>. By May, they were using the product internally, and by June, they began inviting friends and then people from the waitlist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:44">[01:09:44]</a>.

Linear maintained a private beta stage for almost a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:07">[01:10:07]</a>. The waitlist included a survey asking about current tools and company size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:17">[01:10:17]</a>. They selectively invited smaller companies that used tools Linear currently supported and showed genuine interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:28">[01:10:28]</a>. Initially, Kii manually reviewed survey responses and sent out invites, starting with about 10 people per week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:49">[01:12:49]</a>. This cohort-based invitation process allowed them to fix issues and incorporate feedback from one group before inviting the next, making the initial development more effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:39">[01:13:39]</a>.

Linear launched publicly in June 2020, with hundreds of companies already using it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:42">[01:10:42]</a>. They also launched pricing, with almost all existing users converting to paid plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:54">[01:10:54]</a>. During the private beta, they even experimented with an optional payment slider where users could choose how much to pay per seat, which helped build confidence in their pricing strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:05">[01:15:05]</a>.

### Product-Market Fit as a Spectrum
Linear views product-market fit not as a binary state, but as a spectrum, strong within specific customer segments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:53">[01:17:53]</a>. Early on, they found a strong fit with smaller, early-stage companies and founders who valued speed and shared similar values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:11">[01:17:11]</a>. Their initial goal was to become the default tool for startups, which they achieved by focusing purely on that segment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:18">[01:18:18]</a>.

As they grew, they expanded their focus to gain stronger product-market fit within larger company segments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:41">[01:18:41]</a>. This strategy emphasizes "doubling down" on categories where a product is performing well before expanding to new areas, similar to how Zoom focused on universities in its early days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:21">[01:20:21]</a>. Linear recognizes that they are in the "retention business" and the "trust business," needing to continuously provide a high-quality product to maintain customer loyalty and build long-term relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:10">[01:51:10]</a>.

### Building Initial Following
Kii Sarin recommends that founders consider [[building_brands_in_the_ai_industry | building an online following]] before launching, though it wasn't the sole reason for Linear's initial success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:08">[01:22:08]</a>. His background as a designer, giving talks, and writing blog posts helped him gain a modest following <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:26">[01:22:26]</a>.

For a product launch, it's crucial to identify the first audience, understand their needs, and communicate in a way that resonates with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:50">[01:23:50]</a>. Linear's founders, being software builders themselves, naturally spoke the language of their initial target audience, which helped their announcement resonate broadly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:09">[01:24:09]</a>. They avoided overly corporate or "fancy" announcements, opting for a direct and authentic message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:03">[01:23:03]</a>.

## Focus and Prioritization
Kii Sarin's approach to focus is guided by advice from Y Combinator: prioritize talking to customers, [[building_and_evolving_a_software_product | building the product]], and exercising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:48">[00:53:48]</a>. He advises against "side quests" – ideas or tasks that don't directly advance the main goal of building an awesome product for customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:48">[00:55:48]</a>. This involves constantly asking if a task is important to do *now* or if it can be delayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:49">[00:54:49]</a>.

### Go Slow to Go Fast
A core philosophy is "go slow to go fast" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:04">[01:36:04]</a>. This means taking time to think and plan before rushing into action, as rushing often leads to errors that require more time to fix later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:23">[01:36:23]</a>.

## Hiring and Leadership
Linear maintains an "insanely high" hiring bar, growing deliberately and never more than doubling in size annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:54">[00:56:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:09">[00:58:09]</a>. They prioritize hiring fewer, higher-quality individuals who can achieve more than larger, more average teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:31">[00:57:31]</a>.

*   **Beyond the Role**: Linear seeks candidates who possess a broader perspective and skills beyond their specific job title <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:42">[00:58:42]</a>. For example, engineers are assessed for their [[the_importance_of_good_product_decisions_and_taste | product thinking]] and ability to articulate why certain choices are better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:56">[00:58:56]</a>. This creates a more adaptable and collaborative team where individuals are willing to take on tasks outside their direct responsibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:57">[00:59:57]</a>.
*   **Paid Work Trial**: Linear's unique hiring process includes a paid work trial as the final step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:28">[01:02:28]</a>. Candidates work as mini-contractors on a vague problem statement, requiring them to understand, scope, and build a solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:02">[01:03:02]</a>. This allows both the company and the candidate to assess their working relationship, gain insight into the company's operations, and evaluate the candidate's ability to make progress quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:33">[01:03:33]</a>.
*   **Assessing Product Sensibility**: In interviews, Kii delves into past projects, asking candidates to explain *why* decisions were made, if they agreed, and what they would have done differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:47">[01:06:47]</a>. He looks for candidates who can articulate their reasoning and provide a clear rationale for their opinions, demonstrating deep thought rather than superficial preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:36">[01:07:36]</a>.

### Leadership Evolution
Kii Sarin's transition from a designer to CEO highlighted the vast and varied responsibilities of leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:48">[01:28:48]</a>. Unlike a specialized individual contributor role, a CEO deals with diverse challenges daily, from compensation to marketing to legal matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:10">[01:29:10]</a>. Key lessons include the importance of hiring and delegation, enabling other leaders to take ownership of specific areas, which helps manage the wide scope of responsibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:50">[01:29:50]</a>.

## Unique Cultural Activities
As a fully remote and distributed company, Linear organizes a quarterly "baking competition" inspired by *The Great British Baking Show* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:17">[01:25:17]</a>. Employees receive a recipe, purchase ingredients using a company card, and then cook or bake together on a Zoom call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:09">[01:26:09]</a>. This allows for informal chat, mutual assistance, and a friendly competition based on visual presentation (as taste cannot be shared remotely) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:58">[01:26:58]</a>. This activity reinforces the company's value of craft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:22">[01:27:22]</a>.

## Future Outlook
Linear is continuously improving and developing new features. One notable upcoming feature is "Asks," an integration with Slack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:35">[01:30:35]</a>. This feature allows non-product team members (e.g., IT, infrastructure) to easily submit requests through Slack, which are then routed to Linear's triage system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:57">[01:30:57]</a>. Teams can respond directly through Slack, eliminating the need for the requester to be a Linear user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:36">[01:31:36]</a>. This aims to involve the entire company in product operations without requiring everyone to be a power user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:44">[01:31:44]</a>.

A significant misconception surrounding the [[differences_in_jobs_to_be_done_approaches | Jobs to Be Done (JTBD)]] framework is the idea that it primarily focuses on "pain and gain" when assessing customer needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Instead, the framework emphasizes understanding the interplay between **context and outcome** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. When a customer's story seems irrational, it's often because the full context is missing; the context makes the seemingly irrational, rational <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. The goal is to uncover the specific situations where people will change their behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Jobs to Be Done: Hiring Products for Progress

The core premise of JTBD is that people "hire" products and services to make progress in their lives, rather than simply buying them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. This perspective highlights that different things compete to help customers achieve their desired outcomes in a given context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

For instance, Snickers and Milky Way, though both candy bars, are "hired" for different jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.
*   **Snickers** is often consumed when someone has missed a meal, has a lot of work, is running out of energy, and wants to return to tasks quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. Its competitors are not other candy bars, but rather items like protein drinks, Red Bull, or coffee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. The peanuts and nougat masticate into a ball that absorbs stomach acid, fulfilling a meal replacement role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:47">[00:46:47]</a>.
*   **Milky Way** is typically eaten after an emotional experience, often alone, for regrouping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. Its competitors might include a glass of wine, a brownie, or even a run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. The caramel melts easily, making it more like a "drink" for comfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:02">[00:47:02]</a>.

This example illustrates how [[product_management_insights_and_extreme_clarity | JTBD]] reveals the true competitive set from the "demand side" (customer's perspective) rather than the "supply side" (technology or business model perspective) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

### The Origin of Demand: Struggling Moments

Demand is not created by a product; rather, a **struggling moment** causes demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.
For instance, Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU) discovered a struggling moment in 2010 when they found students paying full price but only attending online. These "anomalies" were older, often had prior degrees or college attempts that didn't work out, and now had responsibilities driving them to seek something new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. By recognizing this "job" – people wanting to go back to school but facing barriers – SNHU grew to over 200,000 students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

Customer-centricity means studying these struggling moments, which can then inform a product roadmap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. Instead of rigidly planning features for 24 months, focusing on struggling moments allows for flexibility and innovation, especially when unexpected shifts like the rise of AI occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.

### The Four Forces of Progress

Decisions to switch from an old product (A) to a new product (B) are not random <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>. They are influenced by four forces:
*   **F1: The Push** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>: The context or struggling moment that prompts a person to seek change. This push is unrelated to the new product itself; it's the reason for leaving the old one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.
*   **F2: The Pull** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>: The attraction of a new outcome or improved state.
*   **F3: Anxiety of the New** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>: Apprehensions or fears associated with adopting a new solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. More features can actually increase anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.
*   **F4: Habit of the Present** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>: The inertia or comfort associated with existing behaviors and products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.

People will only make a switch if the combined force of the push and pull (F1 + F2) is greater than the combined force of anxiety and habit (F3 + F4) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. Companies can increase sales by reducing friction (F3/F4) rather than just adding features (increasing F2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>. For example, a house builder increased sales by over 30% by including moving services and storage, addressing the friction of downsizing, even if it meant increasing the condo price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.

This approach means designing the sales process around how customers want to buy, rather than how the company wants to sell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>. The buying process often involves six phases: first thought, passive looking, active looking, deciding, first use, and ongoing use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>. Tailoring interactions to these phases, like providing different demos based on a bank's stage in the purchasing timeline for an invoicing product, can significantly increase conversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>.

## [[developing_user_empathy_and_gathering_insights_for_product_development | Interview Techniques for Uncovering Context]]

Traditional market research often falls short because it asks people what they *want* rather than understanding *why* they do what they do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>. For example, prospective homebuyers might say they want an energy-star compliant house, but those who *bought* a house often traded that for a finished basement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>. [[interview_techniques_for_uncovering_customer_needs | Effective customer communication]] should be based on techniques from criminal and intelligence interrogation, focusing on the story of *how* someone decided to make a purchase, rather than what they say they want <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>.

### Practical Tips for Interviews:

*   **Focus on Causation**: Frame questions around "what causes people to say today's the day they want X?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>.
*   **Interview Recent Purchasers/Churners**: Talk to people who have recently bought a product (even a competitor's) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a> or, for existing products, those who have churned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:17">[00:35:17]</a>. When someone leaves, they are still making progress; understanding why they left provides insights into their struggling moments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:22">[00:35:22]</a>.
*   **Extract the Full Story**: Get details on pushes, pulls, anxieties, habits, and "hire and fire" criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>. This includes functional (time, effort, knowledge), emotional (frustration, desire for feeling better), and social (how others perceive them) energy components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:37">[00:34:37]</a>.
*   **Avoid Discussion Guides**: Don't stick to a rigid script, as it prevents following meaningful information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:28">[00:30:28]</a>. Instead, use the pushes, pulls, anxieties, and habits framework to guide the conversation and understand their story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:42">[00:30:42]</a>.
*   **"Tell Me More" / "Give Me an Example"**: Encourage elaboration without asking "why" repeatedly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:58">[00:30:58]</a>.
*   **"Bracket It"**: When someone reaches "the edge of language," offer a binary choice that is likely neither correct, forcing them to elaborate further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:07">[00:31:07]</a>.
*   **Mirroring**: Play things back incorrectly to prompt the interviewee to correct you and provide more information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:54">[00:27:54]</a>.
*   **Small Sample Size**: In a causal mechanism and set theory perspective, patterns start to repeat around 7-8 interviews. Aim for 10, no more than 12, focusing on quality over quantity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:10">[00:29:10]</a>.
*   **Distrust Predictions**: People cannot reliably predict future actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:44">[00:36:44]</a>. Focus on what people *did* and what *made them try*, even if they failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:58">[00:36:58]</a>. "Bitching ain't switching" – complaining doesn't mean they'll change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:04">[00:37:04]</a>.
*   **Dig Beyond Surface Layer**: People often start with superficial reasons (the "plaum layer") or exaggerated "fantasy/nightmare" stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:23">[00:38:23]</a>. The interviewer needs to be an investigator, pulling back to what actually happened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:44">[00:38:44]</a>.

### Examples of Contextual Insights

*   **Housing Market**: Buyers often claimed they didn't want a dining room table in smaller condos, yet they wouldn't move if there wasn't a designated space for it. The dining table was an "emotional bank account" representing family gatherings and memories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:01">[01:03:01]</a>. Building a symbolic space for it, even if impractical for eating, increased sales by 22% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:39">[01:04:39]</a>. This highlights how irrational contradictions in stated desires versus actual behavior reveal deep-seated contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:51">[01:04:51]</a>.

## When [[the_role_of_empathy_in_product_management | Jobs to Be Done]] is Not the Right Framework

While powerful, JTBD is not always the ideal framework:
*   **No Real Choice**: It is less effective when customers have limited or no real choice, such as employer-provided health insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:12">[00:51:12]</a>. In these cases, ethnography or prototyping to identify frictional points might be more suitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:28">[00:52:28]</a>.
*   **Deeply Ingrained Habits**: For products or services with extremely deep, subconscious habits (e.g., buying chewing gum or a common laundry detergent), people often cannot articulate their "job" because it's too automatic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:51">[00:52:51]</a>. The job is only revealed when people change their behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:25">[00:53:25]</a>.

## Common Misconceptions

The most frustrating misconceptions are:
*   Framing JTBD as "pain and gain" instead of **context and outcome** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:39">[00:54:39]</a>.
*   Focusing purely on the outcome without considering the context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:47">[00:54:47]</a>.
*   Attempting to define "jobs" in a conference room without actually [[the_importance_of_customer_proximity_in_product_design | talking to customers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:54">[00:54:54]</a>. Hypothesizing jobs without direct customer [[linears_approach_to_customer_feedback_and_product_iteration | feedback]] will lead to errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:27">[00:45:27]</a>.

Innovation happens when understanding what causes people to change their direction, not just studying their current momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:50">[00:55:50]</a>.

## Different Flavors of JTBD

There are different approaches to JTBD. Bob Moesta's method, co-created with Clay Christensen, is more qualitative, organic, and tactical, focusing on a "process, practice, and skills" approach to understanding customer behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:45">[00:44:45]</a>. Clay Christensen's work focused more on turning the concept into a theory and strategic framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:17">[00:49:17]</a>. Other approaches, like Tony Ulwick's, are more supply-side driven, focusing on what a product *can do* and its functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:32">[00:49:32]</a>. Moesta believes only people have jobs, not products or organizations, because human behavior contains the irrational elements crucial to understand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:45">[00:49:45]</a>.

To start applying this approach, it is recommended to read "Demand-Side Sales" to understand how to flip the lens from selling to helping customers buy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:47">[00:50:47]</a>.

### Key Takeaways

1.  **Struggling Moments are Key**: Identify the specific contexts and situations where people feel compelled to take action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:16">[00:58:16]</a>.
2.  **Focus on Customer's Progress**: Understand their desired outcome and starting point, not just your own standards for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:41">[00:58:41]</a>.
3.  **Choose What to "Suck At"**: Intentionally decide on the trade-offs your product will make, ensuring they align with the trade-offs your customers are willing to accept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:51">[00:58:51]</a>. Many products fail because their trade-offs don't match customer expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>.

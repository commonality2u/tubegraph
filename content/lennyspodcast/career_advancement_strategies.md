Advancing in one's [[career_growth_and_strategic_positioning | career]] often requires more than just doing good work; it involves strategic engagement with leadership, continuous self-improvement, and an understanding of organizational dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. Ethan Evans, a former Vice President at Amazon, executive coach, and course creator, shares insights and strategies to help individuals [[career_growth_and_strategic_positioning | grow]] into senior and executive roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## The Magic Loop for Career Growth

The [[magic_loop_concept_for_career_growth | Magic Loop]] is a five-step process designed to help individuals [[career_growth_and_strategic_positioning | grow their career]] in almost any circumstance, even with a difficult manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. It forms a partnership with leadership, emphasizing mutual help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.

### Five Steps of the Magic Loop

1.  **Do your current job well** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>: It's essential to be performing at a solid level, ensuring your manager doesn't wish you were different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. You must talk to your manager, understand their expectations, and address any performance issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
2.  **Ask your boss how you can help** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>: This simple question sets you apart as very few people ask this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. It begins to [[building_a_longterm_career_strategy | build a relationship]] where you're seen as part of their organization, dedicated to making them successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.
3.  **Do what they ask** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>: Fulfill the request, even if it's not your favorite work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. Failing to do so after offering help can damage trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.
4.  **Propose a win-win scenario** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>: Go back to your manager and ask if there's a way you can help them that would also help you reach your personal goals, such as changing roles, getting a raise, or learning a new skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. This step requires clarity on your own goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. Managers are generally open to meeting you halfway because they help those who help them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.
5.  **Repeat the loop** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>: Once you're working with your manager towards mutual goals, continue the cycle to continuously [[career_growth_and_strategic_positioning | grow]] and [[navigating_career_transitions_and_promotions | advance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.

### Why the Magic Loop Works

*   **Rarity of help offers**: Managers are often overwhelmed and rarely receive offers of help, making your offer stand out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>.
*   **Social engineering**: It leverages the human tendency to help those who help us, fostering a partnership rather than an oppositional relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>.
*   **Addresses manager's busy schedules**: Many managers have good intentions but get busy with their own work and careers, and this process prompts them to focus on your growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.
*   **Forces gap identification**: It implicitly helps identify skill gaps or areas for improvement needed for the next level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>.
*   **Clarifies personal goals**: It prompts you to articulate your [[career_growth_and_strategic_positioning | career aspirations]] to your manager, which they may not already know <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:54">[00:20:54]</a>.

### Applicability and Limitations

The [[magic_loop_concept_for_career_growth | Magic Loop]] works effectively from the start of one's [[career_growth_and_strategic_positioning | career]] up to senior management levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>. At executive levels (e.g., Vice President), the active "asking" for help tapers off because leaders are expected to be proactive, anticipate needs, and inform their superiors after taking action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>. It's about building rapport and trust, allowing leaders to confidently let you operate autonomously over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>.

The goal of the loop is to achieve [[career_growth_and_strategic_positioning | career satisfaction]], whether that means moving up, getting paid more, or changing roles to address boredom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. Even if your goal isn't promotion, the loop can be used to achieve other objectives, like working on different projects or rebalancing work-life commitments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:28">[00:22:28]</a>.

## [[navigating_career_transitions_and_promotions | Getting Unstuck at Senior Levels]]

It is common for individuals to get stuck at the senior manager level (e.g., L7/M1/M2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:37">[00:23:37]</a>. This can be due to:

*   **Choke points**: There are fewer director positions available than senior manager roles, especially in leaner economic environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:48">[00:23:48]</a>.
*   **Skill transition**: Advancing beyond senior manager requires a shift from functional expertise and execution to influence, coordination, and a strategic mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:46">[00:24:46]</a>. "What got you here won't get you there" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:04">[00:25:04]</a>.

To break through this plateau, individuals should:

*   **Practice Next-Level Skills**: Start practicing director-level skills such as taking on strategic projects and [[becoming_more_strategic | becoming more inventive]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:13">[00:26:13]</a>.
*   **Be the Chosen Person**: Position yourself as the most qualified candidate among peers for future opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:48">[00:26:48]</a>. This involves consistently demonstrating higher-level traits and impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:35">[00:27:35]</a>.
*   **"Do the Job Before You Have the Job"**: By already performing at the next level, you make it easier for leaders to promote you, as they have a vested interest in having strong, capable reports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:07">[00:28:07]</a>.

## [[becoming_more_strategic | The Importance of Inventiveness]]

Inventiveness is a critical trait, especially at senior levels, as highlighted by figures like Jeff Bezos who considers himself primarily an inventor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a>. Systematic inventiveness involves:

*   **Expertise**: Being a knowledgeable expert in the area you wish to invent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>.
*   **Dedicated Thinking Time**: Spending dedicated, device-free time concentrating on problems and potential solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:57">[00:30:57]</a>.
*   **Combining Existing Concepts**: The most straightforward way to invent is to combine two existing things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:19">[00:31:19]</a>. For example, combining drones and aircraft carriers led to the idea of a drone-carrying truck for deliveries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:30">[00:31:30]</a>.

Good ideas often take years to fully express and optimize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. For instance, Amazon Prime shipping is a decades-old idea still being improved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This means you don't need many good ideas to be seen as highly inventive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. Much innovation occurs in the optimization phase, making an existing idea cheaper, better, and faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:41">[00:34:41]</a>.

## [[job_search_strategies_and_mindset | Standing Out in Interviews]]

Having interviewed over 2,200 people, Ethan Evans identifies key factors for success in interviews:

*   **Appearance and Enthusiasm**: Show up looking interested in the job and be enthusiastic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:37">[00:36:37]</a>. People want to work with those who want to work with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:51">[00:36:51]</a>. Even if you decide against taking the job, aim to get the offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:04">[00:37:04]</a>.
*   **Focus on Impact, Not Just Work**: Higher-level candidates should describe the impact of their work and why it mattered, not just what they did <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:27">[00:37:27]</a>. Leaders hire to solve problems, so demonstrating how you've solved big problems and changed the company or customer outlook is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">[00:37:37]</a>.
*   **Professionalism in Virtual Settings**: For Zoom interviews, be fully present, avoid taking calls from a car, keep your camera on, and project enthusiasm through eye contact and body language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:33">[00:38:33]</a>. A good night's sleep and coffee can contribute to being engaged and energetic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:06">[00:39:06]</a>.

## Learning from Failure

A significant failure, like a project not launching on time and angering a top executive, can be recovered from with the right approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:09">[00:49:09]</a>.

### Lessons from a Jeff Bezos Incident

Ethan Evans recounts a time when Amazon's App Store launch was delayed due to a database problem, leading to Jeff Bezos's anger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>. Lessons learned include:

*   **Own the Mistake**: Immediately admit responsibility and take ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:28">[00:44:28]</a>.
*   **Proactive Communication**: Provide frequent, detailed updates on the situation, the plan, and expected next updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:39">[00:44:39]</a>. This helps rebuild trust and prevents micromanagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:14">[00:51:14]</a>.
*   **Meet In Person**: When possible, address issues face-to-face. It's harder for leaders to sustain anger in person, fostering a more human conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>.
*   **Work Hard and Fast to Recover**: Be prepared to pull out all stops and work through discomfort to fix the problem promptly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:55">[00:51:55]</a>.
*   **Persist Through Shame**: Don't let shame or impostor syndrome lead you to quit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:11">[00:53:11]</a>. Most people make mistakes, and recovery is possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:51">[00:53:51]</a>.
*   **Care for Your Team**: Recognize the impact of failures on team members, especially junior ones. Ensure they don't feel undue responsibility for systemic failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:55">[00:59:55]</a>.
*   **Learn and Adapt**: Reflect on what went wrong and adjust your approach. For instance, Amazon learned to prioritize beta testing over surprise launches to avoid public failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:18">[00:58:18]</a>. At senior levels, consider the "New York Times headline" test – if your actions could result in negative public attention, exercise extreme caution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:51">[00:56:51]</a>.

## Amazon's Leadership Principles

Ethan Evans contributed to crafting Amazon's "Ownership" leadership principle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:47">[01:04:47]</a>, specifically the phrase: "An owner never says, 'That's not my job'" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:27">[01:02:27]</a>. This principle emphasizes taking responsibility beyond one's immediate role.

Other impactful principles include:

*   **Bias for Action**: Speed matters in business, and many decisions are reversible, so moving quickly is often necessary in a competitive environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:30">[01:03:30]</a>.
*   **Leaders are Right A Lot**: Leaders are expected to be correct, but the principle evolved to emphasize actively working to disconfirm beliefs and seeking diverse perspectives to avoid narrow decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:42">[01:07:42]</a>.

## Contrarian Views

Ethan Evans holds contrarian views on certain common industry practices:

*   **Return to Office Movement**: While many leaders favor a full return to the office, Evans believes remote work has much more opportunity for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:14">[01:09:14]</a>. Offices have been optimized for 300 years, while remote work is a relatively new and unexplored frontier for innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:47">[01:09:47]</a>.
*   **Doing Business on a Handshake**: Evans believes that over-reliance on contracts has led to a loss of trust in one's word <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:42">[01:10:42]</a>. While occasionally one might get burned, building relationships based on faith and mutual trust can be highly beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:10">[01:11:10]</a>.

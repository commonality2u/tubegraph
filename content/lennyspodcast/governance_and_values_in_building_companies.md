The decision to found a company is not merely an entrepreneurial pursuit; it is a profound act of creation that carries significant ethical and societal responsibilities. While the failure of a startup is often perceived as the worst outcome, a far more detrimental fate is to create a "zombie undead company" that founders despise but cannot leave, or worse, one that becomes a "malign force in the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This can contribute to a mental health crisis among founders, who face immense stress from both perceived failures and "so-called successes" that lead to companies they find abhorrent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Founders should take the long-term impact and values of their company seriously from the outset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Evolution of Focus: From Lean Startup to Governance

Eric Ries, renowned for creating the Lean Startup methodology and coining terms like "MVP" and "pivot", has shifted his focus to issues of governance and corporate structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. His work, including the Long-Term Stock Exchange (LTSE), emphasizes building companies with values aligned with human flourishing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

A core aspect of Ries's "first principles thinking" is identifying "what is a startup really" and why traditional business practices often fail in this context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. He views his work as descriptive, giving names to existing phenomena like "pivot" rather than prescribing actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. This scientific approach means that "whatever works is Lean Startup," encouraging continuous adoption of effective new practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:21">[01:18:21]</a>.

## The Responsibility of Products and Companies

Founders and product creators bear a responsibility for what they put into the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:17">[00:21:17]</a>. This responsibility extends beyond their immediate control, as users may misuse or misunderstand their creations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:23">[00:21:23]</a>. Ries acknowledges a past oversight in his book, where he stated that Lean Startup would give entrepreneurs "the tools they need to change the world" without explicitly adding "for the better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a>. This seemingly minor omission reflects a common assumption in the tech industry that "changing the world" inherently implies positive impact, an assumption that has had "catastrophic consequences" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:33">[00:27:33]</a>.

Companies are now building technologies "so invasive into people's lives" and "so much more powerful than what was before" that taking moral responsibility is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:24">[01:32:24]</a>. The next generation of founders increasingly feels a "real sense of responsibility to make the world a better place" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:03">[01:33:03]</a>.

## Integrating Values into Product Development

### Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and Quality
The concept of an MVP is not about building something "bare bone stripped down" or of low quality, but rather finding "the most efficient way to get the validation" needed for a hypothesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:32">[00:32:32]</a>. User expectations for product quality are important, but quality is ultimately defined by the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:36">[00:32:36]</a>. Building a high-quality product that customers don't want is the "ultimate waste" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:27">[00:32:27]</a>. Therefore, the goal is to "build as little as necessary" to test a hypothesis, even if that minimum still implies a high level of quality for specific features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:57">[00:37:57]</a>.

### Craftsmanship and Intentionality
The discussion around "craft" in product development needs to be clear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:17">[00:49:17]</a>. Craft can relate to perfection, which, again, must be defined for a specific customer and purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:11">[00:50:11]</a>. Genuine craftsmanship involves building with integrity (e.g., writing good code) to keep options open and maintain speed, rather than compromising quality for speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:20">[00:51:20]</a>. However, "craft" can also be an excuse to avoid feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:50">[00:51:50]</a>. If a founder's artistic ethos is non-negotiable, that is acceptable, but it should be an explicit value, not an untested assumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:06">[00:52:06]</a>. If a founder lacks a clear design ethos, "experimentation will get you there" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:28">[00:53:28]</a>.

### Building the Company You Want
Founders are encouraged to build the company they truly want to work on, rather than succumbing to external pressures that might lead to a business they dislike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:40">[00:53:40]</a>. Being willing to stand for one's principles, even at the risk of being fired, can accelerate one's career and attract like-minded individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:01">[00:54:01]</a>.

## Addressing the "Zombie Company" Phenomenon

Far worse than a startup failing is being trapped in a "zombie, undead company that you hate but you can't leave" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:09">[00:55:09]</a>. These companies are often "alive but they were almost never are going to succeed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:20">[01:00:20]</a>.

### Advice for Stuck Founders
If a founder is questioning whether to pivot, they "probably know the answer already" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:51">[01:13:51]</a>. A company experiencing product-market fit has no time for "Naval gazing" or doubt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:06">[01:14:06]</a>. For those stuck, Ries advises:
*   **Admit it's not working:** Be honest with yourself and the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:24">[01:14:24]</a>.
*   **Set a fixed time for decisive action:** Dedicate 100% effort to a single, critical assumption for a set period (e.g., six weeks) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:34">[01:14:34]</a>.
*   **Embrace new paradigms:** If experiments become unproductive, seek a new approach where learning is possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:45">[01:15:45]</a>.
*   **Share secret desires:** Have each team member state what they would be doing if they could start the company over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:15">[01:17:15]</a>. This often reveals shared, unexpressed desires for a new direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:40">[01:17:40]</a>.
*   **Don't be afraid to shut down:** If the team agrees, it's okay to "give the money back" and let the company die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:13">[01:18:13]</a>.

### Psychological Barriers
The difficulty in admitting failure stems from the deep ego identification many founders have with their companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:05">[00:59:05]</a>. The experience of a company's failure can feel like a personal death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:13">[00:59:13]</a>. Ries emphasizes that to learn, one must be able to fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:16">[01:15:16]</a>. Founders should strive to "disidentify with the company" so that "the company to die without them dying" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:21">[00:59:21]</a>. This allows them to take what they've learned into future endeavors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:32">[00:59:32]</a>.

## AI, Governance, and Organizational Values

Ries sees AI as a "management technology" that will profoundly change organizational structures by solving the problem of summarizing vast amounts of information, potentially reducing the need for extensive middle management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:25">[01:23:25]</a>.

A critical challenge with AI is "AI alignment," which Ries argues is a reflection of *human* alignment within corporations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:40">[01:39:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:40">[01:19:40]</a>. He notes that tech has "severely underinvested and neglected in creating governance and Alignment structures" to ensure values are explicitly embodied in the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:12">[01:20:12]</a>.

### Building Trustworthy Organizations
To ensure a company's promises are trustworthy and its values are upheld, these values must be embedded within the "structure of the organization itself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:13">[01:35:13]</a>. This ensures that even if the founder leaves, the company's core mission is maintained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:17">[01:35:17]</a>. Companies are "super organisms with their own soul and their own life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:47">[01:34:47]</a>, and founders "birth them," they don't own them as slaves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:54">[01:34:54]</a>.

Companies are exceptional at what they prioritize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:20">[01:37:20]</a>. For example, a company will file its quarterly report on time with 100% certainty due to embedded processes, but its commitment to avoiding complicity in harm may be far less certain if not structurally reinforced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:05">[01:36:05]</a>.

### Redefining "For-Profit"
Ries argues that the conventional understanding of a "for-profit" company is "wrong" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:31">[01:37:31]</a>. True profit, he asserts, is about "maximizing human flourishing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:40">[01:37:40]</a>. There are "exploitative extractive ways of making money" and "truly additive ways" that create net new value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:01">[01:38:01]</a>. If companies are dedicated to human flourishing, they can avoid becoming "bureaucratic nightmares" or "rent-seeking blobs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:14">[01:38:14]</a>. This means encoding promises into the company's structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:25">[01:38:25]</a>.

### Implementing Values in Structure
It is "always too early until it's too late" to embed governance structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:52">[01:53:52]</a>. Founders are often advised to delay these changes, but by the time a company is nearing an IPO, it becomes extremely difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:25">[01:45:25]</a>.

Ways to embed values and mission into a company's structure include:
*   **Public Benefit Corporation (PBC) or Social Purpose Corporation (SPC) designation:** Legal structures that commit a company to a social mission alongside profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:01">[01:44:01]</a>.
*   **Foundations/Trusts:** Companies can allocate a portion of their equity to a foundation whose trustees represent key stakeholders or mission-aligned groups, providing economic and governance influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:17">[01:44:17]</a>. (e.g., Open AI is structured as a non-profit foundation with a for-profit subsidiary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>).
*   **Board Mission Pledge:** Requiring board members to pledge to use their business judgment to support the company's mission, not just shareholder interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:32">[01:44:32]</a>.
*   **Mission-aligned financing instruments (LSTV):** Ensuring investors sign contracts to support the company's mission and are overseen by trustees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:45">[01:44:45]</a>.
*   **Founder Preferred Shares:** Giving founders differential voting rights or other powers to protect the mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:08">[01:48:08]</a>.

Without these protections, standard Articles of Incorporation in Silicon Valley might obligate a company to accept an offer that maximizes shareholder returns, even if it conflicts with the company's stated mission or values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:10">[01:47:10]</a>.

Companies with long-term thinking and customer-centricity, regardless of their specific structure, often gain a "major source of competitive advantage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:08">[01:53:08]</a>. The "shareholder primacy theory of corporations" is "wrong" even for maximizing returns, as it incentivizes short-term gains at the expense of long-term value creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:46">[01:53:46]</a>. Companies structured around long-term, mission-driven principles have been shown to financially outperform those focused solely on short-term profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:15">[01:54:15]</a>. This is an "open secret" that is rarely offered as an option to founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:56">[01:54:56]</a>.

## The Future of Company Building

Ries believes there will be a "new wave of Founders" who take seriously the idea that "human flourishing is the thing at the beating heart" of their companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:08">[01:38:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:08">[01:38:08]</a>. This approach not only allows companies to change the world for the better but also makes them "worth a lot more than their competitors" due to increased customer loyalty and employee motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:14">[01:41:14]</a>.

As an industry, builders "need a new movement to say like we are going to build companies where [[importance_of_personal_and_company_operating_principles | human flourishing]] is the thing at the beating heart" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:04">[01:41:04]</a>. Ries encourages founders to actively seek out and implement these structural protections from the beginning, rather than waiting for it to be too late <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:51">[01:43:51]</a>. Ultimately, the collective power of founders who provide the "fresh meat" for the economic system means they can "set the terms by which this is done" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:03">[02:13:03]</a>.

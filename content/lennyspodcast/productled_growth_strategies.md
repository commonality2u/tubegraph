[[Elena Verna]] is recognized as one of the most experienced and knowledgeable individuals in [[growth_strategies_in_tech_companies]] globally, having led growth at companies like Miro, SurveyMonkey, and Amplitude, and advised firms such as MongoDB and Netlify [01:03:07]. Her insights cover [[growth_strategies_in_tech_companies]], the evolution of B2B growth, the benefits of freemium over trial models, the concept of [[productled_growth_strategies]], the challenges of scaling PLG, and the future of [[productled_sales_strategies]] [01:13:58].

## Understanding Product-Led Growth (PLG)

[[Productled growth strategies]] is defined as a specific approach within a growth model that answers three key questions: how to acquire, retain, and monetize customers [02:10:04]. A company can choose to be product-led, marketing-led, or [[founderled_sales_strategies | sales-led]] across any of these areas [02:17:19]. The game of growth is seen as a layering or sequential process, not an either/or decision [00:00:00]. The biggest mistake is viewing these approaches as a choice rather than a sequential play where models are layered on top of each other [00:46:17].

## PLG vs. Sales-Led: A Layering Game

Being [[founderled_sales_strategies | sales-led]] risks disruption from [[productled_growth_strategies | product-led]] companies [00:10:04]. However, transitioning from [[founderled_sales_strategies | sales-led]] to [[productled_growth_strategies | product-led]] does not mean abandoning the sales-led approach; instead, it means strengthening existing sales efforts and overlaying a product-led motion to amplify growth [00:27:38]. The most successful companies execute both strategies correctly and cohesively [00:30:50]. This approach makes scaling simpler, as companies know they will eventually employ both strategies [02:22:24].

## Product-Led Growth in B2B

Traditionally, B2B products focused on utility and efficiency for the enterprise buyer, often resulting in cold, unusable interfaces [01:14:04]. This led to users wanting to exit the product quickly, as they were not the decision-makers [01:18:21]. However, in the last decade, decision-making power in B2B has shifted to the "prosumer" or employee [01:37:40]. The new wave of B2B products, like Slack and Miro, are "shiny and fun," resembling consumer products in their user experience and ability to build habits [01:47:00].

This shift emphasizes user-centricity, redefining the customer from an enterprise buyer to a product user [02:04:15]. This impacts onboarding, time-to-value, activation experience, and the creation of habit loops [02:20:01]. Examples include Slack, which "blew away" enterprise competitors by building for users, and Miro, where individuals bring the software into companies to improve collaboration [02:44:49]. Amplitude is also seeing this shift from top-down data analytics purchases to bottom-up user adoption [02:27:00]. This evolution leads to products that solve user problems rather than just fulfilling checklists of security or compliance [02:37:50].

### Components of PLG

A [[productled_growth_strategies | product-led growth]] model fundamentally involves three questions: how to acquire, retain, and monetize customers [02:10:04].
*   **Retention:** Every company must first focus on being product-led in retention [02:06:03]. This means nailing activation and, more importantly, engagement through habitual loops [02:10:04]. Without strong product-led retention, there's no chance for product-led acquisition [02:15:00].
*   **Acquisition:** [[Productled growth strategies | Product-led acquisition]] means users buying, referring, or creating content that attracts other users [02:37:40]. This is most effective when a product has a one-to-many or collaboration-at-its-core relationship (e.g., Slack, Miro, Amplitude) [02:45:00]. If a product doesn't have these relationships (e.g., Snowflake), product-led acquisition becomes very difficult, requiring reliance on marketing-led or [[founderled_sales_strategies | sales-led]] approaches [02:50:00].
*   **Monetization:** This can be through self-serve or via [[productled_sales_strategies | product-led sales]] [02:54:00]. The choice depends on the product's use cases and market maturity [02:54:00]. Every industry is expected to undergo a [[transition_from_productled_growth_to_productled_sales | transformation]] towards product-led approaches within the next decade [02:58:00].

## Challenges in Scaling Product-Led Growth

A common pattern for [[productled_growth_strategies | product-led companies]] is to start with strong user love, Word-of-Mouth, community, and retention, leading to successful self-serve monetization and eventually their first enterprise contracts [02:49:00]. The excitement of large average contract values (ACVs) often leads companies to double down on hiring more sales people [02:50:00].

Initially, this works well due to strong existing user bases and advocates [02:59:00]. However, a slowdown inevitably occurs because companies run out of enterprise buyers already in their user base [02:59:00]. Only about 30% or less of buyers are typically within the user base, meaning sales needs to actively find the buyer for the remaining accounts [03:01:00]. This leads to investing in enterprise marketing (e.g., demand gen, ABM specialists) [03:27:00].

### The Crucial Mistake

The critical error many companies make when chasing enterprise buyers is abandoning their [[productled_growth_strategies | product usage growth]] and [[productled_growth_strategies | product-led tactics]] [03:53:00]. When prioritizing resources, companies often choose to hire for enterprise roles (e.g., sales reps, ABM specialists) over [[productled_growth_strategies | growth PMs]] or growth marketers, as these personas often don't overlap [03:59:00]. This disconnect leads to a slowdown in enterprise pipeline, as the foundation of user growth and community is neglected [03:07:00].

Companies must not forget their product-led roots [03:41:00]. While some correct course quickly, others take too long, leading to a complete slowdown and potential reinvention of their growth model as competition enters [03:42:00]. Over-correcting on one go-to-market motion, instead of layering them, is a common pitfall [03:10:00].

To avoid this [[challenges_of_transitioning_from_salesled_to_productled_growth | downfall]]:
*   **Don't compare ACVs directly:** [[Productled growth strategies | Product-led growth]] and [[productled_sales_strategies | product-led sales]] are expansion games, where initial contract values might be lower because you enter the account earlier [03:17:00]. Incentivize teams accordingly [03:54:00].
*   **Balance product roadmap:** Don't let the product roadmap exclusively focus on enterprise features [03:07:00]. Continuously innovate and delight users, as they are the "selling agents" within an organization [03:22:00]. Building solely for enterprise buyers can indicate a departure from your [[productled_growth_strategies | PLG]] roots [03:29:00].

## The Emergence of Product-Led Sales

[[Productled sales strategies | Product-led sales]] is an emerging trend where sales is layered on top of [[productled_growth_strategies | product-led growth]] [03:43:00]. It is predicted to largely replace traditional "top-down" sales organizations within the next 10 years [03:52:00].

### Product-Led Sales vs. Traditional Sales-Led

**Product-Led Sales:**
1.  **Starts with Usage:** Begins with an acquisition (marketing-led or product-led) and self-serve usage (freemium or self-serve monetization) [03:09:00]. The product itself generates usage without human involvement [03:22:00].
2.  **Usage-Based Qualification:** Companies monitor usage for signs of network effects within an organization [03:32:00]. This involves scoring users based on volume, velocity, breadth of feature use, behavior, and demographics to assess the probability of selling to the entire organization [03:57:00].
3.  **Sales Involvement:** Sales teams first aim to generate "hand-raisers" through product levers [04:27:00]. The second layer involves proactively reaching out to users who exhibit similar high-potential usage patterns but haven't raised their hand, either directly to a buyer or through the user for an introduction [04:44:00].
4.  **Product as Sales Enablement:** The product itself serves as the sales enablement material [04:58:00].
5.  **User Value & Expansion:** [[Productled sales strategies | Product-led sales]] focuses on user value, which drives expansion [03:11:00].
6.  **Lower Cost of Acquisition:** The cost of acquiring a user is significantly cheaper than acquiring a buyer [03:22:00].
7.  **Pipeline Creation from Usage:** Pipeline is generated from actual usage, not just marketing qualified leads [03:29:00]. This creates opportunities for more acquisition, retention, product building, and discovery of adjacent use cases [03:41:00].
8.  **User-Driven Decisions:** It empowers users to make purchasing decisions and act as sales agents [04:15:00]. Enterprise buyers are increasingly being "boxed out" of the initial decision-making process, which can be beneficial for all parties [04:27:00].

**Traditional Sales-Led:**
1.  **Starts with Leads/Prospecting:** Begins with marketing qualified leads or outbound prospecting to find a buyer [04:05:00].
2.  **Demo-Heavy:** Involves many demos and client entertainment to convince buyers to purchase [04:12:00].
3.  **Post-Purchase Utilization Battles:** Sales aims to sell as much as possible to the entire organization upfront, often leading to utilization issues post-purchase [04:18:00]. Companies then have to justify the large initial cost and catch up on contract value [04:29:00].

Self-serve models, once limited, are now seeing increased deal sizes, with companies like Atlassian closing $200k deals and even personal experiences of paying over $24,000 for Drift via credit card without sales involvement [03:53:00].

## Freemium vs. Trials

Both freemium and trials allow for free product usage, but trials are time-bound, while freemium offers ongoing free usage, often with feature or usage walls [04:09:00].

### The Problem with Time-Bound Trials
Time-bound trials are problematic because the time needed to evaluate a product varies greatly between a small startup (e.g., 24-48 hours) and a large enterprise (e.g., a month or more due to dependencies) [04:45:00]. A 7-day trial might only serve small startups, alienating larger enterprises that would need to constantly renew trials to get value [04:28:00]. This creates a "superficial time component" that isn't a good measure of time-to-value and can be stressful for users [04:41:00].

### The Power of Freemium (Usage-Based "Trials")
Instead of time, freemium models should focus on usage metrics [04:49:00]. For example, MongoDB offers a free, community-shared cluster for development, with no time limit [04:55:00]. This allows users to "play around" and prototype without pressure, knowing that any production use case will require a paid model [04:25:00].

Even high-friction B2B products like Amplitude, Twilio, Contentful, Snowflake, and Okta are adopting some form of freemium [05:18:00]. The key is to reduce the "cost" of self-serve provisioning through innovation, such as no-code platforms, to enable more users [05:32:00].

### Strategic Reasons for Freemium
The biggest mistake is viewing freemium solely as a conversion rate optimization tactic [04:47:00]. Instead, companies should have a clear strategy behind their freemium offering, focusing on its strategic business impact [04:59:00].

Freemium should check one of the following boxes:
*   **Indirect Monetization:** Helps with virality or network effects, like Miro's three free editable boards that drive user acquisition through collaboration [04:50:00]. SurveyMonkey also had a free user base that drove 100% of their acquisition without significant marketing spend [05:13:00].
*   **Proof of Concept (POC):** Serves as a fantastic POC for users, like MongoDB's free cluster [04:50:00].
*   **Suffices for Some Users:** If a feature is commoditized, giving it away for free becomes necessary to attract users, then differentiating with innovation [05:47:00].
*   **Creates Habit Loops:** Features that build user habits, such as notifications or communication channels, should be free [05:57:00].
*   **Strategic Land:** Allows landing customers that may not be monetized initially but offer future expansion opportunities [05:37:00].
*   **Breeding Ground for Discovery:** Freemium can be a "breeding ground" for discovering adjacent use cases and personas, allowing a company to pivot its roadmap and be first to market [05:07:00].
*   **Data Collection:** Collects data that enables building and selling other paid products, as seen with LinkedIn's freemium base enabling their Sales Navigator and recruiting products [05:25:00].

In general, anything that creates friction for the growth model should be gated in paid versions, while anything that promotes the growth model should be free [05:09:00]. The decision heavily depends on the actual monetization strategy [05:21:00].

## Hiring for Growth

Hiring for growth, particularly a growth leader, requires a strategic approach:

### Internal vs. External Hires
It's advised to find the first growth hire internally rather than bringing in an external expert immediately [05:51:00].
*   **Evolution, Not Revolution:** Growth is an evolution, and fostering a growth mindset internally is crucial [05:15:00].
*   **Product Familiarity:** Internal hires (e.g., a data analyst, product manager, or technically inclined engineer) are already familiar with the product and its authentic growth model [05:29:00]. An external hire might "slap" their previous company's model onto a new product, leading to a 99% rejection and failure rate [05:30:00].
*   **Quick Wins vs. Long Game:** Internal hires can provide quicker wins [05:33:00]. External hires need 3-6 months or longer to understand the product's growth model, during which time they might feel pressured to copy-paste past successes, leading to high turnover and no significant change in growth trajectory [05:38:00]. Copy-pasting growth models rarely works, even between direct competitors [05:40:00].

### When to Hire a Growth Person
A growth person should only be hired once a company has a strong [[productled_growth_strategies | product-market fit]] [05:24:00]. This means:
1.  **Retention:** Demonstrable retention for at least six months to a year post-initial offering [05:33:00].
2.  **Acquisition & Monetization Ability:** Some "green shoots" indicating an ability to acquire and monetize customers from the beginning [05:57:00].

A growth hire comes in to help build out, scale, and innovate on an existing growth model, not to figure it out from scratch [05:58:00]. The founding team should establish the initial growth model themselves, as delegating this critical function can lead to failure [05:27:00].

## General Growth Tips

To drive sustainable growth, companies and leaders should focus on:
*   **Pattern Recognition:** Understand how to find patterns in the problems being solved [05:04:00].
*   **Frameworks over Success Points:** Develop frameworks for solving problems, which are easier to scale, repeat, and sustain, rather than relying on individual successes or patterns from other companies [05:44:00].
*   **Minimize Context Switching:** Reduce constant shifts between different optimization problems (e.g., funnel optimization, conversion rates, loop creation) by applying consistent frameworks [05:57:00]. This creates a repeatable, sustainable, and competitively defensible growth model that fosters a growth culture and mindset across the company [05:00:00].

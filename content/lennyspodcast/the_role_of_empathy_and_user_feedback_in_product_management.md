The [[role_of_product_managers | Product Manager (PM)]] role necessitates a deep understanding of users and a commitment to gathering their feedback to create successful products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:58">[01:36:58]</a>. This involves being "fundamentally inseparable from your users" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:00">[09:32:00]</a> and constantly seeking insights to inform product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:00">[09:55:00]</a>.

## Cultivating User Empathy

Empathy is a crucial skill for product managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:58">[01:36:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:54:00">[57:54:00]</a>. It's about feeling what a user is feeling through research insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:00">[09:55:00]</a> and building an emotional connection to the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:21:00">[18:21:00]</a>.

### Immersing in the User Base
To build empathy, PMs should constantly immerse themselves in their user base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:26:00">[42:26:00]</a>. This means:
*   **Constant Conversations** Engaging in ongoing discussions with users to understand their pain points and daily tool usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:46:00">[23:46:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:57:00">[42:57:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:22">[01:21:22]</a>. This creates a "repository or library of conversations" for future product decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:08:00">[24:08:00]</a>.
*   **Asking Non-Users** It's vital to ask non-users why they aren't using the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:38:00">[44:38:00]</a>. This can uncover insights related to marketing and perceptions that surround the product, not just its features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:55:00">[44:55:00]</a>.
*   **Engaging with Sales Teams** For products with specialized audiences (e.g., infra, security products), partnering closely with the sales team is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:11:00">[46:11:00]</a>. Participating in sales calls allows product teams to cross-pollinate customer pain points into the product roadmap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:54:00">[46:54:00]</a>.

### Operationalizing User Insights
Insights gathered from user conversations should actively inform the product roadmap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:30:00">[49:30:00]</a>. This can involve:
*   **Prioritization:** Using user input as a signal to prioritize or deprioritize items on the roadmap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:31:00">[48:31:00]</a>.
*   **Creating Artifacts for Sales:** Developing resources like "Loom videos" that demonstrate various use cases of the product, which sales teams can use to evangelize its capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:56:00">[48:56:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:38:00">[49:38:00]</a>.
*   **Systematic Feedback Collection:** Storing feedback that isn't immediately actionable in a backlog (e.g., using a Slack integration to turn feedback into tasks in a system like Asana) for weekly grooming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:09:00">[50:09:00]</a>.

## Leveraging User Feedback in Product Development

[[Importance of user feedback in product development | User feedback]] is integral throughout the product development cycle, especially when dealing with uncertainty and potential pivots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40:00">[08:40:00]</a>.

### Iterative Approach to Visioning
Instead of a linear process, the visioning phase should involve a "cross-pollination of functions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:00">[09:42:00]</a>. This means integrating:
*   **Research Insights:** To deeply understand user feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:00">[09:55:00]</a>.
*   **Designs and Prototypes:** To visually communicate the future product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:00">[10:00:00]</a>.
*   **Engineering Feasibility:** To ensure the vision is achievable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:00">[10:06:00]</a>.

A compelling vision pitch should combine pain points, solutions, and proof points (e.g., user testimonials or data) to make the idea resonate emotionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:51:00">[11:51:00]</a>.

### Prototyping for Buy-In
At Figma, there's a strong emphasis on "designing and prototyping even before a project gets a green light" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:02:00">[18:02:00]</a>. This "see to believe and see to feel" approach helps generate emotional pull and secure investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:17:00">[18:17:00]</a>.

Even without extensive design or engineering skills, PMs can leverage new tools (e.g., AI for rapid prototyping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:55:00">[19:55:00]</a>) or simply "go around and ask people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:17:00">[20:17:00]</a> to collaborate on mockups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:05:00">[21:05:00]</a>. Hackathons like "Maker Week" at Figma provide an excellent opportunity to gather initial buy-in and build momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:46:00">[20:46:00]</a>.

### "Strong Opinions, Weakly Held"
When presenting an idea, even if it's an "A minus idea" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:50:00">[25:50:00]</a>, it acts as a catalyst for discussion and refinement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:15:00">[25:15:00]</a>. People are more likely to react to an existing idea than to nothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:25:00">[25:25:00]</a>. However, it's crucial to be willing to "kill your darlings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:22:00">[26:22:00]</a> and pivot based on external signals from users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:31:00">[26:31:00]</a>.

### Early Staging and Dogfooding
A unique aspect of Figma's process is its "multi-month plus long staging or dogfooding process" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:10">[01:17:10]</a>. Putting a product on staging early allows the team to receive valuable feedback, directly benefiting the product's maturity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:49">[01:27:49]</a>. This process also makes internal stakeholders invested, as they see their feedback directly shaping the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:14">[01:28:14]</a>. This constant feedback loop fosters collective investment and drives success, embodying the idea that "product development is a team sport" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:55">[01:28:55]</a>.

By combining deep user empathy with a robust feedback loop and a willingness to iterate, product managers can effectively navigate the complexities of product development and deliver impactful solutions.

To truly excel in public speaking and ensure your message resonates, it's essential to embrace the power of storytelling. While "storytelling" is a business buzzword, many are hesitant to fully embody it, fearing they will "separate themselves from the herd" [00:12:00]. However, the alternative is to be "forgettable" [00:23:00]. Our minds are not designed to remember facts, statistics, or platitudes unless they are attached to imagery and narrative [00:33:00].

Matthew Dicks, a 59-time Moth Story Slam winner and author of *Storyworthy*, emphasizes the importance of storytelling in both personal and professional life. His insights offer practical ways to improve communication and build confidence on stage.

## Core Concepts of Storytelling

At its heart, a compelling story revolves around a central, transformative moment.

### The Five-Second Moment
Every effective story is built around a singular "5-second moment" [00:05:19]. This moment signifies either:
*   **Transformation**: The storyteller changes from one kind of person to another [00:05:38].
*   **Realization**: The storyteller's understanding or belief shifts [00:05:47].

These changes accumulate over time but culminate in a specific "flip" [00:06:06]. The primary purpose of a story is to bring this moment to maximum clarity for the audience, allowing them to experience the transformation or realization alongside the storyteller [00:06:19]. The vast majority (98%) of the story serves as context, leading up to this crucial moment [00:06:32].

### Starting at the End
For true stories about oneself, one's company, or products, the storyteller should "start at the end" [01:02:00]. Knowing the story's conclusion, specifically the 5-second moment, dictates everything that precedes it [01:11:00]. A story's beginning and end should operate "in opposition to each other" [01:11:00].

### The Universal Appeal of Change
While specific daily events might only resonate with those in similar fields, stories about change have "great universal appeal" [01:15:16]. Audiences connect with narratives of finding confidence, overcoming challenges, or shifting beliefs, even if the content itself is unfamiliar [01:15:23].

## What Makes a Good Story?

Matthew Dicks provides a simple checklist for a good story:

1.  **A Change Happens**: As discussed, a core element is a moment of transformation or realization [01:16:09].
2.  **The Dinner Test**: A story told formally should be similar to one you'd share at a dinner party [01:16:17]. Avoid "performance art" elements like unattributed dialogue or starting with a sound effect, as these are unnatural in real conversation [01:16:47]. Aim for a "slightly elevated" version of natural speaking [01:18:16].
3.  **It Must Be Your Story**: When telling a true story, it must be centered on *your* experience [01:18:24]. Telling someone else's story can feel like fiction and doesn't allow for the necessary "vulnerability" [01:18:49]. Sharing your heart and mind creates a deeper connection with the audience [01:19:23]. Even historical or third-person accounts can be made personal by focusing on how that experience "informed or changed your own life" [01:20:00].

> "If you're telling a story about someone else, essentially you might as well be tell fiction because that person's not in the room and to the audience they don't really exist unless they're you know if they can't see them that person is just another human being who supposedly lives somewhere in the world or once lived in the world and because of that you are almost unable to express any vulnerability in your story you can't reveal anything about yourself and storytelling is one of the key parts of storytelling is to be vulnerable with your audience" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:24">[01:18:24]</a>

## Adding Stakes to Your Story

To keep an audience engaged, they must be "constantly wondering what the next sentence is" [01:24:14]. Stakes are what the audience should be worried about, hoping for, or concerned about for the storyteller, company, or product [01:23:35].

Strategies for adding stakes:

*   **The Elephant**: Immediately establish a big, worrying element at the beginning of the story. This doesn't have to be the core of the story but grabs attention [01:25:24].
*   **The Backpack**: Share your plan or hopes with the audience *before* carrying it out. This allows them to feel your hopes and fears as the story unfolds [01:26:22].
*   **Breadcrumbs**: Offer small hints or pieces of information that create anticipation without revealing the full picture [01:26:56].
*   **Hourglasses**: When a critical moment is about to happen, slow down the narrative and load it with details to keep the audience on the edge of their seat [01:27:21].
*   **Crystal Balls**: Predict a (potentially terrible) future outcome if things go wrong. This creates worry and investment in the audience [01:27:48].
*   **Surprise**: Deliver moments where the audience "didn't see something coming and then it was almost like it was inevitable" [01:28:31]. The best surprises are those where, in hindsight, all the clues were present.

It's crucial to spread out stakes throughout the story, rather than "frontload" them all at the beginning [01:31:45].

## Public Speaking Tips for Business

In a business context, where communication can often be "round, white, and flavorless" [01:34:48], storytelling helps you stand out and be remembered.

*   **Be Memorable**: If you don't tell stories, you risk being "forgettable" [01:34:40]. Our minds are not designed to retain facts, statistics, or abstract ideas without accompanying imagery or narrative [01:37:00].
*   **Make it Personal**: While not making it *all* about you, strategically incorporating personal elements into your business narratives can create powerful connections [01:44:49]. Consider creating a "personal interest inventory" â€“ a list of relatable aspects of your life (e.g., being married, having children, hobbies) that you can cleverly weave into conversations or presentations [01:45:00].
*   **Use Humor**: Daring to be funny is a "brilliant and beautiful and simple way to differenti yourself" [01:51:48]. Many want to *have been* funny, but shy away from the risk of *being* funny [01:52:27].
    *   **Nostalgia**: Reflecting on the past can be inherently funny and relatable, especially when introducing new products or services by contrasting them with older ways of doing things [01:53:27]. This also demonstrates expertise and market understanding [01:56:31].
    *   **"One of These Things Is Not Like the Other"**: Present three elements, two expected and one unexpected, to generate humor [01:56:54].
*   **Speak with Adjacency**: When trying to explain something complex or convince someone of an idea, don't match content to content directly [01:03:25]. Instead, match "theme, meaning, or message" [01:03:31]. Tell a story about something seemingly unrelated that shares the same underlying message. The "snap" moment, when the audience realizes the connection, is incredibly powerful and memorable [01:04:16].

## Homework for Life: Building a Story Bank

The most valuable tool for any aspiring storyteller is "Homework for Life" [01:06:50]. This practice involves:

1.  **Daily Reflection**: Every day, before bed, look back and identify one moment "worth telling as a story" [01:07:35]. This could be a "5-second moment" or simply something that touched your heart or mind [01:22:23].
2.  **Record It**: Use an Excel spreadsheet or similar tool. Create two columns: date and a space for a brief description of the moment [01:07:49].
3.  **Consistency**: Commit to doing this every single day, even if the moment seems trivial [01:15:54]. Over time, you'll develop a "lens for storytelling" and notice more moments [01:08:34].

**Benefits of Homework for Life**:

*   **Endless Stories**: You'll discover your life is "filled with more stories than I will ever have time to tell" [01:10:00].
*   **Slowing Down Time**: By consciously remembering daily events, you "recover your time" and perceive time as flying less quickly [01:11:39].
*   **Seeing Patterns**: The practice helps you identify recurring themes or behaviors in your life you might not otherwise notice [01:12:08].
*   **Memory Recovery**: Once you start looking through a storytelling lens, old forgotten memories will "bubble up" and can be added to your bank [01:10:48].
*   **Therapeutic Value**: Beyond collecting stories, it's a valuable practice for self-reflection and understanding your own experiences.

## Overcoming Public Speaking Nerves

[[overcoming_public_speaking_anxiety | Managing presentation nerves and stage presence]] is a common challenge, but there are strategies to help:

1.  **Understand the Source**: Recognize that 98% of nervousness occurs *before* you start speaking [01:20:01]. Once you begin, most nerves dissipate [01:20:09]. This realization can be a huge relief.
2.  **Normalcy**: Understand that almost everyone experiences nervousness, even seasoned professionals [01:21:55]. You are not alone.
3.  **Preparation**:
    *   **Record and Listen**: Record your talk and listen to it passively (e.g., while doing chores) [01:22:23]. This helps the content "seep into your soul" and become ingrained [01:22:35].
    *   **Focus on Transitions**: Actively listen to your recording specifically for the transitions between sections or scenes [01:23:08]. Weak transitions are often where people get lost [01:23:15]. Mentally walk through the "scenes" of your story without telling the whole narrative [01:24:16].
    *   **Avoid Memorization**: Memorizing your talk word-for-word can lead to "suffering" [01:24:31]. Instead, aim to "remember your talk without memorizing your talk" [01:24:41].
4.  **Practice**: Your first stories or talks won't be perfect, but consistent [[exercises_to_improve_public_speaking_skills | practice]] is key to improvement [01:16:50]. Public speaking is more about "decision-making" and strategic choices than innate talent [01:17:12].

## The Power of "Yes"

Saying "yes" to opportunities, even those that seem crazy or scary, is a powerful life philosophy that can lead to extraordinary experiences and rich stories [01:29:05].

> "When someone offers you an opportunity as crazy as it is as ridiculous as much as you don't want to do it... have resulted in the best and most extraordinary opportunities of my life." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:19">[01:27:19]</a>

*   **Overcome Presumption**: Saying "no" often stems from the "presumptuous" belief that you already know what's on the other side of an unfamiliar door [01:26:54].
*   **Flexibility**: A "yes" can always turn into a "no" later [01:27:41]. You can step through the door, experience it, and decide it's not for you, then step back out.
*   **Embrace Fear**: The things that frighten you are often the things that are "the best for me" [01:29:15]. Running towards what scares you can open up unexpected and valuable paths.

## A Final Tactical Tip

To immediately improve any story or talk:
Start every story with **location** and **action** [01:38:17].
*   **Location**: "I am in a place" [01:39:05]. This activates the audience's imagination, allowing them to visualize the setting with their own "thousand adjectives" [01:38:27].
*   **Action**: "I am doing a thing" [01:39:05]. This immediately signals to the audience that the story is moving forward and something is happening [01:39:08].

This simple opening acts as a signal, telling the audience, "the movie's on, nobody talks" [01:40:34], and encourages them to listen. This is particularly powerful for those from marginalized groups who may find it harder to command attention [01:39:46].

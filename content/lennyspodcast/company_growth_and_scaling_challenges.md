HubSpot's co-founder and CTO, Dharmesh Shah, discusses various challenges faced by companies as they grow and scale, offering unique perspectives and solutions based on his experiences.

## From Startup to Large Public Company

Dharmesh Shah, a "startup guy at heart," reveals that he is "having a better time at HubSpot now it's 7,000 people than I was having at 70 people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:15">[01:18:15]</a>. This is because he experiences "all the upside of scale," such as making big bets, long-term planning, and aiming for global domination, "without the downsides of scale," like having to manage many people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:20">[01:18:20]</a>.

### Public vs. Private Status

Founders often feel apprehensive about transitioning from a private to a public company, fearing it will "change everything" and make their life "suck" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>. However, there are significant benefits to being publicly traded:
*   **Clear Valuation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:37">[00:21:37]</a>: A public company knows its market valuation on "any business day of the week" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a>. While valuation oscillates, it tends to track the actual value created over time in an efficient market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:02">[00:22:02]</a>.
*   **Broader Participation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>: Going public allows a wider group, including customers, partners, and well-wishers, to participate in the company's growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:12">[00:23:12]</a>. HubSpot, for example, went from $1 billion in market cap privately to $30 billion publicly, with the majority of that growth accessible to public investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>.

A key lesson from Amazon, which HubSpot applies, is that being a public company "does not mandate that you do certain things" other than transparency about the company's direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a>. Companies can "stay true to that" vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:38">[00:24:38]</a>.

### Transparency as a Founding Principle

HubSpot maintains a core value of transparency, where "all information within HubSpot is equally shared with everyone of the company" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:03">[00:25:03]</a>, with two exceptions: illegal information sharing (e.g., acquisitions under NDA) and salaries (co-owned by the individual) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:22">[00:25:22]</a>.

When preparing for IPO, lawyers advised a small group of "designated insiders" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>. However, Shah and his co-founder discovered there was no legal limit to the number of insiders. Consequently, HubSpot designated "every single employee to be a designated Insider" on the day they went public, allowing them to maintain full transparency. This practice continues even with over 7,000 employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:39">[00:26:39]</a>.

## Battling Complexity: The Second Law of Thermodynamics

Shah frames the challenge of scaling as "fighting the second law of thermodynamics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">[00:37:37]</a>, which states that "within a closed system entropy increases over time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:43">[00:37:43]</a>. In layman's terms, "over time unless you intervene, everything goes to crap" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:04">[00:38:04]</a>. This applies to companies:
*   **Early Stage**: Fighting to survive, "just trying not to die" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:39">[00:38:39]</a>.
*   **Second Phase**: Trying not to stagnate, driving [[Growth strategies in tech companies | growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:46">[00:38:46]</a>.
*   **Third Stage**: Fighting complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:01">[00:39:01]</a>. Complexity causes everything to become "more complicated," requiring more management layers and headcount, leading to slower operations and eventual decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:14">[00:39:14]</a>.

To combat this, HubSpot champions "fight for simplicity" as a cultural principle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:53">[00:39:53]</a>. Simplicity is "worth fighting for" and "requires fighting for" because the "universe is working against you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:58">[00:39:58]</a>. Well-intentioned individuals often inadvertently introduce complexity through new tiers, features, or options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:14">[00:40:14]</a>.

### Simplicity in Practice: Product and Operations

*   **Product Development**: In HubSpot's early years, a rule for product development was "every time you added what we thought of is a knob or dial called a feature you had to take one out somewhere else" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:03">[00:41:03]</a>. This forced product teams to think about the long-term costs of complexity, not just the initial development and maintenance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:11">[00:42:11]</a>. Adding a new product, for instance, introduces "dimensional complexity" affecting every decision, from hiring to marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:43">[00:42:43]</a>.
*   **Operational Simplification**: HubSpot tried to start with the "simplest possible thing" and add complexity only when necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:40">[00:34:40]</a>.
    *   **Salaries**: Early on, everyone, including founders, received a flat salary of $5,000/month for the first year and a half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:56">[00:32:56]</a>. This simplified compensation.
    *   **Seating**: In early offices, a lottery system was used to assign seats, even for founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:25">[00:35:25]</a>. This avoided office politics and fostered better chemistry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:43">[00:36:43]</a>. While the algorithm was updated over time (e.g., quarterly shuffles, local optimizations), the core idea of minimizing complexity related to seating arrangements persisted for hundreds of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:07">[00:36:07]</a>.

## [[Product Operations and Scaling Product Management | Scaling Product Management]] and Strategy

### Specialization vs. Broadness

Conventional startup wisdom advises focusing on "one thing and be really really exceptionally world-class at that one thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. HubSpot chose the opposite approach: building a broad "all-in-one" product from year one that included SEO tools, web analytics, blogging, and content management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:41">[00:51:41]</a>.

Their "zig" (contrarian approach) was based on solving the actual customer problem for SMBs, who lacked the resources to integrate disparate best-of-breed tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:10">[00:52:10]</a>.

*   **Heuristic for Broadness**: In early resource-constrained years, HubSpot measured if they were in the top three in any individual product category (e.g., blogging tools) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:14">[00:53:14]</a>. If they were, it meant they had "invested too much in that category" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:23">[00:53:23]</a>, as their value proposition was the integrated system, not individual component excellence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:33">[00:53:33]</a>. (Note: This heuristic evolved, and later, HubSpot aimed to be top three in most categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:59">[00:53:59]</a>).

Founders should "fall in love with the problem," not just the solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:51">[00:54:51]</a>. If understanding the problem deeply necessitates a broader product, then it should be pursued, provided there are self-imposed constraints to prevent complexity from becoming fatal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:40">[00:55:40]</a>.

### [[Growth strategies in tech companies | Growth Strategies in Tech Companies]]: Focusing on SMBs

HubSpot's decision to focus on the Small and Medium Business (SMB) market was a "high conviction, low consensus bet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:12">[00:29:12]</a>. While many considered it difficult due to challenges like difficult scaling and lower revenue per customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:27">[00:45:27]</a>, HubSpot persisted for 18 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:36">[00:29:36]</a>.

The advantages of the SMB market, compared to enterprise or consumer markets:
*   **Revenue Generation**: Like enterprise software, SMB solutions allow charging for the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:34">[00:47:34]</a>.
*   **Scalability**: Like consumer products, there are millions of SMBs to sell to, avoiding revenue concentration issues of enterprise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:50">[00:47:50]</a>.
*   **Feedback Loops**: SMB markets offer short feedback loops, allowing for experimentation and risk-taking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:57">[00:47:57]</a>.

While historically challenging, the SMB market has now seen more success stories (e.g., Shopify) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:47">[00:48:47]</a>. Shah observes a "reverse gravity" in software: successful companies tend to be "pulled up" into the enterprise market over time as they cater to larger customers who stay longer and pay more <a class="yt>timestamp" data-t="00:49:07">[00:49:07]</a>. This means companies that remain focused on SMBs face less competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:58">[00:49:58]</a>.

## Leadership and Management

### [[Hiring and Scaling a Sales Team | Hiring and Scaling a Sales Team]] and Direct Reports

Dharmesh Shah made a conscious decision "not to have any direct reports" from day one at HubSpot and has maintained this for 18 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>. This stems from his self-assessment that he "suck[s] at management" and would rather focus his energy on things he is good at and enjoys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:08">[01:17:08]</a>. This decision, though unusual for a CTO, allowed him to thrive at HubSpot's scale, getting "all the upside of scale with very little of the downside" of managing people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:36">[01:18:36]</a>.

This exemplifies the idea that leaders "don't have to do it the way everybody else has done" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:51">[01:18:51]</a>.

### Decision Making

HubSpot has evolved its decision-making process, recognizing that while data is important, "data doesn't make decisions, people do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:18">[01:03:18]</a>. Key principles include:
*   **Designate a Decision Maker**: Clearly identify the Directly Responsible Individual (DRI) who will make the decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:50">[01:03:50]</a>.
*   **Debate, Decide, Unite**: HubSpot's version of Amazon's "disagree and commit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:11">[01:04:11]</a>. It emphasizes open debate, making a clear decision, and then uniting around it, even if individuals disagreed with the outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:17">[01:05:17]</a>. This aims to be more "friendly" and "HubSpotty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:31">[01:05:31]</a>.
*   **Proportionality**: The effort (calories) spent on a decision "should be proportional to the consequences of that decision" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:29">[01:07:29]</a>. This is akin to Jeff Bezos's "one-way doors vs. two-way doors" heuristic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:35">[01:07:35]</a>.
*   **Systematic Thinking**: Approaching decisions like writing a Python function or building an Excel spreadsheet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>. Identify all relevant factors ("columns") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:21">[01:06:21]</a>, then rank their importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:05">[01:07:05]</a>. This exercise provides better information for human decision-makers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:15">[01:07:15]</a>.

### Flash Tags for Communication

To manage the "megaphone issue" where leaders' casual opinions are taken as mandates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:03">[00:58:03]</a>, Shah uses "flash tags" in his communications, particularly email:
*   **#FYI**: For your information, no response expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:04">[00:59:04]</a>.
*   **#Suggestion**: A thought to explore, no response expected, but something he would consider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:20">[00:59:20]</a>.
*   **#Recommendation**: Thought-out advice; a response is appreciated if not followed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:44">[00:59:44]</a>.
*   **#Plea**: A strong belief, begging for action, but still not a mandate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:18">[01:00:18]</a>.

This system, which is on the company wiki, allows for clear communication of the weight of a statement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:39">[01:00:39]</a>. It supports HubSpot's belief in autonomy and trusting its people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:17">[01:11:17]</a>.

### Culture as a Product

When tasked with defining HubSpot's culture, Shah realized that culture already existed; his job was to "articulate the culture" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:41">[01:17:41]</a>. He approached this by asking: "If I could write a python function that would measure the probability of success of a new person coming into HubSpot, what would the factors be?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:51">[01:17:51]</a>. This led to the creation of the "Culture Code" deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:48">[01:20:48]</a>.

Shah's core idea is that "culture is a product" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:28">[01:21:28]</a>. Just as a company builds a product for its customers, it also builds "a product they build for their team" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:37">[01:21:37]</a>. This postulate leads to several insights:
*   **Customer Feedback**: Just as product teams talk to customers, culture creators must talk to employees (the "customers of the product") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:57">[01:21:57]</a>. HubSpot uses regular NPS surveys to gauge employee satisfaction and identify "bugs" in the culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:07">[01:22:07]</a>. All survey responses are published internally for transparency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:20">[01:23:20]</a>.
*   **Iteration, Not Preservation**: A common mistake is believing the job is to "preserve the culture" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:37">[01:22:37]</a>. Instead, culture should be "iterated on," like a product, because employee needs change as the company scales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:02">[01:23:02]</a>.
*   **Core Values vs. Flexible Principles**: While there are core values (like transparency) that endure and act like "federal laws" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:57">[01:26:57]</a>, other aspects of culture can be optimized by individual groups, similar to "state law" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:11">[01:27:11]</a>. For example, while HubSpot generally doesn't care about work hours, the support team requires coverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:42">[01:27:42]</a>.
*   **Aspirational Elements**: Culture documents can include aspirational elements that, when openly acknowledged, can become "self-fulfilling prophecies" as new employees adopt them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:56">[01:29:56]</a>.

## Identifying Good Ideas and Future Relevance

Shah uses a four-factor framework for evaluating new ideas (startups, products, features):
1.  **Potential**: If successful, what is the "magnitude of the outcome"? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:37">[01:10:37]</a>
2.  **Probability of Success**: What is the likelihood of achieving that outcome? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:52">[01:10:52]</a> (Avoid filtering out ideas based solely on low probability without considering high potential/expected value) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>.
3.  **Passion/Proximity**: How much does one care about solving this problem? Is it something one can work on for years? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:36">[01:12:36]</a>
4.  **Prowess**: What unique assets or unfair advantages (e.g., existing code, market access) does one possess to pursue this idea? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:49">[01:12:49]</a>

### The Impact of AI

Shah views AI as a transformative shift, comparable to the internet's arrival in the 90s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:04">[01:32:04]</a>. While PCs provided "compute at scale" and the internet offered "distribution at scale," AI provides "cognition at scale," amplifying the human brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:47">[01:32:47]</a>.

AI enables a shift from "imperative" (step-by-step instructions) to "declarative" (describing the desired outcome) software models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:43">[01:34:43]</a>. This means users can express what they want (e.g., "generate a report of all my customers in Europe") without knowing the exact clicks or commands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:35">[01:35:35]</a>. This technology was not feasible for products like his earlier "Growth Bot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:02">[01:36:02]</a> but is now a reality.

To understand and adapt to AI, Shah recommends finding an "actual problem that you care about and go try to solve it with that thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:49">[01:37:49]</a>. He encourages building and learning in public, as the internet is effective at providing feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:35">[01:38:35]</a>.

## Definition of Success

Dharmesh Shah's definition of success, adopted by HubSpot, is: "Success is making the people who believed in you look brilliant" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:34">[01:39:34]</a>. This includes employees, customers, and investors, reflecting an outward-facing, customer-centric philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:45">[01:39:45]</a>.

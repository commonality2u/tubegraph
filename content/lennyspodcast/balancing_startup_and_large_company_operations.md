Claire Vo, a Chief Product Officer at companies like Color, Optimizely, and LaunchDarkly, emphasizes that she is often hired into later-stage companies not to teach them how to operate like a big company, but to remind them they can operate like a startup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This approach focuses on maintaining a fast pace and high quality within larger organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>.

## Maintaining a Fast Pace

To achieve a faster pace, several strategies can be employed:

*   **Avoid Calendar-Driven Pace**
    Organizations often allow their pace to be dictated by the rhythm of recurring meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>. It's crucial to break this [[developing_and_implementing_company_structures_and_operating_systems | anti-pattern]] by insisting that discussions and decisions happen immediately or by the next day, rather than waiting for the next scheduled meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.

*   **"One Click Faster" Expectation**
    Leaders should communicate an expectation for the "clock speed" to be one click faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>. This means if something is planned for "this year," the expectation shifts to "this half"; if "this half," then "this quarter," and so on, down to "today" or "end of day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>. This sets a higher default pace and influences the energy and momentum of the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>.

*   **Personal SLA (Service Level Agreement)**
    Leaders must ensure their personal response times are fast to avoid becoming a bottleneck for the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>. By being responsive, they enable the rest of the team to operate at maximum speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.

## Upholding a High Bar for Quality

Maintaining a high bar for quality involves two main components: talent and product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>.

### Talent Bar

*   **Define and Articulate Expectations**
    Leaders must clearly define the talent bar, being specific and measurable about what is expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>. This includes having specific and measurable career ladders, especially at senior levels, to definitively assess performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>.

*   **Normalize Feedback**
    Open and candid feedback is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>. [[scaling_a_company_culture_while_maintaining_user_trust | Conflict-avoidant]] or feedback-avoidant cultures degrade the talent bar because expectations are not stated or accountability isn't held <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>. Being clear when expectations are not met, and making it clear that questioning ideas is not questioning innate talent, sets people up for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.

    > "You are not doing a good job is much kinder than I think you can improve on this aspect or that aspect or I've gotten some feedback that you could be better at like that's not kind because it doesn't set somebody else up for success either in your organization or somewhere else." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>

*   **Act Quickly on Non-Fits**
    When individuals are not a good fit, acting quickly is a hard but necessary part of the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>. This ensures the overall team operates in a healthy, effective, and performant way, making everyone happier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.

### Product Bar

*   **Focus on Impact and Delivery**
    The focus shifts from individual idea manifestation to whether the right products are being built quickly and delivering results, regardless of the tools used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>.

## Organizational Structure: The CPTO Role

The role of Chief Product and Technology Officer (CPTO), which combines product, engineering, and design functions, is becoming more prevalent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>.

*   **Technical Acumen**
    A CPTO must be technical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>. Understanding how software is built at a technical level is essential for driving value by ensuring a highly performing engineering team and scalable platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.

*   **Operational Mindset**
    The CPTO role is highly operational, requiring strong skills in [[developing_and_implementing_company_structures_and_operating_systems | organization design]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>. Engineering teams are significantly larger than product organizations, presenting different talent and cultural challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>. A CPTO is also on-call, responsible for critical system outages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>.

*   **Strategic Alignment and Leverage**
    The primary reasons for this role are:
    *   **Unified Building:** Product, engineering, and design are seen as one team, all building "capital P product" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>. This structure optimizes for the entire organization rather than individual functions, eliminating debates over what's best for product versus engineering or design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>.
    *   **CEO Leverage:** Research and Development (R&D) is a significant and complex investment. Having a single executive responsible for R&D investment provides tremendous leverage to the CEO and ensures accountability for this meaningful investment against business objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>.

*   **Founder Mindset and Broad Skills**
    Experience in a small, early-stage startup can provide the broad functional skills necessary for a CPTO role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>. This "founder mindset" helps individuals see how all functions are interconnected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:00">[05:09:00]</a>. Employees should be given permission to operate with a "no lanes" principle, where responsibilities are fluid and roles can overlap (e.g., an engineer writing a spec, a designer doing light coding) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:00">[05:49:00]</a>. This thinking fosters the types of leaders who can succeed in a CPTO role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>.

## Impact of AI on Operations

AI is expected to rapidly change operations in companies, particularly impacting roles like Product Management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>.

*   **Shifting Skills and Ratios**
    While AI may not eliminate Product Managers (PMs) entirely, the ratios between PMs and other teams are likely to shift, and the required skills will change much faster than anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>.

*   **Automation of "Lowercase C" Communication**
    AI tools are excellent at synthesizing information, composing communications, and coordinating information flow (e.g., writing PRDs, brainstorming ideas, improving documentation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>. This "lowercase c" communication, which involves the functional trading of information, may be largely replaced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>.

*   **Enduring Value of "Capital C" Communication and Strategy**
    Skills that AI will not easily replace include "Capital C" communication (influence, conviction, boldness), getting human systems to follow a path, and the human aspect of boldness in seeing the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>. While AI can synthesize strategies, the human elements of charisma and attracting alignment remain critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>.

*   **New Product Building Skills**
    PMs need to learn how to build "non-deterministic products" using new technologies like AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>. Specializing and learning new technologies can lead to very interesting positions, similar to the opportunities for PMs who embraced mobile technology in the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>. [[innovating_within_large_organizations | Studying existing products]] and conducting tear-downs, experimenting with no-code/low-code tools, and finding personal enjoyment in creative AI tools are ways to develop these skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>.

## Sales-Led Product Approach

Claire Vo identifies as a "sales-led product apologist," believing it is acceptable for product teams to be commercially oriented and listen to the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>. She argues that great businesses can be built on sales-led motions without compromising craft or user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>. Sometimes, PMs "turn their nose up" at powerhouse companies for being sales-led, but these companies can still develop excellent products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>.

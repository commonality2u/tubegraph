Duarte Incorporated, led by CEO Nancy Duarte, has been instrumental in shaping presentation design for over 35 years, helping to create more than 250,000 presentations for influential leaders, brands, and institutions, including Apple, Google, the World Bank, and Al Gore's *An Inconvenient Truth* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. Duarte emphasizes that effective presentations are not only for "big stage talks" but are essential in any "moment of influence," such as meetings or phone calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Core Principles of Innovative Presentation Design

According to Nancy Duarte, three key principles underpin effective and [[crafting_compelling_presentations | compelling presentations]]:

1.  **Audience as the Hero: The Power of Empathy**
    Duarte's methodology is "empathy first," stemming from her personal experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>. The audience, not the presenter, is the hero of the story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>. Presenters should act as mentors, coming alongside the audience to help them overcome internal conflicts and empower them to take action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>. This means understanding who the audience is and how to help them get unstuck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>.

    Duarte Incorporated conducts listening tours, surveys, and interviews to gather audience insights, performing "gap analysis" to compare current states with desired outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>. Draft presentations are then shared with leaders for feedback before being finalized for the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>. The goal is to ensure the message resonates and is empathetic to the audience's priorities and challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a>.

2.  **[[story_structure_in_presentations | Infusing Presentations with Story]] (What Is, What Could Be, New Bliss)**
    Effective presentations infuse talk with story by utilizing [[story_structure_in_presentations | story structures]] that mirror human cognitive processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:11">[00:24:11]</a>. This involves a "rise and fall" cadence, building and releasing tension, which creates longing for a future state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:34">[00:24:34]</a>.

    Visually, this structure can be imagined as traversing between "what is" (the current state) and "what could be" (the future state or solution), repeatedly moving between these two points until arriving at the "new bliss" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:53">[00:26:53]</a>. This contrast makes people long for a better future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:31">[00:27:31]</a>.

    > "The ability to just have that contrast as a framework in your brain during a meeting on a phone call any moment of influence like literally it works it works in any format." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:22">[00:31:22]</a>

    This "what is, what could be, new bliss" framework can be applied even in brief interactions, such as convincing a spouse to do chores, by providing context ("what is") and painting a picture of the positive outcome ("new bliss") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:01">[00:33:01]</a>.

3.  **[[visualization_and_desensitization_techniques_for_public_speaking | Can They See What You're Saying?]]**
    Visuals are crucial for comprehension and alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:20">[00:36:20]</a>. A presentation should use visual tools, such as presentation software, live sketchers, or simple diagrams, to help the audience understand complex ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:22">[00:36:22]</a>. For example, diagrams showing how technology works or how elements relate within a system can greatly enhance understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:04">[00:37:04]</a>. In informal settings, even drawing on a napkin or a whiteboard can create shared understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:43">[00:37:43]</a>.

    Sometimes, the absence of visuals, allowing the audience to focus solely on the speaker's words and presence, can be incredibly powerful, as seen in Dr. King's "I Have a Dream" speech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:31">[00:40:31]</a>.

## Evolution and Influence

### The Apple Legacy
Duarte Incorporated's long-standing relationship with Apple, starting from the company's founding, influenced modern presentation design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. Apple was among the first companies to connect computers to projectors at scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. Duarte pushed the boundaries of early presentation software, which initially produced "ugly" and "bitmapped" designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. A memorable moment was creating a slide covered entirely with the word "BIG" in hot pink against a black background for a 1992 sales conference, designed to literally light up the audience's faces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. This demonstrated that slides could be visually impactful, moving beyond being mere teleprompters filled with text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.

Duarte learned to "push the medium" to be more pleasing to the audience, emphasizing clarity of focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>. This meant aligning visuals with brand guidelines, making presentations cinematic and visually experiential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>. For instance, during Apple's "Think Different" campaign, Duarte chose a subtle animated background of floating particulates, echoing classic Alfred Hitchcock posters, rather than the then-popular beveled, cluttered Photoshop backgrounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>.

### Rise of the "Slide Doc"
The concept of a "slide doc" emerged to bridge the gap between large-scale stage presentations and internal meetings or email circulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:40">[00:42:40]</a>. A slide doc contains more words, stronger pictures, and potentially a lengthy appendix to allow for independent reading without a presenter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:56">[00:42:56]</a>. This is contrasted with traditional presentations, which rely heavily on the speaker's narration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:08">[00:43:08]</a>. The Minto Pyramid Principle, which suggests starting with the conclusion, can be effective for execs or fundraising, but other audiences may require a longer narrative to unpack the "future state" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:19">[00:46:19]</a>.

## Crafting Impactful Presentations

### Duarte's Pixar-Like Process
Duarte Incorporated approaches presentations with a process akin to how Pixar makes movies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:42">[00:50:42]</a>. This involves:
*   **Crafting the Narrative**: Developing the big idea and script <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:57">[00:50:57]</a>.
*   **Visualizing Key Moments**: Mapping out and chunking content, sometimes developing revolutionary models that drive web assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:02">[00:51:02]</a>.
*   **Circulating and Building Consensus**: Sharing initial concepts within the company to ensure alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:22">[00:51:22]</a>.
*   **Iterative Refinement**: Working out "kinks" in the narrative before delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:41">[00:51:41]</a>.

The process is highly adaptable, tailored to the unique presenter, audience, and context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:09">[00:53:09]</a>. For instance, when a multinational company executive needed to secure a $100 million budget, Duarte advised against using slides, instead suggesting he draw on a whiteboard to maintain eye contact and convey passion, which ultimately secured the funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:11">[00:52:11]</a>.

For creating individual slides, it's recommended to:
*   **Plan and Sketch First**: Avoid immediately opening presentation software, instead sketching out the narrative structure (e.g., using storyboards) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:21">[00:48:21]</a>.
*   **One Point Per Slide**: Each slide should make a single point to support the overall "big idea" of the talk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:38">[00:41:38]</a>.
*   **Match Slide Type to Content**: Choose appropriate slide types (e.g., tables for dense project information) that align with the audience's communication culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:12">[00:49:12]</a>.
*   **Avoid "Cookie Cutter" Approaches**: Modify content based on the audience, especially for high-stakes presentations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:11">[00:44:11]</a>.

### Presenting Remotely
Remote presentations require specific considerations:
*   **Eye Contact**: Practice looking directly into the camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:30">[00:53:30]</a>.
*   **Presence**: Compensation for the lack of visible body language (hands, physical space) and adapting to new communication dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:09">[00:54:09]</a>. The shift to remote work has impacted traditional soft skills like face-to-face eye contact and understanding non-verbal cues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:35">[00:54:35]</a>.

## [[techniques_for_enhancing_public_speaking_skills | Conquering Presentation Nerves]]
Nervousness before presenting is a natural "fight or flight" instinct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:45">[00:56:45]</a>. Those who feel nervous often have "gorgeous content" because they are deep and thoughtful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:22">[00:56:22]</a>. To manage nerves:
*   **Visualization**: Sit in the audience seats, then imagine yourself on stage seeing friendly, happy faces in the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>.
*   **Calming Rituals**: Find a quiet, dark space backstage to breathe deeply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:10">[00:58:10]</a>.
*   **Chemical Shift**: Watch a short, funny video or recall humorous memories right before going on stage to induce laughter, chemically shifting the body from nervousness to a relaxed state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:26">[00:58:26]</a>.
*   **Choose Passionate Topics**: Practice presenting on topics you are genuinely passionate about. This builds a foundation of presenting from your "soul" that can be applied to other, less exciting topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:20">[01:15:20]</a>.

## Leading Through Communication: The Torchbearer Leader
In her book *Illuminate*, Nancy Duarte explores the concept of the "torchbearer leader," who guides people through movements of change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:26">[01:02:26]</a>. A torchbearer leader understands the ultimate destination but may only see a few steps ahead, much like a torch illuminating a path in a cave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:40">[01:02:40]</a>. This limited but sufficient vision dissipates the fear of those following <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:43">[01:02:43]</a>.

Movements follow a five-act structure:
1.  **Dream**: Verbalizing the vision for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:05">[01:02:05]</a>.
2.  **Leap**: Individuals choose to commit to the journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:09">[01:03:09]</a>.
3.  **Fight**: The initial enthusiasm gives way to the realization of challenges and roadblocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:37">[01:03:37]</a>.
4.  **Climb**: Sustained effort through difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:29">[01:03:29]</a>.
5.  **Arrive**: Reaching the desired future state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:56">[01:03:56]</a>.

Throughout these phases, leaders must use speeches, stories, ceremonies, and symbols to provide emotional fuel and keep people moving toward the larger initiative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>.

## The Power of Informal Content
Modern video content production expectations have shifted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:21">[01:05:21]</a>. Highly polished, professionally produced videos are not always necessary for effective communication. An informal, informative video can outperform a high-production-value one, demonstrating that content and clear communication often outweigh elaborate visual effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:01">[01:06:01]</a>.

## [[storytelling_and_drawing_in_product_management | Storytelling in Product Management]]
The [[storytelling_and_drawing_in_product_management | product management]] process can greatly benefit from [[storytelling_and_drawing_in_product_management | storytelling]]. An example is Airbnb's "Snow White" project, where a team literally walked through a customer's "day in the life" scenario, with an illustrator capturing each scene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:12">[01:08:12]</a>. This process led them to realize they needed to shift to a mobile-first strategy and helped define key user journeys that became central to the company's strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:41">[01:08:41]</a>.

Even in product reveals, like Apple launches, [[storytelling_and_drawing_in_product_management | storytelling]] is crucial for building excitement and conveying the meaning and "why" behind a product, influencing its acceptance or rejection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:49">[01:09:49]</a>.

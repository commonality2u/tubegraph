From: [[lennyspodcast]] <br/> 

Pricing often immediately brings to mind specific dollar figures, but Madhavan Ramanujam, author of *Monetizing Innovation*, views price as a measure of value, akin to how a liter measures volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This perspective highlights that price reflects whether people truly desire and would purchase a product, which is the core of the [[how_to_conduct_willingness_to_pay_conversations | willingness to pay (WTP)]] conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## What is Willingness to Pay (WTP)?

Willingness to Pay (WTP) is a crucial metric that indicates whether customers value a product and how strongly they desire it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. It's not just about product-market fit; it's about achieving "product-market-pricing fit." Without considering pricing, feedback on product liking can be misleading, as the price significantly alters the customer's perception of value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>.

## Why WTP is Crucial

*   **Beyond Product-Market Fit**
    While "product-market fit" is a well-understood concept, Madhavan emphasizes the need to validate "product-market-pricing fit." A product might be liked, but its appeal changes drastically when a price is attached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. Hearing what customers want to hear without a price attached leads to missed opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>.

*   **Early Validation and Preventing Failure**
    Companies and entrepreneurs should assess WTP much earlier in the product development process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. This means engaging in sales and marketing conversations about value and asking about payment even before launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. Delaying this conversation, or treating pricing as an afterthought, is a primary reason 72% of innovations fail commercially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. Early WTP assessment allows for product pivots and ensures the product is built around what customers genuinely need, value, and are willing to pay for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. This concept is summarized as "price before product, period" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>.

    *   **Porsche Cayenne Example**: Porsche famously engaged with the market to understand the need, value, and WTP for an SUV even before drawing a blueprint. Every feature was battle-tested with customers, ensuring that only desired elements (like a large cup holder) were included, while unwanted ones (like six-speed manual transmission in an SUV) were discarded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>. This customer-centric design led to the Cayenne becoming a roaring success, accounting for over half of Porsche's profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>.

    *   **Two-Sided Marketplace Example**: A two-sided marketplace company planned a new product for the buy side. After an extensive ideation process, they presented 40 ideas to the CEO, who questioned their monetization certainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>. By testing wireframes and concepts with customers, they discovered that internal "awesome" features, like "highlight connections from Facebook," had no WTP, with customers expressing disinterest, unwillingness to pay, or privacy concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>. This early validation prevented a disastrous product launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:28">[00:21:28]</a>.

*   **Product Prioritization**
    WTP conversations are essential for prioritizing product roadmaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a>. They reveal which 20% of features drive 80% of WTP, allowing product teams to focus on high-value development rather than over-indexing on less important features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:11">[00:22:11]</a>.

## How to Conduct WTP Conversations

Directly asking "how much should I charge for this product?" yields "garbage" answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:34">[00:24:34]</a>. Instead, nuanced approaches are needed:

1.  **Relative Framing**: Ask questions in a comparative manner. For a B2B SaaS product, you might ask, "If Salesforce was indexed at 100 in value, where do you think we are?" followed by "If Salesforce was indexed at 100 in pricing, where do you think we should be?" This elicits meaningful relative responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:03">[00:25:03]</a>.

2.  **Psychological Thresholds**: After explaining the product's value (as in a sales and marketing pitch), ask customers:
    *   "What do you think is an **acceptable price** for this innovation?" (where they love both the product and the price) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:43">[00:26:43]</a>
    *   "What do you think is an **expensive price**?" (value-priced, neutral reaction) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:54">[00:26:54]</a>
    *   "What do you think is a **prohibitively expensive price**?" (they would "laugh you out of the room") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:57">[00:26:57]</a>
    This method helps identify "cliffs" or psychological thresholds where willingness to pay drops significantly, like crossing from $99 to $101 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:31">[00:27:31]</a>. Rahul Vora used this to determine Superhuman's $30 price point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:55">[00:27:55]</a>.

3.  **Purchase Probability Questions**: Ask customers, on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = not interested, 5 = most likely to buy), how likely they are to buy the product at a given price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:45">[00:28:45]</a>. Even a "5" often only means 30-50% certainty of purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:08">[00:29:08]</a>. This helps build demand curves and understand price elasticity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:22">[00:29:22]</a>.

4.  **Most/Least Important Feature Identification**: Instead of ranking all features, present subsets (e.g., 6 out of 10) and ask customers to identify the "most important" (must-have, willing to pay) and "least important" (don't need, won't pay) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:51">[00:29:51]</a>. People are better at identifying extremes, and repeating this with different subsets helps prioritize the entire feature set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:39">[00:30:39]</a>.

5.  **Trade-off Exercises**: For more advanced analysis, create realistic buying scenarios (e.g., different product packaging and pricing options) and ask customers how they would choose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>. This reveals underlying mental models and rules customers use to make decisions, indicating how adding features or increasing prices affects their choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:40">[00:31:40]</a>.

It is critical to ask "why" after customers give their responses, as approximately 50% of follow-up questions should be "why" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:21">[00:32:21]</a>. This elicits valuable information for product design or value messaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:28">[00:32:28]</a>.

## Practical Application of WTP Conversations

*   **Who Conducts Them**: Early-stage founders can lead one-on-one conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:55">[00:33:55]</a>. At later stages, cross-functional teams (sales, product) can conduct these with multiple decision-makers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:10">[00:34:10]</a>.
*   **Meeting Setup**: These discussions can occur in one-on-one meetings, focus groups, or through quantitative surveys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:04">[00:35:04]</a>. For B2C companies, thousands of survey responses can be statistically significant. For B2B SaaS, talking to 20-30 leading accounts can reveal patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">[00:37:37]</a>.
*   **When**: These conversations should occur before user research, focusing on whether people would buy into the idea, see the value, and understand the ROI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:06">[00:36:06]</a>.
*   **Frequency**: It's advisable to revisit pricing strategy at least every six months and expect to make changes within 12-18 months due to market dynamics or product milestones (new plans, features) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:23">[00:38:23]</a>.

## WTP and [[the_importance_of_segmentation_in_pricing | Segmentation]]

[[the_importance_of_segmentation_in_pricing | Segmentation]] should be based on what customers *need*, *value*, and are *willing to pay for*, not just demographics or personas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:33">[00:40:33]</a>. The key principle for effective segmentation is "you can act differently" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:02">[00:43:02]</a>. This means your product, sales, marketing, and finance teams must be able to adapt their approach for each segment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:17">[00:43:17]</a>.

*   **Productizing to Segments**: Rather than building one product and trying to position it differently, you should productize to specific segments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:46">[00:40:46]</a>. This acknowledges that customer needs are heterogeneous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:04">[00:42:04]</a>.
    *   **Water Example**: Water is free from a fountain, $2 in a bottle, $2.50 with gas, and $5 from a mini-bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:14">[00:41:14]</a>. It's the same water, but it's packaged and productized differently to meet varied needs and WTP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:22">[00:41:22]</a>.
    *   **Apple iPhone Example**: Apple offers iPhones ranging from $299 to $1499, productizing to different segments based on features and WTP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:54">[00:48:54]</a>.
    *   **Eventbrite Example**: Eventbrite moved from a single product to three plans (Essential, Professional, Enterprise) to cater to different customer needs, such as the number of ticket types required for an event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:07">[00:50:07]</a>.
    *   **Uber Example**: Uber's multiple car types (Uber Black, UberX, Uber Pool, Comfort) are an example of productizing to dynamic segments, as a user's needs might change based on the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:14">[00:52:14]</a>.

*   **Early-Stage Segmentation**: Even early-stage founders should understand the different segments based on WTP for their idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:17">[00:45:17]</a>. This helps prioritize which segment to target first and which product to build initially, leading to tailored value messaging and successful launches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:59">[00:45:59]</a>.

## WTP and [[different_pricing_models_and_strategies_for_products | Pricing Models]]

"How you charge" is often more important than "how much you charge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:06">[01:00:06]</a>. The [[different_pricing_models_and_strategies_for_products | pricing model]] or monetization model can drastically alter perceived value and adoption.

*   **Michelin Example**: Michelin, a tire company, changed its model from per-tire sales to per-mile charging for trucks. This was a success because it allowed truckers to expense tire costs as a variable cost and aligned with their use, despite the initial innovation being only 20% longer lasting tires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:02">[01:01:02]</a>.

*   **Segment Example**: B2B SaaS company Segment (pre-Twilio acquisition) shifted their pricing model from API-based to monthly tracked users. This change, aligning with how customers perceived value (more users tracked = more value), resonated better with non-technical personas like marketing teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:45">[01:02:45]</a>.

*   **Usage-Based vs. Subscription Models**: The choice depends on the business situation:
    *   **Subscription makes sense when**: predictable bills are demanded, usage is consistent month-over-month (e.g., Tide Pods), or usage is intermittent but value is ongoing (e.g., LifeLock identity theft protection) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:26">[01:04:26]</a>. It can also simplify the pricing conversation (e.g., Spotify, Netflix) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:23">[01:05:23]</a>.
    *   **Usage-based (Pay-as-You-Go) makes sense when**: low commitment/less friction is desired (e.g., AWS onboarding), customers demand transparency and fairness (not necessarily predictability) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:58">[01:05:58]</a>, usage and value are both intermittent (e.g., movie tickets, flights), or underlying costs scale with usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:27">[01:06:27]</a>. Crucially, there must be clear, trackable metrics that customers agree reflect value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:50">[01:06:50]</a>.
    *   **Hybrid Models**: Combining elements, like HubSpot's fixed monthly fee plus pay-as-you-go for exceeding limits, can be a winning strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:10">[01:07:10]</a>.

*   **Testing Models**: Break-even exercises can test different pricing models. For example, offering equivalent total costs via different structures (e.g., transaction fee vs. flat fee, or seat-based vs. hybrid) reveals customer preference even when the economic outcome is identical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:42">[01:10:42]</a>. The "indifferent" option rarely wins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:22">[01:11:22]</a>.

## WTP and Benefits vs. Features

Product teams often focus too much on features, while customers care about benefits (what the features *do* for them) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:44">[01:12:44]</a>. Signs of this misstep include being overly passionate about every product detail or not seeing market traction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:59">[01:12:59]</a>. Effective communication focuses on value and benefits.

*   **SmugMug Example**: SmugMug, a photo-sharing company, saw double-digit revenue improvement with no product changes just by reframing their pricing page to emphasize benefits (e.g., "ability to sell photos online") rather than listing numerous features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:52">[01:13:52]</a>.
*   **Porsche Taycan Example**: Porsche's messaging for the electric Taycan focused on its core benefit: being "first and foremost a Porsche," which resonates with their audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:50">[01:14:50]</a>.
*   **Shopify Example**: Shopify's plans emphasize benefits like "number of locations you can track inventory," rather than just listing backend features. Their tagline "fair pricing, unfair advantage" further emphasizes value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:07">[01:15:07]</a>.

## WTP and [[behavioral_pricing_and_its_impact_on_consumer_decisions | Behavioral Pricing]]

[[behavioral_pricing_and_its_impact_on_consumer_decisions | Behavioral pricing]] taps into the "irrational modes of our decision making" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:35">[01:16:35]</a>. Understanding psychological biases can significantly impact revenue without changing product features.

*   **Compromise Effect (Good-Better-Best & Decoys)**: People tend to avoid extremes and choose the middle option.
    *   A company with products priced at $49, $79, and $149 found that 60-70% chose the $49 product because too many features were given away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:41">[01:17:41]</a>. By moving prices to $99 and $199 (respecting inelasticity and psychological thresholds) and adding a $299 decoy product, they shifted the mix, leading to a 30%+ increase in MRR/ARPU without product changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:03">[01:18:03]</a>. The $299 product made the $99 option look more attractive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:32">[01:18:32]</a>.
    *   The movie theater popcorn example (small for $7, extra-large for $8) illustrates how the small option acts as a decoy to make the larger, more profitable option seem like a bargain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:20">[01:19:20]</a>.
    *   For product packaging, this means not giving away too much in the entry-level product to encourage upgrades to the middle package <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:01">[01:20:01]</a>.

*   **Pennies-a-Day Effect (Framing)**: How a price is framed impacts perception. $30/month feels different than $1/day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:16">[01:21:16]</a>. Similarly, showcasing an annual subscription's monthly equivalent (e.g., $29.99/month for annual vs. $40/month for monthly) makes it more attractive than just listing the annual total ($360/year) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:57">[01:21:57]</a>.

*   **Razor/Razor Blade Model**: This strategy involves selling the base product cheaply (the "razor") and making profit on the consumables (the "blades") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:34">[01:23:34]</a>. Examples include Gillette razors/blades or HP printers/cartridges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:38">[01:22:38]</a>. For SaaS, this means making a base platform attractive to onboard users, then charging for usage chunks or add-ons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:58">[01:22:58]</a>.

*   **Panini Effect**: People have a compulsion to complete tasks or "fill puzzles" from childhood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:56">[01:23:56]</a>. If a product offers multiple services and displays them as a "puzzle" with empty slots for unpurchased products, it can dramatically increase attachment rates (e.g., 40-50% more products bought) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:51">[01:24:51]</a>. Starbucks' bingo card is a real-world example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:44">[01:25:44]</a>.

## Pricing in a Slowing Economy

In an economic downturn, founders should consider three proactive strategies:

1.  **Lesser Expensive Alternate**: Develop a "de-featured" product version to keep in your back pocket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:02">[01:29:02]</a>. If a customer struggles with price, offer this reduced-value alternative rather than a simple discount. This maintains price integrity and prevents the discounted price from becoming the new standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:30">[01:29:30]</a>.
2.  **Three Non-Pricing Actions**: Instead of dropping prices, consider:
    *   Giving more product or value at the current price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:16">[01:30:16]</a>.
    *   Changing contract terms (e.g., offering a longer contract) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:42">[01:30:42]</a>.
    *   Adjusting payment terms (e.g., extending payment windows) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:55">[01:30:55]</a>.
3.  **Change Business/Pricing Model**: A downturn can be an opportune time to transition to a [[different_pricing_models_and_strategies_for_products | pricing model]] like usage-based or outcome-based pricing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:10">[01:31:10]</a>. If customers are using the product less, they'll be receptive to a usage-based model that lowers their current bills, making it easier to implement for future growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:22">[01:31:22]</a>.

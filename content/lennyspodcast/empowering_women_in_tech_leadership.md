Claire V, a seasoned Chief Product Officer and former founder, discusses the challenges and opportunities for women in tech leadership roles, emphasizing the importance of agency, curiosity, and empowerment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:57">[00:32:57]</a>.

## Current Landscape for Women in Tech

Despite Claire's successful career, she acknowledges that navigating the tech industry as a woman has not been easy, and challenges persist even at senior leadership levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:57">[00:33:57]</a>.

Key statistics highlight the underrepresentation of women:
*   Approximately 13% of founders last year were women, a figure that is declining year-over-year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:31">[00:33:31]</a>.
*   Female-led founded teams received only 2% of venture capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:41">[00:33:41]</a>.
*   Women hold 30% of senior leadership roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:45">[00:33:45]</a>.
*   Women constitute 30% of software engineering teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:48">[00:33:48]</a>.

These numbers demonstrate that women are "not in the room in equal proportions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:52">[00:33:52]</a>.

## Personal Experiences and Persistent Biases

Claire recounts personal struggles, including fighting for her all-girls school to offer computer science at the same level as the all-boys school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:58">[00:34:58]</a>. In the early 2000s, she experienced "nonsense," such as venture capitalists telling her "don't get pregnant" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:09">[00:35:09]</a>. She emphasizes that such incidents "still happen" even at her executive level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:30">[00:35:30]</a>.

A recurring challenge for Claire is being questioned about her technical capabilities, despite her extensive background as a technical co-founder, coder, and leader of multi-hundred-person engineering teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:25">[00:37:25]</a>. She finds it difficult to imagine a male counterpart with her experience receiving the same question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:17">[00:38:17]</a>.

Claire clarifies that her reflections are not rooted in imposter syndrome, given her proven track record as a founder, successful exit, CPO, investor, and board member <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:14">[00:34:14]</a>. Instead, she approaches these challenges with curiosity to understand the structural, cultural, and external factors at play, as well as her own internal contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50">[00:35:50]</a>.

## Strategies for Empowerment and Growth

Claire advises women to adopt an empowered mindset, acknowledging their value and rejecting imposter syndrome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:29">[00:36:29]</a>. She believes the "universe is bendable to your will" and that these gender disparities are "not tractable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:44">[00:36:44]</a>. [[leadership_and_personal_growth_as_a_ceo | Curiosity and empowerment]] have been her path to joy in a sometimes complicated industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>.

She illustrates this philosophy with a personal story: while 34 weeks pregnant, she strategically orchestrated meetings to sell her startup to Optimizely, emphasizing her limited travel window as a negotiation tactic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:51">[00:45:51]</a>. This act of "bending the universe to your will" exemplifies her belief in taking [[leadership_and_personal_growth_as_a_ceo | agency and control]] over one's career and life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:18">[00:46:18]</a>.

## Driving Industry Change

To address the underrepresentation of women in tech, Claire advocates for normalizing their presence in leadership roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:37">[00:40:37]</a>. She encourages providing platforms for diverse voices to share their journeys, demonstrating that leaders can come from various technical and cultural backgrounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:59">[00:40:59]</a>. By seeing more diverse role models, the industry can begin to unlock "very embedded concepts of who is and isn't a technology leader" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:32">[00:41:32]</a>. Claire actively seeks to invest in and raise the voices of female founders and CTOs to drive this change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:18">[00:41:18]</a>.

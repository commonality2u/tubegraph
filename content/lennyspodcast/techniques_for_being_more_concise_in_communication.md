Effective communication is paramount in any leadership role, and especially for product people, as "communication is the job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. One of the key aspects of strong communication is conciseness.

## Understanding Conciseness
Conciseness is often misunderstood as simply being brief. However, being concise is not about the absolute word count, but rather the **economy of words** and the **density of the insight** being shared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>. A 300-word memo can be meandering, while a 1000-word memo can be tight and concise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>. The goal is to explain things clearly and compellingly, anticipating questions to avoid confusion, skepticism, or apathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

### The Problem of Poor Communication
When communication is unclear, it leads to avoidable questions and back-and-forth, causing delays and frustration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. The "blast radius" of a poorly written memo or message, especially in channels with many people, can be much larger than anticipated, wasting everyone's time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:41">[00:25:41]</a>.

## Key Techniques for Conciseness

### 1. Preparation is Paramount
The biggest bottleneck to being concise is often not knowing what your core point is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>. Just as a well-told story is concise because the storyteller knows all the beats, clarity comes from knowing your message inside and out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>.

The consistent solution to being concise is **preparation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>. Even a few minutes of preparation can make a huge difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>. Before a meeting or writing a message:
*   Ground yourself: Why are you in this meeting? What do you want to share and ensure gets across? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a>
*   Decide beforehand if you want to speak and what point you want to make, especially for introverted individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:13">[00:22:13]</a>.

### 2. Reread and Refine
Always reread your own message before sending it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:16">[00:24:16]</a>. This simple act can help you:
*   **Trim unnecessary content:** Ask yourself if there's a tighter, clearer, cleaner way to present the information or ask a question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:04">[00:23:04]</a>.
*   **Identify secondary information:** Move less critical details to a thread or an appendix to keep the main message focused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:29">[00:29:29]</a>.

### 3. Prioritize "Sales then Logistics"
A common mistake is overestimating your audience's buy-in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. Instead of immediately diving into the "how" or logistics, first "sell" the audience on "why" the initiative or action is important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.
*   A "sales note" aims to get people excited and agree to the action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.
*   Concise selling can be done in 1-2 minutes or even a couple of sentences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>.
*   Remind people why you're doing this, why it benefits the business, and what problem it solves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>.
*   Clearly state what you need from the other person upfront <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>.

### 4. Utilize Signposting
[[Communication frameworks for clarity and influence | Signposting]] involves using specific words, phrases, and formatting to guide your reader or listener and signal what's coming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:39">[00:27:39]</a>.
*   **Examples of signposting words:** "for example" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:06">[00:28:06]</a>, "because" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:09">[00:28:09]</a>, "as a next step" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:15">[00:28:15]</a>, "first, second, third" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:22">[00:28:22]</a>.
*   These "power words for clarity" help the audience mentally structure the information and focus their attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:50">[00:28:50]</a>.
*   You can also verbally signpost by saying things like, "The most important part to pay attention to is..." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:11">[00:29:11]</a>.

### 5. Format Sparingly, Write Completely
Avoid excessive formatting, as too much bolding or italics negates their highlighting effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:50">[00:29:50]</a>.
*   Be wary of overusing bullets with sentence fragments, which can make your reader decipher and interpret your meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:17">[00:30:17]</a>.
*   Force yourself to write complete sentences in bullets; if it's hard, it's a "litmus test" that the idea wasn't fully thought out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:52">[00:30:52]</a>. This aligns with the Amazon six-page memo philosophy, where clear prose reveals clarity of thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:41">[00:31:41]</a>.

### 6. Anticipate Objections (MOO Framework)
The **MOO** framework stands for **Most Obvious Objection** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:28">[00:50:28]</a>.
*   Before communicating, spend even two minutes thinking about obvious objections you are likely to get <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:42">[00:50:42]</a>.
*   This preparation allows you to volunteer information upfront or frame your message to preempt concerns, preventing you from being caught off guard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:17">[00:51:17]</a>.
*   Thinking about MOO not only helps you communicate better but also crystallizes your own thinking, revealing potential gaps in your plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:54">[00:52:54]</a>.

### 7. Find the Right Level of Confidence
Speak accurately about your level of conviction and the evidence you have <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:12">[00:43:12]</a>.
*   **Avoid overconfidence:** Don't state hypotheses as facts ("this *is* X" instead of "this *could* X") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:53">[00:42:53]</a>. It's okay for something to be an initial hunch; just state it as such <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:24">[00:43:24]</a>.
*   **Avoid under-confidence:** Don't diminish strong recommendations by saying "you can ignore everything I just said" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:08">[00:44:08]</a>. If you have strong reasons, it's almost irresponsible not to present them with appropriate conviction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:35">[00:44:35]</a>.
*   **Have a point of view (POV):** Present a recommendation and back it up with evidence, logic, principles, or examples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:11">[00:45:11]</a>. This gives others something specific to align with or push back on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:34">[00:45:34]</a>.

### 8. The Question Behind the Question
When asked a question you don't immediately know the answer to, instead of just saying "I'll get back to you," try to uncover the underlying concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:02">[00:56:02]</a>.
*   Offer related information you *do* know, then ask probing questions like "Are you wondering if we are investing in mobile appropriately?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:23">[00:55:23]</a>.
*   This allows the conversation to continue and addresses the actual intent behind the question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>.
*   Reflecting back the question ("Let me just make sure I understand what you're looking for...") can also buy you time to think and ensure alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:55">[00:56:55]</a>.

### 9. CADAF Framework for Delegating
When delegating, this framework helps ensure clear, concise instructions and effective communication:
*   **C - Comprehension:** Ensure the person has everything they need to understand the task and the desired end result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:19">[01:10:19]</a>.
*   **E - Excitement:** Explain the "why" to make the task exciting and connect it to broader goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:45">[01:10:45]</a>. (This links to [[communication_frameworks_for_clarity_and_influence | communication frameworks for clarity and influence]])
*   **D - Derisk:** Anticipate and address obvious risks that could lead to misunderstandings or wasted effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:08">[01:11:08]</a>. (This concept is similar to MOO)
*   **A - Align:** Give the person a chance to ask questions and confirm alignment, revealing any confusion you might have missed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:59">[01:11:59]</a>.
*   **F - Feedback:** Establish the shortest possible feedback loop to catch issues early and ensure progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:42">[01:12:42]</a>.

### 10. [[Techniques for effective feedback and communication | Strategy not self-expression]]
When giving feedback, the goal is **behavior change**, not simply venting frustrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:07">[01:06:07]</a>.
*   Trim everything that doesn't contribute to motivating the person to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:12">[01:06:12]</a>.
*   Focus on explaining the benefit of the change to them and others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:22">[01:06:22]</a>.
*   Get out any personal frustrations beforehand (e.g., talk to a friend or therapist) to ensure you remain calm and focused during the conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:24">[01:07:24]</a>.

## The Cumulative Impact
While these techniques may seem minor, they compound to make a significant difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:29">[00:36:29]</a>. Spending a little more time upfront on communication is an investment that saves tons of time later by preventing unnecessary back-and-forth and confusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:01">[01:10:01]</a>. It shows rigor in thinking and a strategic approach to the business, leading to better outcomes and increased influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:02">[01:02:02]</a>.

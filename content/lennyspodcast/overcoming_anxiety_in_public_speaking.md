[[overcoming_public_speaking_anxiety | Public speaking anxiety]] is a common challenge, but it can be significantly reduced with the right [[strategies_for_public_speaking_and_reducing_stage_fright | techniques]] and [[the_impact_of_confidence_and_mindset_in_public_speaking | mindset]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>. Speaking well is a powerful skill crucial for career advancement, including interviewing, leading meetings, pitching ideas, and leading teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>. The good news is that with some help and practice, anyone can improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.

## Normalizing Anxiety

Many people feel like they are the only ones who experience [[overcoming_public_speaking_anxiety | public speaking anxiety]] because they see others communicating effortlessly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>. However, a lot of work often goes into seemingly effortless communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>. Experts believe that feeling nervous when communicating in front of others is an innate human condition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>. Normalizing this anxiety and realizing you are not alone can help reduce the pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. Improvement is a process, not a switch, and feeling less nervous over time is achievable by applying specific principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>.

## Techniques for Reducing Anxiety

Several [[techniques_for_reducing_presentation_nerves | techniques]] can help calm the body and mind before and during a talk:

### Visualization
[[visualization_techniques_for_public_speaking | Visualization]] is a highly useful technique that desensitizes individuals to the speaking environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. This involves seeing oneself not just in the moment of speaking, but also getting onto the stage, delivering the presentation, seeing it well-received, and stepping off the stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>.

*   **Process**: A good visualization involves deep breathing to calm oneself, either with closed eyes or by looking at a picture of the speaking environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:00">[08:11:00]</a>. Envision yourself in the room with the audience, responding positively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:30:00">[08:30:00]</a>.
*   **Benefits**: It acts as a dress rehearsal, making the actual event feel less new and novel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:54:00">[08:54:00]</a>. Athletes frequently use this technique to help them perform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>. Virtual reality tools can also aid in this desensitization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:00">[09:09:00]</a>.

:::caution Misconception
The popular advice to "picture people in your audience naked" is not good advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:23:00">[06:23:00]</a>. Instead, focus on visualizing a successful, clothed presentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:32:00">[07:32:00]</a>.
:::

### Dare to be Dull
This concept, derived from improvisation, advises striving for "connection over perfection" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>. When speaking, especially spontaneously, people often put immense pressure on themselves to be perfect or interesting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>. This self-evaluation taxes cognitive resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.

*   **Application**: Simply focus on getting the task done â€“ answer the question, give the feedback, or engage in small talk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>. By dialing down self-evaluation, more mental resources are freed up to succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. Paradoxically, this approach often leads to better, more interesting, and insightful communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.

### Reframing Anxiety as Excitement
Physiological arousal (faster heart rate, shaky hands) is similar for both anxiety and excitement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>. The key difference is how this arousal is labeled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>.

*   **Process**: Instead of seeing symptoms of anxiety as negative, reframe them as signs of excitement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>. Tell yourself, "I'm excited to share my point of view" or "I get to demonstrate my value" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.
*   **Benefits**: This [[the_impact_of_confidence_and_mindset_in_public_speaking | cognitive reframing]] causes relaxation and can lead to being perceived as communicating better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>.

### Mantras
Using a simple mantra can help change negative self-talk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>. Negative internal chatter ("I'm not prepared," "I'm an impostor") sets people up to be more nervous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>.

*   **Examples**: "I have value to bring" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>, "You've got this," "I'm prepared," "I know my stuff" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>, or "Last time this went well" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>.
*   **Application**: Write it on a Post-it note or set a phone reminder to flash up a minute or two before speaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. This helps turn off the internal negative self-talk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. Another effective mantra is, "It's not about me, it's about my content" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>.

### Breathing Techniques
Breathing is very helpful in managing anxiety symptoms as it slows heart rate, normalizes voice, and reduces shakiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>.

*   **Double Exhale**: Take a full inhale, then sneak in a little extra air, and then take a long exhale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:40]</a>.
*   **Rule of Lung**: The exhale should be twice as long as the inhale (e.g., three-count inhale, six-count exhale) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>. This is critical for the relaxation response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>.
*   **Benefits**: Physiologically reduces stress, increases focus, and prevents catastrophizing about future events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>.

### Getting Present-Oriented
Anxiety often stems from fear of potential negative future outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. Being in the present moment can counteract this.

*   **Tongue Twisters**: Saying tongue twisters aloud helps to get present-oriented and warms up the voice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>. An example is: "I slit a sheet, I slit a sheet, a sheet I slit. And on that slitted sheet I sit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.
*   **Swearing**: Research suggests that swearing can release neurochemicals that blunt anxiety-associated neurochemicals, like cortisol, and provide a dopamine hit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>.

### Conversation as a Framework
Many people feel more comfortable in conversation than presenting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>.

*   **Approach**: Set up communication situations (presentations, meetings) as conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>. This can even be a conversation with yourself, such as stating, "Today I have three questions I'd like to answer. Question number one is..." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>. This reframes the act from "presenting" to "having a conversation," reducing anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>.
*   **Distraction**: Temporarily shift the audience's attention away from yourself at the beginning of a talk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. This can be done by asking a question, telling a story, showing a video, or asking them to read something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>. The first minute before and after speaking is often the most nervous time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>.

## Strategies for Spontaneous Speaking

Most public speaking is spontaneous, not prepared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>. This includes Q&A, giving toasts, feedback, and small talk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>.

### Preparation for Spontaneity
The ability to speak spontaneously can be improved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>. It's counterintuitive, but one must "prepare to be spontaneous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>. Just as athletes practice to respond effectively in their sport, preparation and practice are vital for spontaneous communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>.

### Mindset and Approach
Improving spontaneous speaking requires addressing both mindset and the actual messaging through structure and focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>.

### Using Structures
Structures provide a logical beginning, middle, and end, acting as a "recipe" for communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>. They tell you *how* to say it, leaving you to focus on *what* to say <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>.

*   **Problem-Solution-Benefit**: Common in advertising, this structure outlines a problem, how a product/service solves it, and the benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>.
*   **PREP (Point, Reason, Example, Point)**: State your point, give a reason, provide an example, and then restate your point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>. This is useful for making a quick point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>.
*   **What-So What-Now What**:
    *   **What**: Your product, service, update, or feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>.
    *   **So What**: Why is it important and relevant to the audience or company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>.
    *   **Now What**: What comes next or what actions are required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>.
    This structure helps package information for digestibility and memorability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>.
*   **ADD (Answer, Detailed Example, Describe the Relevance)**:
    *   **Answer**: Respond to the question cleanly and concisely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>.
    *   **Detailed Example**: Provide an example to reinforce the answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>.
    *   **Describe the Relevance**: Explain the significance of the answer, connecting the dots for the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:00">[04:35:00]</a>.
    This structure is particularly useful for Q&A sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>.
*   **AAA (Acknowledge, Appreciate, Amend)** for Apologies:
    *   **Acknowledge**: State the specific behavior or offense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>.
    *   **Appreciate**: Express appreciation for the difficulty or impact caused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>.
    *   **Amend**: Propose specific actions to remedy the situation or prevent recurrence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>.
    Apologies should take responsibility for the transgression itself, not just how it made someone feel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>.
*   **WHAT (Why, How, Anecdote, Thanks)** for Toasts and Tributes:
    *   **Why**: State the purpose of the gathering (e.g., celebrating a product launch) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>.
    *   **How**: Explain your connection to the event or person being honored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>.
    *   **Anecdote**: Tell a relevant, accessible, and concise story or example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>.
    *   **Thanks**: Express gratitude or provide a concluding cheers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>.
    Toasts should be brief, and emotion can be conveyed through anecdotes rather than directly stated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>.

### Specific Situations

#### Small Talk
Small talk helps form and foster relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>.

*   **Be Interested, Not Interesting**: Instead of trying to be super interesting, focus on setting the other person up for success by asking questions and engaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>.
*   **Balance of Disclosure**: Maintain comparable levels of disclosure over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>. If one person shares deep personal details, the other should reciprocate appropriately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>.
*   **Supporting vs. Shifting Responses**: Aim for more supporting responses (asking follow-up questions to keep the conversation on the other person's topic) than shifting responses (redirecting the conversation to yourself) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>. A balance is needed, as too much supporting without any shifting can make it seem like you don't want to share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>.

#### Giving Feedback
Feedback is an opportunity to problem-solve and requires collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>.

*   **Invite Collaboration**: Avoid "bestowing" your opinion; instead, invite the other person to work with you on the issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:00">[05:14:00]</a>.
*   **Use Structures**: Apply structures like "What-So What-Now What" or the "Four I's" (Information, Impact, Invitation, Implications) to package feedback clearly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>.

#### Q&A Sessions
See Q&A as an opportunity to extend, expand, connect, and learn, even in hostile situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:00]</a>.

*   **Avoid Over-Validation**: Refrain from saying "good question" to every question or "does that make sense?" at the end of every answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:00">[06:38:00]</a>. Instead, ask "Did I answer your question?" or "Do you have a follow-up question?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:00]</a>.
*   **Use the ADD Structure**: This structure (Answer, Detailed Example, Describe the Relevance) is ideal for providing complete and relevant answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:00">[06:26:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>.

## Improving Public Speaking Through Practice

The only way to improve communication, whether spontaneous or planned, is through consistent practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>.

*   **Repetition, Reflection, Feedback**:
    *   **Repetition**: Regularly practice communication situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>.
    *   **Reflection**: Think about what worked and what didn't after each communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>.
    *   **Feedback**: Seek input from others, as self-judgment of communication can be flawed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.
*   **Resources for Practice**:
    *   **Toastmasters**: A non-profit educational organization that provides a supportive environment to practice public speaking and leadership skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:00">[04:35:00]</a>. They have a special focus on [[improving_public_speaking_through_interactive_exercises | on-the-spot speaking]] called "Table Topics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>.
    *   **Improvisation Classes**: Improv training helps people become more comfortable, present, and collaborative in communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>.
    *   **University Extension Programs**: Many universities offer continuing education or extension classes on communication and public speaking that are open to the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a>.
    *   **Applied Learning**: Actively apply concepts by doing "try this" exercises from books, watching demonstrations, or dissecting communication in real-world scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>.

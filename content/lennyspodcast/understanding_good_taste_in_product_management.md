Shas Doshi, in a live recording at the Lennys' Friend Summit, discussed key questions he wished he had asked himself earlier in his career, including the crucial topic of [[developing_good_taste_and_high_standards | developing good taste]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. This question goes beyond just product aesthetics, delving into the core beliefs and evaluation methods of product leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:53">[00:29:53]</a>.

## Do I Actually Have Good Taste?

Shas Doshi poses this as a vital self-reflection question for product leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:53">[00:25:53]</a>. He admits that he initially believed he had good taste in product decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:55">[00:30:55]</a>. However, through personal experience, he realized he lacked [[developing_good_taste_and_high_standards | good taste]] in how he chose to evaluate incoming information, beliefs, and learning sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:42">[00:30:42]</a>.

### The Google and Twitter Revelations

Shas recounts his time at Google where he was told that "strategy is for MBAs" and the focus was solely on execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:36">[00:26:36]</a>. He adopted this mantra, dismissing the need for a [[becoming_more_strategic_in_product_management | product strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:33">[00:27:33]</a>.

This perspective shifted significantly when he moved to Twitter after its IPO around 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:44">[00:27:44]</a>. Despite having incredible assets like its product, network effects, brand, and talent, Twitter was struggling and not meeting its full potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:04">[00:28:04]</a>. It took him six to nine months to realize that Twitter's biggest issue was a [[becoming_more_strategic_in_product_management | product strategy]] problem, lacking a compelling and cohesive strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:30">[00:28:30]</a>. This experience solidified his understanding that his previous dismissal of strategy was incorrect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:05">[00:29:05]</a>.

### Defining Good Taste

Shas defines taste not merely as an appreciation for "beautiful pixels" or "perfect products," but as:

> "Taste is about the ability to identify what is really good without needing to see its results" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:41">[00:31:41]</a>

He contrasts this with the "zero taste" required to acknowledge someone's genius (e.g., Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang) after their success is evident from stock prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:09">[00:32:09]</a>. True taste means recognizing potential before it becomes widely apparent, like recognizing "game" in a practice session before the actual game is called <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:05">[00:33:05]</a>. He also notes that being a "stuff grader" who dislikes everything requires "zero taste" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:38">[00:33:38]</a>.

### Obstacles to Developing Good Taste

Shas highlights several common pitfalls that prevent product leaders from exercising true taste:

*   **Excitement about cool metaphors**: Concepts like "two-way doors" are embraced due to their catchy nature, even when the underlying idea (reversible/irreversible decisions) is less popular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:06">[00:34:06]</a>.
*   **Authority bias**: Ideas are accepted simply because a respected figure (e.g., Bezos) stated them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:53">[00:34:53]</a>.
*   **Impressions from alliterations**: Phrases like "fail fast" gain traction due to their alliterative quality, even if "fail quickly" conveys the same meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:01">[00:35:01]</a>.
*   **Impression by complicated charts and math**: Being swayed by complex visuals or equations that are not fully understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:05">[00:36:05]</a>.

### The Path to Better Taste

Recognizing his own lack of [[developing_good_taste_and_high_standards | good taste]], Shas embarked on a journey to improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:18">[00:31:18]</a>. This involved shedding ingrained patterns and evaluating ideas independently of social or authority proofs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:46">[00:36:46]</a>. The outcome was becoming a more [[key_skills_for_product_managers | critical thinker]], moving beyond the common belief that one is already a critical thinker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:24">[00:37:24]</a>.

By cultivating genuine [[developing_good_taste_and_high_standards | good taste]], product leaders can make better decisions, prioritize effectively, and ultimately achieve greater [[impact_in_product_management | impact]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>.

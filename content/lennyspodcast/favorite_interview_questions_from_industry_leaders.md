This article compiles favorite interview questions from over 100 podcast guests, aiming to help candidates prepare for interviews, or help interviewers improve their [[interviewing_techniques_for_product_management | existing interview questions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Top Interview Questions

### Akaash Demanana (Head of Product at Roll, former PM at Stripe)
*   **Question:** "To what do you attribute your success and you can't say luck?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>
*   **Purpose:** To gauge a candidate's self-awareness and curiosity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. Humble individuals often credit luck, so removing that option reveals deeper reflection on their journey and worldview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

### Jeff Charles (Head of Product at Ramp)
*   **Question:** "What's the hardest thing you've ever done?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>
*   **Purpose:** To understand a candidate's definition of "hard," how they overcame difficulty, how they collaborated with others, and their level of agency in overcoming challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. This helps assess their work ethic and resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

### Shashir Maroocha (CEO and Co-founder of Coda)
*   **Question:** "A group of scientists have invented a teleportation device. They've hired you to be their business counterpart to bring this to market. What do you do?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>
    *   **Follow-up Constraint:** "They will answer only two of your questions, and after that, they expect a plan. What two questions do you ask?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>
*   **Purpose:** This [[interview_techniques_for_uncovering_customer_needs | coded question test]] assesses a candidate's ability to identify the most impactful ("IR") questions to drive a market strategy, even with limited information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. There is no single "right" answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.
    *   **Example of excellent questions:** A product manager asked: "Is it safe enough for humans or not?" and "Is it more expensive capex or Opex?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. These questions allow for distinct market strategies based on the answers (e.g., human fax machines, replacing airports, or transporting goods) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.
*   **Insight:** The question's low-stakes, imaginary nature increases a candidate's ability to learn the method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. Kids often excel at simplifying and identifying core questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. The ability to find IR questions applies to almost any product or situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

### Yuki Yamashita (Chief Product Officer at Figma, former Head of Design at Uber)
*   **Question 1:** "Describe to me a time when you're part of a controversial product decision." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>
*   **Purpose:** To see if candidates can articulate conflict, represent different perspectives in an "even-keeled" way, and demonstrate the ability to understand why conflicts existed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.
*   **Question 2:** "Talk about kind of like a big problem that you worked on." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>
*   **Purpose:** The interviewer wants to feel compelled to work on that problem after the candidate describes it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. This tests a product manager's ability to "cast something" as existential and interesting, and rally others through strong storytelling and communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.

### Katie Dill (Head of Design at Stripe), Henri Sarani (CEO of [[unique_hiring_practices_and_company_culture_at_linear | Linear]]), and Camille Hurst (Product Leader at Spotify, former Product Leader at Patreon)
*   **Question:** "Tell me what work you are most proud of." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a> (or "What is the candidate most proud of and why?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>, and "Tell me about something they're really proud of that they accomplished and take me through the process and tell talk to me about why they're proud of it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>)
*   **Purpose:** This question reveals a candidate's taste, judgment, motivations, what they value, what they consider a "good outcome," and what "good" looks like to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. It's also an opportunity for candidates to share positive accomplishments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>.

### Jeannie Z (Head of Product at Webflow, former Airbnb colleague)
*   **Question:** Behavioral questions focusing on challenging or ambiguous situations. Specifically, "how do they navigate ambiguity?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>
*   **Purpose:** The PM role is inherently ambiguous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. Good answers show candidates who can structure a path forward through ambiguity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>, seek inputs and help from others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>, and set up milestones to evaluate if their charted path is working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>.

### Noah Weiss (Chief Product Officer at Slack)
*   **Question:** "What unfair secrets have you learned to improve the velocity and energy level of a product or team?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a> (meaning something not commonly found in articles or conventional wisdom) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>
*   **Purpose:** To discover unique insights, how candidates learned them, and how they apply them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. It also provides interesting inspiration for the interviewer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>.

### Ben Williams (Former VP Product at Snyk, now an advisor to product-led growth startups)
*   **Question 1:** "Fast forward three years, what's different about you then?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>
*   **Purpose:** To identify signals of humility and self-awareness regarding personal and professional growth areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>. Candidates who can openly discuss areas they need to work on are preferred over those who focus solely on role or title aspirations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.
*   **General Observation:** Looks for curiosity throughout the interview, as good Product Managers constantly ask "why" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>.
*   **Question to Ask the Interviewer (from a candidate he interviewed):** "Tell me about the diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging initiatives that you've recently personally been involved with." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>
*   **Purpose:** This question is brilliant for candidates to test alignment between their personal values and the company's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>.

### Melum Quan Barwitz (Head of Growth and early employee at Deel)
*   **Question:** "What would your siblings say about you?" (If no siblings, "What will your parents say about you?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>
*   **Purpose:** To assess sincerity and self-awareness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>. A truthful, humble answer that acknowledges imperfections (e.g., "they'll say these weird things about me") is preferred over a perfectly curated, overly positive response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>.

### Paige Costelo (Co-Head of Product Management and Head of AI at Asana)
*   **Question:** "Tell me about a time something went wrong. What was it? What did you do about it?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a> (e.g., product failed, team issue) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>
*   **Purpose:** This question reveals a lot about a person's mindset, how they perceive themselves, and how they evaluate situations when things aren't working well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>.

### Niral Singal (VP of Product at Facebook)
*   **Question:** "What's something that everyone takes for granted that you think is essentially hogwash or inaccurate?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>
    *   **Variations:** For managers, "What's conventional wisdom that you bet against that you have found is actually inaccurate?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a> or "What do people think about AI that's inaccurate that everyone believes?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>
*   **Purpose:** To break the typical [[techniques_for_preparing_for_interviews | interview mindset]] where candidates try to predict what the interviewer wants to hear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>. This question forces candidates to be genuinely opinionated and authentic, allowing high-quality individuals to shine even if their prepared answers might have led to dismissal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>.

### Io Omalo (Chief Product Officer at Carbon Health, former Product Lead at Square, former founder)
*   **Question:** "Tell me something you did that worked out but not for the reason that you thought it would work," or "Tell me something you did that was a good decision that didn't work." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:59">[00:17:59]</a>
*   **Purpose:** To tease out introspection and determine if a candidate is reflective about their decisions, understands why they succeeded or failed, and incorporates those learnings into their future approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>.

### Scott Belsky (Chief Strategy Officer at Adobe, former Chief Product Officer at Adobe, former founder of Behance)
*   **Question 1:** Asks about something people have learned about themselves that reveals a limitation in how they work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>.
*   **Purpose:** To test introspection and see if candidates can be open about hitting their limits or struggling, rather than blaming others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>.
*   **Question 2:** "Do you consider yourself lucky?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>
*   **Purpose:** To assess humility and self-awareness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>. Those comfortable and secure will admit to being lucky and privileged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>, unlike insecure individuals who might avoid admitting luck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>.

### Lauren Israel (Head of Growth at Notion, former Head of Growth at AirTable)
*   **Question:** "Tell me about a time that you delivered something that was impactful." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:23">[00:19:23]</a>
*   **Purpose:** To understand how candidates define "impact" and what it means to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>. For growth practitioners, a good answer demonstrates intrinsic motivation to positively impact the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>.

### Paul Adams (Chief Product Officer at Intercom) - Advice for Reference Calls
*   **Question for References:** "What feedback will I be giving this person in their first performance review?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>
*   **Purpose:** This question is designed to elicit honest and insightful feedback from references, as it's difficult to dodge and provides incredibly useful insights into a candidate's areas for growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:15">[00:20:15]</a>. This is part of the final stage of the hiring process after finding a great candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:49">[00:19:49]</a>.

From: [[lennyspodcast]] <br/> 
Mike Maples Jr., a renowned early-stage startup investor and founder of Floodgate, has dedicated significant time to researching the origins of great startup ideas and what differentiates startups and founders who achieve breakthroughs from those that don't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:55">[01:23:55]</a>. After reviewing thousands of startups over two decades, he uncovered three core elements of most breakthrough startup ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:42">[01:41:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These elements are key to understanding how a startup can wage asymmetric warfare on the present and propose a radically different future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

Business is rarely a fair fight, with incumbents holding an inherent advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:55">[01:13:55]</a>. Startups don't win by executing better, but by proposing a radically different future that disorients incumbents and moves people chaotically towards that new future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:52">[00:30:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:31">[00:31:31]</a>. This approach aims for a "pattern breaking" idea that cannot be compared to anything before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:04">[01:16:04]</a>.

### Three Elements of Breakthrough Startup Ideas
Mike Maples Jr. identifies three core elements that tend to suggest breakthrough potential for a startup idea:
1.  **Inflections** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:05">[01:23:05]</a>
2.  **Insights** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:05">[01:23:05]</a>
3.  **Founder Future Fit** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:05">[01:23:05]</a>

These elements represent underlying forces that give an idea the power to escape the gravitational pull of the present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:50">[01:24:50]</a>.

#### 1. Inflections
An inflection is an external event that creates the potential for radical change in how people think, feel, and act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:34">[01:31:34]</a>. It is a turning point where something new is introduced, enabling new empowerment for the first time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:02">[01:32:02]</a>.

*   **Definition**: An external event that creates the potential for radical change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:34">[01:31:34]</a>. It's a turning point where the slope changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:02">[01:32:02]</a>.
*   **Examples**:
    *   The iPhone 4S shipping with a GPS locator chip enabled ride-sharing companies like Lyft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>. Without precise location, ride-sharing wouldn't have been viable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>.
    *   Improved smartphone cameras, increased smartphone adoption, widespread Wi-Fi, and faster network upload speeds converged to enable Instagram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:17">[01:17:17]</a>.
    *   Legal and regulatory changes during the pandemic, like allowing telemedicine visits across state lines and enabling reimbursement, acted as an inflection, empowering patients and doctors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>. This was a regulatory, not technological, change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.
    *   Changes in social beliefs and patterns of behavior can also be inflections, such as the public's increased acceptance of telemedicine after COVID-19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.
    *   The proliferation of customer reviews online and people's trust in them, combined with Facebook Connect for profile sharing, were inflections for Airbnb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>. The Great Financial Crisis also acted as an inflection, compelling people to generate income from their homes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.
*   **Stress Testing Inflections**: When evaluating an idea, ask:
    1.  What is the specific new thing that was just introduced? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>
    2.  How does it empower specific people in specific ways? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>
    3.  Under what conditions might that empowerment be realized, and under what conditions might it not be? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>

Inflections are "all around us all the time," but most people tend to follow established patterns and miss them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>.

#### 2. Insights
Unlike inflections, insights originate from the founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>. An insight is a "non-obvious truth" about how one or more inflections can be leveraged to change people's behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>.

*   **Definition**: A non-obvious truth about how inflections can be harnessed to change behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>.
*   **Non-Consensus and Right**: For an idea to be breakthrough, it must be non-consensus but right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>. If an idea is consensus, it's likely not radical enough and too similar to incumbents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>. The best ideas often receive initial disinterest or hostility, but resonate deeply with a small subset of people who "fall irrationally in love" with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>.
*   **Backcasting**: Breakthrough founders backcast, assuming the future must be radically different to achieve significant success. They identify such futures and work backward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>.
*   **The Power of Surprises**: Breakthroughs cannot be generated by a recipe; they are discovered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. Founders should actively "savor surprises" and construct experiments designed to yield unexpected learnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. If an experiment only validates a hypothesis, no new knowledge is gained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>.
    *   *Example: Chegg's Textbook Rentals* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>: Founders tested arbitrary rental prices (up to $75 for a $100 textbook) beyond their initial hypothesis ($35), discovering students were willing to pay significantly more. This surprise informed their pricing model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>.
*   **The Earned Secret**: Breakthroughs come from "earned secrets" â€“ insights gained by getting one's hands dirty, exploring new technologies at the cutting edge, and being exceptionally awake to possibilities that most people overlook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>. These founders are often obsessed with their subject, constantly thinking about it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>.
*   **Pivots**: Many of Mike Maples Jr.'s most successful investments (80% of exit profits) came from pivots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>. This highlights that if the underlying insight is correct, a startup can navigate through initial incorrect implementations to achieve product-market fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>. For instance, Octa initially focused on cloud systems management, but pivoted to identity management after discovering it was customers' top priority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>.

#### 3. Founder Future Fit
Founder future fit refers to the unique [[attributes_of_successful_startup_founders | attributes of successful startup founders]] that make them ideally suited to a specific future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>.

*   **Definition**: A set of traits that makes a founder ideally suited to a certain type of future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>.
*   **Diverse Profiles**: There isn't one "canonical best founder." They can be young, first-time founders (like Mark Andreessen with Netscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>), or experienced industry veterans (like the Applied Intuition founders who grew up in Detroit, worked at car companies, and then at Google's Waymo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>).
*   **Knowledge of the Future**:
    *   Young, first-time founders often have a "beginner's mind," unencumbered by old ways of thinking, which is valuable when operating at the cutting edge of new technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>.
    *   Experienced founders (e.g., Octa's Todd McKinnon from Salesforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>) possess deep industry knowledge, networks, and credibility necessary for selling to large enterprise customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>.
*   **Living in the Future**: Rather than trying to "think of startup ideas," founders should "live in the future" and notice what's missing there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>. Their intuition about what to build is more likely to be right because they are experiencing the emerging reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>.
    *   *Example: Mdty Hall (Living Carbon)* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>: She worked as Chief of Staff to Sam Altman, who frequently "visits the future" by interacting with cutting-edge projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>. This exposure led her to identify the opportunity for genetically modified trees for carbon capture, marrying technological advancements with market needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>.
*   **Lighthouse Customers**: Founders can also build for "lighthouse customers" â€“ early adopters living in the future, whose current needs will become widespread in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>. Solving their problems can lead the startup to the "promised land" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>.

### Pattern-Breaking Actions for Breakthrough Startups
Beyond the idea itself, breakthrough companies engage in specific [[challenges_and_strategies_in_startup_growth | strategies in startup growth]] and [[strategies_for_effective_marketing_in_a_tech_startup | marketing]]. These are the "pattern breaking actions" that allow them to move people to a radically different future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>.

#### 1. Create Movements
A movement is a distinct approach to market development that leverages the grievance of a minority against the tyranny of a majority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>. It's about convincing early believers to commit emotionally to a different future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>.

*   **Belief-Driven Adoption**: Early customers, employees, and investors are not motivated by pragmatism, but by belief in the founder's vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>.
*   **Crystallizing Choice**: A movement creates a stark dichotomy between "the world that is" and "the world that could be," fostering an irresistible desire to move to the new future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>.
*   **Turning Weakness into Strength**: Great [[creating_movements_in_startups | movements in startups]] turn the incumbent's greatest strength into its biggest weakness. For example, Airbnb didn't criticize hotels directly but offered the experience of "living like a local," implying that hotels' standardized experiences were a limitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>.
*   **Higher Purpose**: Breakthrough startups appeal to a higher purpose rather than merely claiming to be "better" than competitors. Tesla's mission, "accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy," positions it beyond just being a car company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>.

#### 2. Master Storytelling
Storytelling is a crucial element for pattern-breaking founders to persuade others to change their habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>. It involves drawing attention to the stark contrast between the current reality and the proposed future.

*   **The Hero's Journey**: Founders can apply the "hero's journey" narrative structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>:
    1.  **The World That Is**: Describe the current undesirable state (e.g., taxis suck) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>.
    2.  **Call to Adventure**: Introduce the new product or idea (e.g., Lyft's ride-sharing app) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>.
    3.  **Resist the Call**: Acknowledge the natural resistance or fear of the new (e.g., "It's scary to get in a stranger's car") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>.
    4.  **Mentor and Magic**: The founder acts as the mentor, offering a "magic" tool or insight (e.g., Lyft's pink mustache, which made the service less scary and more recognizable) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>.
    5.  **Co-conspirators**: Early believers join the journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>.
    6.  **Emerge Transformed**: The user (hero) is transformed by adopting the new solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>.
*   **Language and Metaphor**: Effective storytelling uses powerful metaphors and language, such as Twitter's "tweeting birds" rather than "micro blogs Inc." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.
*   **Founder as Obi-Wan, Not Luke**: The founder's role is to be the mentor (Obi-Wan Kenobi), not the hero (Luke Skywalker). The early believers are the heroes, and the founder's job is to tell a story that motivates them to move to the different future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>. The story must be tailored to the audience (employees, investors, customers), as each has a different idea of their "hero's journey" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>.

#### 3. Embrace Disagreeableness
[[overcoming_startup_failures_and_challenges | Overcoming startup failures and challenges]] and achieving breakthroughs often requires a willingness to be disagreeable and challenge the status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>.

*   **Fundamental Disagreement**: A startup is a fundamentally disagreeable act, representing a disagreement with how things are done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. Founders must be willing to pursue something they are obsessed with, even if others think they are crazy, and prioritize the mission over fitting in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>.
*   **Not Always Coachable**: Truly breakthrough founders may not always be "coachable" in the conventional sense; they listen, but ultimately follow their own belief in a different truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>.
*   **Courage to Be Disliked**: Founders must have the courage to be disliked, especially in the early stages when their idea is unconventional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>. Even after success, they may face criticism for "breaking the rules" or being "too powerful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.

### Advice for Ideas within Large Companies
Many of these principles can be applied within larger organizations to foster [[challenges_and_misconceptions_of_startup_success | startup success]] and breakthrough ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>.

*   **Separate Value Delivery Systems**: Breakthrough ideas within a company often need a completely different value delivery system than the core business. They should be treated as separate entities, not forced to become a large part of the business too quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>.
*   **Maintain Discretion**: It's crucial to make internal pattern-breaking projects less visible in their early stages to avoid them being pulled back into the corporate "tractor beam" of existing patterns and processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>. Examples include Apple's iPhone development, Amazon's AWS, and Lockheed's Skunk Works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.
*   **Willingness to Fail**: Companies should allocate a portion of their profits (e.g., 10%) to projects that are likely to fail but have wildly asymmetric upside if they succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>. This willingness to fail enables breakthrough success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>.

### General Advice for Founders
*   **Get Out of the Present**: Actively seek out the future, as it's already here but "just not evenly distributed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>. Your opinion about the future is only valid if you are living in it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>.
*   **Force a Choice, Not a Comparison**: Don't try to be a "10 times better Apple"; aim to be the "world's first banana" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>. Offer something so different that customers are either desperately drawn to it or completely disinterested, leaving no neutrality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>.
*   **Embrace the Loneliness**: It's okay if most people don't like your idea initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. The journey of a breakthrough founder is often lonely, but it doesn't mean your vision is wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>.
*   **Do Your Best**: Strive to "do your best" in every endeavor, honoring your unique abilities and purpose. This focus on personal excellence, rather than comparison to others, enables true competitive advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>.

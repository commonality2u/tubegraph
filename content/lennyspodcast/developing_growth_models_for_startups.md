Developing a growth model is crucial for understanding how a startup business grows and making informed decisions. It serves as an analytical representation of how the business comes together and functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. While often built in a spreadsheet, its primary value comes from forcing a deep understanding of the business mechanics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>, rather than merely being a forecasting tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

## What is a Growth Model?
A growth model is essentially a formula for your business, often residing in Excel, that summarizes and integrates all the factors driving its growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. It's a conceptual understanding of how the entire business fits together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

## Why Develop a Growth Model?
The main advice when dealing with a marketplace is to tread lightly, especially when adjusting core incentives or mechanisms, as changes can have unpredictable, long-term effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:32">[00:41:32]</a>. This emphasizes the need for understanding provided by a growth model.

Key benefits of a growth model include:
*   **Better Decision Making** It helps teams make more informed choices by diving deep into various business topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.
*   **Forced Understanding** The process of building the model itself forces a clear understanding of how the business works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. Approximately 50% of the value derived from a growth model comes from the act of building it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.
*   **Opportunity Assessment** It provides an artifact to weigh different opportunities and understand the potential benefits of focusing on various aspects of the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.
*   **Not a Forecasting Tool** Importantly, it is not a replacement for financial forecasts but serves as a tool for opportunity assessment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

## Building a Growth Model
The process of building a growth model typically starts with basic building blocks and can be expanded for complexity. Dan Hockenmeyer has built 20-30 such models for various companies through his consulting firm, Basis One <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>.

### Core Components
For a relatively simple [[growth_hacking_and_strategies | SaaS business]], there are three fundamental components:
1.  **Acquisition Channels**: Understanding how customers are acquired, whether through paid marketing, sales, or viral referrals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. This includes assumptions about traffic, spend, and conversion rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.
2.  **Retention**: The rate at which customers activate and their monthly retention curve, indicating how long they stay and their survival rate over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:08:00]</a>.
3.  **Monetization**: How customers pay for the service, such as a monthly or annual fee, which translates into revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:12]</a>.

### Adding Complexity
*   **Transactional Businesses**: For businesses with transactions, additional layers are needed. This includes how retained customers transact (e.g., transactions per month, average order value) and unit economics, given typically higher costs like Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:38]</a>.
*   **Marketplace Businesses**: These are the most complex. In addition to demand-side modeling, a marketplace growth model requires incorporating supply acquisition and retention, and understanding the interaction between supply and demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:52]</a>.

### Non-Linear Relationships
Growth models become particularly interesting when incorporating non-linear elements:
*   **Virality**: Existing customers referring new ones, which in turn refer more, creating a compounding effect on growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:15]</a>.
*   **Reinvesting Contribution Margin**: Using contribution margin generated from paid marketing to acquire more customers, which highlights the importance of payback period over LTV to CAC for understanding growth speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:39]</a>.

### Pitfalls and Best Practices
*   **Stacking Assumptions**: Growth models can break down if too many assumptions are stacked, especially in marketplaces where interactions (e.g., between supply and demand) are hard to understand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:45]</a>.
*   **Junk In, Junk Out**: Be careful to avoid this problem, particularly with marketplaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:21]</a>.
*   **Conceptual vs. Mini Models**: It's often better to have one very basic, high-level conceptual model describing the whole system, complemented by mini-models for each product pod or go-to-market team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:46]</a>. These mini-models help teams understand the specific inputs and levers driving their North Star metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:13:06]</a>.

To get started, it's advised to partner with a smart analyst or finance person and begin building the model, iterating on it over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:23]</a>. For deeper learning, Reforge is a highly recommended resource <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:45]</a>.

## Applying Growth Models in Startups
Once a growth model is developed, it becomes a very helpful input into quarterly or annual planning processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:18:00]</a>.

### Resource Allocation and Prioritization
*   **Common Currency**: It provides a "common currency" to compare and trade off efforts between different teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:27]</a>. For example, an analyst can run scenarios through the model to translate different teams' metric movements into a comparable impact on short or long-term growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:52]</a>. This enables much better allocation decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:55]</a>.
*   **Team-Specific Levers**: Individual product teams can use their mini-models to assess which levers to pull to achieve their North Star goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:06]</a>. This ensures that their strategy explicitly articulates what actually moves their metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:17]</a>.

### Lessons Learned from Growth Models
*   **Sensitivity to Retention**: A key insight from building growth models is that business growth is exceptionally sensitive to customer retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:07]</a>. Even small percentage gains in retention can be far more valuable than larger changes in other areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:29]</a>, often leading to a misallocation of product and growth resources if not understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:34]</a>.
*   **Focus on Early User Experience**: Retention is a culmination of the entire product experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:06">[00:21:07]</a>. To improve retention, focus on core product levers and a deep understanding of the customer journey, rather than just sending more emails or push notifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:19">[00:21:37]</a>. The biggest wins in retention often come from inflecting the early user experience, especially within the first week or month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:22:20]</a>.
*   **Avoid Correlational Fallacies**: It's a common analytical failure to assume that if "best users do X," then making other users do X will drive future retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:44">[00:23:53]</a>. This rarely works, as there's usually something unique about those customers or their experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">[00:23:56]</a>.
*   **Prioritize New Users over Resurrection**: While it's tempting to try and resurrect churned users, it's often more challenging because they've already decided they don't want the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:46">[00:24:51]</a>. Focusing on new users and optimizing their initial funnel experience typically yields much higher leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:53">[00:25:01]</a>.

An example from Thumbtack demonstrated that understanding the repeat rate of new customers was critical. Optimizing cross-selling and overall customer LTV by shifting resources from top-of-funnel acquisition to deeper in the stack led to a much better customer journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:20:35]</a>.

## Connecting to Marketplace [[growth_frameworks_and_strategies | Growth Strategies]]
Marketplaces are inherently complex due to their two-sided nature, but growth models help make sense of them. Dan has focused on [[challenges_and_strategies_for_creating_successful_startups | growth-stage marketplaces]] throughout his career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:07]</a>.

### Marketplace Health Metrics
Beyond general business health metrics like GMV (Gross Merchandise Value) and unit economics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:45">[00:29:16]</a>, key health metrics for marketplaces include:
*   **Liquidity**: How reliable is the marketplace for both consumers and suppliers? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:38]</a> This can be expressed in terms of customer-valued metrics like wait time (for Uber/Lyft) or conversion/search-to-fill rates (for e-commerce) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:44">[00:30:15]</a>. Achieving liquidity is paramount; nothing else matters until it's established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:16">[00:30:25]</a>.
*   **Share of Wallet**: For buyers, this is the percentage of their total spend captured by your marketplace versus alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:43">[00:30:50]</a>. For sellers, it's the percentage of their business done through your platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:50">[00:30:54]</a>. High share of wallet indicates a deeper customer relationship, better future retention, and greater defensibility, and often reduces multi-tenanting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:12">[00:31:29]</a>. Prioritizing depth over breadth is often preferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:56]</a>.

### Supply vs. Demand Focus
While both supply and demand are crucial, demand is ultimately the most important factor in a marketplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:41">[00:34:43]</a>. If a marketplace successfully aggregates demand, suppliers will always be willing to participate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:44">[00:35:01]</a>. Supply is critical early on as it *is* the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:16">[00:34:22]</a>, but supply acquisition should always be framed by its impact on demand and customer benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:11">[00:36:15]</a>.

Instead of focusing on simple balance metrics, build dual-sided ROI equations that fully internalize the marketplace dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:51">[00:37:28]</a>. This means including the CAC for both the customer and the proportional supply needed for that customer's transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:57">[00:38:29]</a>.

### Expanding Marketplaces
When expanding, focus less on the total addressable market (TAM) of adjacent opportunities and more on **adjacency** (how easily the current model can extend) and **network effects** (can the same supplier or consumer be leveraged for multiple offerings?) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:37">[00:44:25]</a>.

It's critical not to let "go-to-market" efforts get too far ahead of product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:54">[00:45:57]</a>. The priority should be delivering an incredible end-to-end customer experience, even for a smaller number of customers, to create the "flame" that drives retention and word-of-mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:37">[00:45:49]</a>.

### Marketplace to SaaS vs. SaaS to Marketplace
It's generally easier for a marketplace to add a [[growth_hacking_and_strategies | SaaS]] component than the other way around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:18">[00:47:22]</a>. Marketplaces generate demand (a higher value activity) and already have relationships with both sides, which SaaS businesses lack on the demand side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:25">[00:47:57]</a>. For marketplaces looking to add SaaS, the focus should be on solving significant customer pain points and creating a much better, stickier experience, rather than just increasing monetization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:22">[00:48:55]</a>. Only consider expansion once core marketplace metrics (liquidity, performance) are strong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:13">[00:49:26]</a>.

### Horizontal vs. Vertical Marketplaces
While there are successful examples of "unbundling" (e.g., StockX from eBay for sneakers due to trust issues with inventory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:20">[00:50:35]</a>), the idea of unbundling is often overhyped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:37">[00:50:39]</a>. The common logical error is over-focusing on user experience improvements while underestimating the economic benefits of scale and network effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:56">[00:51:07]</a>.

A vertical marketplace is most likely to succeed if the sub-segment is:
*   **High Frequency or High Dollar Value**: Leading to a high Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:02">[00:52:07]</a>.
*   **Self-Contained Network**: Where the users don't significantly benefit from being part of a broader network (e.g., blue-collar workers on a specialized platform versus an investment banker on LinkedIn) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:26">[00:52:58]</a>.

### Future of Marketplaces
Newer marketplaces are charging higher commissions by doing more work to justify them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:05">[00:59:11]</a>. This evolution moves from:
1.  **Marketplace 1.0 (Lead Gen)**: Primarily aggregating demand (e.g., Zillow, HomeAdvisor) with low commissions (5-10%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:13">[00:59:25]</a>.
2.  **Managed Marketplaces**: Generating trust and vetting supply (e.g., Airbnb, Etsy), charging higher commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:25">[00:59:47]</a>.
3.  **Heavily Managed Marketplaces**: Taking over parts of the value chain (e.g., DoorDash owning logistics, Fair underwriting transactions), leading to even higher commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:48">[01:00:24]</a>.

The ultimate end of this continuum is a business charging 100% commission, effectively ceasing to be a marketplace and becoming an e-commerce business (e.g., Opendoor) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:28">[01:00:58]</a>. The deciding factor for whether a marketplace will consolidate or remain a marketplace is the **amount of creativity required from suppliers** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:03">[01:01:12]</a>.
*   If customers want commoditized experiences (e.g., ride-sharing), the market will likely consolidate and evolve away from a marketplace model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:19">[01:01:39]</a>.
*   If customers value suppliers bringing amazing, creative new things (e.g., Etsy, Amazon, Fair, Steam), the businesses tend to remain in marketplace mode longer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:47">[01:02:00]</a>.
*   A marketplace essentially stops being a marketplace when it owns the supply, eliminating the direct transaction between supply and demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:25">[01:02:54]</a>.

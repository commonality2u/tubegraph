Effective user activation and onboarding are crucial for a product's success and sustainable growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:02">[00:46:02]</a>. Focusing on these early user experiences is often more impactful for retention than tactical fixes later on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:02">[01:40:02]</a>.

## The Sean Ellis Test as a Leading Indicator

The [[The importance of design and user experience in building software | Sean Ellis Test]] is a simple question designed to help determine if a product has product-market fit, serving as a leading indicator before long-term retention data is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:51">[01:11:51]</a>.

The question is: "How would you feel if you could no longer use this product?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. Users are given choices:
*   Very disappointed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>
*   Somewhat disappointed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>
*   Not disappointed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>
*   Not applicable (already stopped using) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>

A common threshold for indicating strong product-market fit is when 40% or more of users say they'd be "very disappointed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. This percentage emerged from observing patterns across many startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. While 40% is a guideline, the real power is having a target for the team before aggressively growing the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:56">[01:07:56]</a>.

### When to Administer the Test
The test is best administered to a random sample of users who have:
*   Used the product multiple times (at least twice) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:56">[02:28:56]</a>
*   Hit an activation moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:56">[02:28:56]</a>
*   Used the product recently (within the last week or two) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:56">[02:28:56]</a>
*   Not yet churned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:56">[02:28:56]</a>

A sample size of at least 30 responses is generally recommended for reliable data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>.

### Limitations and Nuances
*   **One-off products**: The test may not be suitable for products used only once, like a movie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:21">[02:13:21]</a>.
*   **Cultural differences**: Some cultures may be more optimistic or pessimistic in their responses, potentially warranting adjustment of the percentage threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:28">[02:27:28]</a>.
*   **Investment/Switching Costs**: A high score can sometimes reflect significant user investment in the platform rather than just pure utility (e.g., Webs.com, Eventbrite) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:48">[02:08:48]</a>. The product still needs to be valuable and unique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:13">[02:45:13]</a>.
*   **Small Niche**: A high percentage of "very disappointed" users doesn't guarantee a massive market opportunity, but it does indicate deep relevance, which can be a strong foundation for long-term success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:09">[03:10:09]</a>.

## Strategies for Improving User Activation and Onboarding

### 1. Deeply Understand Your "Must-Have" Users
The primary use of the Sean Ellis Test is to identify and [[Developing user empathy and gathering insights for product development | understand]] the users who would be "very disappointed" without the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:10">[01:29:10]</a>.
*   **Identify Benefits**: Ask "What is the primary benefit that you get?" from these users. Start with an open-ended question to gather insights, then refine into a multiple-choice question for subsequent surveys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:13">[01:15:13]</a>.
*   **Understand Context**: Follow up by asking "Why is that benefit important to you?" to uncover the underlying problems users are solving (e.g., "drowning in email" for Zine) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:37">[01:15:37]</a>. This context helps in crafting effective messaging and [[Building credibility and customer engagement | acquisition]] strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:18">[01:16:18]</a>.
*   **Ignore "Somewhat Disappointed" for Core Product**: Traditionally, feedback from users who are "somewhat disappointed" should be largely ignored for core product and onboarding changes to avoid diluting the product for "must-have" users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:31">[02:59:31]</a>.
*   **Superhuman's Refinement**: Superhuman found a way to leverage "somewhat disappointed" users by asking what they would need to become "must-have" users *while staying true to the core benefit valued by the "must-have" users* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:23">[04:22:23]</a>. This helps convert fence-sitters without diluting the core value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:50">[04:28:50]</a>.

### 2. Prioritize Speed to Value and Activation
The goal is to get as many *right* people to experience the product-market fit moment as quickly as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>.
*   **Repositioning and Streamlining**:
    *   **Lookout Example**: Initial survey showed 7% satisfaction. Identifying "antivirus" as the core value, the company repositioned its messaging and streamlined the [[Onboarding and decisionmaking at startups | onboarding]] process to immediately set up antivirus upon sign-up. This increased the "very disappointed" score to 40% in two weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:07">[00:53:07]</a>.
    *   **LogMeIn Example**: 95% of users signed up but never did a remote control session, significantly limiting monetization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:53">[05:49:53]</a>. A complete freeze on product development and marketing efforts allowed the team to focus solely on improving the signup-to-usage rate. In three months, usage increased by 1000% (from 5% to 50% of users), enabling profitable acquisition at much larger scales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:50">[05:50:50]</a>.
*   **Identify Friction Points**: Ask users why they failed to progress at specific points in the funnel (e.g., "Why didn't you download the software after registering?"). Often, the problem is simpler than expected (e.g., users not believing a "free" product was credible) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:51">[05:51:51]</a>.
*   **Increase Desire, Reduce Friction**: These are the two primary levers for driving conversion during onboarding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:36">[01:01:36]</a>. Reminding users of the benefits they will receive can increase desire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:49">[01:01:49]</a>.
*   **Define an [[Onboarding and activation metrics in tech | Activation Metric]]**: Qualitatively define when a user has had a "good enough" experience to know the product's value (the "aha moment") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:57">[01:02:57]</a>. Ensure this metric correlates with long-term retention. Ideally, it's a value that can be experienced very early in the user journey (first session/day) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:07">[01:04:07]</a>.

### 3. Establish a North Star Metric
A North Star Metric is a single, quantifiable metric that reflects the delivery of the product's core value to customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:02">[04:59:02]</a>.
*   **Value-Driven**: It should be rooted in the must-have value identified by the Sean Ellis Test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:51">[01:19:51]</a>.
*   **Actionable and Upward Trending**: It should be a number that can continuously go "up and to the right" over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:40">[01:20:40]</a>.
*   **Correlation to Revenue**: While revenue shouldn't be the North Star Metric itself, it should correlate directly to revenue growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:46">[01:20:46]</a>. (e.g., Airbnb's "Nights Booked" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:41">[01:22:41]</a>, Uber's "Weekly Rides" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:57">[01:22:57]</a>, Amazon's "Monthly Purchases" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:30">[01:21:30]</a>).
*   **Team Alignment**: The team should collectively decide on the North Star Metric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:18">[01:20:18]</a>.

### 4. Build a Flywheel for Sustainable Growth
Once activation is strong, focus on building a sustainable growth engine, often called a "flywheel" or "growth loop" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>. This involves optimizing all parts of the user journey, from acquisition to monetization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>.

The typical sequence of focus, after validating product-market fit, is:
1.  **Activation**: Ensure new users quickly experience the core value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:03">[05:11:03]</a>.
2.  **Engagement**: Keep users coming back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:03">[05:11:03]</a>.
3.  **Referral**: Encourage existing users to bring in new ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:03">[05:11:03]</a>.
4.  **Monetization**: Ensure the revenue model is effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:03">[05:11:03]</a>.
5.  **Acquisition**: Only then, scale top-of-funnel acquisition efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:03">[05:11:03]</a>.

#### Specific Considerations for Growth Loops:
*   **Referral Programs**:
    *   Work best as accelerators for products that *already* have strong word-of-mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:15">[01:15:15]</a>.
    *   Incentives on both sides (referrer and referred) tend to be most effective (e.g., PayPal, Dropbox) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:31">[01:13:31]</a>.
    *   Collaborative products inherently lend themselves well to referrals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:55">[01:16:55]</a>.
*   **[[Manual onboarding as a growth strategy | Freemium]]**:
    *   The free product must be *so good* that it naturally generates word-of-mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:55">[01:15:59]</a>.
    *   The premium product must be sufficiently better and differentiated to incentivize upgrades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:24">[01:16:24]</a>.

### 5. Research and Experimentation
*   **Blend Qualitative and Quantitative**: Strong growth comes from combining quantitative data analysis (analytics, A/B testing) with qualitative user research (surveys, interviews) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:16">[01:12:16]</a>.
*   **Ask the Right Questions**: A problem well-stated is a problem half-solved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:41">[00:57:41]</a>. Learning how to ask the right questions at the right time is critical for uncovering solutions and improving growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:11">[01:33:11]</a>.
    *   "How did you find this product?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:19">[01:10:19]</a>
    *   "How do you typically find something like that?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:22">[01:10:22]</a>
*   **Prioritization**: Use frameworks like ICE (Impact, Confidence, Effort) to prioritize experiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:03">[01:11:03]</a>. Impact should encompass reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:51">[01:27:51]</a>. The framework helps systematically compare ideas and explain decisions to the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:59">[01:29:59]</a>.

## The Role of AI in Growth
AI is poised to significantly impact growth work:
*   **Experiment Idea Generation**: AI can assist in coming up with experiment ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:35">[01:30:35]</a>.
*   **Modeling Outcomes**: AI will improve the ability to model potential outcomes of experiments and identify opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:51">[01:29:51]</a>.
*   **Analysis**: AI can help with the analysis of experiments, which is often a bottleneck in high-velocity testing programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:33">[01:32:33]</a>.
*   **Cross-Functional Collaboration**: Dispassionate recommendations from an AI system could help overcome ego-driven challenges in [[Onboarding and decisionmaking at startups | cross-functional collaboration]] for growth initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:43">[01:31:43]</a>.

From: [[lennyspodcast]] <br/> 

The "working backwards" process is a fundamental approach in [[Product development processes at Ramp | product development]], particularly emphasized at Amazon. Its core principle is to start with the problem a customer faces and then derive the solution, rather than beginning with a solution and attempting to retrofit a problem to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:11">[00:47:11]</a>.

## Core Tenets of Working Backwards

The essence of working backwards revolves around:
*   **Problem Obsession** It is all about obsessing about the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:15">[00:47:15]</a>. Teams must be guided by the problem they are trying to solve and be faithful to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:01">[00:48:01]</a>.
*   **Customer Focus** The process emphasizes starting with what you are trying to accomplish for a [[Talking to customers for product development | customer]] or for the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:24">[00:50:24]</a>.

## Common Mistakes in Implementation

A common mistake teams make when attempting to apply the working backwards process is not truly starting from the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:23">[00:47:23]</a>. Instead, they often begin with a desired solution and then try to retrofit a problem and a customer to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:44">[00:47:44]</a>. This often manifests when discussions center around combining existing technologies or services ("we could put these ingredients together") rather than addressing a compelling customer problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:33">[00:57:33]</a>.

## The Amazon Mechanism: Press Release and FAQ

At Amazon, the working backwards principle is enforced through a specific mechanism: writing an internal press release and a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) document <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:40">[00:50:40]</a>.

*   **Press Release (PR):** This document outlines the customer problem, the proposed solution, and often includes a customer quote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:58">[00:50:58]</a>. Ian McAllister recalls a specific learning from Jeff Bezos during the development of Amazon Smile: a press release without a problem paragraph suggested there wasn't a real problem to solve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:54">[00:41:54]</a>. This emphasizes that the PR is not for announcement but as a tool to ensure a problem-first approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:38">[00:51:38]</a>.
*   **Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ):** The FAQ section of the document addresses whether there is a legitimate plan to succeed for the proposed idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:05">[00:51:05]</a>. This delves into internal components, finances, and key technical hurdles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:44">[00:56:44]</a>.

### Jeff Bezos's Investment Criteria

Jeff Bezos's criteria for investing in something new align with the working backwards process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:06">[00:56:06]</a>:
1.  **Is it a big idea?** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:10">[00:56:10]</a>
2.  **Is it something we should be doing?** (i.e., does it fit with the company's mission/domain?) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:12">[00:56:12]</a>
3.  **Is there a legitimate plan to succeed?** (addressed by the FAQ) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:25">[00:56:25]</a>

All three criteria must be met for a new initiative to move forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:27">[00:56:27]</a>.

## Adapting the Process Outside Amazon

While the Amazon mechanism (PR and FAQ) is effective, the spirit of working backwards can be applied in any organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:13">[00:51:13]</a>.

*   **Flexibility in Format:** If a team doesn't have the existing "muscle" to work backwards, using the press release template can be a great starting point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:08">[00:51:08]</a>. However, it's not the only way; the core idea is to always think about the problem first, regardless of the document format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:21">[00:51:21]</a>.
*   **Organizational Context:** [[Product development processes at Ramp | Product leaders]] should acknowledge the environment they are in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:22">[00:53:22]</a>. If an organization has a specific format for proposals (e.g., slide culture), it may be necessary to adapt the working backwards principles to that format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:12">[00:52:12]</a>. The key is to embed the *spirit* of starting from the customer problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:06">[00:55:06]</a>.
*   **Review Process:** A "working backwards review" is a meeting with leadership or other stakeholders to review the concept, press release, and FAQ, asking questions to ensure thoroughness and alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:20">[00:55:20]</a>. This can serve as a gate for approving new initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:31">[00:55:31]</a>.

## Operational Mindset and Continuous Improvement

Jeff Wilke, former SVP for Worldwide Discovery at Amazon, instilled an [[Operationalizing the principle of meticulousness in product development | operational mindset]] and rigor across the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:48">[00:42:48]</a>. This means understanding that [[Product development processes at Ramp | product leadership]] is not just about [[Product development processes at Ramp | building new things]], but also about how well you run what you've already built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:03">[00:44:03]</a>. Paying attention to existing products can generate ideas for improvements or new features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:41">[00:44:41]</a>.

This [[Operationalizing the principle of meticulousness in product development | operational mindset]] extends to continuous improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:52">[00:42:52]</a>. For a [[Product development processes at Ramp | product manager]], this means constantly reflecting on what could have been done better in every role, experience, project, and communication, and then applying those learnings to future situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:10">[00:37:10]</a>.

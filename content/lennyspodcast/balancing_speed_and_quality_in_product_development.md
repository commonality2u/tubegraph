## The False Trade-off Between Speed and Quality

Contrary to popular belief, there is not an actual trade-off between [[Importance of Speed and Stability in Software Development | speed and quality]] in product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. The misconception arises because people often equate speed with "rushing or being sloppy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Instead, true speed in this context is about "being really competent" and acting as an expert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

At the pinnacle of their craft, professionals demonstrate high-quality output through their speed, not despite it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. This efficiency allows for more iterations, which is a significant component of product [[Developing Taste and Quality in Product Design | quality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. As Patrick Collison of Stripe tweeted, "slow and expensive usually go together" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.

## Achieving Speed and Quality

Speed in product development means having a workable solution very early in the development cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. For example, within 10% of a project's rough time budget, there should be something functional that tests a key hypothesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. This allows for early validation and prevents spending 80% of the time on an incorrect assumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.

Key components for achieving this:
*   **Talented Engineers** Engineers should not be blocked by every design choice; they should be willing to create something workable even if it's not perfect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.
*   **No Expectation of Perfection** The first version is considered the "best guess in the general direction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>, not a final, polished product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. This reduces the pressure for perfectionism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.
*   **Focus on Core Problem** The goal of early versions is to validate or invalidate major assumptions and see if the software solves the core problem for users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.
*   **Gradual Release** New features are released to increasingly larger circles of users, starting with internal teams, then beta groups, and finally general availability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. This ensures real validation and feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>.
*   **Avoiding Wasted Time** The sooner directional sense is gained, the faster the entire process can go, as most wasted time comes from building features nobody wants or uses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>.

## Avoiding Bloated Software

A common criticism is that successful software products eventually become bloated. To counteract this, a strict policy is in place regarding feature requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>. The product intentionally says no to "customization features requested by middle managers in order to make reporting a little bit easier at the cost of making IC [individual contributor] workflows worse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>.

This commitment prioritizes the direct user experience of the individual contributor, ensuring the product remains fast and enjoyable to use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>. The logic is that if the IC user experience is degraded, users will disengage, leading to inaccurate data and ineffective reporting anyway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>.

When considering complex feature debates, the focus is always on understanding specific, real-life use cases tied to actual people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:49">[00:24:49]</a>. It's crucial to ensure a solution matches "reality," even if reality is "ugly sometimes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:47">[00:25:47]</a>.

### Understanding User Needs through "Feeling Bad"

A key strategy is to "feel bad in the same way that customers feel bad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:13">[00:31:13]</a>. This means digging deep during customer calls, going beyond surface-level requests to understand the underlying emotional valence or "bad feeling" that motivates a user's need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:50">[00:31:50]</a>. By understanding the emotional hook, more profound solutions can be built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:07">[00:35:07]</a>.

An example is the "triage management" feature, which automated manual processes that made users feel "underwater" or "out of control" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:05">[00:37:05]</a>.

## Systematizing Creativity

To generate non-obvious solutions, a systemized approach to creativity is used:
1.  **Extreme Thinking**: Ask, "How extreme can you take it?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:33">[00:45:33]</a>. This involves exploring the "11-star experience" or 10x version of an idea, throwing away constraints like cost or practicality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:01">[00:46:01]</a>.
2.  **Explore Possibility Space**: The goal is to see beyond defaults and hidden constraints to fully understand the range of options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:26">[00:46:26]</a>.
3.  **Build Extreme Versions**: Actually build and test these extreme versions rapidly to learn about the product space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:40">[00:47:40]</a>. For instance, in developing a draft-saving feature, the team built a "fastest possible" version (which felt unsafe) and a "safest possible" auto-save version (which created too much clutter) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:03">[00:49:03]</a>. This led to the balanced, nuanced solution that was not initially obvious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:39">[00:50:39]</a>.
4.  **Align with Product Promise**: The attributes explored should align with the core promise of the product or business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:05">[00:52:05]</a>.

## Strategic Backlog Management

A backlog of product opportunities is maintained, with 20-30 potential areas to explore at any given time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:28">[00:41:28]</a>. These are not yet ready for development due to a lack of conviction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:43">[00:41:43]</a>. The team continuously accumulates understanding and periodically reevaluates these opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:47">[00:41:47]</a>. This informs a shared "mental model" of the user and their needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:59">[00:41:59]</a>.

For example, "capacity planning" has been in the backlog, a problem managers struggle with, often resorting to custom spreadsheets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:03">[00:43:03]</a>. The goal is not to solve the entire problem, but to find a specific, elegant solution that is "right for Linear" and can be built reliably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:48">[00:43:48]</a>. This approach is supported by intentionally keeping the team small, which acts as a constraint against taking on too much too early <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:14">[00:44:14]</a>.

## The Role of Product in Go-to-Market

Product management is viewed as a "go-to-market discipline" alongside sales and marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:50">[00:58:50]</a>. While the traditional "Triad" of engineering, product, and [[Importance of design and functionality in product development | design]] is important, a deeper collaboration between product, sales, and marketing is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:02">[00:59:02]</a>.

This "double triangle" model ensures that product managers connect the "building side" with the "selling side" of the organization, integrating commercial goals into product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:32">[01:01:32]</a>. Product managers, with their deep understanding of the customer's native language, should originate the messaging for the product, helping marketing teams craft effective communication that resonates with expert practitioners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:36">[01:03:36]</a>. Sales then validates this messaging in the field, creating a robust feedback loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:54">[01:00:54]</a>.

## Deadlines as a "P-Zero Problem"

Deadlines are not viewed as arbitrary fabrications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:53">[01:09:53]</a>. Instead, they are taken "seriously that they are basically like a p-zero problem," meaning everything else becomes secondary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:02">[01:10:02]</a>. The philosophy is to have few deadlines, but when one is set, it becomes the absolute priority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:17">[01:10:17]</a>.

To hit a deadline, the product manager's job is to "cut as much scope as possible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:32">[01:10:32]</a>, ensuring that a product can actually be shipped on time, even if it doesn't have all desired features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:49">[01:10:49]</a>. This commitment signals seriousness to the team and stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:12">[01:10:12]</a>. Deadlines are typically set for external marketing exercises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:32">[01:11:32]</a>, recognizing that each launch opportunity is limited and irreplaceable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:25">[01:12:25]</a>.

Estimating is minimized in favor of early shipping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:18">[01:13:18]</a>. By getting a working product out early (within 10% of the allotted time), the remaining time can be used to decide on further iterations or polishing, allowing for an informed go/no-go decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:25">[01:13:25]</a>. This process of rapidly iterating and getting things out early ensures that the team is always in a position to hit commitments and deliver value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:58">[01:13:58]</a>.

Linear, a B2B SaaS product, demonstrates that there is no inherent trade-off between speed and quality in product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Instead, people often misunderstand speed as rushing or being sloppy, when it should be viewed as a reflection of competence and expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. As Patrick Collison, CEO of Stripe, tweeted, the idea that "good cheap fast choose two" is "devious misinformation spread by the slow," as "slow and expensive usually go together" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>.

## Speed as Competence

At Linear, speed means that within 10% of a rough time budget for a feature, a workable solution is ready to test a key hypothesis internally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. This rapid prototyping allows for numerous iterations, which directly contributes to a higher quality product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.

Key components enabling this approach include:
*   **High-quality talent** with engineers who are not blocked by every design choice and are comfortable making workable solutions even if they're not perfect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.
*   **No expectation of perfection in the first version**: The initial release is considered a "best guess" in the general direction, designed to validate or invalidate major assumptions quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.

To move faster without sacrificing quality, the focus should be on adopting an attitude of "controlled risk" where the first version isn't expected to be perfect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. The priority is working software that addresses the core problem and feels good to use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>.

## Iterative Feedback and Preventing Bloat

[[integrating_customer_feedback_into_product_development | Integrating customer feedback]] early and often is crucial. Linear gets new feature ideas out to people as early as possible, typically within the first 10% of the allotted time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>. This involves:
1.  **Internal testing**: Features are first used by internal Linear teams who use the product daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>.
2.  **Gradual beta release**: Once a feature is "good enough" and won't corrupt data, it's released to early beta customer groups for feedback and problem-solving validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>. This helps avoid building features that nobody actually wants or uses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>.

### Avoiding Bloat by Prioritizing Users

Linear actively combats product "bloatedness" by having a clear policy: prioritize the individual contributor (IC) and end-user experience over requests for customization or reporting features from middle managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>. This is a core promise of Linear, ensuring the tool remains fast and enjoyable to use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>.

Product managers (PMs) are encouraged to avoid saying "yes" to requests that might make the IC user experience worse, as this leads to disengagement and inaccurate data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>. Instead, the focus is on solving the core problems for individual users significantly better than competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>.

### Understanding User Needs and Emotions

To make informed decisions, Linear delves into specific user cases rather than general requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:49">[00:24:49]</a>. This means understanding the real-life workflows of individuals and identifying the emotional pain points users experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:06">[00:25:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:13">[00:31:13]</a>.

Nonan Yu, Head of Product at Linear, describes his goal in customer calls as wanting to "feel bad in the same way that customers feel bad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:13">[00:31:13]</a>. By digging deep into the "emotional valence" motivating feature requests, Linear can develop solutions that prevent those negative feelings, such as automatic triage management to prevent issues from falling into "holes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:04">[00:37:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">[00:37:37]</a>.

This approach of seeking out "schlep blindness" – the mundane pains people are blind to – allows Linear to find opportunities for automation and improvement that others might miss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:56">[00:35:56]</a>.

## Systemized Creativity and Extreme Testing

Linear employs a "systemized way of being creative" by exploring extreme versions of potential solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:55">[00:44:55]</a>. This involves asking: "How extreme can you take it?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:31">[00:45:31]</a>. Inspired by concepts like Airbnb's "11-star experience," this process involves setting aside practical constraints like cost to fully explore the "possibility space" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:46">[00:45:46]</a>.

An example is the "save drafts" feature:
1.  **Extreme Speed**: The first version prioritized being as fast as possible, with no pop-ups or confirmation for saving changes, just an "x" button to discard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:05">[00:49:05]</a>. This felt "super unsafe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:39">[00:49:39]</a>.
2.  **Extreme Safety**: The next iteration implemented autosave for everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>. While safe, this led to a "paper trail" of unintended drafts (like "Untitled document" syndrome) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:10">[00:50:10]</a>.
3.  **Balanced Solution**: The final solution balances these extremes:
    *   A new issue creation triggers an interruption to confirm saving a draft, as it's a new object <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:13">[00:51:13]</a>.
    *   Once a draft exists, all subsequent modifications are automatically saved, avoiding further interruptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:20">[00:51:20]</a>.

This approach helps uncover optimal solutions by testing the boundaries of the product space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:51">[00:53:51]</a>.

## Opinionated Software and Deadline Management

B2B software often teaches users "how to work" by embedding specific processes and best practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:29">[00:54:29]</a>. Linear embraces this, being opinionated about how product teams should operate based on observed successful practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:10">[00:57:10]</a>. This is why they resist extensive customization; they believe their streamlined, opinionated workflows lead to better outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:48">[00:56:48]</a>.

Regarding deadlines:
*   **Treat deadlines as P-zero problems**: When a deadline is set, it must be taken "so seriously that they are basically like a pzero problem," meaning everything else is secondary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:02">[01:10:02]</a>.
*   **Cut scope ruthlessly**: The PM's role is to remove as much scope as needed to ensure the deadline is met with a shippable product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:32">[01:10:32]</a>.
*   **Focus on external deadlines**: Deadlines are primarily for external marketing or communication events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:32">[01:11:32]</a>. Missing these opportunities means they are lost forever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:27">[01:12:27]</a>.
*   **Minimal estimating, early shipping**: Linear does "almost no estimating" for deadlines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:18">[01:13:18]</a>. Instead, they ship early to have a working product, allowing the remaining time to be used for iteration or polishing to reach a shippable state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:25">[01:13:25]</a>. This proactive approach sets the team up to make a "yes" or "no" decision on shipping, rather than realizing it's "half broken" at the last minute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>.

At Linear, there isn't actually a trade-off between speed and quality in product development; instead, they are seen as complementary when competence is high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. People often mistakenly associate speed with rushing or sloppiness, rather than with competence and expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. In fact, if you observe experts at the pinnacle of their craft, the quality of their output is often directly related to their speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. The faster they go without being sloppy, the better the work product tends to be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

## What Speed Looks Like in High-Quality Product Development

For Linear, speed means having a workable solution early in the development cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. If you have a rough time budget for a feature, by the time 10% of that budget has passed (e.g., after one week), there should be something that works and tests a key hypothesis internally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. This approach allows for early validation and helps identify incorrect assumptions before too much time is invested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

This rapid iteration is crucial for [[improving user experience and product quality | product quality]] because it enables more iterations and experimentation with different variations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. Key elements enabling this speed include:
*   **Talented Engineers** Engineers who are comfortable making something workable even if it's not perfect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.
*   **No Expectation of Perfection** The first version is considered the "best guess" in the right direction, not a polished final product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. This removes the pressure to be a perfectionist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.
*   **Early User Feedback** Starting with internal users and then gradually expanding to beta customers helps validate assumptions and ensures the product solves core problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. The goal is to get working software that can be interacted with and tested quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>. The faster you get a directional sense of whether you're heading in a good direction, the faster the entire process goes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>.

As Patrick Collison, CEO of Stripe, tweeted, "good, cheap, fast, choose two" is often misinformation spread by the slow, as slow and expensive usually go together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>.

## Avoiding Software Bloat: Prioritizing the IC

A common criticism Linear faces is the assumption that it will eventually become a bloated piece of software like many enterprise products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>. Linear explicitly addresses this by having a clear policy on feature requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>. They strictly say no to customization features requested by middle managers for easier reporting, especially if these features come at the cost of making individual contributor (IC) workflows worse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>.

This decision stems from the understanding that:
*   **IC Engagement is Key** If the IC user experience is poor, they will disengage. Engineers are paid to write code, not to meticulously fill out tickets that complicate their day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>. This leads to inaccurate or sparse data, making reporting useless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a>.
*   **False Trade-off** Product managers often feel pressured by sales or buyers to say yes to such requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>. However, Linear asserts this is a false trade-off; making the IC experience worse ultimately undermines the product's value proposition of making teams more effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>.
*   **Focus on Core Problems** Instead of accommodating every request, Linear focuses on solving the top 2-3 most important problems for users far better than anyone else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:19">[00:21:19]</a>.

This policy helps [[building a brand and maintaining product quality | maintain product quality]] and ensures that Linear remains a beloved tool because it continuously prioritizes the actual users who interact with the software daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:27">[00:27:27]</a>.

## Empathy and "Feeling Bad" in Product Development

When gathering [[improving product management skills | customer feedback]], the goal is not just to understand what features users *want*, but to deeply understand the *emotion* they want to avoid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:13">[00:31:13]</a>. Nan You's goal is to "feel bad in the same way that customers feel bad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:11">[00:31:11]</a>. This involves continuously "digging and digging" during customer calls to uncover the underlying emotional valence motivating a request <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:08">[00:31:08]</a>.

An example is the stress users felt about project deadlines. Instead of just adding a date field, Linear introduced flexible target dates (e.g., Q4 project) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:41">[00:33:41]</a>. This solved the emotional pain of needing to provide false precision and avoid miscommunication with other teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:55">[00:33:55]</a>.

Another example is the "triage management" feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:32">[00:36:32]</a>. People felt "underwater" manually routing tickets or frustrated by issues falling into "holes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:11">[00:37:11]</a>. Linear automated this process, systemizing how issues are routed to the right teams, addressing the feeling of lack of control and uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:48">[00:37:48]</a>.

This approach targets "schlepp blindness," where people are blind to the daily frustrations they experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:56">[00:35:56]</a>. By observing these emotional friction points, product teams can find opportunities to provide significant value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:09">[00:36:09]</a>.

## Systematized Creativity: Testing Extremes

To foster creativity and come up with non-obvious solutions, Linear employs a method of testing extremes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:05">[00:45:05]</a>. This involves asking: "How extreme can you take it?" for a product or feature, removing constraints like cost or practicality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:31">[00:45:31]</a>. The goal is to explore the entire "possibility space" and discover choices that might otherwise be overlooked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:19">[00:46:19]</a>.

For example, when designing a draft-saving feature:
1.  **Extreme Speed**: The first version prioritized extreme speed, immediately discarding content on close without asking for saving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:10">[00:49:10]</a>. This felt "super unsafe" to users, confirming a potential pitfall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:39">[00:49:39]</a>.
2.  **Extreme Safety**: The next extreme was autosaving everything immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>. While safe, it led to a "paper trail" of untitled or abandoned drafts, similar to cluttered document tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:07">[00:50:07]</a>.

The final solution balanced these extremes:
*   A new issue creation prompts to save a draft on close (interruption needed for safety) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:47">[00:50:47]</a>.
*   An existing draft automatically autosaves changes (no further interruption needed) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:02">[00:51:02]</a>.

This process, reminiscent of [[the working backwards process in product development | "working backwards"]] or Airbnb's "11-star experience," allows teams to understand the nuances of a problem space by experiencing its boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:46">[00:45:46]</a>. It's not just about ideation, but actually building and feeling these extreme versions quickly to inform the optimal solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:40">[00:47:40]</a>.

## B2B Software Teaches How to Work

Adopting B2B software isn't just about solving a problem; it's about adopting a *way of working* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:58">[00:55:58]</a>. Many B2B tools originate from internal processes within large companies that proved successful and were then productized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:40">[00:54:40]</a>. Therefore, when a company buys a tool, they're essentially buying a "baseline level of competency" and a set of best practices for that domain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:51">[00:55:51]</a>.

Linear's opinionated approach, sometimes called the "Linear method," aligns with this philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:12">[00:57:12]</a>. They avoid extensive customization requests because they believe their default workflows reflect the best practices observed in high-performing teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:03">[00:57:03]</a>. The goal is to automate these proven practices and provide them as native features, enabling other companies to adopt them effortlessly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:58">[00:57:58]</a>.

## Double Triangle: Collaboration with Sales and Marketing

At Linear, product management is considered a go-to-market discipline, not just focused on engineering and design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:49">[00:58:49]</a>. They advocate for a "double triangle" model of collaboration, where the PM is in the middle, connecting the "building side" (engineering, product, design) with the "selling side" (sales, marketing, product management) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:29">[01:01:29]</a>.

Unlike organizations where product, sales, and marketing might have antagonism, Linear fosters close collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:26">[00:59:26]</a>. Product managers are expected to:
*   **Be deeply involved in messaging**: They understand the customer's "native language" better than anyone, allowing them to help the marketing team originate the right words and phrasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.
*   **Validate messaging in the field**: Sales teams provide direct feedback on whether the messaging resonates with customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:54">[01:00:54]</a>.

This integration ensures that what is built effectively addresses commercial goals and that the product is communicated to the audience in an authentic and impactful way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:02">[01:01:02]</a>.

## Approach to Deadlines

Linear has a very specific view on deadlines:
*   **Don't have too many** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:17">[01:10:17]</a>.
*   **When you do, treat them as P0 (top priority)** This means engineers working on a P0 deadline are not pulled onto other tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:22">[01:10:22]</a>.
*   **PMs cut scope relentlessly** The product manager's job is to cut as much scope as possible to ensure the deadline is met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:32">[01:10:32]</a>. The goal is to have a working product that can be shipped, even if it doesn't have every desired feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:11">[01:11:11]</a>.
*   **Deadlines are usually for external marketing launches** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:32">[01:11:32]</a>. These represent limited communication opportunities with the audience that, if missed, cannot be regained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:25">[01:12:25]</a>.
*   **Minimal estimating, maximum early shipping** Instead of extensive upfront estimation, the focus is on shipping a working version (even a simple one) as early as possible (within 10% of the allocated time) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:18">[01:13:18]</a>. This allows the remaining time to be spent on iterating and polishing, enabling a confident "yes" or "no" decision at the actual deadline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:51">[01:13:51]</a>. This strategy contributes to their [[effective product management strategies | effective product management strategies]].

This approach to deadlines is integrated with their philosophy of speed and quality, ensuring that commitments are taken seriously and that the team is always in a position to deliver.

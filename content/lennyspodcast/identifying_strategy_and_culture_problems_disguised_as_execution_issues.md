Many leaders find themselves constantly busy, solving execution problems, only for new ones to surface repeatedly, creating a "classic vacuum hole" scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:35">[01:05:35]</a>. However, in high-performing environments where team members have good intentions, most perceived execution problems are actually rooted in deeper issues related to strategy, culture, or interpersonal dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>.

## When Execution Problems Are Actually Strategy Problems
A common scenario is when two teams are misaligned, affecting their ability to hit OKRs and move faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:01">[01:06:01]</a>. Leaders might try to solve this by creating new review processes or regular one-on-one meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:49">[01:06:49]</a>. However, this apparent [[Challenges in Strategy Implementation | execution problem]] is often a [[Understanding strategy and its challenges | strategy problem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:40">[01:07:40]</a>.

The misalignment occurs because:
*   Teams are pursuing different strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:43">[01:07:43]</a>.
*   There is no clear, well-defined strategy for the teams to follow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:54">[01:07:54]</a>.
*   OKRs are not well-aligned, and there's no clear sense of priorities or how to adapt when reality changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:04">[01:08:04]</a>.

Instead of addressing the lack of strategy, teams might argue over feature dependencies or resource allocation, failing to recognize the fundamental mismatch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:31">[01:08:31]</a>. A clear, correct strategy should inform these decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:15">[01:08:15]</a>.

## When Execution Problems Are Actually Culture Problems
In the same scenario of misaligned teams, the issue might stem from a [[Impact of Company Culture on Product Development | culture problem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:04">[01:09:04]</a>. If a company's [[Building and maintaining company culture to enhance team collaboration | culture]] mainly optimizes for individual team OKRs, it becomes difficult for teams to collaborate effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:12">[01:09:12]</a>. A team might hesitate to help another if it means risking their own OKRs, as their manager could face repercussions during performance reviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:25">[01:09:25]</a>.

Simply holding more meetings will not solve this underlying [[Building and maintaining company culture to enhance team collaboration | culture problem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:39">[01:09:39]</a>. The execution problem will likely manifest in different ways over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:48">[01:09:48]</a>. This emphasizes the importance of [[Insight on company culture and leadership at Meta | leadership]] setting the desired culture by consistently embodying the behaviors they want to see replicated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:02">[02:06:02]</a>.

## Interpersonal Problems
Sometimes, the perceived execution problem is simply due to interpersonal friction, such as two team managers not getting along <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:57">[01:09:57]</a>. As a leader, spotting this and coaching individuals through their differences is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:12">[01:10:12]</a>. Addressing this root cause eliminates the need for superficial meetings and processes that wouldn't work anyway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:24">[01:10:24]</a>.

## Distinguishing True Execution Problems
Not all execution problems are disguised. Genuine execution problems include:
*   **Infrastructure issues**: An old infrastructure that can no longer sustain usage, leading to slower performance or outages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:03">[01:11:03]</a>.
*   **Skills gaps**: Engineers lacking specific skills for a certain technology or a product manager being a "zero to one" person assigned to a mature, scaling initiative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:30">[01:11:30]</a>.

A "surefire way" to identify if an execution problem is disguised is when "you put on a band-aid and the band-aid falls" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:26">[01:12:26]</a>. If organizations are constantly solving the same problem repeatedly without lasting results (e.g., "these two teams can never work together"), it's likely not an execution issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:30">[01:12:30]</a>. Organizational memory tends to be short, leading teams to apply new superficial solutions rather than addressing the deeper, recurring root cause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:47">[01:12:47]</a>.

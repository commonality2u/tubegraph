Whiz, a rapidly growing security company, achieved a remarkable feat by hitting $100 million ARR just 18 months after its founding, making it the fastest-growing software company in history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:38">[01:36:38]</a>. This success came despite initial struggles to pinpoint their core idea, highlighting a powerful journey to [[product_market_fit_strategy | product-market fit]].

## The Initial Search for a Product Idea
When Ros Herberg, Chief Marketing Officer and VP of Product Strategy at Whiz, joined as the first product manager, the founders hadn't settled on a clear idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. The company was initially founded as "Beyond Networks" with an aim to enter the network security space, despite the founding team's prior experience in cloud security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:32:00">[07:32:00]</a>.

During the early weeks, particularly as Whiz launched during the COVID-19 pandemic shutdown in March 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:27">[08:06:27]</a>, the team engaged in 10 to 15 daily meetings with potential customers (CISOs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:40">[08:21:40]</a>. They presented their idea through a deck, which often elicited polite responses like "Oh, sounds interesting" or "Would love to hear more" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:15:39">[09:15:39]</a>.

However, Ros, despite being the product manager, found herself confused about what they were actually going to build after weeks of calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:06">[09:56:06]</a>. This internal confusion, coupled with the polite but non-committal customer feedback, was a key signal that their initial idea wasn't working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:07">[10:07:07]</a>.

## Signs of a Lack of Fit
One of the critical lessons from Whiz's early days was recognizing the difference between polite interest and genuine customer pull. As human beings, there's a natural bias to seek affirmation rather than uncomfortable truths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:47:30">[13:47:30]</a>. Customers, especially when talking to smart founders, might be reluctant to say they don't understand or aren't interested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:55:08">[10:55:08]</a>.

Ros bravely articulated her confusion to the founders, which sparked a deep discussion and led to the realization that they were "listening in the wrong way" and "looking for positive reinforcements but not really listening intently to like signs of deep enthusiasm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:13:30">[11:13:30]</a>.

## The Pivot to Cloud Security
This realization led to a five-hour discussion where the team decided to pivot to cloud security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:08:03">[18:08:03]</a>. This was a natural fit, as it was their background and an area where they perceived "problems there was so big and so strong" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:24:20">[18:24:20]</a>.

### Signals of [[Product Market Fit Strategy | Product Market Fit]]
Once they pivoted to cloud security, the conversations with customers dramatically changed. The "room felt so different" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:41:40">[18:41:40]</a>. Instead of polite interest, genuine enthusiasm and critical questions emerged, acting as strong indicators of [[levels_of_productmarket_fit_and_their_significance | product-market fit]]:

*   **Questions about Pricing:** Customers started asking, "How are you pricing this? How much will this cost?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:21:50">[13:21:50]</a>.
*   **Inquiries about Purchasing:** "When can we start doing a PO? How long long as a PO?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:26:08">[13:26:08]</a>
*   **Requests for Connections:** Customers would offer to connect the team to specific people in their organization: "Okay, I know exactly who I need to connect you to in my team" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:30:40">[13:30:40]</a>.
*   **Pushing for Next Steps:** This is a crucial indicator. Customers weren't just saying "super cool," but actively pushing for proof-of-value (POV) or deployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:02:00">[19:02:00]</a>. Ros recounts how a Fortune 10 company, when asked to fill out a long technical questionnaire before a POV to buy time, returned it filled out the next day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:07:05">[20:07:05]</a>. This indicated their strong commitment and desire for the product.

### Founders Leading Early Sales
A unique aspect of Whiz's early success was that the founders and early employees, including Ros, personally handled sales in the initial stages. They closed deals themselves before hiring a dedicated sales team, learning immensely from the direct interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:49:10">[21:49:10]</a>. This allowed them to understand the product and market deeply and build confidence for future sales hires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:02:10">[22:02:10]</a>.

> "If you can't do it one time and to end then you like the core core Core Group the chances of just bringing somebody from the outside to solve that problem it's wishful in some ways I but it never ends up that way." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:53:57">[22:53:57]</a>

## Post-PMF Scaling and the "Heat" Metaphor
As Whiz scaled, Ros observed a shift in where the "heat" or primary focus of the company lay:
*   **Early Days:** The "heat was in the product kitchen," as everyone waited for something tangible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:20:50">[28:20:50]</a>.
*   **Building:** The heat moved to engineering to "build it, make it work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:39:50">[28:39:50]</a>.
*   **Selling:** After initial deals, the heat shifted to sales, pushing for more conversions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:49:50">[28:49:50]</a>.
*   **Scaling Awareness:** Finally, the heat moved to marketing, as sales needed more pipeline and brand awareness became critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:58:10">[28:58:10]</a>.

## Key Takeaways for [[Product Market Fit Strategy | Product-Market Fit]] and Beyond

### 1. Embrace Vulnerability and Questioning
Ros's pivotal moment came from asking "what exactly are we doing here?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:26:00">[10:26:00]</a>. A culture that encourages asking "I don't understand" or "please explain again" is vital for early-stage companies to avoid going in circles and truly [[developing_customer_discovery_methods_for_productmarket_fit | understand customer needs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:57:00">[15:57:00]</a>.

### 2. Prioritize Clear and Simple Messaging
As a product leader moving into marketing, Ros realized the importance of clear, simple communication. Product people, living "inside the product in the technical domain," can often be too far removed from the common market user or seller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:26:40">[45:26:40]</a>. Marketing bridges this gap, and messages must be "Crystal Clear black and white" to scale without getting lost in translation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:27:00">[46:27:00]</a>.

> ### The "Dummy Explanation"
> Ros insists that all marketing materials should be understandable by "anybody," without assuming deep knowledge about Whiz, its product, or the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:50:00">[49:50:00]</a>. For example, instead of using technical jargon like "cloud native application protection," they should communicate in terms their audience actually Googles, like "Cloud security solution" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:01:00">[48:01:00]</a>.

### 3. Be Unafraid to Experiment
In marketing, unlike product development, "there's no cost to anything, no maintenance to anything, no technical depth, no anything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:42:00">[37:42:00]</a>. Ros's strategy for Whiz was to "try everything" to make noise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:07:00">[38:07:00]</a>. This led to unconventional tactics like transforming their RSA conference booth into a "Whiz of Oz" theme, which significantly increased engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:52:00">[38:52:00]</a>.

### 4. Embrace the Possibility of Failure
Ros believes in the "opportunity to fail" as empowering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:20:00">[42:20:00]</a>. This mindset, rooted in her upbringing, encourages attempting tasks even when success isn't guaranteed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:19:00">[41:19:00]</a>. It allows for bold experimentation and pushing boundaries, whether in finding [[the_concept_of_product_market_fit_and_its_evolution | product-market fit]] or expanding market reach.

### 5. Build a Culture of Trust and Impact
Whiz's flat organizational structure fosters a culture where "everybody can have a seat on the table and voices are heard" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>. This environment of trust and the belief in "giving everybody a chance to have impact regardless of title or experience" allows crucial conversations to happen, like Ros's initial questioning of the product idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:55:00">[52:55:00]</a>.

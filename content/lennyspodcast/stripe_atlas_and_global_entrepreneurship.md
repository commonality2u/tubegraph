Stripe Atlas is a service designed to radically simplify the process of starting a company, particularly for entrepreneurs outside the United States seeking to establish a U.S. presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:09">[01:37:09]</a>. Founded on the belief that there should be more startups, the platform aims to dramatically lower the barriers for great people to solve problems globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:50">[01:39:50]</a>.

## Origin and Mission
Stripe Atlas was conceived in 2016 after Stripe teammates heard stories from international entrepreneurs who had to fly to the United States to establish a U.S. company, gain access to the U.S. financial system, and raise capital from U.S. or global investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:09">[01:37:09]</a>. This problem of needing to get on an airplane just to run a business was identified as a "burning problem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:02">[01:39:02]</a>. The core mission of Atlas is to make it possible to start a company in a few clicks, enabling entrepreneurs to go from quitting a job on Sunday night to being ready to run a business by Monday morning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:19">[01:44:19]</a>.

## Core Offerings and Evolution
Stripe Atlas provides automated solutions for administrative complexities that traditionally take weeks or months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:43">[01:29:43]</a>. Key services include:
*   **Incorporation Documents** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:06">[01:22:06]</a>
*   **EIN (Employer Identification Number)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:06">[01:22:06]</a>
*   **Share Purchases** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:06">[01:22:06]</a>
*   **83(b) Elections:** A significant feature is the automation of the 83(b) election, a complex and time-sensitive IRS rule designed to spur entrepreneurship. Previously, founders had a strict 30-calendar-day window to send a one-page document via snail mail to the IRS, with no verification or redo if missed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:30">[01:41:30]</a>. Stripe Atlas now handles this process in the background, including faxing, phone calls, and form filling, ensuring it is done on time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:50">[01:52:50]</a>.

As of the podcast's launch date, Stripe Atlas allows users to incorporate a new company in a single day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:17">[01:17:17]</a>. This means handling all the necessary paperwork, tax IDs, and financial system access so founders can focus on building and shipping their product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:47">[01:44:47]</a>.

## Impact on Entrepreneurship
Stripe Atlas has had a substantial impact on the startup ecosystem:
*   **Market Share:** One in six new Delaware Corporations are now started on Stripe Atlas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>. The team is aiming for one in five <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:56">[01:54:56]</a>.
*   **Accelerated Growth:** The automation efforts have led to companies charging their customers sooner, with some seeing the time to acquire their first customer cut in half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>. This accelerates GDP generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:51">[01:47:51]</a>.
*   **Increased Solo Founders:** The platform's ease of use has led to more solo founders utilizing Atlas than ever before, indicating that more people are choosing to become entrepreneurs due to the lowered barriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:27">[01:48:27]</a>.
*   **Cross-Border Founders:** Over 20% of multi-founder teams using Atlas have at least one founder from another country, showcasing the internet's ability to bring diverse people together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:38">[01:55:38]</a>.
*   **Economic Contribution:** Companies started through Atlas (55,000 to date) are generating $5 billion in revenue per year, and this figure is growing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:08">[01:50:08]</a>. About 20% of users reported they wouldn't have started their business without Atlas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:28">[02:02:28]</a>.

## Philosophy and Strategy
The Atlas team, consisting of only about 10 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:54">[01:50:54]</a>, prioritizes automation and focuses on problems that can be solved with leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:12">[01:51:12]</a>. This aligns with a [[Longterm vision and entrepreneurship | long-term compounding philosophy]] of building products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:04">[01:24:04]</a>.

A key aspect of their strategy is to "delight current customers such that they would tell their friends" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:47">[00:59:47]</a>. This focus on user experience and quality is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>. The team continually seeks to improve user experience by driving down support tickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:27">[00:50:27]</a>. Their primary metric is "companies with zero support tickets" through the entire incorporation process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:27">[00:50:27]</a>, which improved from 15% to 85% over 18 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:48">[01:51:48]</a>.

The team's approach to problem-solving involves:
*   **Deep Customer Understanding:** Actively listening to customers' "burning problems" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>, often through silence during interviews to allow them to articulate their needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>.
*   **Prioritizing Paying Customers:** Focusing exclusively on feedback from paying customers to ensure solutions address real, valuable problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:57">[00:36:57]</a>.
*   **"Users Having a Bad Day" Metric:** Tracking instances where users encounter issues (e.g., 404 errors, delayed payouts) to identify and eradicate pain points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:05">[01:01:05]</a>.
*   **Collaboration Over Competition:** When AngelList, a competitor, decided to exit the incorporation business, Stripe Atlas maintained an open relationship, allowing for a seamless transition where AngelList directed users to Atlas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:07">[02:11:07]</a>. This demonstrates a belief in specialization and partnership over adversarial competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:55">[02:14:55]</a>.

The team has a strong cultural focus on making the product great and creating the best possible user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:11">[01:25:11]</a>. They believe that if the experience is better, the business will grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:31">[01:25:31]</a>.

## Leadership and Team
The Atlas team is deliberately built with diverse perspectives, being majority women and actively fostering diversity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:07">[01:56:07]</a>. Jeff Weinstein, who previously led product for Stripe's payment infrastructure teams and then took on scaling Atlas, has since passed on leadership to Haley Haverson, who now leads the Atlas team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:52">[02:08:52]</a>.

Invention and innovation are crucial aspects of career advancement, often requiring a systematic approach rather than just sporadic bursts of creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:23">[00:26:23]</a>. While people might assume invention takes extensive time, only about two dedicated hours once a month are needed to generate good ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The real effort often lies in expressing and refining a single good idea, which can take years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## The Importance of Inventiveness

You don't need many good ideas to be perceived as tremendously inventive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. Companies like Amazon exemplify this; ideas such as Prime shipping and Kindle were conceived decades ago but are still being improved upon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Jeff Bezos, Amazon's founder, primarily identified himself as an inventor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a>. His goal was to create the most inventive company, systematically out-inventing competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:22">[00:30:22]</a>.

## Becoming Systematically Inventive

Ethan Evans, a former Vice President at Amazon and holder of over 70 patents, outlines a method for systematic invention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:10">[00:30:10]</a>:

*   **Be an Expert**
    You need to possess some level of expertise in the area where you aim to invent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>. Without foundational knowledge, efforts may be futile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:44">[00:30:44]</a>.

*   **Dedicated Thinking Time**
    Allocate specific, uninterrupted time for thinking, away from distractions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:57">[00:30:57]</a>. This intentional concentration on a problem can yield innovative solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:11">[00:31:11]</a>.

*   **Combine Existing Concepts**
    Often, the most effective way to invent is not by creating something entirely new, but by combining two existing concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:19">[00:31:19]</a>. For instance, the idea of a drone delivery system from a mobile truck was conceived by combining drone delivery with the concept of an aircraft carrier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:30">[00:31:30]</a>.

This process reflects Thomas Edison's famous quote that invention is "1% inspiration and 99% perspiration" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:29">[00:26:29]</a>. The "99% perspiration" can be learned, making the "1% inspiration" less daunting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:37">[00:26:37]</a>.

## Invention as a Catalyst for Career Growth

At Amazon, [[Leadership principles and career success | leadership principles]] such as "Think Big" and "Invent and Simplify" directly encourage inventiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:53">[00:29:53]</a>. Demonstrating these "next-level skills" like strategic thinking and inventiveness is crucial for [[Leadership and career advancement | career advancement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:13">[00:26:13]</a>. The goal is to make yourself the obvious choice for higher-level positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:48">[00:26:48]</a>. This proactive approach is particularly important in environments where opportunities might be limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:53">[00:27:53]</a>.

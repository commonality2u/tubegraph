Roger Martin, a renowned strategy advisor and former dean of the Rotman School of Management, asserts that the current state of strategy education in business schools is largely ineffective. He states that what is "taught now in Business Schools generally sucks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>, leaving people unprepared educationally and within companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Reasons for Poor Strategy Education

Martin identifies several core issues contributing to the poor state of strategy education:

### Over-reliance on Theoretical Frameworks
Business schools have taken a "crazy theoretical bent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>, particularly falling "in love with a theory called the resource based Theory The Firm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

*   **Critique of Resource-Based View (RBV)**: Martin describes the RBV as "silly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a> and a "dumb Theory" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>. He argues that it emerged partly from academics' jealousy of Michael Porter, who published *Competitive Strategy* in 1980 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. Academics caricatured Porter's work as the "positioning school," claiming it was solely about finding a structurally attractive place and exploiting it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. In contrast, the RBV suggested strategy was "all about building resources" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>, implying "if you build it they will come" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. Martin contends that the RBV fails to address how to decide *which* resources to invest in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a> and is rarely used in practice, noting he has only seen it applied once in 42 years of consulting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.
*   **Suppression of Alternative Approaches**: Martin reveals that his own integrated approach to [[strategy_and_its_four_critical_choices | strategy]], which combines "where to play" and "capabilities," is "illegal to teach" in most leading business schools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. He explains that Strategic Management departments at universities maintain "100% control over what's taught" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a> and require allegiance to the RBV for hiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>.

### Lack of Practical Application
Students are not trained in "youthful strategy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. Martin notes that "strategy consulting firms" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>, which should be a feeder for practical strategy knowledge, now do "almost no strategy anymore" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>, focusing instead on larger, less strategic projects like post-merger integration or digital transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.

### Intimidating Nature of Strategy
[[Challenges in Business Strategy | Strategy]] is inherently challenging because it requires making choices to do some things and not others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. This decision-making process can be "emotionally intimidating" as individuals fear being held accountable for their choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

## Developing Strategic Acumen

Despite the shortcomings in formal education, Martin argues that [[becoming_more_strategic_in_a_business_context | strategic thinking]] is a learnable skill, not an innate talent.

*   **Practice is Key**: "I have never met this mythical beast called a great natural strategist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:06">[00:44:06]</a>. Great strategists "have all one thing in common: they just practice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:30">[01:20:30]</a>. As an example, he mentions A.G. Lafley, former P&G CEO, who was considered a "strategy genius" but had been "practicing strategy for decades before he became the CEO" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:57">[01:19:57]</a>.
*   **Focus on Betterment, Not Perfection**: To overcome the overwhelming nature of strategy, Martin advises focusing on "betterment over perfection" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:26">[01:26:26]</a>. This involves identifying the "single most painful gap" between current outcomes and desired outcomes, and then making different choices to close that gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:32">[01:15:32]</a>.
*   **Continuous Improvement**: By consistently addressing the most pressing "gaps," these problems will "get smaller and smaller over time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:37">[01:16:37]</a>. This iterative approach to [[challenges_in_business_strategy | problem-solving]] leads to continuous improvement in [[strategic_management_and_capability_building | strategic management]].
*   **Don't Wait**: Martin cautions against deferring strategic thinking for "operational concerns." He states, "You'll never amount to anything nobody sets that ever amounts to anything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:19">[01:17:19]</a> if they wait to address strategy later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:17">[01:15:17]</a>.

[[Career development for product owners and product managers | Career growth]] for product managers is significantly influenced by how individuals engage with feedback and their self-assessment practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:02">[03:02:02]</a>. Product leaders observe that strong product managers who advance in their careers often approach these aspects differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:06">[06:04:06]</a>.

## The Three W's Framework for Career Growth

A career growth framework for product managers comprises three key areas, known as the "three W's" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>:
1.  **What you produce** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>: Focusing on tangible outputs like shipping products, analyzing experiments, or contributing to go-to-market strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:00">[07:38:00]</a>. This is particularly important early in a career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>. Even at senior levels, it's critical not to forget the individual contributor (IC) roots and continue to engage in hands-on work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:00">[09:01:00]</a>.
2.  **What you bring to the table** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>: This refers to a product manager's impact on impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>. It's about the quality of product artifacts (e.g., PRDs, product notes, strategy documents) and effectively demonstrating skills in data, metrics, design, research, technology, and strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>.
3.  **What's your operating model** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>: This involves communication, collaboration, organizational skills, and community skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>. Key tenets include raising difficult issues without being difficult, bringing out important topics without drawing importance to oneself, and facilitating decisions rather than making all of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. This is especially crucial for mid-senior to senior level transitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.

## Pitfalls to Career Growth

Several factors can impede a product manager's [[Career development for product owners and product managers | career growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>:
*   **Focusing on uncontrollable factors**: Shifting focus from what one *can* control (e.g., personal output, skills) to what the organization or other stakeholders *should* do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.
*   **Relationship with change**: A decreasing rate of personal skill change as one becomes more senior can slow growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>.
*   **How you see yourself**: The stories product managers tell themselves about their capabilities or identity can inadvertently hinder their growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:02]</a>. For example, labeling oneself as a "high agency PM" might excuse brashness or cutting corners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:10">[03:11:10]</a>.

## The Role of Self-Assessment

Self-assessment is a powerful tool for [[Career development for product owners and product managers | career development]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:02">[03:02:02]</a>.

### Correcting Self-Narratives
It's vital to recognize and correct self-told stories that might be holding one back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:10">[03:11:10]</a>. If an individual struggles to identify these stories, talking to trusted individuals can help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>.

For example, a product leader shared an experience at Gojek where observing colleagues' proficiency in data and communication challenged his own self-assessment, revealing areas for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>. This re-calibration fostered a hunger for growth and a self-perception as a continuous learner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>.

### Continuous Benchmarking
To maintain a high rate of change and growth, product managers should continuously benchmark their skills. If one perceives themselves as a "four out of five" in data within their organization, they should benchmark themselves against the best in the industry to identify areas for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:53">[03:09:53]</a>. This applies to all key skills, including communication and collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:10">[03:11:10]</a>.

## The Role of Feedback

[[The impact of user feedback on product development | Feedback]] is crucial for growth, even though it can be emotionally challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. Product management's ambiguous nature means feedback can come from various stakeholders across many dimensions, some of which may not be priorities for one's [[Career development for product owners and product managers | growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>.

### Channeling and Prioritizing Feedback
Product managers must channel [[Candor and feedback in professional growth | feedback]] into targeted growth areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>. It's impossible to improve every area simultaneously. The strategy should be to:
1.  Identify the area with the maximum leverage for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>.
2.  Address critical weaknesses first, as they offer the highest leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:08">[03:56:08]</a>.
3.  Focus on one or two key skill areas at a time to avoid being overwhelmed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:08">[03:56:08]</a>.

For early career PMs, it's recommended to pick one skill from "data" or "tech" and another from "design" or "research" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>. If transitioning from a design background, focus on data or tech, and vice versa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>. Once proficiency is demonstrated in two of these three, focus can shift to "strategy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>. This approach has proven successful in transitioning product managers at Gojek <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>.

### Importance of Product Artifacts
The quality of a product manager's "artifacts" (e.g., Product Requirement Documents (PRDs), product notes, design briefs, Jira stories) directly reflects their ability to apply skills and integrate feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>. When a product manager's career growth stalls despite working on impactful projects, often the tangible artifacts they produce are found to be lacking in detail or quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>.

> "You must have that impact through the artifacts that you work on." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>

### Receiving and Acting on Feedback
Product managers should be open to receiving [[Methods for providing constructive feedback | feedback]], even if it's difficult to hear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. A useful approach is to acknowledge and thank individuals for their feedback, even while internally processing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>. This encourages others to continue providing valuable insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

Product managers who prioritize their [[Career development for product owners and product managers | growth]] by actively seeking and acting on [[Candor and feedback in professional growth | feedback]], engaging in honest self-assessment, and focusing on improving tangible outputs and artifacts are best positioned for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:02">[03:02:02]</a>. This continuous learning mindset, coupled with a strategic approach to skill development, enables rapid [[Career development for product owners and product managers | career progression]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>.

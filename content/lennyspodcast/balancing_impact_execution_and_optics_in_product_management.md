Product work can be understood through three distinct levels: impact, execution, and optics. Understanding these levels and how they interact is crucial for effective product management, fostering team alignment, and achieving desired outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:54">[00:53:54]</a>.

## The Three Levels of Product Work

Different stakeholders often operate at different levels by default, leading to potential misunderstandings and conflicts, even among intelligent and well-intentioned individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:22">[00:57:22]</a>.

*   **[[impact_in_product_management | Impact]]**  
    This level focuses on the ultimate outcomes and value created, particularly for the customer experience and the brand. Founders and CEOs often default to thinking at this level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:38">[00:56:38]</a>. An example includes a CEO questioning how a product launch will [[impact_in_product_management | impact]] customer service response times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:42">[00:54:42]</a>.
*   **[[importance_of_execution_and_output_in_product_management | Execution]]**  
    This level is concerned with the practicalities of getting things done and hitting milestones. Product managers (PMs) often fixate on [[importance_of_execution_and_output_in_product_management | execution]] â€“ what it takes to complete tasks and reach the next objective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:13">[00:56:13]</a>.
*   **Optics**  
    Optics is about creating awareness of the [[impact_in_product_management | impact]] and [[importance_of_execution_and_output_in_product_management | execution]] efforts of an individual or team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:39">[00:58:39]</a>. Good internal optics can generate energy, awareness, excitement, and opportunities for feedback, all of which contribute to greater [[impact_in_product_management | impact]] and [[importance_of_execution_and_output_in_product_management | execution]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:19">[00:59:19]</a>.

## Understanding Misalignment

Conflicts arise when individuals or groups operate at different levels of product work without explicit alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:08">[00:57:08]</a>. For instance, a PM explaining *why* a customer service issue exists (an [[importance_of_execution_and_output_in_product_management | execution]]-level concern) might not resonate with a CEO focused on the overall [[impact_in_product_management | impact]] on brand and customer experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:25">[00:55:25]</a>.

## The Importance of Optics

While good internal optics is beneficial for creating awareness and opportunities, the challenge arises when the balance is lost, and optics becomes the primary goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:32">[00:59:32]</a>. Organizations can inadvertently signal that performance in optics is sufficient for appreciation and reward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:55">[00:59:55]</a>. This can manifest in how leaders appreciate activities; for example, constantly praising status updates (an optics activity) rather than results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:41">[01:00:41]</a>.

## Contextual Prioritization

There is no single "right" level to operate at; the optimal balance depends on the specific context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:20">[01:01:20]</a>:

*   **Early-Stage Teams**  
    While considering eventual [[impact_in_product_management | impact]], early-stage teams should primarily optimize for [[importance_of_execution_and_output_in_product_management | execution]]. This is because immediate [[impact_in_product_management | impact]] may not be visible on short timelines (weeks, months, or even quarters). The focus should be on converting core insights into a product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:56">[01:01:56]</a>.
*   **Platform Teams**  
    If a platform team has faced recent availability issues affecting other internal teams, they might benefit from explicitly increasing their focus on optics by improving communication channels and status updates with dependent teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:55">[01:02:55]</a>.

## Execution Problems are Often Strategy or Culture Problems

Many perceived [[importance_of_execution_and_output_in_product_management | execution]] problems in high-performing, fast-growing environments are actually rooted in deeper issues related to [[becoming_more_strategic_in_product_management | strategy]] or culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:55">[01:03:55]</a>. Leaders often find themselves constantly solving new [[importance_of_execution_and_output_in_product_management | execution]] problems, creating a perpetual cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:38">[01:05:38]</a>.

### Underlying Causes

*   **[[becoming_more_strategic_in_product_management | Strategy Problems]]**  
    Team misalignment, often seen as an [[importance_of_execution_and_output_in_product_management | execution]] issue, frequently stems from a lack of clear strategy or conflicting strategies. Without a well-defined strategy, teams might set misaligned OKRs, lack a sense of priorities, or struggle to adapt when reality changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:40">[01:07:40]</a>.
*   **Culture Problems**  
    An organizational culture that primarily optimizes for individual team OKRs can make cross-team collaboration and alignment difficult. If a team is penalized for assisting another, even for the company's overall benefit, then the [[importance_of_execution_and_output_in_product_management | execution]] problems will persist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:03">[01:09:03]</a>.
*   **Interpersonal Problems**  
    Sometimes, misalignment boils down to individual team managers not getting along. In such cases, no amount of process or meetings will fix the [[importance_of_execution_and_output_in_product_management | execution]] problem; coaching individuals through their differences is necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:55">[01:09:55]</a>.

### Identifying True Execution Problems

True [[importance_of_execution_and_output_in_product_management | execution]] problems are typically tangible issues such as outdated infrastructure leading to slow performance or outages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:01">[01:11:01]</a>, or significant skill gaps within a team, like a zero-to-one PM managing a mature, scaling initiative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:30">[01:11:30]</a>. A key sign that a perceived [[importance_of_execution_and_output_in_product_management | execution]] problem is actually a deeper issue is when "band-aids" (temporary solutions) are constantly applied but consistently fail, leading to the same problem recurring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:23">[01:12:23]</a>.

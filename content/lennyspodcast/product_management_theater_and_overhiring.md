Many companies overhired during the pandemic, leading to a surplus of roles that Marty Cagan refers to as "product management theater" and "product leadership theater" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. This phenomenon involves individuals in roles like agile coaches, product owners, and business analysts who are "dramatically overpaid for the value they provide" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a> because their function is often closer to project management than actual [[key_strategies_and_practices_for_effective_product_management_and_team_building | product management]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Drivers of Overhiring and Product Management Theater

Several converging factors have contributed to this situation:
*   **Pandemic Overhiring** Many companies significantly increased their workforce during the pandemic, sometimes lowering hiring bars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[01:00:00]</a>.
*   **Financial Changes** Increased cost of funds in the financial world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[01:02:02]</a>.
*   **Anticipated AI Impact** The predicted influence of generative AI creates uncertainty, with even some industry leaders suggesting against learning programming due to AI's potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>.
*   **Excessive Team Sizes** Especially outside Silicon Valley, team sizes have become "out of hand," leading to a realization that smaller teams can be more productive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>. This includes roles like agile coaches, Scrum Masters, various project managers, and "assistant product manager types" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>.
*   **Remote Work Challenges** While not fully returning to collocated teams, remote setups have impacted velocity and [[impact_in_product_management | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>.
*   **Overreliance on Processes** Companies, particularly outside the "Silicon Valley bubble," have heavily invested in processes like SAFe and often misunderstand simpler ones like Scrum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. This leads to high costs and little in the way of outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>.

## Feature Teams vs. Empowered Product Teams

The "dislike" of Product Managers (PMs) often stems from experiences with those who are not effective at the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>. This often occurs in "feature teams," which are distinct from "empowered product teams" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>.

### Feature Teams (Product Management Theater)
*   **Focus on Output:** Given a roadmap of features or projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a>.
*   **Role:** Primarily focused on designing, building, testing, and deploying features, often with strict dates and timelines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:25">[00:21:25]</a>.
*   **PM Role in this context:** More of a project management role, where a dedicated PM is not always needed, and engineers or designers might prefer to handle it themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a>. These individuals are often "dramatically overpaid for the value they provide" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:02">[00:20:02]</a>.
*   **Industry Sentiment:** This model contributes to the perception that PMs are unnecessary or ineffective, leading to a general dislike for the role in many companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>.

### Empowered Product Teams
*   **Focus on Outcomes:** Given customer or business problems to solve, with success measured by whether the problem is solved, not just by shipping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>.
*   **Role:** PMs on these teams are "creators, not facilitators" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:17">[00:25:17]</a>. They work alongside design and engineering to develop solutions that are not only usable and feasible, but also valuable and viable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>.
*   **Value Proposition:** This is where a "real" product manager is essential, as they bring specific skills (e.g., understanding customers, data analysis, market knowledge, business viability, compliance, monetization) that engineers and designers typically don't have <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:27">[00:23:27]</a>.

> "A product owner is one extreme and honestly that is a role in a delivery process that has no business being a dedicated person...an empowered product manager is on the other side of the spectrum" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:06">[00:28:06]</a>.

## Skills for a "Real" Product Manager

To be an effective product manager, focusing on value and viability is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:53">[00:24:53]</a>. Key skills include:
*   **User and Customer Expertise:** Deep understanding of users and customers, often gained through direct interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>. Marty Cagan was required to visit 30 customers in person before taking a PM role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">[00:26:05]</a>.
*   **Data Analysis:** Expertise in product usage data, its changes over time, and purchase patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:27">[00:26:27]</a>.
*   **Business Acumen:** Representing compliance, sales, marketing, financial cost, monetization, and legal constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:37">[00:26:37]</a>.
*   **Market Understanding:** Deep knowledge of the broader market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:18">[00:27:18]</a>.

These skills enable a PM to contribute at a level beyond merely administering a backlog in Jira <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:32">[00:27:32]</a>.

## The Reckoning and Opportunities for Growth

Many in "delivery team product owners and feature team product managers" are facing a "reckoning" as companies realize these roles are not what they thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:31">[00:29:31]</a>. Generative AI is expected to exacerbate this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:45">[00:29:45]</a>, particularly for "backlog administrator" or "feature team project manager" roles, which are vulnerable to automation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:50">[00:52:50]</a>.

However, individuals can "raise their game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:04">[00:32:04]</a> to become "real product managers." This involves developing the necessary skills, which can lead to appreciation and promotion within their companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:37">[00:31:37]</a>.

### Challenges in Learning and [[breaking_into_product_management | Breaking into Product Management]]
A significant challenge is that approximately 90% of online content and certifications related to product management propagate the "feature team world" model, which is often misaligned with the practices of successful product companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:34">[00:33:34]</a>. This creates a "self-propagating" issue where well-meaning individuals share ineffective practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:02">[00:36:02]</a>.

> "People need to take more control of their career and really use their judgment, try to figure out what do you want to be if you want to be in the product world, what do you want to be, what kind of a product manager do you want to be" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:26">[00:34:26]</a>.

[[interviewing_techniques_for_product_management | Critical thinking]] and diligent research are crucial for identifying good managers and understanding genuine product roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:16">[00:37:16]</a>.

## The Product Operating Model

Marty Cagan's new book, "Transformed," focuses on how companies can transition to a "product operating model" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:06">[00:56:06]</a>. This model represents a set of 20 principles consistently used by the best product companies, rather than a specific process or methodology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:01">[01:03:01]</a>.

Key aspects of the [[product_operations_and_scaling_product_management | Product Operating Model]] include:
*   **Strategic Decision Making:** Leaders define the product strategy and "big bets" (what problems to solve), while teams are empowered to find the best solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:02">[00:46:02]</a>. This is distinct from a "top-down" approach where teams are merely handed feature roadmaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:01">[00:45:01]</a>.
*   **Problem Solving:** Teams possess the skills for product discovery to create effective solutions that work for both customers and the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:46">[01:05:46]</a>.
*   **Delivery and Measurement:** Products are built, tested, and deployed reliably, with instrumentation to prove outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:02">[01:06:02]</a>. This often involves small, frequent, and uncoupled releases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:34">[01:09:34]</a>.

### Core Competencies in the Product Operating Model
*   **Product Manager:** A "serious" PM responsible for value and viability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>.
*   **Product Designer:** A "real" product designer covering service design, interaction design, visual design, and user research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:09">[01:07:09]</a>.
*   **Tech Lead:** An "incredibly important" role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:14">[00:54:14]</a>.
*   **Product Leader:** A manager of product, design, and engineering who coaches their people and develops real product strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:19">[01:07:19]</a>.

### Principles of the Product Operating Model
*   [[Impact in product management | Innovation]] is more important than predictability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:51">[01:08:51]</a>.
*   Learning is more important than failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:56">[01:08:56]</a>.
*   Principles are more important than process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:58">[01:08:58]</a>.
*   Teams are empowered with problems to solve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:05">[01:09:05]</a>.
*   Real ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:14">[01:09:14]</a>.
*   Addressing product risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:23">[01:09:23]</a>.
*   Embracing quick experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:26">[01:09:26]</a> and testing ideas responsibly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:29">[01:09:29]</a>.
*   Small, frequent, uncoupled releases (e.g., daily releases vs. quarterly) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:35">[01:09:35]</a>.
*   Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD), instrumentation, and monitoring of everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:40">[01:09:40]</a>.

## Product Ops and Founders

*   **Product Ops (Operations):** Distinct from the "product operating model," [[product_operations_and_scaling_product_management | Product Ops]] is analogous to DevOps or DesignOps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:57">[01:11:57]</a>. Its value comes from centralizing user research and data analysts to support product teams, acting as a small, high-leverage group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:15">[01:12:15]</a>. It becomes problematic when interpreted as "process and governance" or used to provide "assistants" to product managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:01">[01:13:01]</a>.
*   **Founders and PMs:** Founders should be cautious about hiring a PM too early. A "real" product manager's role (focusing on value and viability) is initially the founder's job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:29">[01:16:29]</a>. It's often more beneficial to hire a PM after achieving product-market fit or when the engineering team reaches a certain scale (e.g., 20-25 engineers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:03">[01:17:03]</a>.

## The [[the_future_of_product_management | Future of Product Management]]

The principles of an empowered product manager remain stable, but techniques are undergoing radical changes, especially with generative AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:01">[00:50:01]</a>. AI will likely disrupt skills related to backlog administration and basic project management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:01">[00:53:01]</a>. However, the core responsibilities of value and [[balancing_impact_execution_and_optics_in_product_management | viability]] will become even more critical, requiring deep understanding of ethical and legal implications of new technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:51">[00:53:51]</a>.# Product Management Theater and Overhiring

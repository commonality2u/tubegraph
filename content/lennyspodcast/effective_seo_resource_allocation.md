Many companies tend to under-resource Search Engine Optimization (SEO) while over-resourcing advertisements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. For large companies like Zillow or eBay that spend tens of millions on ads, it doesn't make sense to allocate only a fraction of that amount to SEO, especially when the potential traffic from SEO could be equivalent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## When to Invest in SEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>

Determining the right time and whether to invest in SEO as a growth channel depends on a few key attributes of a product or company:

### Addressable Market Size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>
A large addressable market is crucial for SEO success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. Most categories inherently possess a large market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. To assess this, one can examine product and audience competitors using tools like Similarweb. By looking at their total traffic, especially traffic by channel, a company can gauge its potential traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. The heuristic is to evaluate how much traffic competitors receive and then estimate conversion rates to compare potential sales with other channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>.

### Existing Authority and Traction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>
Google prefers to rank credible domains, making it too early for seed or Series A companies with little to no traction to significantly invest in SEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. Key signals of authority include:
*   **Non-SEO Traffic:** A minimum of approximately 1,000 daily visits from non-search channels (e.g., direct, paid, email, social) indicates credibility to Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.
*   **Referring Domains:** Aim for at least 1,000 referring domains linking to your site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>.
*   **Shares and Social Activity:** High engagement on social platforms contributes to authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:12">[01:10:12]</a>.
*   **Branded Search:** The number of times people search for your brand name directly on Google is an authority signal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:15">[01:10:15]</a>.

The more authority a company has, the easier and faster it can grow through SEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.

### Comparison to Other Channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:02">[00:23:02]</a>
Prioritize SEO by comparing its potential impact and scope against other growth channels like paid ads or social media, considering the associated costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>. If other channels are performing exceptionally well (e.g., paid ads, brand building), it might not be the immediate priority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:16">[00:23:16]</a>.

## Types of SEO Investment

There are three primary types of SEO where resources can be allocated:

### [[programmatic_vs_editorial_SEO|Programmatic SEO]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>
This involves automatically generating pages from a database of information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>. Examples include product pages on eBay or address pages on Zillow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a>. It often involves category pages (grids or lists of items) and item pages (single items) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>.
*   **Benefit:** No per-page cost for creation once the system is built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:03">[02:21:03]</a>.
*   **Challenge:** It's highly specialized and difficult to execute well, especially with complexities around indexation logic, clustering keywords, and handling user-generated content (UGC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:05">[00:46:05]</a>. This approach often requires a growth person with strong technical ability and prior experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:43">[00:47:43]</a>.

### [[programmatic_vs_editorial_SEO|Editorial SEO]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>
This refers to content manually written by a person, such as articles, guides, or listicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:29">[00:19:29]</a>. While programmatic SEO used to dominate, [[programmatic_vs_editorial_SEO|editorial SEO]] is increasingly driving more traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>.
*   **Benefit:** Always an opportunity if an addressable market exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:55">[02:20:55]</a>.
*   **Challenge:** Every page incurs a cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>. The main effort is not just writing, but strategically identifying topics, outlining comprehensive content (including subtopics), and ensuring factual accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:39">[00:54:39]</a>.

### Technical SEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>
This involves the underlying infrastructure, such as internal link architecture, redirects, and page speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:55">[00:19:55]</a>. While important for foundational health and bug fixing, it's not the primary driver for growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. A common misconception is to over-index on technical audits, which often yield a list of bugs rather than a growth strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.

## Hiring for SEO

When building an SEO team, the hiring strategy depends on the type of SEO being pursued, the company's stage, and budget:

*   **Programmatic SEO:** Requires highly specialized individuals with technical ability, ideally those who have demonstrated significant SEO growth at lesser-known companies (where it's harder to achieve) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:48">[00:47:48]</a>. These roles involve architectural planning, taxonomy creation, and working with engineers to build scalable systems for content generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:22">[00:49:22]</a>.
*   **Editorial SEO:** Can be effectively handled by a "young and hungry" person with a good workflow and the right tools, even if they don't have prior SEO expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:48">[00:46:48]</a>. Their role involves identifying high-potential topics, creating comprehensive outlines for writers, managing content publishing, and analyzing results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:05">[00:56:05]</a>. The minimum viable team for editorial SEO is one SEO person and one writer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:27">[00:59:27]</a>.

## Overcoming Obstacles to Effective Resource Allocation

A significant challenge in SEO is getting recommendations launched, as many strategies fail to materialize due to resource constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:31">[01:06:31]</a>.

### Integrating SEO with Product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:09">[01:07:09]</a>
Often, SEO is siloed from the core product organization, despite many SEO changes being product changes. Adopting a [[productled_approach_to_SEO|product-led SEO]] model, where SEO is integrated into product development and prioritized at the executive level, is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:17">[01:07:17]</a>.

### Long-Term Investment and Early Signals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:21">[00:40:21]</a>
SEO is a long-term investment, typically showing results in six to nine months for new sites, though larger, more authoritative sites may see changes within weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:51">[00:40:51]</a>.
*   **Early Indicators:** Look for pages ranking at least in position 20 or higher, even if clicks are low. As Google tests pages on less popular keywords, higher engagement (click-through rate and time on page) leads to exponential growth and ranking for more competitive terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:39">[00:42:39]</a>.
*   **Avoid False Negatives:** It's common for initial SEO attempts to fail due to incorrect implementation rather than a lack of opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:42">[00:43:42]</a>. Perseverance and iterative adjustments are key.

## Key SEO Concepts for Resource Allocation

### [[importance_of_internal_links_and_topical_authority_in_SEO|Topical Authority]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:01">[01:09:01]</a>
Beyond traditional PageRank (links), Google now assesses a site's authority based on a broader range of signals including non-SEO traffic, social shares, and branded searches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:52">[01:09:52]</a>. Crucially, this authority is *topical*, meaning Google prioritizes sites that are disproportionately known for specific themes or narrow expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:26">[01:10:26]</a>. Focusing on a specific niche and building deep expertise there can allow a company to outrank larger competitors with more overall domain authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:04">[01:13:04]</a>.

### [[importance_of_internal_links_and_topical_authority_in_SEO|Internal Links]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:44">[01:16:44]</a>
A significant, often under-optimized lever is internal link architecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:19">[01:18:19]</a>. Google crawls sites via links, and pages with more internal links typically receive more traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:41">[01:17:41]</a>. Many sites have a power curve where a small percentage of pages receive most links, leaving many pages with insufficient links (ideally at least 5-10 per page) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:17">[01:20:17]</a>. Spreading links more evenly and ensuring a "flat graph" structure (few hops from crawl points) can lead to significant traffic increases (25% or more) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:07">[01:22:07]</a>. It's important to note that body links (within content) are more impactful than navigation or footer links <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:50">[01:22:50]</a>.

## [[Impact of AI on SEO|Impact of AI on SEO]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:49">[01:24:49]</a>

While AI tools like GPT-3 can generate grammatically correct sentences, their use for content generation is generally not recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>. The primary issue is the lack of underlying wisdom or factual accuracy, leading to content that is not genuinely useful or truthful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:35">[01:25:35]</a>.

However, [[impact_of_AI_on_SEO|AI is highly useful for other SEO tasks]]:
*   **Data Analysis:** AI excels at extracting structure from data, clustering keywords into topics, identifying subtopics, and assessing topical authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:50">[01:27:50]</a>.
*   **Workflow Optimization:** AI can help in deciding which topics to write about, generating outlines, and analyzing performance, allowing human domain experts to focus on writing high-quality, truthful content based on that structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:33">[01:27:33]</a>.

## First Steps for Startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:31">[01:28:31]</a>

For a startup considering SEO investment, the initial steps should be:
1.  **Assess Addressable Market Size:** Determine if the market is large enough by analyzing product and audience competitors' traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:46">[01:28:46]</a>.
2.  **Evaluate Current Authority:** Check existing non-SEO traffic and the number of referring domains to gauge the company's current traction and ability to compete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:57">[01:28:57]</a>.
3.  **Prioritize Against Other Channels:** Compare the potential ROI of SEO with other growth opportunities and allocate resources strategically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:09">[01:29:09]</a>.

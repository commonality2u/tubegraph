Claire Hughes Johnson's book, "Scaling People," emphasizes that effective management and company building start with the individual, rather than solely focusing on the product, team, or company structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:51">[00:26:51]</a>. For founders and managers, [[the_personal_development_of_a_founder_and_leadership_lessons | personal development]] is foundational.

## Personal Operating Principles

Claire identifies personal operating principles as core to one's effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:36">[00:28:36]</a>. These principles provide a framework for how an individual operates, especially in leadership roles.

### 1. Build Self-Awareness to Build Mutual Awareness

The first and most fundamental principle is [[importance_of_feedback_and_selfawareness_in_career_growth | self-awareness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:53">[00:27:53]</a>. To succeed in company building or management, it is crucial to understand one's own motivators, strengths, blind spots, and tendencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:01">[00:28:01]</a>. By actively seeking feedback and openly sharing these insights with others, individuals can become significantly more effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:15">[00:28:15]</a>.

#### Crystallizing Personal Values
To develop [[importance_of_feedback_and_selfawareness_in_career_growth | self-awareness]], an exercise involves identifying core personal values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:17">[00:29:17]</a>. Start with a broad list of values (e.g., family, ambition, impact, competition, education, integrity) and narrow them down to a crucial few, ideally three <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:29">[00:29:29]</a>. Discussing these choices with a trusted colleague or mentor can help clarify why these values are paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:10">[00:30:10]</a>.

It is particularly impactful to associate a personal story with each core value, illustrating how past experiences have shaped its significance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:34">[00:30:34]</a>. For example, Claire recounts a manager whose strong value of transparency stemmed from a childhood experience where crucial information about his mother's illness was withheld <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:50">[00:30:50]</a>. Such formative experiences can shape one's operating principles for life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:31">[00:31:31]</a>.

#### Understanding Work Style Tendencies
Beyond values, understanding work style tendencies contributes to [[importance_of_feedback_and_selfawareness_in_career_growth | self-awareness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>. Tools like Myers-Briggs, DISC, and Enneagram can provide data points on aspects such as introversion/extroversion and task/people orientation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:11">[00:32:11]</a>. Plotting these tendencies alongside personal values helps to define one's unique operating style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:05">[00:33:05]</a>.

### 2. Say the Thing You Think You Cannot Say

This principle encourages direct and open communication, even when it feels uncomfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:25">[00:33:25]</a>. Often, what feels like a significant strength (e.g., directness) can also be a blind spot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:31">[00:33:31]</a>.

Tactical advice for saying uncomfortable things:
*   **Detoxify the "left-hand column":** Acknowledge internal commentary but reframe it constructively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:17">[00:35:17]</a>.
*   **Ask questions:** Questions are less threatening and invite dialogue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:34">[00:35:34]</a>.
*   **Own your observations:** Frame feedback as "your observation" or "your perception" rather than a judgment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:47">[00:35:47]</a>. For example, instead of "You botched that interview," say, "I wonder if you missed an opportunity in that interview" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:57">[00:35:57]</a>.
*   **Act as an explorer, not a lecturer:** A manager's role is to enable team members, not just dictate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:09">[00:38:09]</a>. Engage in curious exploration, asking questions about observed patterns and inviting the other person's perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:11">[00:38:11]</a>. This approach can be used for "hypothesis-based coaching," where initial data leads to an observation to be explored with the individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:51">[00:38:51]</a>.

### 3. Distinguish Between Being a Leader and a Manager

Early in her career, Claire struggled to differentiate between these two roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:26">[00:34:26]</a>. This distinction is crucial for effective [[the_personal_development_of_a_founder_and_leadership_lessons | leadership lessons]]. Reid Hoffman, for example, self-identified as more of a leader than a manager, valuing the creation of an environment for open feedback and trusting his team to provide direct critiques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:51">[00:41:51]</a>. The ability to receive candid feedback, even harsh, demonstrates a strong foundation of trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:04">[00:42:04]</a>.

### 4. Come Back to the Operating System

This principle emphasizes creating stability amidst chaos in high-growth environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:15">[00:44:15]</a>. By establishing rituals and common, shared practices, such as quarterly goals or specific planning processes, organizations can maintain a sense of order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:54">[00:44:54]</a>. This consistent "Cadence" provides a predictable framework that teams can rely on, even when other aspects of the business are in flux <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:11">[00:45:11]</a>.

As one's career scales and responsibilities grow to include multiple functions, having a common operating system for managing diverse teams becomes essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:04">[00:46:04]</a>. This standard approach across different areas helps leaders maintain stability and focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:37">[00:46:37]</a>.

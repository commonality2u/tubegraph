Facing setbacks is a common, though often uncomfortable, part of a professional journey. Ethan Evans, a former Vice President at Amazon, shares his insights and personal experiences on [[lessons_from_failures_and_the_importance_of_persistence | overcoming significant failures]] and how to grow from them to achieve [[leadership_principles_and_career_success | career success]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:14">[01:14:14]</a>.

## A High-Stakes Failure at Amazon
Evans recounted a critical failure during his time at Amazon when he was responsible for launching the Amazon App Store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:07">[00:41:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:10">[00:41:10]</a>. The launch involved a personal letter from Jeff Bezos emphasizing a unique "test drive" feature, which allowed users to try an app in a web browser simulator before downloading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:50">[00:41:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:13">[00:42:13]</a>. On launch day, the system wasn't working, despite the team working all night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:31">[00:42:31]</a>. Bezos, expecting the letter to go live at 6:00 a.m. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:58">[00:42:58]</a>, quickly escalated the issue, expressing frustration and anger about a database problem that went against Amazon's push to eliminate Oracle databases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:38">[00:43:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:45">[00:43:45]</a>. This led to a "snowballing" effect, with other senior leaders joining the angry email thread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:58">[00:43:58]</a>.

## Key Steps to Navigate a Crisis
In the face of such a high-pressure situation, Evans implemented several strategies that proved crucial for [[lessons_from_failures_and_the_importance_of_persistence | recovery]]:

*   **Ownership**: The first step was to "own it," clearly stating that the problem was his fault and he would deal with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:28">[00:44:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:34">[00:44:34]</a>.
*   **Proactive Communication**: Evans began providing frequent updates (hourly) on the situation, detailing current status, immediate plans, and when the next update would be provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:39">[00:44:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:13">[00:45:13]</a>. This helped rebuild trust by showing that the team was "on it" and prevented micromanagement from higher levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:12">[00:51:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:24">[00:51:24]</a>.
*   **Leveraging Support**: Other leaders, understanding the severity of the situation, reached out to offer assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:20">[00:45:20]</a>. AWS principal engineers were brought in to address the database issue, providing a temporary solution of 500 AWS machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:47">[00:45:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:21">[00:46:21]</a>.
*   **Face-to-Face Engagement**: Despite the tension, Evans intentionally sat next to Bezos at a subsequent meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:18">[00:48:18]</a>. This deliberate move allowed for a human conversation, which helped in rebuilding their relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:55">[00:48:55]</a>. Face-to-face interaction makes it harder for individuals to maintain an "angry and flamy" demeanor compared to email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:18">[00:49:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:39">[00:51:39]</a>.

## Long-Term Lessons and Mindset Shifts
From this experience, Evans derived several crucial [[lessons_from_failures_and_the_importance_of_persistence | lessons]]:

*   **You Can Recover from Any Hole**: Despite publicly failing the CEO, Evans was promoted to Vice President two years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:44">[00:49:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:25">[00:50:25]</a>. This demonstrates that even significant mistakes are not career-ending if managed correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:02">[00:53:02]</a>.
*   **Combating Impostor Syndrome**: Many professionals fear that one big mistake will expose their perceived incompetence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:47">[00:52:47]</a>. Evans's story shows that even a "huge mistake" can be overcome, highlighting that everyone makes mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:02">[00:53:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:54">[00:55:54]</a>.
*   **"Fear The New York Times Headline"**: As a leader in a large, public company, it became essential to anticipate potential negative public attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:51">[00:56:51]</a>. This meant prioritizing careful planning over speed if there was a risk of major public failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:16">[00:57:16]</a>.
*   **Prioritize Reliability Over Surprise Launches**: Amazon historically favored "surprise launches" to avoid "vaporware" accusations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:55">[00:57:55]</a>. However, Evans learned that surprise launches risk being "surprised by what doesn't work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:21">[00:58:21]</a>. Shifting to beta testing, even with the risk of leaks, is a better outcome than launching a flawed product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:38">[00:58:38]</a>.

## The Importance of Ownership
Evans was instrumental in drafting one of Amazon's 14 core [[leadership_principles_and_career_success | leadership principles]], specifically "Ownership" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:51">[01:00:51]</a>. He proposed the impactful phrase: "An owner never says that's not my job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:27">[01:02:27]</a>. This principle emphasizes taking responsibility beyond one's immediate role and thinking like a proprietor of the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:52">[01:02:52]</a>. This experience of proposing language that was adopted globally underscores the potential for individuals to influence large organizations if their ideas are strong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:02">[01:06:02]</a>.

## Impact on Team and Avoiding Shame
A significant regret for Evans was not adequately supporting the new college graduate engineer who wrote the buggy code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:52">[00:59:52]</a>. While no one explicitly blamed the engineer, the individual knew it was their bug and left the company after the incident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:59">[00:59:59]</a>.

> [!warning] Lesson Learned
> It's crucial to reassure team members that mistakes happen and that the system failed them, not just their individual effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:35">[00:59:35]</a>. Leaders must prevent team members from feeling undue responsibility or shame, as it can lead to losing valuable talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:20">[01:00:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:28">[01:00:28]</a>.

Evans emphasizes that a mindset of "I'm not going to live in shame about it" is key to navigating mistakes and continuing to move forward in one's [[building_a_meaningful_career | career]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:32">[00:55:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:47">[00:55:47]</a>.

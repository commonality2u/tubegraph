Shopify, a company initially known for its strong in-person [[company_culture_and_remote_work | company culture]] and meticulously designed office spaces, made a pivotal decision to transition to a permanent remote-first model during the COVID-19 pandemic. This shift was not merely a reaction to external circumstances but a calculated move rooted in the company's core philosophy of [[Productivity and innovation in remote work environments | first-principles thinking]] and maximizing human potential.

### The Evolution to Remote-First
Before the pandemic, Shopify had invested significantly in creating collaborative physical environments, even open-sourcing their floor plans to share insights on building great office spaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:18">[00:38:18]</a>. The company's co-founder, Daniel Debow, provided significant energy towards this effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:35">[00:38:35]</a>.

However, even prior to COVID-19, the company was experiencing the challenges of growth that strained its in-person model. Starting in Ottawa, Canada, a city of a million people, Shopify found that the local talent pool was not deep enough to support its expansion to 10,000 employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>. The company had already spread across four or five cities, attempting to adhere to similar time zones, leading to an "awkward hybrid" model where many meetings were held with individuals in different offices, often with only one person physically present in a room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:48">[00:41:48]</a>. This scenario, where "only good decisions" were made along the way, inadvertently led to a suboptimal "local maxima" in their location strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:29">[00:42:29]</a>.

### The Catalyst for Change
The onset of COVID-19, and the universal "shelter-in-place" mandates, acted as a fundamental "Boolean flip" in Shopify's decision-making framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:58">[00:38:58]</a>. This change invalidated a core assumption—that people *could* leave their homes and work in an office—triggering a re-evaluation of their entire operational structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:07">[00:39:07]</a>.

Concurrently, Shopify experienced explosive growth as local businesses turned to e-commerce to survive the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:03">[00:43:03]</a>. To meet this demand and help small businesses, Shopify needed to "staff up" significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:28">[00:43:28]</a>. The question then became: where to find this talent? The optimal solution was to hire people "everywhere" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:33">[00:43:33]</a>. This solidified the decision to go "remote only forever," recognizing that while it would be "way harder" to build a remote company, it represented a "better set of trade-offs for the Shopify of the future" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:46">[00:43:46]</a>.

The company's leadership believed that the difficulty of building a fully remote company was a challenge worth pursuing, especially given the potential for "amazing cultures that can be put together purely remote," as seen in communities like Wikipedia or World of Warcraft raiding guilds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:26">[00:44:26]</a>.

### The "Internet into a Company" Philosophy
Rather than attempting to "port the office online," Shopify's approach was to "port the internet into a company" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:53">[00:44:53]</a>. This philosophy underscored a commitment to leveraging the internet's inherent distributed and asynchronous nature to redefine how work is done, rather than simply replicating existing office structures in a digital format.

This decision was aligned with a broader principle: if something is being done a certain way, it's often worth questioning that approach by default. Toby Lütke, Shopify's CEO, states, "if most people are doing it a certain way, I by default don't want to do it that way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:37">[00:31:37]</a>. This ethos of challenging the status quo and thinking from [[Productivity and innovation in remote work environments | first principles]] is a cornerstone of Shopify's innovative management strategies.

In essence, the move to remote-first at Shopify was a strategic re-derivation of their operational model based on evolving foundational assumptions, the need to scale talent acquisition globally, and a deep conviction that a remote model offered the most optimal path for the company's long-term mission of making entrepreneurship more common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:49">[01:04:49]</a>.

Vikhram Dhami, Head of Product at Gojek, is recognized as one of Asia's most prominent product leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:09">[01:09:09]</a>. He oversees product management, design, program management, research, and insights for teams across India, Singapore, and Indonesia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:39">[00:54:39]</a>. Dhami has developed a [[frameworks_for_growth_in_product_management | career growth framework for product managers]] known as the "Three W's" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. This framework aims to guide [[career_development_for_product_owners_and_managers | product managers' career development]] and address common pitfalls that impede growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:02">[00:33:02]</a>.

The Three W's are:
1.  **What you produce** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>
2.  **What you bring to the table** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>
3.  **What's your operating model** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>

## The Three W's Explained

### What You Produce
Early in a product manager's [[career_development_for_product_owners_and_managers | career]], the focus should be on *outputs* rather than immediate impact or grand strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>. Outputs are tangible deliverables that can be quickly executed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:17">[00:30:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:47">[00:50:47]</a>.

Examples of outputs include:
*   Launching a product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>
*   Analyzing and running experiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>
*   Contributing to a go-to-market strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>
*   Preparing briefs, slides for leadership reviews, or legal reviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>
*   Ensuring Jira storyboards are well-described <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>

As product managers become more senior, they transition to owning *outcomes*, which relate to product area goals and collaboration with stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. Even at senior levels, it's crucial not to forget individual contributor (IC) roots and be willing to "pull up your sleeves" and work on outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. The principle is to be useful and make the team more effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>.

### What You Bring to the Table
This aspect focuses on a product manager's "impact on impact" â€“ demonstrating how they contribute to successful outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>. It's about the quality of the artifacts produced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>.

Key artifacts and skills to demonstrate:
*   **Product Requirements Documents (PRDs)**: Ensuring high quality and deriving from strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>
*   **Product Notes**: Crafting notes for care and marketing teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>
*   **Data and Metrics**: Working with data, metrics, and experiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>
*   **Design and Research**: Providing clear briefs to design teams, identifying user problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">[00:22:22]</a>
*   **Technology Skills**: Understanding technical aspects and engaging in deep debates about technology design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:42">[00:54:42]</a>
*   **Strategy**: Collaborating on and articulating product strategy, focusing on *how* to achieve business goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:32">[00:55:32]</a>

Product managers should channel questions and inputs into strategic choices rather than simply pushing back or debating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:11">[00:23:11]</a>. The aim is to create an "aura of 'I got this'" where colleagues trust that tasks handled by the product manager will be done well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>.

### What's Your Operating Model
This element emphasizes effective communication, collaboration, and organizational and community skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:04">[00:52:04]</a>.

Three key tenets for product managers working with others:
1.  **Raise difficult issues without being difficult to work with.** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a> This involves bringing the conversation to a logical space, rather than an emotional one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:53">[00:25:53]</a>.
2.  **Bring out important topics without drawing importance to yourself.** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:48">[00:20:48]</a>
3.  **Be able to get decisions made without having to make all the decisions yourself.** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a> The PM's role is to ensure decisions are made and the team isn't blocked by "stupid" work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:10">[00:25:10]</a>.

The product manager is often seen as the "community enabler" within the team and organization, tying everyone together towards a common mission, especially crucial in remote or distributed teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:26">[00:52:26]</a>.

## Impediments to Career Growth

Vikhram highlights three mindset shifts that can hinder a product manager's [[career_development_for_product_owners_and_managers | career growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:02">[00:30:02]</a>:

1.  **Focusing on things beyond your control**: As PMs become more senior, they often shift their focus from their own learning and growth to external factors like organizational strategy or stakeholder behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:45">[00:28:45]</a>. It's vital to maintain focus on what is within your control, such as improving skills in data, technology, communication, and collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:08">[00:29:08]</a>.
2.  **Relationship with change**: Early in a career, the rate of skill acquisition and growth is high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:07">[00:30:07]</a>. However, this "rate of change" can slow down at mid-senior levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:41">[00:30:41]</a>. To counter this, product managers should constantly benchmark themselves against industry bests to identify areas for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:09">[00:31:09]</a>.
3.  **How you see yourself**: Self-told stories or labels (e.g., "high agency PM," "hyper-collaborative PM") can inadvertently excuse deficiencies in other areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a>. Recognizing and correcting these stories is crucial for getting back on a [[career_development_for_product_owners_and_managers | growth path]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:34">[00:33:34]</a>. Embracing a "learner" mindset is an enabling story to tell oneself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:51">[00:35:51]</a>.

## Improving Product Management Skills

To foster [[improving_product_management_skills | skill development]] and [[product_manager_skill_development | product manager skill development]], Vikhram recommends:

*   **Being open to feedback**: Viewing feedback as a gift, even when it's difficult to hear, is essential for continuous improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:47">[00:39:47]</a>.
*   **Strategic focus on skill development**: Product managers cannot improve every area simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:03">[00:39:03]</a>. Identify areas that offer maximum leverage for growth and focus on them sequentially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:09">[00:39:09]</a>.
    *   For those [[getting_into_and_growing_in_product_management | transitioning into product management]], especially from a design/research background, focus on data or technology skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:22">[00:41:22]</a>. If coming from data/tech, focus on design/research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:27">[00:41:27]</a>. Once proficiency is demonstrated in two of these three, then focus on strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:40]</a>.
    *   Softer skills like communication, collaboration, and community engagement are lifelong learning areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>.
*   **Embracing practice**: Product management is a discipline that improves with practice. While there's a "science" to it (frameworks, methods), there's also an "art" that is honed through experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:32">[00:48:32]</a>.

## Understanding the Product Manager Role

The product manager role is often ambiguous, with varying definitions across companies and even within different teams of the same company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:56">[00:46:56]</a>. When stakeholders ask if a product manager is expected to do something, the general answer is: "If this is something which is blocking the progress on the product, then yes, the product manager should work on that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:06">[00:48:06]</a>.

The product manager serves as the "co-collaborator" for all key disciplines: strategy, technology, design, and data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:52">[00:49:52]</a>. They are the only role that pairs with everyone else, providing a unique holistic insight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:06">[00:50:06]</a>. It's about playing a "role" that enhances the team's overall contribution and energy, rather than strictly adhering to a job title <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:20">[00:51:20]</a>.

### Essential [[skills_for_modern_product_managers | Skills for Modern Product Managers]]

Vikhram identifies eight key axes of skills that product managers are evaluated on and should continually develop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:31">[00:38:31]</a>:

*   **Data & Metrics**: From defining basic metrics to being a "ninja-level" data expert capable of sophisticated analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:50">[00:53:50]</a>.
*   **Design & Research**: From identifying user problems to tying them to business goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:21">[00:54:21]</a>.
*   **Technology Skills**: From basic understanding of concepts like HTTP/API to engaging in deep technical debates and writing design documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:42">[00:54:42]</a>.
*   **Strategy**: From relying on others for direction to articulating a coherent product strategy that defines *how* to achieve defined business objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:19">[00:55:19]</a>.
*   **Communication**: Effectively conveying ideas and information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>.
*   **Collaboration**: Working effectively with diverse stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>.
*   **Organizational Skills**: Managing tasks, processes, and team dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:13">[00:19:13]</a>.
*   **Community Skills**: Building and fostering a sense of shared mission within the team and organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:55">[00:52:55]</a>.

## Contrarian Views

Vikhram shares two personal beliefs that might be considered contrarian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:02">[00:57:02]</a>:

*   **Intent is not enough**: While good intentions are important, they must be reflected in actions, behavior, and communication. How you say something and how you collaborate is as crucial as your underlying intention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:13">[00:57:13]</a>.
*   **Effort and hours matter**: Despite recent trends suggesting otherwise, putting in significant effort and hours is still essential for personal and [[career_development_for_product_owners_and_managers | career growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:16">[00:58:16]</a>. This doesn't endorse workaholism but emphasizes the necessity of dedication to skill improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:51">[00:58:51]</a>.

Ultimately, Vikhram's overarching motto is "it's never too late" to pursue what you want to do and be, emphasizing continuous learning and adaptability throughout one's [[career_development_for_product_owners_and_managers | career]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:47">[01:08:47]</a>.

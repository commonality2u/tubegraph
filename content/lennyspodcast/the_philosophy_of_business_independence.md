The philosophy of business independence champions a divergent path from the conventional venture capital (VC) route, emphasizing self-sufficiency, long-term sustainability, and a different definition of success. At its core, this approach suggests that financial independence allows a company to control its own destiny, free from external pressures and expectations.

## Why Choose Independence?

For entrepreneurs, starting a business by [[the_benefits_of_bootstrapping_a_business|bootstrapping]] offers more practice in making money, which is the fundamental skill for any successful business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This contrasts sharply with the prevailing industry narrative of "go big or go home," raising substantial capital to achieve "unicorn status" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. The reality is that "almost nobody makes it that way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

Choosing independence, or bootstrapping, can be "much more fulfilling and fun and even much more lucrative" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:37">[01:37:37]</a>. For companies like 37signals, co-founded by Jason Fried, having no investors means all profits filter down to the founders and employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>.

While some businesses, such as those building cars, opening restaurants, or requiring significant hardware, may need external capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a>, software businesses typically do not. Software margins "should be close to 80 or 90%" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:17:00">[08:17:00]</a>. However, the VC model often leads to these profitable businesses becoming "the least profitable" due to excessive spending on staff and customer acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a>.

Independence also allows for:
*   **Freedom and Autonomy** – Companies can "do what we want to do" and are not beholden to external demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>.
*   **Playing Infinite Games** – The focus shifts from a finite goal (like an acquisition or IPO) to a continuous journey of building and improving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>.
*   **A "Stay Up" Mentality** – While starting a business is relatively easy, staying in business is harder and should be celebrated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>. This also means being comfortable with plateaus in growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>.
*   **Scrappiness and Discipline** – When there's "no big cushion of millions sitting in the bank" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>, companies are forced to "figure out how to make money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:53">[01:17:53]</a> and remain efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:37">[01:37:37]</a>.

## Characteristics of Independent Businesses: The 37signals Model

37signals, the company behind Basecamp and HEY, embodies the independent business philosophy:
*   **Structure:** They have no investors, no board, and no plans to go public or sell the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>.
*   **Profitability:** They have been profitable for 24 consecutive years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>, generating "double-digit million dollar profits" annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>.
*   **Scale:** With over 100,000 customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a> and a relatively small team of around 75 employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:00">[06:09:00]</a>, they operate with a focus on efficiency rather than aggressive growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>.
*   **Product Strategy:** They maintain a simple product offering, for example, Basecamp has one price for unlimited users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. This simplifies development and support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.
*   **Target Market:** They focus on the "Fortune Five Million," catering to small and medium-sized businesses rather than just large enterprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>.
*   **Decision-Making:** [[The art of decisionmaking and intuition in business|Decisions are often driven by instinct and gut feeling]], rather than rigid data analysis or long-term planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>. This is encapsulated in the quote, "I don't plan long term because I want to do what I think not what I thought" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.
*   **Work Culture:** They advocate that [[Building an Entrepreneurial Culture|work doesn't have to feel like war]], discouraging the use of military metaphors in business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>. Instead, the focus is on "pride and excitement and and and a spirit of of creation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>.
*   **[[Staying lean and efficient in business|Operating Principles]]:** [[Importance of personal and company operating principles|Constraints]] such as small teams and limited cash "often lead to better outcomes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>. They employ a development framework called "Shape Up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>, where projects are undertaken by two-person teams (one programmer, one designer) with a maximum "appetite" of six weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>. These "cycles" are followed by two-week cool-down periods to prevent burnout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>.

## The Evolution of Independence: "Once" Products

Despite the success of Basecamp and HEY, 37signals is launching a new line of "Once" products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>. This marks a significant shift, as Jason Fried initially thought the company would be satisfied focusing on a single product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>. This change reflects a renewed desire to "make more things again" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>, embracing a [[thinking_creatively_in_business|philosophical approach to product development]] that prioritizes novelty and exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:51">[01:30:51]</a>.

"Once" products challenge the dominant Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model. These will be non-SaaS software products that users "download, pay for once, and then install on their own server" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>. The goal is to provide high-quality, simple, "essential generics" that focus on the core 80% of functionality, rather than feature bloat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. The first "Once" product will be a relaunch of their old group chat tool, Campfire, as an alternative to expensive monthly subscriptions for chat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>. These products also provide the code, allowing users to modify and tweak the software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>.

## Advice for Aspiring Independent Entrepreneurs

The core advice for those embarking on an independent business path is to "stay as small as you can for as long as you can" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>. Control costs, do as much work as possible yourself, and avoid unnecessary expenses like elaborate branding or office space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>.

Finally, an independent business owner should always aim to "make more money than we spend" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:32:00">[06:32:00]</a>, have "good healthy margins" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:00">[06:35:00]</a>, and "enjoy ourselves" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:00">[06:42:00]</a>. The ultimate success criterion is simple: "Do you want to do that again?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>. As Jason Fried's father famously advised, "no one ever went broke making a profit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.

HubSpot co-founder and CTO, Dharmesh Shah, is known for his "zig when everyone else is zagging" approach to business, which involves making "high conviction, low consensus bets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This means being right about something others believe you are wrong about for a long time, enabling a unique competitive advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:47:00">[28:47:00]</a>.

### Core Principles of Contrarianism

Shah emphasizes the importance of making conscious, well-reasoned decisions that go against conventional wisdom. This involves:

*   **Questioning Norms** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:05:00">[51:05:00]</a>: Always consider alternative paths, even if they seem unconventional. It's crucial to understand what the "zig" would have been, even if you decide not to pursue it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:23:00">[51:23:00]</a>.
*   **Limiting Contrarian Dimensions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:36:00">[28:36:00]</a>: While embracing contrarian ideas, a company should not reinvent everything. There's a balance between being unique and leveraging established best practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:07:00">[30:07:00]</a>.

### Examples of Contrarian Strategies at HubSpot

HubSpot's journey is rich with examples of defying traditional business norms:

*   **Organizational Structure**
    *   **No Direct Reports** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>: As CTO, Shah has never had a direct report in 18 years at HubSpot, including from day one, and does not conduct one-on-one meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>. This decision was based on his self-assessment of not being proficient at management and choosing to [[practical_application_of_strategic_thinking_in_business | lean into his strengths]] (startup guy, product/engineering) rather than spending years becoming "passively okay" at management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:08:00">[17:08:00]</a>. This allowed him to "get all the upside of scale... without the downsides of scale" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:17:00">[18:17:00]</a>.
    *   **Flexible Work Hours** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:42:00">[27:42:00]</a>: Founders, being "night people," initially implemented a "no meetings before 11 AM" rule for the first few years, later allowing meetings without their presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:19:00">[19:19:00]</a>. Similarly, for much of HubSpot's history, the company did not care about specific work hours, though this was adapted for teams like support where coverage is critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:42:00">[27:42:00]</a>.
    *   **Salary Flatness** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:56:00">[32:56:00]</a>: In the early days, everyone, including the founders, was paid a flat $5,000 per month for about 18 months to promote simplicity and avoid complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:56:00">[32:56:00]</a>.
    *   **Seating Lottery** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:25:00">[35:25:00]</a>: To avoid office politics and simplify decision-making around seating, HubSpot initially implemented a "seat shuffle" lottery every time a new employee was hired. This evolved into quarterly shuffles, with local optimizations for team needs (e.g., engineers needing quiet) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:25:00">[35:25:00]</a>.

*   **Going Public**
    *   **Embracing IPO** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:45:00">[20:45:00]</a>: Shah advocates for companies to go public, countering the common apprehension among founders. He argues that while there's an administrative "tax," being public offers transparency in valuation and allows a broader set of stakeholders (customers, partners, general public) to [[alternative_paths_to_business_success_compared_to_traditional_venture_capital | participate in the company's growth]] and wealth creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:45:00">[20:45:00]</a>.
    *   **Radical Transparency with Insiders** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:54:00">[24:54:00]</a>: HubSpot maintained its core value of transparency even after going public. During the IPO process, they discovered there was no legal limit to the number of "designated insiders" who could access sensitive financials. HubSpot designated every single employee as an insider, allowing them to continue sharing all financials with everyone, all the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:54:00">[24:54:00]</a>. This also showcases [[challenges_in_building_valuesaligned_businesses | challenges in building values-aligned businesses]].

*   **Market Strategy: Focus on SMB** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:12:00">[29:12:00]</a>
    *   From day one, HubSpot committed to focusing on the Small and Medium Business (SMB) market, a "high conviction, low consensus bet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:12:00">[29:12:00]</a>.
    *   This was considered difficult due to challenges in scaling to SMBs, their traditional nature, and lower individual customer value compared to enterprise clients. Raising capital for an SMB-focused company was challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:51:00">[45:51:00]</a>.
    *   However, Shah argues that SMB offers the best of both worlds: revenue generation like enterprise software and millions of potential customers like consumer products, without revenue concentration or long sales cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:27:00">[47:27:00]</a>.
    *   He also points out "reverse gravity" in the software market: companies often get pulled up-market to serve larger customers. By focusing on SMB, HubSpot avoids direct competition with most successful software companies that eventually become enterprise-focused, creating a niche of "people stupid enough to stay focused on SMB" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:07:00">[49:07:00]</a>.

*   **Product Strategy: Wide, Not Deep** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:30:00">[51:30:00]</a>
    *   Contrary to common startup advice to focus on one thing and be world-class, HubSpot decided to build a broad "all-in-one" product from year one, encompassing SEO tools, web analytics, and blogging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:30:00">[51:30:00]</a>.
    *   The contrarian insight was that SMBs didn't lack individual tools; they lacked the ability to integrate and manage many disparate tools. HubSpot aimed to solve the "actual customer problem" of fragmentation, even if it meant being "many miles wide and only so inches deep" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:10:00">[52:10:00]</a>.
    *   A surprising metric for this strategy was: if HubSpot was in the top three in any individual product category, it meant they had invested *too much* in that category. Their value proposition was the integrated solution, not the best individual component <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:12:00">[53:12:00]</a>. This illustrates a unique approach to [[differentiation_versus_lowcost_strategy | differentiation versus low-cost strategy]].

*   **Fighting Complexity (Second Law of Thermodynamics)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:33:00">[37:33:00]</a>
    *   Shah believes that all leaders and businesses are constantly fighting the second law of thermodynamics, meaning "over time, unless you intervene, everything goes to crap" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:00:00">[38:00:00]</a>. This means complexity increases over time, leading to slower operations and eventual decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:01:00">[39:01:00]</a>. This is a key [[challenges_in_strategy_implementation | challenge in strategy implementation]].
    *   HubSpot's cultural principle is "fight for simplicity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:53:00">[39:53:00]</a>.
    *   **Product Feature Rule**: For a time, HubSpot had a rule that every new "knob or dial" (feature) added to the product required removing another one to maintain simplicity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:58:00">[40:58:00]</a>. This forces product teams to consider the long-term "dimensional complexity" that each new feature adds, beyond just implementation and maintenance costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:36:00">[42:36:00]</a>.

*   **Culture as a Product** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:28">[01:21:28]</a>
    *   HubSpot views culture as a product built for their team, not something static to be preserved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:35">[01:21:35]</a>.
    *   This means actively iterating on culture, just like a product, by gathering feedback (e.g., NPS surveys among employees), identifying "bugs," and transparently addressing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:07">[01:22:07]</a>.
    *   Aspiration: Culture can include aspirational elements not yet fully realized, as publishing them can make them increasingly true over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:56">[01:29:56]</a>. This counters the belief that values should only reflect who you *are*, not who you *aspire to be* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>.

### Decision-Making with "Flash Tags"

To manage communication and decision-making efficiently in a large organization, Shah developed "flash tags" for emails and other communications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:38:00">[57:38:00]</a>. These hashtags signal the level of conviction and expected action:

*   **#FYI**: For your information, no response expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:04:00">[59:04:00]</a>.
*   **#Suggestion**: A thought or idea worth exploring; no response expected, but should be considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:20:00">[59:20:00]</a>.
*   **#Recommendation**: Thought-out advice; a response is appreciated if the recommendation is not followed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:44">[00:59:44]</a>.
*   **#Plea**: A strong belief or request, close to a mandate but still respecting autonomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:16">[01:00:16]</a>. HubSpot's culture emphasizes autonomy, so explicit mandates are rare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:51">[01:00:51]</a>.

This system helps clarify the intent behind communication, preventing junior employees from over-indexing on informal suggestions from leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:55:00">[57:55:00]</a>.

### Systematic Idea Evaluation

Shah advocates for a systematic approach to evaluating business ideas, using a mental "Excel spreadsheet" with four key columns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:09">[01:10:09]</a>:

1.  **Potential**: The magnitude of the outcome if successful (e.g., impact, revenue, market cap) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:30">[01:10:30]</a>.
2.  **Probability of Success**: The likelihood of achieving that outcome. Critically, assess potential *before* probability to avoid filtering out high-reward, lower-probability ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:52">[01:10:52]</a>.
3.  **Passion/Proximity**: How much you care about solving the problem, and whether you can work on it for a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:32">[01:13:32]</a>.
4.  **Prowess**: Unique assets or unfair advantages (e.g., existing code, market access) that increase your likelihood of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:49">[01:12:49]</a>.

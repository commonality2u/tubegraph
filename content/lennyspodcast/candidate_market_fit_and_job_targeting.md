When seeking a job, it's crucial to adopt a focused approach, akin to using a spear rather than a net, to avoid opportunities slipping through your grasp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This concept, known as Candidate Market Fit (CMF), applies the principles of [[the_concept_of_product_market_fit_and_its_evolution | Product Market Fit Strategy]] to the job search process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:20">[00:31:20]</a>.

## Understanding Candidate Market Fit

CMF is the most important job search tactic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>, recognizing that you operate within a marketplace of supply and demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:51">[00:50:51]</a>. In a down market, like the current tech landscape with recent layoffs, your CMF can be pushed down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:30">[00:21:30]</a>. For instance, a Director of Product who might have secured a VP role in a strong market might now need to consider a Senior Manager role due to increased competition from VPs taking Director positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>.

Crucially, CMF is a reflection of the marketplace, not a personal statement about your worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:43">[00:21:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:43">[00:41:43]</a>. Realizing this can bring a sense of relief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:54">[00:21:54]</a>. Being close to the "technology frontier" is vital, as this is where new jobs and opportunities are created, particularly in a dynamic economy driven by creative destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:06">[00:37:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:12">[01:39:12]</a>.

## Developing Your Candidate Market Fit

The process of defining your CMF involves several key steps:

### The Manukan Two-Pager
The first radical step is to consciously think about what you want and don't want in a job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>. Most people "spray and pray" when laid off, applying broadly without specific direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:12">[00:22:12]</a>. This "Manukan Two-Pager" (named after Allison Manukan) is a draft, not a final decision, and it benefits from being shared with a [[job_search_strategies_and_mindset | Job Search Council]] for collaborative learning and refinement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:02">[00:23:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:48">[00:23:48]</a>.

### The Listening Tour
Once you have a draft Manukan Two-Pager, embark on a "listening tour" to understand what the market wants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:42">[00:24:42]</a>. As job seekers, "we're the product" – our skills and experience are what we're bringing to market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:46">[00:24:46]</a>. This tour involves engaging with:
*   **Reverse exit interviews** with former colleagues to understand your strengths and perceived fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:16">[00:27:16]</a>.
*   Your **broader network**, asking the "golden question": "If you were in my shoes, how would you approach this?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:34">[00:27:34]</a>.
*   **Recruiters**, seeking their advice on where you might fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:42">[00:27:42]</a>. Building relationships with recruiters even when not actively looking is valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:06">[00:28:06]</a>.

The listening tour provides market research and customer feedback on your fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:20">[00:26:20]</a>. It also creates "listening posts" – people invested in your success who will think of you when opportunities arise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:29">[00:26:29]</a>. While challenging and occasionally humiliating due to honest feedback, a [[job_search_strategies_and_mindset | Job Search Council]] can help interpret and parse the input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:25">[00:30:25]</a>.

### Narrowing Your Focus
After the listening tour, you need to create a simple, narrow, and clear CMF statement, typically with three to four attributes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:11">[00:31:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:33">[00:33:33]</a>. Examples include:
*   "A director of product role in a healthcare Series B startup in San Francisco" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:46">[00:31:46]</a>.
*   A product designer seeking "companies that either did not have a design team or needed to reboot one" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:40">[00:33:40]</a>.

Resist the urge to be broad; a narrow focus (a "spear, not a net") allows others to be expansive on your behalf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>. For example, if you seek a specific healthcare role, people might also think of you for a fintech role in a heavily regulated industry if they see a fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:32">[00:32:32]</a>. But if you state you'll take "any product job," no one will remember you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:41">[00:32:41]</a>.

This narrow focus is challenging but crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:52">[00:32:52]</a>. Your [[job_search_strategies_and_mindset | Job Search Council]] can provide support, as market conditions change, and your CMF may need to adapt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:31">[00:34:31]</a>. Once finalized, share your CMF statement on LinkedIn and with your network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:25">[00:34:25]</a>.

### Strategic Adjustments in a Down Market
In a challenging market, you may need to consider a "two-step strategy," taking a role below your previous level to gain experience in a desired area before pursuing your ultimate goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:39">[00:39:39]</a>. For example, an EVP at a traditional media company successfully took an individual contributor (IC) role at a top streaming company to gain relevant experience, transforming his career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>. Similarly, a Chief Product Officer (CPO) who lacked proper product training found success in an IC role at a larger tech company to learn foundational skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>.

## Playing to Win with a Job Mission and OKRs

To "play to win" rather than "not to lose" in interviews and negotiations, create your own job mission with Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) for the role you're seeking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:28">[00:50:28]</a>. This private document outlines what you'll be accountable for and the outcomes you'll deliver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:06">[00:51:06]</a>.

### Benefits of a Job Mission with OKRs
*   **Better Interview Questions:** Drafting it helps you formulate insightful questions to clarify the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:21">[00:51:21]</a>.
*   **Impresses Hiring Managers:** Sharing it as a draft, preferably in a live conversation, demonstrates initiative and a deep understanding of the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:33">[00:51:33]</a>. One senior Amazon hiring manager stated this approach would "blow my mind" and lead to an immediate hire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:03">[00:52:03]</a>.
*   **Clarifies the Role:** It helps both you and the hiring manager ensure alignment on the true nature of the job, preventing "Job A" from turning into "Job B" after starting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:01">[00:53:01]</a>.
*   **Leverages Negotiation:** It sets you up to negotiate for success by discussing the resources and support you'll need to achieve the agreed-upon OKRs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:43">[00:53:43]</a>. This includes asking for budgets (e.g., for technical debt), training, or additional hires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:26">[00:54:26]</a>. Companies often appreciate this proactive approach, as it shows you're thinking about their success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:08">[00:56:08]</a>. This negotiation should be a collaborative conversation, not an antagonistic demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:06">[00:58:06]</a>.

By taking this proactive stance, you show initiative, accountability, and the ability to "make things happen," distinguishing yourself from other candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:53">[00:59:53]</a>.

When discussing product value, many individuals quickly gravitate towards describing the product's features. However, effective product marketing emphasizes communicating the *benefits* that customers gain from those features. Understanding this distinction is crucial for successful monetization and customer engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:53">01:19:53</a>.

## Features vs. Benefits Defined

*   **Features** are what a product *is* or *does* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">01:20:00</a>. These are the components and functionalities that product builders create <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">01:20:00</a>.
*   **Benefits** are what customers *get out of* the features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">01:20:00</a>. They explain how the features solve a problem or improve a customer's situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">01:20:00</a>.

Effective communication requires pitching benefits, as this is how customers understand the true [[Role of marketing in product success | value]] of a product. If only features are discussed, customers may not grasp the product's worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">01:20:00</a>.

## Signs of Feature-Centric Communication

Several indicators suggest that a product team may be overly focused on features rather than benefits:

*   **Passion for the Product's Inner Workings**
    If a team is highly enthusiastic about every detail of the product and how its "bells and whistles" operate, they are likely discussing features. This showcases the product's coolness rather than its direct advantages for the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:06">01:20:06</a>.
*   **Lack of Market Traction**
    If a product isn't gaining traction in the market, it might be due to a misunderstanding of what customers are receiving. Shifting the conversation to focus on benefits can rectify this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:16">01:20:16</a>.

## Strategies for Communicating Benefits

Focusing on benefits can significantly improve product reception and revenue.

### 1. Reframe Communication

Rather than listing technical specifications, reframe the message to highlight the tangible advantages for the user.

*   **SmugMug Example**: SmugMug, a photo hosting and sharing company, initially published lengthy pricing plans that detailed every feature. By changing their communication to emphasize benefits, such as "the ability to sell photos online" (which is enabled by many underlying features), they saw a double-digit improvement in revenue without altering the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:38">01:20:38</a>.
*   **Porsche Example**: Porsche's communication for its electric car, the Taycan, famously focused on the benefit of it being "first and foremost a Porsche," appealing to their audience's [[Understanding and executing effective product positioning strategies | desire for the brand's core attributes]] rather than just its electric vehicle features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:34">01:21:34</a>. This type of [[Differentiating messaging for effective sales | value communication]] deeply resonates with their target market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:48">01:21:48</a>.

### 2. Emphasize Value in Product Plans

When outlining different product tiers or plans, foreground the benefits that differentiate each tier.

*   **Shopify Example**: Shopify's plans are designed to emphasize benefits rather than just features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:07">01:15:07</a>. For instance, instead of listing technical details about inventory management, they highlight "the number of locations that you can track inventory" as a benefit. This is particularly useful for businesses with complex supply chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:20">01:15:20</a>. Shopify's tagline for "Shopify Plus"—"fair pricing, unfair advantage"—also serves as a strong value statement, making it clear what customers are gaining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:49">01:15:49</a>.

### Practical Takeaway for Product Teams

Product managers and founders should review their website and communication materials to assess whether they are pitching features or benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:03">01:16:03</a>. This self-assessment can reveal opportunities to improve [[the_importance_of_communication_in_product_management | communication]] and, by extension, product adoption and revenue.

Developing good taste and high standards is crucial for individuals and organizations, particularly in product development and marketing. Seth Godin defines good taste as "knowing what other people want just before they do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. This means bringing something to the world that is unexpected but gladly received, akin to how Jazz musicians or fabric designers are recognized for their taste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

## Understanding Quality and Standards

Quality, according to Godin, is not about luxury or perfection, but about "meeting spec" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. If a product meets its specifications, it is done. High standards, then, involve "relentlessly improve[ing] the spec in service of the people you're working with and for" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. It's not about being a perfectionist who refuses to ship a product that meets spec; that's just "hiding" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.

## Building Taste and Raising Standards

One effective way to [[developing_taste_and_quality_in_product_design | build taste and higher standards]] is to learn from and work with individuals who already possess them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. Godin's early experience as a product manager at Spinnaker Software taught him that the goal was to "Delight the person who was buying the software," not to achieve internal perfection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. The focus must be on the user's delight, not on pleasing one's boss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

This perspective extends to one's general approach to work. As advised by Martin Luther King Jr., even in "menial jobs," one can choose to be "the best Barista in the world for an hour" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. If you have the chance to "add Delight to someone's day," you do it for yourself, not merely for pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.

## Key Insights for Product People

For product managers and founders, several critical choices, often overlooked, directly impact their product and future:

*   **Choose Your Customers:** Define your "smallest viable audience" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:02">[00:24:02]</a>. This choice dictates everything about the product, from its features to the future experience of building it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:15">[00:24:15]</a>.
*   **Choose Your Competition:** Understanding your competitive landscape is crucial. Competing against established giants like Walmart means accepting their rules of engagement, such as price wars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:18">[00:25:18]</a>.
*   **Choose the Source of Validation:** Don't aim to please your boss; instead, seek validation from the specific customers you've chosen to serve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:36">[00:25:36]</a>. This clarifies expectations and streamlines decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:55">[00:25:55]</a>.
*   **Choose Your Distribution:** The distribution method significantly influences product design. A video game sold in mass retail differs vastly from shareware distributed online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:04">[00:26:04]</a>. These choices are interconnected and must be made intentionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:30">[00:26:30]</a>.

## The Role of Tension in Strategy and Innovation

A great strategy, like any art form or innovation, has [[developing_taste_and_quality_in_product_design | tension]] at its core <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:07">[00:32:07]</a>. Tension, distinct from stress, arises from the possibility that something "might not work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:13">[00:28:13]</a>. When a new product is launched, it creates tension by making a promise: "we have this thing that can do X" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:27">[00:28:27]</a>. If users "fall in love with that possibility," they question if the promise will be kept, thus creating tension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:35">[00:28:35]</a>. This concept directly relates to [[developing_taste_and_quality_in_product_design | brand building]]: "make a promise and keep it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>.

## The Importance of Being Remarkable

A key aspect of building a successful product and brand is being "remarkable." The word "remarkable" means "worth making a remark about" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:20">[00:30:20]</a>. This isn't about creating gimmicks or viral videos, but about crafting something that genuinely improves a person's life and makes them want to talk about it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:27">[00:30:27]</a>. For example, Google's initial promise of a simple search with two buttons was remarkable because it offered a clear utility that users would share with others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:16">[00:31:16]</a>. This "network effect" is crucial for software products; if a product doesn't work better when users tell others about it, its marketing problem remains unsolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>.

## Seeing the System

To be a strategic thinker, one must "see the system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:04">[00:35:04]</a>. Systems are pervasive and often invisible, establishing "the way things are around here" through culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:48">[00:33:48]</a>. While systems facilitate interoperability, they can also become self-reinforcing and hinder progress, such as hiring practices that favor conformity over talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:51">[00:35:51]</a>. What feels "scary" to do might be precisely because the system wants to discourage it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:51">[00:33:51]</a>. To innovate, one must identify elements within the system that allow for a change in its rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:02">[00:37:02]</a>.

## Choosing Your "Wave"

The metaphor "better waves make better surfers" highlights that success is often determined by choosing the right context rather than just inherent skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:08">[00:37:08]</a>. Great surfers "pass up waves that other people might take waiting for the right wave" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:34">[00:37:34]</a>. This translates to choosing the right company, the right team members, and avoiding rushing to meet arbitrary deadlines with "mediocre work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:43">[00:37:43]</a>. If you don't want to be average, you must do something different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:03">[00:38:03]</a>.

## Leadership and Service

Ultimately, [[developing_leadership_skills_and_understanding_feedback | leadership]] involves painting "a picture of the future" and going there, inspiring others to follow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:17">[00:43:17]</a>. However, this vision must be rooted in "empathy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:33">[00:43:33]</a>. A leader should paint a picture of "where *they* want to go," not where the leader wants to go <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:36">[00:43:36]</a>. Professionals understand that their role is to be "of service," opening doors for people to reach their desired destinations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:57">[00:43:57]</a>. It's challenging to change what people want, but highly effective to help them achieve what they already desire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:05">[00:44:05]</a>.

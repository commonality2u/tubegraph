Product management theater refers to a situation where companies have "ridiculous roles" and individuals who are not "real [[Role of Product Managers | product managers]]" are "dramatically overpaid for the value they provide" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. These individuals often fulfill a project management role rather than genuine [[Product Management in Tech Companies | product management]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Causes and Context
The rise of [[Product Management Misconceptions | product management theater]] is attributed to a "convergence of factors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>, including:

*   **Over-hiring during the pandemic** Many companies "over hired during the pandemic," often lowering the hiring bar for [[Role of Product Managers | product managers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.
*   **Changing financial landscape** An increase in the cost of funds has contributed to companies re-evaluating their spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.
*   **Predicted impact of Generative AI** The uncertainty and potential disruption from generative AI create fear among leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.
*   **Excessive team size and roles** Especially outside Silicon Valley, team sizes have become "out of hand," with numerous "ridiculous roles" like agile coaches, [[product_management_vs_product_owner | product owners]], product Ops, and business analysts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>. Smaller teams are often more productive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>.
*   **Remote work** For many companies, remote employees have led to a "real hit" in both velocity and [[Product management and innovation | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>.
*   **Over-reliance on processes** Many large companies outside of Silicon Valley invest in processes like SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework) without sufficient outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>.

Ultimately, companies are realizing they have "so little in the way of outcomes to show for all this cost" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>.

## Characteristics of Product Management Theater
The core issue of [[Product Management Misconceptions | product management theater]] is that many individuals holding [[Role of Product Managers | product manager]] titles are not performing the functions of a "real [[Role of Product Managers | product manager]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>.

### Feature Teams vs. Empowered Product Teams
A key distinction is made between "feature teams" (or feature factories) and "empowered product teams" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>:

*   **Feature Teams** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>:
    *   Are given a roadmap of "output" â€“ features or projects to design, build, test, and deploy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a>.
    *   Focus on delivering output, which is "a lot easier" than delivering outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:34">[00:21:34]</a>.
    *   Often don't need a [[Role of Product Managers | product manager]], as the role becomes a "project management role" that engineers or designers could cover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a>.
    *   [[Role of Product Managers | Product managers]] in these teams are "dramatically overpaid for the value they provide" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:02">[00:20:02]</a>.
    *   May define their job as "facilitating" or "herding cats" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>, rather than being a "creator" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:17">[00:25:17]</a>.

*   **Empowered Product Teams** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:57">[00:20:57]</a>:
    *   Are given "problems to solve" (customer or business problems), usually one or two per quarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>.
    *   Measure success by whether they "solv[e] the problem," not just by shipping the feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:07">[00:22:07]</a>.
    *   Focus on "outcomes" and "time to money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:19">[00:22:19]</a>.
    *   Require a "real [[Role of Product Managers | product manager]]" who brings skills related to value and viability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>.

## The Reckoning
There has been a "reckoning" for "delivery team product owners and feature team product managers" as companies realize these roles are not as valuable as perceived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:31">[00:29:31]</a>. Generative AI is expected to "compound this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:45">[00:29:45]</a>. Individuals acting as "backlog administrators" are particularly vulnerable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:01">[00:53:01]</a>.

## The "Real" Product Manager Role
A "real [[Role of Product Managers | product manager]]" on an empowered product team is a creator, not just a facilitator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:17">[00:25:17]</a>. Their core responsibilities revolve around:

*   **Value** (for the customer) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>
*   **Viability** (for the business) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>

This contrasts with the engineer's responsibility for feasibility and the designer's for usability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>.

### Key Skills for a "Real" [[Role of Product Managers | Product Manager]]
To contribute value and viability, a [[Role of Product Managers | product manager]] needs to develop specific skills:
*   Become an expert on users and customers, which often requires significant direct interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>.
*   Be an expert on data, understanding how the product is used, how usage changes, and how it's purchased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:27">[00:26:27]</a>.
*   Represent business constraints, including compliance, sales, marketing, financial costs, monetization, and legal issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:37">[00:26:37]</a>.
*   Possess a deep understanding of the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:18">[00:27:18]</a>.

These skills enable the [[Role of Product Managers | product manager]] to come up with solutions that are not only usable and feasible but also valuable and viable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>.

## Overcoming [[Product Management Misconceptions | Product Management Theater]]
Individuals and companies can work towards transforming from a theater-like environment to an empowered product organization.

### Individual Action
Many [[Role of Product Managers | product managers]] feel "trapped in a feature team" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:44">[00:30:44]</a>. However, individuals have "a lot more agency than they realize" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:04">[00:31:04]</a>. They can:
*   **Raise their skills**: Conduct a self-assessment and develop the necessary skills to contribute at a higher level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:32">[00:31:32]</a>.
*   **Promote change from within**: By improving their game, [[Role of Product Managers | product managers]] can earn appreciation and potentially influence their company to adopt more effective ways of working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:54">[00:31:54]</a>.

### Organizational Transformation
Companies need to "take a hard look at how they build products and how they serve their customers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>. The "product operating model" is a framework for this transformation.

#### The Product Operating Model
This model is a set of 20 principles consistently used by the best product companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:30">[01:04:30]</a>. It addresses three key dimensions:
1.  **Deciding what to work on**: How companies decide which problems to solve, largely defined by [[Product management strategies and frameworks | product strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:28">[01:05:28]</a>.
2.  **Solving problems**: Ensuring teams have the skills for product discovery to create valuable, viable, usable, and feasible solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:46">[01:05:46]</a>.
3.  **Building, testing, and deploying**: Focusing on reliable, demonstrable delivery that generates desired outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:02">[01:06:02]</a>.

Key principles within this model include:
*   Innovation is more important than predictability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:48">[01:08:48]</a>.
*   Learning is more important than failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:54">[01:08:54]</a>.
*   Principles are more important than process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:58">[01:08:58]</a>.
*   Teams are empowered with problems to solve, fostering real ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:05">[01:09:05]</a>.
*   Embracing quick experimentation and testing ideas responsibly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:26">[01:09:26]</a>.
*   Small, frequent, uncoupled releases; continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD); instrumentation and monitoring of everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:35">[01:09:35]</a>.

#### Core Competencies in the Product Operating Model
For companies to truly transform, they need to institutionalize four key competencies, often missing despite similar job titles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:26">[01:06:26]</a>:
1.  **Real [[Role of Product Managers | Product Manager]]**: Focusing on value and viability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:02">[01:07:02]</a>.
2.  **Real Product Designer**: Encompassing service, interaction, visual design, and user research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:11">[01:07:11]</a>.
3.  **Real Tech Lead**: An essential engineering role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:15">[01:07:15]</a>.
4.  **Real Product Leader**: Managers who know how to coach their people and establish a real [[Product management strategies and frameworks | product strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:19">[01:07:19]</a>. This "Triad" of product manager, designer, and tech lead, overseen by a product leader, is crucial for empowered teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:44">[01:07:44]</a>.

### Misinformation and Learning
A significant challenge is that "90% of the content out there is from the feature team world or worst" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:34">[00:33:34]</a>. Well-meaning individuals in online communities often propagate bad practices learned from their own "crappy company" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:49">[00:35:49]</a>.

Individuals need to develop critical thinking skills and "use their judgment" when seeking advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:16">[00:37:16]</a>. Researching potential managers and understanding their work history is also advised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:35">[00:37:35]</a>.

### Product Ops
[[Product Ops]] is distinct from the product operating model, analogous to Dev Ops or Design Ops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:57">[01:11:57]</a>. In effective companies, [[Product Ops]] primarily involves user research and data analysts brought together under one leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:16">[01:12:16]</a>. This function can be highly leveraged by multiple teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:31">[01:14:31]</a>. However, some companies misinterpret [[Product Ops]] as focusing on "process and governance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:06">[01:13:06]</a> or as a way to provide [[Role of Product Managers | product manager]] "assistance" to do "dirty work," which is problematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:22">[01:13:22]</a>.

### Founders and [[Role of Product Managers | Product Managers]]
Founders often hesitate to hire [[Role of Product Managers | product managers]] early, viewing them as unnecessary or disruptive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:20">[01:15:20]</a>.
*   Founders are discouraged from hiring [[Role of Product Managers | product managers]] "too soon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:56">[01:15:56]</a>, especially if the [[Role of Product Managers | product manager]]'s role would overlap with the founder's own responsibilities for value and viability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:29">[01:16:29]</a>.
*   A "real [[Role of Product Managers | product manager]]" should be hired *after* [[Product management and innovation | product market fit]] is achieved and the company reaches a certain scale (e.g., around 20-25 engineers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:03">[01:17:03]</a>. Before this point, the co-founder is often best suited to be the product person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:20">[01:17:20]</a>.
*   Hiring a [[Role of Product Managers | product manager]] too early can lead to "too many cooks in the kitchen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:44">[01:16:44]</a>.

### Conclusion
Companies with [[Product Management Misconceptions | product management theater]] often demonstrate a lack of "outcomes to show for all this cost" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a> and will face pressure to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>. The "best companies" operate with "so much less proportional spend and so much more... real return" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a> by adopting an [[effective_product_management_strategies | effective product management strategies]] model centered on principles, empowered teams, and true [[Role of Product Managers | product management]] expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:30">[01:04:30]</a>.

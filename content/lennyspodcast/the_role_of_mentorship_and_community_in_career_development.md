Nikhail Singall, a product leader at Meta who has worked on influential consumer products like Facebook, Credit Karma, Google Hangouts, and Google Photos, emphasizes the crucial roles of mentorship and community in [[leadership and career advancement | career advancement]] and [[building a meaningful career | professional fulfillment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:13">[01:13:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:09">[01:41:09]</a>. He advocates for a long-term approach to [[the importance of longterm career planning | career planning]], focusing on sustained motivation and continuous learning rather than short-term gains like promotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

## The Short-Term vs. Long-Term Career Perspective

Many individuals focus on short-term career frustrations, such as disliking their boss or perceiving a lack of company progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. However, these issues are often present in many roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>, and lateral moves do not equate to forward progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. Singall advises working backward from a desired "end state" for one's career, viewing it like a product with versions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. He suggests thinking not just about the next job, but the job after that, or even the boss's boss's job, to identify what skills or experiences are needed to reach those goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.

A common short-term focus is on promotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. While promotions are a company's system for indicating internal movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>, they should be viewed in service of a larger, long-term career arc <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. Many people plan to leave a company as soon as they get promoted, which highlights a disconnect between promotion and true [[leadership principles and career success | career success]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

### Avoiding "Ex-Growth Companies"

Singall introduces the concept of "ex-growth companies" – organizations that raised substantial capital during periods of rapid growth but have since lost momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>. These companies are often privately held, maintaining high valuations from a past era, but are now struggling to find product-market fit with large teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>. Joining or staying at such companies can be detrimental to a career because the equity may become worthless, and the opportunity cost is significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>.

Signs of an ex-growth company include:
*   Still trying to find product-market fit despite a valuation in the hundreds of millions or billions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>.
*   Having to work very hard to acquire users, rather than experiencing natural "pull" or "sucking sound" from customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:37">[00:20:37]</a>.

Reasons to consider staying at such a company are limited, primarily if it offers an unparalleled learning opportunity (e.g., an executive team role not available elsewhere) or out of loyalty to the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:34">[00:21:34]</a>. However, staying due to fear of not finding another job is a common but poor reason <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:27">[00:22:27]</a>.

## [[Coaching and mentoring in product management | Mentoring]] and [[Navigating career growth and advancement in tech | Career Growth]]

Nikhail has mentored hundreds of product managers, often assisting them during "911 calls" — moments of dilemma or career transitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. He notes that [[coaching and mentoring in product management | mentoring]] helps individuals decide on new jobs, consider leaving, or navigate difficult work situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

### Why Managers Struggle
The tech industry has a surprising lack of formal training for managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:28">[00:35:28]</a>. The assumption often is that if one is a good coder or a good product manager, they are automatically ready to manage people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:46">[00:35:46]</a>. This creates a "massive epidemic" of untrained managers, leading to challenges with bias, coaching, teaching, and addressing development areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:19">[00:36:19]</a>.

For new managers, Singall offers two key pieces of advice:
1.  **Share the steering wheel:** Management is not about simply dividing and conquering or letting go once someone is trained. It's more like a sidecar on a motorcycle, where the manager provides counsel while the team member drives, fostering a shared responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:51">[00:37:51]</a>.
2.  **Earn the right to manage:** Managers have organizational power, but they must earn the right to be a person's manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:49">[00:38:49]</a>. This means asking "what can I help you with?" and waiting to be invited in, partnering on specific areas when the need arises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:57">[00:38:57]</a>.

### The Rise of the Senior IC Path
The growth of the Individual Contributor (IC) path, particularly in product management, is seen as one of the best developments in the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:50">[00:40:50]</a>. For years, ICs were often promised management roles without proper training, leading to average managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:03">[00:41:03]</a>. The IC track allows individuals to become true experts in specific areas of product ambiguity—like crafting, market understanding, organizational navigation, domain expertise (e.g., ML, hardware), or team dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>. This focus on deep skill development makes them more valuable as "builders" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:44">[00:41:44]</a>. Singall believes that the IC path will become increasingly solidified and recognized, mirroring established paths in engineering and design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:02">[00:43:02]</a>.

## The Power of Community for Learning

Given the weakness in formal management training, community emerges as a "critical ingredient" for learning and improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:16">[00:46:16]</a>. Whether within or outside of a company, communities foster safety and authentic conversations, helping members realize they are not alone in their struggles and facilitating the sharing of best practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:27">[00:46:27]</a>.

### Examples of Professional Communities
*   **The Skip CPO Community:** Nikhail created this community for Chief Product Officers (CPOs) who often experience the loneliness of leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:26">[00:48:26]</a>. Starting with a small group, it grew to 28 members, using WhatsApp and Zoom for authentic discussions about shared challenges and solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:02">[00:49:02]</a>. Members must be product leaders at mid to late-stage companies with similar problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:58">[00:50:58]</a>.
*   **Lenny's Newsletter Community:** This larger community, open to all levels of product managers and other functions, provides a Slack channel and hosts monthly meetups worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:36">[00:51:36]</a>. Singall believes such communities are more valuable for learning than managing a single person in a stalled project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:27">[00:52:27]</a>.

## Overcoming Challenges and Mental Health in Senior Leadership

Senior leaders often possess "superpowers" that enabled their success but can also create "shadows"—development areas that are hard to recognize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:35">[00:53:35]</a>. What got them to their current position isn't always what will help them advance further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:55">[00:53:55]</a>. For example, a "great collaborator" might only collaborate effectively when others agree with their views, struggling when differing opinions arise at a senior level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:44">[00:54:44]</a>.

To identify these hidden development areas, leaders must seek and genuinely listen to contradictory, informal feedback, rather than relying solely on formal feedback or dismissing criticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:30">[00:57:30]</a>. Creating an environment of psychological safety encourages honest input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:53">[00:31:53]</a>.

### The "Act Three" of a Career and Mental Health
As careers extend into 60 or even 70 years, many successful professionals reach their initial "North Star" (e.g., becoming a VP, starting a company) only to feel lost afterward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:50">[01:03:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:09">[01:04:09]</a>. Singall illustrates this with the metaphor of dog tracks: if a dog catches the fake rabbit, it may never run again because it has achieved its goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:10">[01:05:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:25">[01:05:25]</a>. Similarly, individuals who only focus on achieving a specific title or financial goal may become sad, unproductive, or develop bad habits once that goal is met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:27">[01:05:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:20">[01:06:20]</a>.

Therefore, it is crucial to start thinking about a "second North Star" or the "Act Three" of one's career early on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>. This often involves shifting focus from accumulation to "giving" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:41">[01:09:41]</a>. Examples include content creation, volunteering, or founding mission-based companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:29">[01:10:29]</a>. Nikhail himself plans to devote his Act Three to [[coaching and mentoring in product management | coaching]] and lifting others up, finding ways to scale this impact authentically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:32">[01:11:32]</a>. This focus on sustained purpose helps prevent mental health challenges and provides a more fulfilling, long-term career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:38">[01:06:38]</a>.

## Key Takeaway for Career Development
Nikhail's ultimate advice for product managers is to "ensure that the story you will tell about the work you're doing today is meaningful for your skip job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:34">[01:21:34]</a>. This means actively crafting a narrative that highlights problems solved, skills built, headwinds faced, and how they were overcome, using "I" statements to articulate personal impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:02">[01:22:02]</a>. A compelling story, regardless of formal promotion, signifies progress in one's career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:41">[01:22:41]</a>.

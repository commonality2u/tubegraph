Effective SEO strategies often involve a choice between programmatic and editorial approaches. Understanding the distinctions and appropriate use cases for each is crucial, especially with the [[Impact of AI on SEO | rise of AI]] answers in search results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Programmatic SEO

Programmatic SEO involves taking various data sources and building out pages that combine this information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:25">[01:10:25]</a>. This approach is ideal for achieving scale and is most effective when there's a clear user use case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:30">[01:14:30]</a>.

**Examples of Successful Programmatic SEO:**

*   **[[Zapier | Zapier]]** originally had a product that no one knew they needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:57">[02:30:57]</a>. They leveraged programmatic SEO by creating pages that demonstrated how different applications could work together (e.g., "Gmail and Salesforce") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:56">[02:54:56]</a>. This allowed users to discover the product as a solution to their existing needs, building a flywheel effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:06">[02:56:06]</a>.
*   **[[Tinder]]** focused on solving the "loneliness problem" for users in new cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:50">[02:50:50]</a>. They built programmatic pages for "online dating in [city]" that provided examples of date locations and offered Tinder as a solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:01">[03:06:01]</a>. This approach ensures that even with [[Impact of AI on SEO | AI overviews]], users would still click through to solve their mid-funnel problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:09">[03:11:09]</a>.
*   **TripAdvisor** combined user-generated content (UGC) with hotel and city data to create comprehensive pages for each property, dominating search results without writing individual long-form content for every hotel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:48">[01:10:48]</a>.
*   **Zillow** addressed the problem of property valuation by integrating government data, comparison data from home sales, photos from realtors, and neighborhood/school information onto individual programmatic pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:45">[01:11:45]</a>. For Zillow, SEO is often the *only* channel to bring traffic to these specific property pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:21">[01:12:21]</a>.
*   **Canva** and **SurveyMonkey** use programmatic approaches for templates, which directly lead to monetization through product usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:08">[00:56:08]</a>.

## Editorial SEO

Editorial SEO involves manually writing long-form content, typically blog posts or articles, around specific keywords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This approach was historically focused on ranking for "top of funnel" keywords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:50">[01:04:50]</a> and getting the first click <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:09">[01:00:09]</a>.

**Critique of Editorial SEO in the AI Era:**

*   **Risk of Disruption by AI Overviews**: Generic, top-of-funnel content (e.g., "best beach vacation") is highly susceptible to [[Impact of AI on SEO | AI overviews]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:10">[01:17:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:57">[01:21:57]</a>. These AI-generated answers provide summarized information directly in search results, reducing the need for users to click on external links <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:40">[01:06:40]</a>.
*   **Irrelevance for User Intent**: Many long-form articles written by freelancers who are not subject matter experts (e.g., a non-travel expert writing about "best beach vacations") do not best serve the user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:12">[01:11:12]</a>.
*   **Cost-Prohibitive at Scale**: Manually writing unique, quality content for millions of potential search queries (e.g., 500 million properties for Zillow) would be extremely expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:52">[01:12:52]</a>.
*   **Focus on Vanity Metrics**: Editorial SEO often prioritizes rankings for broad keywords (e.g., "CRM") over actual conversions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:12">[02:21:12]</a>. Traffic alone, especially to content that doesn't convert, is often a "total waste of time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:48">[00:51:48]</a>.

## Choosing Between Programmatic and Editorial SEO

The decision between programmatic and editorial SEO hinges on the user's intent and the purpose of the content.

*   **User Needs**: If a user is looking for a specific data point (e.g., home value) or a direct solution (e.g., how to connect two software tools), a programmatic page that provides that immediate answer is more effective than a long-form article <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:10">[01:13:10]</a>.
*   **Scale**: Programmatic SEO is suitable when you need to generate a vast number of pages covering similar topics with variations (e.g., connecting different apps, city-specific information) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:30">[01:14:30]</a>.
*   **Monetization Alignment**: Crucially, programmatic efforts should directly feed into what the company is attempting to monetize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:06">[00:56:06]</a>. Generating programmatic pages (or any content) just for the sake of having content is unproductive if it doesn't align with the product journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:53">[00:56:53]</a>.
*   **Mid-Funnel Focus**: With AI handling many top-of-funnel discovery queries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:07">[01:40:07]</a>, [[Productled approach to SEO | SEO needs to shift towards the mid-funnel]] and bottom-of-funnel buyer journeys where users have higher intent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:03">[02:20:03]</a>. Programmatic SEO often excels here by providing solutions to specific problems or comparisons.

*   **Think of SEO as a Product**: [[Productled approach to SEO | Product managers]] should be thinking about SEO as a product question, focusing on the user experience and how to position the product for self-discovery journeys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:26">[02:23:26]</a>.
*   **Understand User Intent**: Before investing in SEO, a company must be able to answer: "What is it that someone's going to do a search on?" If this cannot be answered, SEO might not be the right channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:39">[00:40:39]</a>.
*   **Focus on Business Metrics**: Measure SEO success by conversion metrics (e.g., MQLs, actual dollar conversions) rather than vanity metrics like rankings or raw traffic volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:39">[00:48:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:50">[00:51:50]</a>.
*   **Strategic Resource Allocation**: [[Effective SEO resource allocation | Evaluate SEO investment]] like any other product idea, considering the total cost (time, resources, direct expense) against expected returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:41">[00:39:41]</a>. For B2B SaaS companies, other channels like sales motions might yield better ROI if the customer journey isn't fully online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:17">[00:42:17]</a>.
*   **Integrate Brand Building**: Link building should be viewed as brand building, promoting strong relationships between content and the product being monetized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:34">[01:08:34]</a>. Google's ability to read content means mentions can be as valuable as traditional HTML links <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:02">[01:09:02]</a>.
*   **Technical SEO has its Place**: While important for very large sites (millions of pages), for smaller sites (e.g., 100-page SaaS tool), extensive investment in technical SEO to fix minor issues like page speed might not be cost-effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:08">[01:35:08]</a>.
*   **SEO is Not a Dark Art**: Google's best practices guide provides fundamental principles for building an effective SEO strategy: make a website understandable to Google, link appropriately, and create helpful content that users want to read <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:21">[01:28:21]</a>.

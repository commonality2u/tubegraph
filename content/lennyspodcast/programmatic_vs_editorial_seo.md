Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is a powerful yet often misunderstood growth lever for companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. A common misconception is that companies tend to under-resource [[SEO as a growth strategy|SEO]] while over-resourcing paid advertisements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. For large companies like Zillow or eBay, which spend tens of millions on ads, investing in a robust [[SEO as a growth strategy|SEO]] team can yield comparable traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

There are two primary approaches to content-based [[SEO as a growth strategy|SEO]]: programmatic and editorial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. These strategies, along with [[Tools and techniques for effective SEO|technical SEO]], form the core of a comprehensive [[SEO strategies in the age of AI|SEO strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.

## Programmatic SEO

[[AI and programmatic SEO|Programmatic SEO]] involves automatically generating pages from a database of information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>.
*   **Examples**:
    *   eBay's product pages are generated from their product database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a>.
    *   Zillow's address pages are generated from property information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>.
    *   Sites with User-Generated Content (UGC) like Glassdoor also use programmatic generation for pages like company reviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>.
*   **Page Types**: Typically includes category pages (grids or lists of items) and item pages (individual products, addresses, videos) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>.
*   **Advantages**: The main benefit is that there is no individual cost per page created, as pages are generated automatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>. This allows for the creation of millions of pages without direct manual effort for each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>.
*   **Disadvantages**: Can lead to low-quality or "thin" content if not carefully managed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:03">[00:30:03]</a>. Google's algorithm has evolved to prefer pages that cover multiple keywords within a topic, rather than minor variations for every single keyword <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>.
*   **[[Impact of AI on SEO|AI and Programmatic SEO]]**: [[AI and programmatic SEO|AI can be useful]] for programmatic SEO when there is underlying structured data to base sentences on, such as a basketball game's play-by-play or clinical trial information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:16">[01:26:16]</a>. However, AI-generated content without factual basis can be problematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:58">[01:25:58]</a>.

## Editorial SEO

Editorial SEO involves manually written content by a person, such as articles, guides, or listicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>.
*   **Examples**:
    *   MasterClass creates content related to their classes, such as "how to poach an egg" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:38">[00:34:38]</a>.
    *   BetterUp builds content around career improvement topics like "how to give difficult feedback" or "how to create a five-year plan" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:42">[00:21:42]</a>.
    *   NerdWallet offers financial guides, and HubSpot provides content on productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:57">[00:21:57]</a>.
    *   Dotdash, a conglomerate of publishers like Allrecipes and Investopedia, consistently excels in editorial SEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:18">[00:22:18]</a>.
*   **Page Types**: Articles, listicles, guides, and product marketing pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:44">[01:00:44]</a>.
*   **Advantages**: Editorial SEO is increasingly driving more traffic than programmatic SEO and offers an opportunity for almost every company with an addressable market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>.
*   **Disadvantages**: Each page has a cost associated with its creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>.

## Technical SEO

Technical SEO focuses on the underlying infrastructure of a website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>. This includes elements like:
*   Internal link architecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>
*   Tags <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>
*   Redirects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>
*   Page speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>
It is crucial for both programmatic and editorial [[SEO as a growth strategy|SEO]] as it helps Google find and crawl all pages effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>.

## Choosing an SEO Strategy

The best [[SEO strategies in the age of AI|SEO strategy]] depends on the company's category and addressable market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:27]</a>.
1.  **Define Addressable Market**: Assess the size of the target market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:46">[01:28:46]</a>. This can be done by looking at competitors' traffic using tools like Similarweb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:51">[01:28:51]</a>.
2.  **Assess Authority**: Determine if the company has enough existing traction and authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:07">[01:09:07]</a>. Signals include non-SEO traffic (at least 1,000 visits/day) and referring domains (at least 1,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:01">[01:10:01]</a>. Google prefers credible domains over sites solely focused on SEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:50">[01:09:50]</a>.
3.  **Identify Page Type**: For desired keywords, analyze what type of pages currently rank in Google search results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>. For example, "how to poach an egg" queries typically yield articles with recipes, not transcripts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>. This helps determine whether programmatic or editorial pages are needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>.
4.  **Content Strategy**: Define subtopics and themes for the chosen page types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a>.
5.  **Prioritization**: Compare the potential impact and scope of [[SEO as a growth strategy|SEO]] against other growth channels (e.g., paid ads, social) and available budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:02">[00:23:02]</a>.

### Key Concepts

*   **[[Understanding topical authority in SEO|Topical Authority]]**: This is crucial and often misunderstood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:14">[01:09:14]</a>. Google prioritizes sites that are known experts in specific, narrow areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:31">[01:10:31]</a>. Authority is determined by various inputs, including:
    *   Links from other sites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:52">[01:09:52]</a>.
    *   Non-SEO traffic (direct, paid, email, social) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:01">[01:10:01]</a>.
    *   Social shares and activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:12">[01:10:12]</a>.
    *   Branded search queries (e.g., "MasterClass Gordon Ramsay") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:14">[01:10:14]</a>.
    Google's algorithm has a semantic understanding, allowing sites with high topical authority in a niche to outrank larger domains with more general authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:31">[01:12:31]</a>.
*   **[[Understanding topical authority in SEO|Topics vs. Keywords]]**: Modern [[SEO strategies in the age of AI|SEO]] focuses on topics rather than individual keywords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:58">[00:31:58]</a>. A single page can rank for hundreds or thousands of related keywords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:50">[00:32:50]</a>. This means the addressable search volume for a topic is significantly larger than for a single keyword <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:14">[00:33:14]</a>. Grouping keywords into topics avoids wasted effort and ensures comprehensive content that fulfills user intent across various related queries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:46">[00:33:46]</a>.
*   **Internal Links**: A powerful, often underappreciated lever for [[SEO as a growth strategy|SEO]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:44">[01:14:44]</a>.
    *   Google crawls sites through links <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:30">[01:18:30]</a>. More internal links to a page generally lead to more traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:41">[01:17:41]</a>.
    *   Many sites (over 90%) have under-optimized internal linking, where a small percentage of pages receive the vast majority of links <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:01">[01:19:01]</a>.
    *   The goal is a "flat graph" where pages are few clicks away from major crawl points (like the homepage or popular pages) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:24">[01:21:24]</a>.
    *   Links within the body of content or at the bottom of an article are more valuable than navigational links in the footer or header <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:47">[01:22:47]</a>.

### [[Hiring strategies for SEO roles|Hiring for SEO]]

The ideal [[Hiring strategies for SEO roles|SEO hiring strategy]] depends on the company's stage, budget, and the chosen SEO approach:

*   **Programmatic SEO**: Requires a specialized "growth person with technical ability" who has experience building scalable systems for indexation logic and managing UGC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:44">[00:47:44]</a>. These individuals are hard to find <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:50">[00:47:50]</a>. Look for candidates from lesser-known companies that have achieved disproportionately high [[SEO as a growth strategy|SEO]] growth, as they likely faced harder challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:13">[00:48:13]</a>. Their role involves analyzing competitor sites, defining product requirements for automated page generation, clustering keywords, and analyzing data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:42">[00:49:42]</a>.
*   **Editorial SEO**: An [[Hiring strategies for SEO roles|SEO manager]] is needed to define topics, create outlines, and manage the publishing process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:05">[00:56:05]</a>. They should have a strong understanding of content strategy, even if they initially lack deep SEO expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:52">[00:56:52]</a>. A separate writer, ideally a domain expert, handles the actual content creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:51">[00:55:51]</a>.

An initial team could be one [[Hiring strategies for SEO roles|SEO manager]] and one writer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:27">[00:59:27]</a>. Companies typically start with 10-30 articles per month and scale up to 100+ once leading indicators of success are observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:27">[00:57:27]</a>.

## [[Tools and techniques for effective SEO|Tools for SEO]]

Key [[Tools and techniques for effective SEO|tools]] for [[SEO as a growth strategy|SEO]] include:
1.  **Google Search Console**: Free and provides real traffic data, Serp tracking, and keyword insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:58">[00:37:58]</a>.
2.  **Clearscope**: Excellent for content analysis and scoring, helping identify content gaps and ensuring comprehensive coverage of subtopics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:16">[00:38:16]</a>.
3.  **Keyword Research Tools**: Ahrefs or Semrush are widely used for keyword research and competitive analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:41">[00:38:41]</a>.
4.  **Screaming Frog**: Useful for site crawling, auditing (finding error codes, redirect loops), and analyzing internal link coverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:24">[00:39:24]</a>.

## Timelines and Expectations

[[SEO as a growth strategy|SEO results]] typically take 6 to 9 months to materialize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:32">[00:40:32]</a>.
*   The timeline is shorter for sites with higher existing authority and traction (e.g., Netflix sees changes in days; large sites like MasterClass or eBay within 1-4 weeks) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:41">[00:40:41]</a>.
*   For new companies starting from scratch, it can take up to a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:50">[00:40:50]</a>. This includes about 3 months for strategy, building, and launching, followed by 3-6 months for ranking to begin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:04">[00:41:04]</a>.
*   **Leading Indicators**: Early signs of progress include ranking for less popular keywords (e.g., position 15-20) and then gradually climbing the search results page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:41">[00:42:41]</a>. This indicates that Google is testing the page's engagement and relevance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:16">[00:41:16]</a>. User engagement (click-through rate on Google, time spent on page) is a key ranking signal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:35">[00:41:35]</a>.
*   **Avoiding False Negatives**: It's common for initial [[SEO as a growth strategy|SEO]] attempts to be incorrectly implemented, leading to a "false negative" conclusion that it doesn't work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:42">[00:43:42]</a>. Perseverance and strategic adjustments based on data are key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:55">[00:43:55]</a>.

## [[SEO challenges with AI answers|Impact of AI]] Beyond Content Generation

While AI for content generation has pitfalls due to a lack of "underlying wisdom" or factual accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:38">[01:25:38]</a>, [[AI and programmatic SEO|AI is immensely useful]] in other [[SEO strategies in the age of AI|SEO]] areas:
*   **Keyword Clustering**: AI can process thousands of keywords, cluster them into topics, and identify overlaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:57">[01:27:57]</a>.
*   **Subtopic Identification**: It can help determine the necessary subtopics and outline structures to ensure content comprehensiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:06">[01:28:06]</a>.
*   **Topical Authority Assessment**: [[AI and programmatic SEO|AI can help assess]] a site's existing [[Understanding topical authority in SEO|topical authority]] within various themes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:01">[01:28:01]</a>.
*   **Performance Analysis**: AI can analyze content performance and feed insights back into the strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:08">[01:28:08]</a>.

By leveraging AI for strategic support, humans can then focus on creating high-quality, factual content based on true expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:10">[01:28:10]</a>.

Getting [[SEO as a growth strategy|SEO]] initiatives launched is often the biggest challenge, due to resource constraints, the perception of [[SEO as a growth strategy|SEO]] as "mysterious," and the significant amount of work involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:57">[01:06:57]</a>. Integrating [[SEO as a growth strategy|SEO]] within the product organization and securing executive buy-in can help overcome these hurdles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:10">[01:07:10]</a>.

Strategy, at its core, is a design for overcoming a high-stakes challenge, combining policy and coherent action to address a specific issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. However, even with a clear definition, organizations often struggle with [[understanding_strategy_and_its_challenges | strategy implementation]]. Many leaders, despite knowing the fundamentals, create what is considered "bad strategy" or fail to execute effective plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>.

## Defining Good Strategy: The Kernel

Richard Rumelt, author of *Good Strategy Bad Strategy* and *The Crux*, defines a good strategy by its "kernel," which consists of three essential components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:26">[00:26:26]</a>:

1.  **Diagnosis:** A deep [[understanding_strategy_and_its_challenges | understanding of the situation]] and the nature of the challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. This involves deciding what to pay attention to and forming hypotheses about how things connect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. Without a rich diagnosis, it's difficult to form an effective plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>.
2.  **Guiding Policy:** A clear statement of how the organization will deal with the diagnosed challenge, prioritizing what to do and what *not* to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. It's about focused action, not a long list of ambitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.
3.  **Coherent Actions:** Specific, coordinated steps designed to implement the guiding policy and address the diagnosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>. These actions must not contradict each other and should lead to a clear outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.

If any of these three elements are missing, it's not truly a strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>.

## Signs of Bad Strategy (and Why Implementation Fails)

Many companies struggle with implementation because their "strategy" isn't actually a strategy at all. Common pitfalls include:

*   **Goals as Strategy:** Presenting abstract, high-level performance goals (e.g., increasing growth and profit) as a strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>. Goals are ambitions, not a plan for overcoming challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>.
*   **Fluff:** Using vague, abstract language ("word salad") that sounds profound but lacks concrete meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>. This makes it impossible to implement anything specific.
*   **Lack of Diagnosis:** Failing to articulate the specific problem or "what makes it hard" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:18">[00:21:18]</a>. For example, stating "we're not growing fast enough" is a statement of value, not a diagnosis of what's holding the company back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>. This is a common challenge that can be [[identifying_strategy_and_culture_problems_disguised_as_execution_issues | disguised as an execution issue]] when in fact the underlying strategy is flawed.
*   **Incoherent Actions:** Proposing actions that contradict each other or diffuse effort instead of focusing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:59">[00:20:59]</a>. A prime example is trying to increase growth and profit simultaneously without understanding their potential conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.

## The [[Role of Power in Strategy | Role of Power]] and Focus

Effective strategy implementation relies on **focus** and the exploitation of a source of **power** (or asymmetry) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:09">[00:25:09]</a>. This power isn't about brute force but about an advantage that makes success more likely than 50/50 odds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:11">[00:29:11]</a>. Examples of power include being first to market, having a strong reputation, unique relationships, or a particular customer base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:35">[00:29:35]</a>.

> "Focus is the fundamental source of power." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:09">[00:25:09]</a>

Identifying one's power involves looking at asymmetries: how is your company or team different? What do you know or possess that others don't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:52">[00:32:52]</a>? This could be specialized knowledge, a unique approach, or the ability to attract top talent (like AI experts to OpenAI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:36">[00:33:36]</a>. [[Role of Power in Strategy | Network effects]] are a significant source of power in modern business, where the more users a product has, the more useful it becomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:16">[00:35:16]</a>.

To successfully implement a strategy, an organization must exploit its source of power, focusing it on a target that can actually be affected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:59">[00:26:59]</a>. Diffusing efforts across too many targets or attempting to change things that are unchangeable leads to failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">[00:37:37]</a>.

## [[Challenges in Product Organizations | Organizational Dynamics]] and Politics

One of the biggest hindrances to successful strategy implementation is organizational dynamics and politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:51">[00:40:51]</a>.

*   **Diversity of Interests:** Large organizations have different groups pursuing different interests, often with their own private agendas that may not align with the overarching company goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:05">[00:52:05]</a>. This leads to a diffusion of effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:02">[00:28:02]</a>.
*   **Fear of Action and Change:** Implementing a strategy involves people changing what they do and can alter power relationships within the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:55">[01:15:55]</a>. This "heavy stuff" can lead to hesitancy from CEOs and other leaders, making decisive action difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:17">[01:16:17]</a>.
*   **Lack of a Decider:** In the face of disagreement and competing interests, a hierarchy of power is needed to make choices and "put some of these aside and doing this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:06">[01:10:06]</a>. Without someone willing to make the final decision and clearly assign responsibilities, an organization can become "frozen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:18">[01:19:18]</a>. Nokia, for example, struggled when its matrix organization diffused power so much that no one was truly in charge of addressing the smartphone challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:13">[01:20:13]</a>.

## Towards Better Strategy Implementation: The Action Agenda

To overcome these [[understanding_strategy_and_its_challenges | challenges]], Richard Rumelt suggests a more practical approach:

### 1. Don't Call it a Strategy – Call it an Action Agenda
Instead of trying to create an abstract "strategy," focus on creating an **action agenda** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:09">[00:58:09]</a>. This emphasizes concrete steps and what the organization is actually going to *do* about a problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:20">[00:58:20]</a>.

### 2. State the Problem (The Crux)
The critical first step is to clearly define the challenge you face – specifically, "what makes it hard?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:46">[00:56:46]</a>. This focus on the "crux" (the hardest part of the problem) is essential. By immersing oneself in the nature of the problem, insights on how to deal with it often emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:24">[01:09:24]</a>.

### 3. Focus on Achievable and Important Challenges
Organizations often have many ambitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:04">[01:00:04]</a>. The key is to choose a challenge that is both **important** (close to your ambition) and **achievable** (something you can actually address) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:44">[01:01:44]</a>. This requires discipline to select and concentrate effort.

### 4. Continuous Adaptation (for Startups)
For startups and pre-product market fit companies, strategy is less about a fixed plan and more about a bet on a particular market or solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:05">[01:21:05]</a>. Successful startups often "switch" their approach over time, adapting rapidly as new information is revealed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:35">[01:22:35]</a>. This requires both commitment to a vision and willingness to pivot when things aren't working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:30">[01:23:30]</a>. This is relevant to [[challenges_in_product_management | product management]] and [[challenges_in_product_organizations | product organizations]] that operate in highly uncertain environments.

### 5. Learn from History
Since strategy is not an exact science like physics, it is heavily based on analogy to previous human experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:57">[00:47:57]</a>. Reading widely, especially biographies and historical accounts, can provide invaluable insights into how complex situations unfolded and how successful (or unsuccessful) strategies were conceived and implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:29">[00:47:29]</a>.

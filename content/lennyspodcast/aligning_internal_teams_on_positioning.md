Weak product performance can often be attributed to issues with [[Importance of Product Positioning | positioning]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:48">[00:47:48]</a>. A significant factor contributing to weak [[Importance of Product Positioning | positioning]] is a lack of alignment across internal teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:19">[01:59:19]</a>.

## The Problem of Misalignment
Often, a company's [[Importance of Product Positioning | positioning]] becomes weak when different departments hold slightly varied understandings of the product's core message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:19">[01:56:19]</a>. This can manifest as:
*   The founder having one idea of the [[Importance of Product Positioning | positioning]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:35">[01:57:35]</a>.
*   The marketing department having a slightly different take <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:04">[01:59:04]</a>.
*   Sales pitches varying further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:13">[02:00:13]</a>.
*   The product team thinking about it differently again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:15">[02:01:15]</a>.

This misalignment prevents the company from "singing the same song" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:43">[02:29:43]</a> and executing a cohesive go-to-market strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:33">[02:57:33]</a>.

## Why Alignment is Crucial
[[Importance of Product Positioning | Positioning]] needs to be a collective, "team sport" effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:27">[02:00:27]</a>. It cannot be developed by one department and then "heaved over the wall" to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:11">[02:02:11]</a>. For [[Importance of Product Positioning | positioning]] to be effective, adopted, and "stick" across the company, it requires:
*   Shared expertise and understanding from all key stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:51">[02:11:51]</a>.
*   Collective agreement on the core elements of [[Importance of Product Positioning | positioning]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:12">[02:12:12]</a>.
*   Consistent execution of the [[Importance of Product Positioning | positioning]] by all teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:35">[02:12:35]</a>.

### Common Scenarios for Misalignment
The majority of [[Importance of Product Positioning | positioning]] problems stem from misalignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:46">[02:39:46]</a>. Two common situations are:
1.  **Founder's Vision vs. New Hires**: A founder might clearly understand the [[Importance of Product Positioning | positioning]] but new VPs in marketing, sales, or product don't grasp it in the same way. The founder then needs external facilitation to bring everyone into alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:52">[02:59:52]</a>.
2.  **Outdated Founder's View**: A founder's understanding of the market might become outdated as the company and market evolve. Heads of product or marketing, seeing current market shifts, realize the company is positioned for "what the market used to be" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:05">[03:07:05]</a>. Different team members (sales, marketing, product) have disparate information, necessitating a group effort to align <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:51">[03:17:51]</a>.

## Achieving Alignment: The Process
An effective [[Importance of Product Positioning | positioning]] exercise involves a structured process to ensure all key internal teams are involved and aligned.

### Key Participants
It's essential to involve representatives from:
*   Marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:59">[02:03:59]</a>
*   Product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:59">[02:03:59]</a>
*   Sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:59">[02:03:59]</a>
*   Customer success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:59">[02:03:59]</a>
*   The executive team, especially the CEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:58">[02:06:58]</a>

These individuals bring their unique expertise and understanding of customers and the product to the table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:51">[02:11:51]</a>.

### Core Steps (as defined by April Dunford)
The process of aligning teams on [[Importance of Product Positioning | positioning]] involves addressing five key components in a specific order:

1.  **Competitive Alternatives**: Identify what the product must "beat" to win a deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:29">[02:38:29]</a>. This includes both the status quo (what customers are currently doing to solve the problem, even if it's imperfect) and other solutions on a customer's shortlist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:48">[02:40:48]</a>.
2.  **Differentiated Capabilities**: List the features, functions, or company capabilities that the product has which the alternatives do not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:18">[02:50:18]</a>.
3.  **Value**: Translate those differentiated capabilities into tangible value for the customer (the "so what") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:19">[02:54:19]</a>. This process often reveals two or three core "value themes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:05">[02:58:05]</a>.
4.  **Best-Fit Customers**: Define the characteristics of target accounts that care most about the product's unique value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:21">[03:06:21]</a>.
5.  **Market Category**: Determine the market context in which the product should be positioned, making its value obvious to the target audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:39">[03:25:39]</a>.

### Outputs and Implementation
The output of this collaborative process is:
*   A documented [[Importance of Product Positioning | positioning]] statement, serving as a foundation for [[Role of positioning in sales and marketing | messaging]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:40">[03:28:40]</a>.
*   A "sales narrative" or pitch that integrates the [[Importance of Product Positioning | positioning]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>. This narrative can be storyboarded in the workshop and then developed into an actual pitch deck, demo, or script <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:09">[03:50:09]</a>.
*   This ensures that sales, product, customer success, and the CEO all "know how to tell the story" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:56">[03:56:56]</a> consistently.

## Signs of Misalignment

Weak [[Importance of Product Positioning | positioning]] can impact various stages of the sales pipeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:52">[09:50:52]</a>. While there isn't a single metric to pinpoint weak [[Importance of Product Positioning | positioning]], certain qualitative indicators can reveal internal misalignment:
*   **Sluggish Marketing Response**: People don't understand what you are, so they don't respond to marketing as expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:58:53">[09:58:53]</a>.
*   **Delayed "Aha!" Moment in Sales**: Prospects don't grasp the product's value until after multiple sales calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:54">[10:07:54]</a>.
*   **High Churn**: Customers churn because the product doesn't meet their expectations, indicating a mismatch between the sales pitch and product reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:21:40">[10:21:40]</a>.
*   **Customer Confusion in Sales Calls**:
    *   "Could you just say that again? Could you just back up at the beginning and do that thing from the beginning?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:23:45">[11:23:45]</a>
    *   "Yeah, I get it, you're just like Salesforce..." when the company is not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:37:05">[11:37:05]</a>.
    *   "I totally get what you do, I just don't get why anyone would pay for that" or "I can do that in a spreadsheet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:51:39">[11:51:39]</a>.

These statements indicate a lack of clarity in how the product is understood and valued, often stemming from internal misalignment on its [[Importance of Product Positioning | positioning]].

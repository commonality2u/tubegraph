From: [[lennyspodcast]] <br/> 

Gas was a social polling application developed by Nikita Bier and his team, sold to Discord for "many millions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. It achieved significant success, growing larger than TBH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:08">[01:10:08]</a>, with 10 million downloads and over $10 million in sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:57">[01:09:57]</a>. The app was primarily self-funded through cash flow, largely operating on startup credits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:13">[01:10:13]</a>.

## Origin and Motivation
The idea for Gas stemmed from a lingering question after the sale of TBH: what if TBH had been monetized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:18">[00:56:18]</a>? The number one support message for TBH was users asking if they could pay to reveal who sent them polls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:26">[00:56:26]</a>. This insight, combined with a market downturn that impacted personal portfolios, motivated the team to quickly build a monetized version of the concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:50">[00:55:50]</a>.

## Development and Challenges
Despite the conceptual similarity to TBH, Gas was considered a "zero to one" development cycle due to significant changes in the regulatory environment and growth mechanics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:38">[00:59:38]</a>.

*   **New Team**: Gas was built by a new team, including engineer Z Turner, working out of Nikita Bier's house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:54">[00:56:54]</a>.
*   **Reinventing Growth Systems**: The regulatory environment changed since 2017, making server-sent text invitations, a key TBH growth mechanism, impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:28">[00:58:28]</a>. Users now had to manually pop compose windows and hit send, leading to fewer invites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:01">[00:59:01]</a>. This required reinventing all growth systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:16">[00:59:16]</a>, which took approximately nine launches and numerous feature changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:22">[00:59:22]</a>.
*   **Testing and Validation**: The team focused on a layered validation process:
    1.  Will people use the core flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:55">[01:11:55]</a>?
    2.  Will people spread it within their peer group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:58">[01:11:58]</a>?
    3.  Will it hop to other peer groups (schools) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>?
    4.  Will people pay for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:26">[01:02:26]</a>?

    They initially launched Gas in the exact same Georgia school as TBH, on the same day five years later, to see if the polling concept was still relevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:37">[00:57:37]</a>. While messages were sent, it wasn't growing initially, necessitating the reinvention of growth systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:53">[00:57:53]</a>.

### Naming and Branding
The app's name, "Gas," was chosen after testing other names like "Crush" and "Melt" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:50">[01:15:50]</a>. The name "Crush" with a pink icon led to a significant drop in invitations, particularly from boys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:13">[01:16:13]</a>. Since both TBH and Crush indexed 60-65% women, the team decided to make the app more masculine by changing the icon to black with a flame and calling it "Gas," which dramatically increased invite rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:42">[01:16:42]</a>.

## Focus on Positive Experience
Unlike many anonymous apps that lead to bullying, Gas was designed to promote positive interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:50">[00:27:50]</a>. It used authored polls to ensure all feedback was positive (e.g., "who has the best smile," "who's most likely to be president") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:07">[00:28:07]</a>. The app made users feel good and sent a much higher volume of messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:22">[00:28:22]</a>. The team even built a system to ensure every user received a vote, by increasing the frequency of names appearing in polls if they hadn't been voted on recently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:50">[01:03:50]</a>.

Users regularly messaged the team, sharing stories of how the app helped them reconsider self-harm, highlighting its positive impact on teens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:03">[01:03:03]</a>.

## Combatting the "Human Trafficking Hoax"
A major challenge Gas faced was a widespread hoax claiming the app was used for human trafficking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:42">[01:04:42]</a>. This hoax, common for viral apps, spreads quickly because creating such content can gain teenagers followers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:11">[01:05:11]</a>.

*   **Initial Response**: The hoax started with a Snapchat story screenshot and quickly spread to App Store reviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:20">[01:13:20]</a>. At its peak, 3% of users were deleting their accounts daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:22">[01:07:22]</a>.
*   **Relentless Effort**: Nikita Bier and his team fought the hoax "at every vector possible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:22">[01:06:22]</a>:
    *   Met with journalists to ensure headlines clarified the hoax (e.g., "Gas app is not for human trafficking" in *The Washington Post*) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:28">[01:06:28]</a>.
    *   Called school superintendents and police chiefs to get public retractions from their posts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:48">[01:06:48]</a>.
    *   Asked Apple to remove review bombs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:02">[01:07:02]</a>.
    *   Nikita's girlfriend made a TikTok video explaining the hoax was false, which was shown to users deleting their accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:10">[01:07:10]</a>. This helped reduce the deletion rate to 0.1% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:31">[01:07:31]</a>.
    *   Networked to the CEO of TikTok to get false information videos deleted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:16">[01:09:16]</a>.
*   **Lessons Learned**: It's crucial to ensure the hoax's virality (K-factor) is less than the app's virality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:38">[01:09:38]</a>.

## Sale to Discord
Gas captured the "zeitgeist of Twitter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:52">[01:10:52]</a>, leading to three companies bidding to acquire it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:17">[01:11:17]</a>. Ultimately, it was sold to Discord <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:23">[01:11:23]</a>.

## Lasting Lessons from Gas
Nikita Bier emphasizes several key takeaways from the experience of building Gas:

*   **Validation Sequence**: [[developing_growth_models_for_startups | Validating product ideas]] in a specific sequence (core flow, peer spread, hopping peer groups, monetization) is crucial for [[building_and_scaling_product_innovations | zero-to-one product development]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:52">[01:11:52]</a>.
*   **Ruthless Prioritization**: When an app scales rapidly, everything breaks, requiring constant replacement and ruthless prioritization of the largest fires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:13">[01:13:13]</a>.
*   **Ethical Growth**: Always operate ethically and legally, doing right by users, as the "internet" can retaliate against unethical growth strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:21">[01:01:21]</a>.
*   **Time to Value**: Get users to the "aha moment" in seconds, demonstrating immediate value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:06">[01:27:06]</a>. This involves deeply understanding and creatively using API mechanisms in non-traditional ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:33">[01:30:33]</a>.
*   **Integrated Growth and Product**: Do not separate marketing and product growth. Everything from ads, to in-app experience, to invitations must be aligned to drive user acquisition and the flywheel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:13">[01:33:13]</a>.
*   **Product-Market Fit**: True product-market fit in consumer apps is immediately obvious; if there's any uncertainty, it's not working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:26">[00:36:26]</a>. Users will be fighting to get in, and new metrics like "hourly active users" might emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:36">[00:36:36]</a>.
*   **User Support**: Implement 24/7 live chat customer support to eliminate confounding variables during testing and gather direct user feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:45">[00:32:45]</a>.
*   **Leveraging Data**: Continually analyze analytics, understanding user funnels, and identifying milestones for activation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:50">[01:32:50]</a>.
*   **Scaling Challenges**: Maintaining an app at scale during hyper-growth is absolute chaos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:29">[01:30:29]</a>, requiring immense physical and mental effort from the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:11">[01:08:11]</a>.
*   **Target Audience**: Teens are a vital demographic for social apps due to their malleable habits, higher invitation rates, and frequent in-person interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:50">[01:10:50]</a>. Building for adults often requires significant ad spend and makes [[developing_growth_models_for_startups | network effects]] harder to achieve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:31">[01:12:31]</a>.

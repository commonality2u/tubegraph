[[finding_productmarket_fit_in_startups | Candidate Market Fit]] (CMF) is considered by Phil Terry to be the most important job search tactic, alongside the [[hiring_for_growth_roles | Job Search Council]] methodology detailed in his book *Never Search Alone* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>. This concept applies a "product lens" to the job search, much like [[product_market_fit_strategies | Product Market Fit]] applies to products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">[00:37:37]</a>.

## Understanding Candidate Market Fit
When seeking a job, individuals are in a marketplace influenced by supply and demand characteristics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:51">[00:50:51]</a>. In a down market, an abundance of supply (many job seekers) can push down an individual's [[the_importance_and_stages_of_productmarket_fit | Candidate Market Fit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:27">[00:51:27]</a>. For example, a Director of Product who might have secured a VP Product role in a strong market might now need to consider a Senior Manager role due to increased competition from more senior candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:17">[00:51:17]</a>.

The crucial takeaway is that a shifting [[identifying_and_addressing_signs_of_being_stuck_in_productmarket_fit | Candidate Market Fit]] is "not a personal statement about you; it's the marketplace" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:43">[00:21:43]</a>. Recognizing this can be a great relief, even if it's challenging to acknowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>.

## Finding Your Candidate Market Fit
The process of finding your [[framework_for_improving_productmarket_fit | Candidate Market Fit]] involves several iterative steps:

### 1. The Manukian Two-Pager: What You Want and Don't Want
The first step is a seemingly radical, yet often overlooked, exercise: clearly defining "what you want and what you don't want" in a job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>. Most people, especially when laid off, tend to "spray and pray" applications, rather than taking a moment to strategize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:12">[00:22:12]</a>.

This exercise, called the "Manukian Two-Pager" (named after Allison Manukian, a member of Phil Terry's product councils) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:02">[00:23:02]</a>, encourages you to draft a document outlining your preferences. Sharing this draft with a [[hiring_for_growth_roles | Job Search Council]] allows for collaborative learning, as others might prompt you to consider aspects you overlooked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:10">[00:24:10]</a>.

### 2. The Listening Tour: Market Research
Once you have a draft of your preferences, embark on a "listening tour" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:42">[00:24:42]</a>. Since you are the product, your skills and experience are what you're bringing to market, so you need to understand what the market wants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:46">[00:24:46]</a>. This involves speaking with:
*   **Former Colleagues (Reverse Exit Interviews):** Ask them about your strengths, what you did well, and what roles they think you'd be a good fit for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:18">[00:27:18]</a>.
*   **Broader Network:** Engage trusted friends and colleagues. Use the "golden question": "If you were in my shoes, how would you approach this?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:16">[00:25:16]</a>.
*   **Recruiters:** Instead of directly asking for a job, seek their advice on what roles they think you'd be a fit for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:42">[00:27:42]</a>. Building relationships with recruiters *before* you need a job is highly recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:06">[00:28:06]</a>.

The listening tour serves to validate your initial preferences against market realities and gather feedback on your perceived fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:20">[00:26:20]</a>. It also helps in refining your pitch and identifying who to talk to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:19">[00:29:19]</a>. People often find this step terrifying, fearing negative feedback, but often receive valuable insights and support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:10">[00:25:10]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:44">[00:25:44]</a>.

### 3. Narrowing Your Focus: Spear, Not a Net
After the listening tour, refine your [[product_market_fit_and_growth_strategy | Candidate Market Fit]] into a focused statement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:11">[00:31:11]</a>. This is critical because "when you're looking for a job you need a spear and not a net" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>. A broad approach (a "net") allows everything to "flip through" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:07">[00:32:07]</a>.

Like building a new product, a "narrow, clear focus" is essential for [[building_productmarket_fit_through_strategic_focus | product market fit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:33">[00:31:33]</a>. This CMF statement should typically have three to four attributes, such as:
*   Level of role (e.g., Director of Product) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:46">[00:31:46]</a>
*   Industry (e.g., healthcare) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:48">[00:31:48]</a>
*   Company stage (e.g., Series B startup) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:49">[00:31:49]</a>
*   Location (e.g., San Francisco) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:50">[00:31:50]</a>
*   Cultural aspects (e.g., remote-first, specific policies) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:39">[00:35:39]</a>
*   Specific needs (e.g., companies without a design team, or needing to reboot one) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:41">[00:33:41]</a>

While it feels counterintuitive to narrow your options, people are naturally expansive when given a specific target. If you tell someone you're looking for a very specific role (e.g., "Director of Product at a healthcare Series B startup in San Francisco"), they can be expansive and suggest related, but different, roles that might fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:39">[00:32:39]</a>. However, if you say "I'll take any product job," people won't remember you or be able to help you focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:41">[00:32:41]</a>.

Your [[hiring_for_growth_roles | Job Search Council]] provides essential support in navigating this challenging narrowing process and interpreting feedback from your listening tour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:25">[00:30:25]</a>. Once refined, you should share your [[the_sean_ellis_test__understanding_product_market_fit | Candidate Market Fit]] statement with your network and on platforms like LinkedIn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:15">[00:34:15]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:25">[00:34:25]</a>. This statement should be concise, ideally a single sentence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:56">[00:35:56]</a>.

## Examples of Adjusting Candidate Market Fit
*   **EVP at a Traditional Media Company:** An EVP running a digital streaming business at an "old media company" wanted to join a top streaming company like Netflix or Apple TV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:22">[00:38:22]</a>. Through his listening tour, he learned that his [[hiring_for_growth_roles | Candidate Market Fit]] for such a company was as an individual contributor (IC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:03">[00:39:03]</a>. Despite running hundreds of people and having senior perks previously, he accepted the IC role, which ultimately transformed his career by giving him experience at a top streamer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:18">[00:39:18]</a>.
*   **Chief Product Officer (CPO) in a Startup:** A CPO at a startup, who was the only product person, realized she lacked sufficient product training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>. Her [[hiring_for_growth_roles | Candidate Market Fit]] shifted to an IC role at a larger tech company, which was the right path for her learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:16">[00:40:16]</a>.
*   **VP Product aspiring to COO:** A VP Product desired a COO role but discovered through his listening tour that the market considered him a fit only for COO roles at companies facing significant bankruptcy, which he learned the hard way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:21">[00:41:21]</a>. He ultimately returned to a VP Product role, realizing a two-step strategy (gaining COO experience *within* a company) was necessary to achieve his goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:41">[00:41:41]</a>.

These examples illustrate that finding your [[hiring_for_growth_roles | Candidate Market Fit]] may involve accepting a "two-step strategy," where you take a role that isn't your ultimate goal but positions you for future opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:39">[00:40:39]</a>. It emphasizes the importance of staying close to the "technology frontier" to avoid getting stuck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:27">[00:42:27]</a>.

## Playing to Win with Candidate Market Fit
Applying the [[the_sean_ellis_test__understanding_product_market_fit | Candidate Market Fit]] approach also influences how you "play to win" in interviews and negotiations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:15">[00:49:15]</a>. This means taking charge and demonstrating your value, rather than being a "ruthless negotiator" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:37">[00:49:37]</a>.

A key tactic is to create your own "job mission with OKRs (Objectives and Key Results)" for the role you're interviewing for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:28">[00:50:28]</a>.
*   This document helps you formulate insightful interview questions to clarify the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:21">[00:51:21]</a>.
*   Presenting this draft privately to the hiring manager demonstrates initiative, accountability, and a proactive mindset, distinguishing you from other candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:01">[00:53:01]</a>.
*   It also clarifies expectations, helping to prevent the common scenario where "Job A turns out to be Job B" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:23">[00:53:23]</a>.
*   The job mission with OKRs also sets the stage for negotiations by allowing you to discuss resources, support, and budget needed to achieve those OKRs, demonstrating your commitment to success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:11">[00:54:11]</a>.

Even if you need to take "any job" for immediate needs, understanding your [[hiring_for_growth_roles | Candidate Market Fit]] and maintaining engagement with your [[hiring_for_growth_roles | Job Search Council]] is crucial to avoid getting stuck in an undesirable role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:55">[00:37:55]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:11">[00:38:11]</a>.

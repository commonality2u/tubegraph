## The Core Guiding Light: Impact

A fundamental principle for [[Career Growth Strategies for Product Managers | product managers]] is to wake up every day striving to have the biggest [[impact_in_product_management | impact]] possible within the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This focus on [[impact_in_product_management | impact]], rather than politics or promotion, should guide daily activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:53">[00:25:53]</a>. For leaders, this extends to using their team to achieve maximum company [[impact_in_product_management | impact]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Attributes of a Top Product Manager

Ian McAllister, who has managed over 100 [[Role of Product Managers in Organizations | product managers]] in his [[Career Growth Strategies for Product Managers | career]] at companies like Amazon, Airbnb, and Uber, authored a classic post detailing what differentiates a top 1% PM from others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. He shared a comprehensive list of attributes, emphasizing that no single PM excels at all of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>.

### Key Skills for Product Managers

The attributes of a top product manager include:
*   **Think big:** Continuously seek opportunities for greater [[impact_in_product_management | impact]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>, expanding the scope of a problem or solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:40">[00:23:40]</a>. This involves thinking beyond the typical product scope and considering anything that influences the product's success or customer success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:51">[00:30:51]</a>.
*   **Communicate:** A crucial skill for [[Key Skills for Product Managers | product managers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>, serving as a test of their thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. It's a skill that requires continuous improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>.
*   **Simplify:** Achieve more with fewer resources by simplifying approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.
*   **Prioritize:** Considered a core skill for a PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. Effective prioritization can lead to five times the [[impact_in_product_management | impact]] compared to those without this skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>.
*   **Forecasting and measuring:** Essential for building instincts by predicting outcomes, executing, and then validating results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>.
*   **Execute:** Shipping and delivering on commitments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.
*   **Understanding technical trade-offs:** While not needing to be a software engineer, understanding technical limitations and possibilities helps simplify and maximize resource utilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.
*   **Understanding good design:** Crucial for customer-focused products, aiding in thinking from the customer's perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>.
*   **Writing effective copy:** Directly impacts communication with customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>.
*   **Earn trust with others:** A critical attribute, especially for product leaders, as trust is the "currency" of a PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. Trust is built by consistently setting and meeting expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:38">[00:24:38]</a>.
*   **Digging for data:** Developing skills to find and analyze data independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>.
*   **Pushing back effectively:** A skill correlated with the ability to grow and succeed as a leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>.
*   **Adapting to change:** Influences morale and effectiveness in rallying the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>.
*   **Driven by impact not promotion:** Focus on [[impact_in_product_management | impact]] as the primary motivator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>.

### Focus for New Product Managers

For new [[Pathways to break into product management | product managers]], the top three skills to master are:
1.  **Communicate** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>: Continuously work on being a better communicator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>. A key tactic is to "Answer First and then explain," or sometimes "Answer and then shut up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>. Learn from feedback by self-reflecting on how a question could have been answered better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>.
2.  **Prioritize** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>: This is the number one key tool of a product manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>. It extends beyond choosing projects to include themes, sequencing, scope, and time management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>.
3.  **Execute** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>: This involves molding a product into a simple, compact package with the highest possible [[impact_in_product_management | impact]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>. It requires fostering the team's ability to ship and continuously improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>. Product managers are the "motive power" behind execution and [[impact_in_product_management | impact]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>.

New PMs should focus on these foundational skills, as other attributes like "think big" or "understand technical trade-offs" become increasingly vital as they grow in seniority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a>.

### Focus for Senior Product Managers

For senior [[Career Growth Strategies for Product Managers | product managers]], the focus shifts to:
1.  **Communicate** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:16">[00:23:16]</a>: Still paramount, but the stakes are higher when communicating with senior leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:20">[00:23:20]</a>.
2.  **Think big** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:25">[00:23:25]</a>: Similar to Warren Buffett's "hunt for bigger elephants," senior PMs should consistently ask if their ideas can be bigger and more impactful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>. This often means acting like a General Manager (GM) for the product, taking a wider view of what success entails beyond just product or tech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:27">[00:30:27]</a>.
3.  **Earn trust with others** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>: This becomes even more critical in senior roles as trust is the currency for gaining resources and influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:11">[00:24:11]</a>. It involves consistently meeting expectations, being honest, owning mistakes, and fostering true partnerships with other leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:57">[00:24:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:50">[00:33:50]</a>.
4.  **Driven by impact not promotion** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:42">[00:25:42]</a>: While important at all levels, for senior PMs, impact directly correlates with growth and increased responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:43">[00:27:43]</a>. Focusing on growing the business drives promotions as a natural result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:32">[00:26:32]</a>.

### The Power of Writing Online
Writing publicly, such as sharing thoughts on product development, can significantly impact one's [[Career Growth Strategies for Product Managers | career trajectory]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. It helps structure personal thoughts, crystallize ideas, and fosters connections within the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. The process of organizing and compacting thoughts for an external audience sharpens thinking and communication skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

## Working Backwards: The Amazon Way

Ian McAllister spent 12 years at Amazon, where he deeply internalized the "working backwards" process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">[00:37:37]</a>. This approach became a core part of Amazon's operational rigor, largely influenced by leaders like Jeff Bezos and Jeff Wilkie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:16">[00:42:16]</a>.

### The Essence of Working Backwards

The "working backwards" process is fundamentally about starting with the customer problem and obsessing over it before moving to the solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:11">[00:47:11]</a>.

> "Working backwards is all about the problem and kind of starting there and obsessing about the problem and being guided by it to then go into the solution." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:11">[00:47:11]</a>

### Common Mistakes in Implementing Working Backwards

The most common mistake teams make when trying to implement working backwards is that they don't truly start with the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:22">[00:47:22]</a>. Instead, they begin with a desired solution or a combination of existing technologies and then retrospectively fit a problem to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:25">[00:47:25]</a>. This is evident when discussions revolve around combining existing "ingredients" or technologies rather than addressing a compelling customer pain point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:24">[00:57:24]</a>.

### The Working Backwards Mechanism (Press Release & FAQ)

Amazon enforces working backwards through a specific mechanism: the internal press release and FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) document <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:40">[00:50:40]</a>.
*   **Press Release:** Outlines the customer problem, the proposed solution, and often includes a customer quote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:56">[00:50:56]</a>.
*   **FAQ:** Addresses potential questions and concerns, outlining a "legitimate plan to succeed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:02">[00:51:02]</a>. This section helps assess whether the idea is big, whether the company should be doing it, and if there's a viable plan to achieve it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:06">[00:56:06]</a>.

The press release and FAQ are tools to *enforce* problem-first thinking, not merely to announce a product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:15">[00:51:15]</a>. The core concept is to think about the problem first, then the solution that addresses it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:27">[00:51:27]</a>. While this mechanism is effective, the spirit of working backwards—starting with the customer problem—can be applied in various formats depending on the organization's culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:12">[00:51:12]</a>.

### The Importance of Operational Rigor
Amazon's culture, heavily influenced by Jeff Wilkie, emphasized an "operational mindset" and rigor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:41">[00:42:41]</a>. This means that a product leader's role isn't just about building new things, but also about effectively running what has already been built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:34">[00:44:34]</a>. Paying attention to the operational aspects of a product can generate ideas for improvement or expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:41">[00:44:41]</a>.

### Continuous Improvement
Both product leadership and the working backwards process emphasize a continuous improvement mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:52">[00:42:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:10">[00:37:10]</a>. This involves reflecting on past experiences, whether successful or not, to identify areas for growth and apply lessons learned to future situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:12">[00:37:12]</a>. Jeff Wilkie exemplified this by teaching the "why" behind decisions, fostering deeper understanding and enabling others to apply mental models to future challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:47">[00:45:47]</a>.

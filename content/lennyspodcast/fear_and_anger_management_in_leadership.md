Matt Mashari, an executive coach, emphasizes the critical importance of understanding and managing fear and anger in leadership. These emotions often cause leaders to make decisions that are counterproductive to their goals and the health of their organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

## Understanding Fear

Fear is identified as the primary struggle for many successful founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. When gripped by fear, a leader's mind becomes unable to see reality clearly, leading to exaggerated predictions and preventing them from taking necessary, albeit difficult, actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:09:45]</a>.

### Fear Gives Bad Advice
A core tenet of Mashari's [[coaching_strategies_for_ceos_and_leaders | coaching]] is that "fear is actually giving you bad advice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. For instance, a CEO might predict that revealing a business problem to the board will lead to a loss of trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. However, Mashari posits that the opposite is true: transparency often builds trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.

To demonstrate this, Mashari often makes "bets" with his clients. He predicts that the opposite of their fear-driven outcome will occur in low-stakes situations. Having never lost these bets, clients learn that fear distorts reality and that acting against it is often beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.

The overall advice for dealing with fear in areas of ego or perceived danger (not physical danger) is to do the opposite of what your brain is telling you to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. It is helpful to check with someone who is not in fear, as they will be able to see clearly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>.

## Understanding Anger

Mashari acknowledges his own struggles with anger, where he acts on it without realizing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>. Anger is seen as destructive, particularly to relationships, especially with those closest to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>.

### Anger as a Cover for Pain
A recent insight shared by Mashari is that "anger is not a base emotion; anger is actually a cover" for pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>. The brain externalizes this pain to avoid feeling it, pushing it onto others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>. The true solution is to allow oneself to feel the pain, even though it hurts, to prevent pushing it onto other people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>.

### Receiving Feedback on Anger
To manage his own anger, Mashari developed a method with his wife for her to provide feedback without him becoming defensive. Initial attempts like "You're in anger" (accusatory) or "Are you in anger?" (passive-aggressive) were ineffective and caused more anger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>. The successful phrasing became:

> "I perceive you to be in anger." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>

This "I statement" is a perception, not a judgment, allowing Mashari to recognize and stop acting on his anger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>. This technique is part of [[challenging_leadership_styles_and_seeking_feedback | challenging leadership styles and seeking feedback]].

## Practical Application in Leadership

Emotions, particularly fear and anger, can derail decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>. While fear can be a powerful short-term motivator, akin to adrenaline, it is corrosive and detracts from enjoyment of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:26">[01:00:26]</a>. Joy, in contrast, offers long-term, consistent motivation without being corrosive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:42">[01:00:42]</a>.

### Managing Difficult Conversations (e.g., Layoffs)
Mashari applies these principles to challenging leadership situations, such as conducting layoffs. He highlights that the single biggest marker between a botched layoff and a successful one is whether the individual hears the news from their manager in a one-on-one conversation, rather than through an email or group communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:02">[00:47:02]</a>. Impersonal communication feels dehumanizing and leads to anger and public backlash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

A key technique for difficult conversations is to:
1.  **Prepare the person**: Start by saying, "This is going to be a difficult conversation. I want you to take a few seconds and prepare yourself. You are not going to enjoy this." This warns the person, helping to prevent the amygdala from being triggered by surprise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>.
2.  **Deliver the news**: Clearly state the decision, e.g., "I'm letting you go" and provide the reason <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:51">[00:30:51]</a>.
3.  **Allow emotion and actively listen**: Ask the person to share their thoughts and feelings, acknowledging their probable anger, fear, or sadness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>. Making them feel heard, even if you imagine their strong, unsaid thoughts, helps them process emotions and feel respected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:32">[00:31:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:18">[00:33:18]</a>. This active listening and validation are crucial for mitigating trauma and promoting recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:34">[00:31:34]</a>.

Ethan Evans, a former Vice President at Amazon, executive coach, and course creator, has conducted over 2,200 interviews throughout his career, offering valuable insights into [[job_search_strategies_and_candidate_market_fit | effective interviewing and candidate selection]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:12">[00:36:12]</a>. His advice focuses on standing out as a candidate and understanding what hiring managers seek <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:27">[00:36:27]</a>.

## Key Factors in Interviews

According to Evans, the top two factors in any interview are **appearance and enthusiasm** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:33">[00:36:33]</a>.

### Appearance and Enthusiasm
Candidates should show up looking interested and engaged, not in pajamas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:40">[00:36:40]</a>. Enthusiasm is crucial because people want to work with those who want to work with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:49">[00:36:49]</a>. Appearing judgmental of the company can be a turn-off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:54">[00:36:54]</a>. Even if a candidate decides they don't want the job, they should still aim to get an offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>. Approaching every interview with excitement and showing knowledge about the company is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:02">[00:37:02]</a>.

### Demonstrating Impact
Beyond superficial factors, the most critical aspect, especially for higher-level roles, is demonstrating impact rather than merely listing tasks completed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:21">[00:37:21]</a>. Leaders hire to solve problems or fulfill needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:35">[00:37:35]</a>. Candidates should explain how their past actions made a difference or helped previous employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:42">[00:37:42]</a>. Highlighting contributions that solved major problems or changed company/customer outlook demonstrates leadership potential and a business understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:02">[00:38:02]</a>.

## Virtual Interview Tips
For virtual interviews, candidates should show full-time dedication by avoiding distractions like taking calls from a car or keeping their camera off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:39">[00:38:39]</a>. Eye contact, body language, and gestures remain important for projecting enthusiasm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:45">[00:38:45]</a>. Being fully present and energetic is a significant advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:14">[00:39:14]</a>. Over-obsessing about content might be less effective than focusing on how one comes across <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:20">[00:39:20]</a>.

## Manager's Perspective on Hiring
Managers are often overwhelmed and appreciate help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>. They have selfish motivations to promote strong, capable direct reports who can take on more of their job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:22">[00:28:22]</a>.

When hiring, a key [[interview_questions_for_candidates | interview question for candidates]] is to "tell me about a time where you needed to disagree with your management, where you needed to stand up or fight for a position against higher leadership or people in power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:02">[01:15:02]</a>. This reveals a candidate's backbone and willingness to challenge, which is essential for leadership roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:19">[01:15:19]</a>.

## Amazon's Leadership Principles in Hiring
Evans contributed to crafting the language for one of Amazon's 14 core [[lessons_in_hiring_and_team_building | leadership principles]]: **Ownership** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:51">[01:00:51]</a>. The phrase he proposed, "an owner never says that's not my job," became part of the principle and remains impactful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:27">[01:02:27]</a>. This principle emphasizes taking responsibility beyond one's immediate role.

Another principle Evans values is **Bias for Action**, which states that speed matters in business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:30">[01:03:30]</a>. Many decisions are reversible, making it crucial to move quickly in a competitive environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:38">[01:03:38]</a>. Being quick is often necessary, even if it means taking calculated gambles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:48">[01:03:48]</a>. This principle was also central to Jeff Bezos's approach at Blue Origin, emphasizing decisiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:39">[01:04:39]</a>.

The principle "Leaders are right, a lot" was refined to include that "leaders actively work to disconfirm their beliefs" and "seek diverse perspectives" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:42">[01:07:42]</a>. This means constantly questioning one's own assumptions and considering different viewpoints, especially for broad customer bases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:03">[01:08:03]</a>.

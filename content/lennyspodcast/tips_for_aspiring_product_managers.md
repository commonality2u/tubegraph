For individuals looking to [[transitioning_into_product_management | transition into product management]] or grow their careers in the field, gaining practical experience and developing key skills even before formally entering the role is highly recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:08">[01:30:08]</a>.

## Leverage Diverse Backgrounds

There is a belief that some of the best product managers come from non-traditional backgrounds, as they often bring empathy gained from being on the "other side" of product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:50">[01:29:50]</a>. Having diverse experiences can provide unique perspectives on user problems and solutions.

## Cultivate Product Sense through Immersion

Becoming a product manager involves continuous training and immersion in the craft, similar to accumulating "10,000 hours" of practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>. This means actively engaging with products and refining your [[traits_and_skills_for_successful_product_managers | product sense]] over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:16">[00:37:16]</a>.

### Practical Exercises:
To prepare for a product management role, consider the following exercises:
*   **Identify Problems in Existing Products** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:11">[01:30:11]</a>:
    *   Open your favorite apps and identify the "top 10 problems" you observe users having with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:11">[01:30:11]</a>.
    *   This also includes identifying technical debt issues, as infrastructure is considered part of the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:30">[00:55:30]</a>.
    *   Continuously update this list of known problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:10">[00:33:10]</a>.
*   **Sketch Solutions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:17">[01:30:17]</a>:
    *   For each identified problem, take a Post-it note and sketch out what the world could look like if that problem were solved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:17">[01:30:17]</a>.
    *   This helps in visualizing the future state and training your intuition about what works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:18">[00:32:18]</a>. Don't let the lack of a designer be an excuse; draw it out yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:10">[00:27:10]</a>.

This continuous practice helps in training your [[strategies_for_career_growth_and_breaking_into_product_management | product sense]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:22">[01:30:22]</a>.

## Understand the Core Craft: Clarity and Conviction

The fundamental craft of product management involves bringing [[common_challenges_and_solutions_in_product_management | Clarity]] and [[common_challenges_and_solutions_in_product_management | Conviction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:01">[00:57:01]</a>.

*   **Clarity** is about achieving transparency and simplicity in understanding, removing extraneous information to focus on the core problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:28">[00:58:28]</a>. This includes being clear in communication, such as what action is expected from an email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:33">[00:57:33]</a>.
*   **Conviction** is having a strong belief or "feeling of what you think the way the world should be" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:17">[01:05:17]</a>. It's about being able to state definitively what you believe is the right direction, even in the face of uncertainty, and driving towards that vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:09">[01:06:09]</a>.

> "Product sense... it's a feeling, right? It's a sense of what is right." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:13">[00:37:13]</a>

## Develop a Vision

A key aspect of product management, and a common area for development, is the ability to develop a vision for a product or company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

### Elements of a Good Vision:
A good vision should be:
*   Lofty: Inspiring and exciting, feeling almost scary but in a good way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
*   Realistic and Attainable: Not so "pie in the sky" that it feels out of reach for most people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
*   Devoid of Current Limitations: Imagine the future without being constrained by today's technical or resource limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.
*   Grounded in a Clear Problem: It must address a potent and exciting problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

### Communicating a Vision:
Various methods can be used to communicate a product vision:
*   **"Once Upon a Time" Framework**: A simple storytelling template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:08">[01:15:08]</a>:
    *   "Once Upon a Time [problem existed]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:01">[01:16:01]</a>
    *   "[Consequences of the problem]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:07">[01:16:07]</a>
    *   "And because of that [further negative impact]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:58">[01:16:58]</a>
    *   "One day [the solution/big change happened]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:09">[01:17:09]</a>
    *   "And as a result [the positive change in the world/dent in the universe]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:50">[01:19:50]</a>
*   **Future News Article**: Write a headline and subtitle, or even a full article, from a future publication (e.g., TechCrunch, The Verge) describing the success of the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:41">[01:17:41]</a>.
*   **Visual Mock-ups/Sketches**: Work with a designer, or sketch yourself, what the future product looks like. This visual representation can excite people and convey possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:26">[01:18:26]</a>.

For aspiring PMs, begin by identifying top problems and sketching solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:40">[01:54:40]</a>.

## Embrace the Mindset: Opportunity Meets Preparation

Success in product management is not solely about luck; it's about being prepared when opportunities arise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:27">[01:30:27]</a>. By continually practicing and developing your product skills, you are always ready for the next step.

> "Opportunity meets preparation, you're already prepared." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:29">[01:30:29]</a>

This advice emphasizes that [[strategies_for_career_growth_and_breaking_into_product_management | breaking into product management]] is an ongoing journey of learning and applying [[career_growth_strategies_for_product_managers | career growth strategies for product managers]], not just a single transition point. Aspiring PMs can use free resources like YouTube to learn new skills, such as DJing, demonstrating the power of self-directed learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:40">[01:36:40]</a>.

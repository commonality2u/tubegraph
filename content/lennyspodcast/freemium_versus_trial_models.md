Elena Verna, an expert in growth strategy, highlights key distinctions and best practices when considering [[different_pricing_models_and_when_to_use_them | freemium versus trial models]] for product growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:20">[01:18:20]</a>.

## Defining the Models

*   **Freemium:** A model where users are allowed to use a product in some free capacity, often with feature or usage walls, but with an ongoing "forever free" component <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:09">[00:42:09]</a>.
*   **Trial:** Similar to freemium in allowing free product usage, but with a specific time component, making it time-bound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:26">[00:42:26]</a>.

While fundamentally similar in offering free usage, the key difference lies in the trial's "superficial time bound" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:34">[00:42:34]</a>.

## The Problem with Time-Bound Trials

Time-bound trials often create issues because the amount of time required for users to try a product can vary significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:47">[00:42:47]</a>. For instance, a small startup might complete a project in 24-48 hours, while a large enterprise with numerous dependencies could take a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:56">[00:42:56]</a>.

A 7-day trial, for example, might suit a small startup but completely alienate a large enterprise that needs more time to assess the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:12">[00:43:12]</a>. This means companies using time-based trials, especially in B2B, risk alienating larger organizations from genuinely trying their products, unless they repeatedly renew trials for months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:21">[00:43:21]</a>.

Verna advises against creating a "superficial time component" that isn't a good measure of how long it takes to derive value from a product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:41">[00:43:41]</a>.

## Strategic Reasons for Freemium

Instead of time-bound trials, freemium models offer various strategic advantages beyond mere conversion rate optimization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:52">[00:49:52]</a>:

*   **Proof of Concept (POC):** Freemium can serve as an excellent POC, allowing users to play around with the product and understand if it's the right solution without time pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:55">[00:43:55]</a>. For instance, MongoDB offers a free, shared cluster that is suitable for prototyping but not for production use cases, effectively acting as a usage-based freemium without a time limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:03">[00:44:03]</a>.
*   **Indirect Monetization (Virality/Network Effects):** Freemium can drive [[the_role_of_referrals_and_freemium_in_product_growth | indirect monetization]] through virality or network effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:50">[00:47:50]</a>.
    *   Miro offers three editable boards for free, which is enough for some users. This is acceptable because these free users acquire others by sharing and collaborating on boards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:57">[00:47:57]</a>.
    *   SurveyMonkey had half of its user base as free users who were healthy and retained, and these users were responsible for 100% of their acquisition, reducing the need for extensive marketing and sales spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:16">[00:48:16]</a>.
*   **Strategic Land:** A freemium model can help land customers you might not intend to monetize immediately, but with whom you want to expand later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:41">[00:48:41]</a>.
*   **Commoditization:** If your offering is becoming commoditized, freemium might be a necessity. The challenge then becomes differentiating yourself within the free space through innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:47">[00:48:47]</a>.
*   **Breeding Ground for Discovery:** Freemium can be a "breeding ground for adjacent use cases and adjacent personas" that allow companies to discover new market trends and pivot their roadmap accordingly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:11">[00:49:11]</a>.
*   **Data Collection for Product Building:** Freemium can be used to collect data that helps build and improve paid products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:25">[00:49:25]</a>. LinkedIn, for example, built its Sales Navigator and recruiting products on top of a strong freemium base, which was essential for selling its paid offerings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:30">[00:49:30]</a>.

## What to Make Free

When deciding what to offer for free, consider the following:
*   **Indirect Monetization:** If it helps drive virality or network effects, it should likely be free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:34">[00:50:34]</a>.
*   **Universal Sufficiency:** If the feature suffices for nearly every user regardless of complexity, it might be a commoditized feature and should be free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:40">[00:50:40]</a>.
*   **Aha Moment:** If it helps users reach their "aha moment" quickly, it should be part of the free offering as a POC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:51">[00:50:51]</a>.
*   **Habit Loops:** Features that create habit loops, like notifications or communication channels, should be free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:58">[00:50:58]</a>.

Generally, anything that creates friction for the growth model should be gated in the paid tier, while anything that promotes the growth model should be free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:09">[00:51:09]</a>. The ultimate goal is to understand how the free offering helps achieve growth outcomes without sacrificing monetization potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:27">[00:51:27]</a>.

Even products with high-friction activations, like Octa, Zendesk, Looker, Amplitude, MongoDB, Twilio, and Contentful, are moving towards or already have some version of freemium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:18">[00:45:18]</a>. This shift is driven by the industry's continuous innovation to lower the cost of provisioning complicated workflows via self-serve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:32">[00:46:32]</a>. If a company doesn't adopt freemium, a competitor likely will, leveraging it as a "Trojan horse" into organizations through user focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:09">[00:47:09]</a>.

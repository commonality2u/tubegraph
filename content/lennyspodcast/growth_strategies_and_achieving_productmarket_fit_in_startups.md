Linear, an issue-tracking system for software companies and technical teams, was founded in 2019 with the goal of building a frictionless and streamlined system for modern software development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. Co-founded by Ki Sarin, who previously held roles as founding designer at Coinbase and principal designer at Airbnb, the company's approach to growth and achieving product-market fit is notably unique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Focus on Craft and Quality

Linear operates with a strong emphasis on "craft and quality," intentionally avoiding A/B tests and metric-based goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. This focus stems from the belief that good design is crucial as an industry matures and becomes more crowded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:50">[00:25:50]</a>. While early iterations of new paradigms (like mobile or web) didn't require "super well-designed" products, today's market demands a "pretty high level design" from the outset to capture attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

> [!info] Design as a Differentiator
> The more crowded a product category becomes, the more opportunity there is for design to be a differentiator, as users often choose products that "look most interesting" or "most quality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:13">[00:29:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:40">[00:29:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:51">[00:29:51]</a>.

However, design alone isn't enough; the product must also offer something "better" or "different" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>. Design and a strong brand can enable [[growth_strategies_for_startup_apps | user acquisition]] and [[customer_interactions_and_productmarket_fit | user retention]] by setting expectations of quality before a user even tries the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:54">[00:27:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:02">[00:28:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:18">[00:28:18]</a>.

## The Linear Method: Building Opinionated Software

Linear espouses a philosophy of building "opinionated software," especially for productivity tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:41">[00:38:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:37">[00:39:37]</a>. This means providing "good defaults or good opinions" on how features and workflows operate, reducing the need for users or teams to spend time "figuring things out" and allowing them to focus on their actual work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:27">[00:40:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:31">[00:40:31]</a>. The core idea is to design for "someone," rather than trying to design "everything for everyone," which often leads to generalized solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:45">[00:40:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:50">[00:40:50]</a>.

## Initial Growth and [[stages_of_productmarket_fit | Product-Market Fit]]

Linear's journey to [[stages_of_productmarket_fit | product-market fit]] involved several strategic steps:

### Early Prototyping and Technical Foundation
The co-founders spent months before their official launch exploring and prototyping the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:43">[01:08:43]</a>. A key decision was to build a locally-based data structure where data lives on the client and syncs with the back end, enabling the application to be "really fast" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:03">[01:09:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:05">[01:09:05]</a>.

### Controlled Private Beta (One Year)
After officially starting in April 2019, Linear launched a small website with a waitlist and began inviting users by May <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:31">[01:09:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:39">[01:09:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:44">[01:09:44]</a>. They remained in private beta for almost a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:07">[01:10:07]</a>.

*   **Waitlist Strategy**: The waitlist included survey questions asking about current tools used, reasons for wanting Linear, and company size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:13">[01:10:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:24">[01:10:24]</a>. This allowed them to selectively invite "smaller companies using the tools we currently supported" and those genuinely interested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:26">[01:10:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:34">[01:10:34]</a>. Initially, the process was manual, with Ki personally reading surveys and sending invites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:49">[01:12:49]</a>.
*   **Cohort-based Feedback**: Instead of inviting everyone at once, they invited small cohorts (e.g., 10 people a week initially) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:06">[01:13:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:07">[01:13:07]</a>. This prevented overwhelming them with duplicate feedback on early-stage bugs, allowing them to fix issues for one cohort before inviting the next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:18">[01:13:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:36">[01:13:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:49">[01:13:49]</a>. This iterative approach made initial development "much more like an effective way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:06">[01:14:06]</a>.
*   **Flexible Pricing Experiment**: During the private beta, they implemented an optional payment page where users could choose how much to pay per seat via a slider (from $1 to $20) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:04">[01:15:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:09">[01:15:09]</a>. While not providing enough data for definitive pricing, it gave confidence that a market existed for their product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:47">[01:15:47]</a>.

### Public Launch and Initial Product-Market Fit
A year after the private beta, Linear publicly launched in June <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:42">[01:10:42]</a>. At this point, they already had several hundred companies using the product, and almost all of them subscribed to the paid plan upon launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:48">[01:10:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:57">[01:10:57]</a>.

> [!info] [[challenges_of_achieving_productmarket_fit | Product-Market Fit]] as a Spectrum
> Linear views [[stages_of_productmarket_fit | product-market fit]] not as a binary "have it or don't have it," but as a spectrum of confidence and a process of "slowly acquiring territory" within specific market segments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:15">[01:19:15]</a>. They constantly question if they truly have it and with whom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:42">[01:16:42]</a>.

Initially, Linear found strong [[stages_of_productmarket_fit | product-market fit]] with "smaller, early-stage companies" where founders were still deeply involved in product development and valued speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:07">[01:17:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:11">[01:17:11]</a>. Their initial goal was to become the "default tool for startups," which they achieved by purely focusing on that segment for the first two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:18">[01:18:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:25">[01:18:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:28">[01:18:28]</a>. They then started focusing on achieving stronger [[stages_of_productmarket_fit | product-market fit]] with larger companies over the next two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:43">[01:18:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:51">[01:18:51]</a>.

> [!quote] Following the Pull
> If you're doing really well in some category, "just like kind of double down on that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:21">[01:20:21]</a>. This is similar to how Zoom focused on specific customer types (e.g., universities) once they saw early success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:37">[01:20:37]</a>. It's essential to follow "poll" and attention where "something's working really well" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:16">[01:21:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:58">[01:20:58]</a>.

Linear observed "pull" from specific company types, such as crypto companies initially, and more recently, AI companies, which guides their strategic thinking on how to attract more users from those segments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:26">[01:21:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:30">[01:21:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:39">[01:21:39]</a>.

## Building a Brand for Growth

Building an "authentic" brand is crucial, as people can sense when something "is off" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:59">[01:30:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>. A brand is not merely a logo or colors but is built over time through consistent actions, communication, customer treatment, and product quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:14">[01:31:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:41">[01:31:41]</a>. For a startup, especially early on, a strong brand can provide "very good leverage" by setting expectations and drawing users in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:57">[01:28:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:03">[01:29:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>.

When announcing a company, it's important to consider the "first audience" – who are the best early users, where are they, and what language do they use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:54">[01:23:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:02">[01:24:02]</a>. Linear's founders, being software builders themselves, wrote their announcement in a direct and authentic way that resonated with their target technical audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:23">[01:23:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:09">[01:24:09]</a>.

## Unique Team Structure to Support Growth

Linear's growth is supported by a lean team philosophy. They believe in building "better with less people," never more than doubling their team size in a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:47">[00:57:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:09">[00:58:09]</a>. This requires hiring high-caliber individuals who possess a "broader perspective" and "product sensibility" beyond their specific roles, for example, engineers with product thinking or marketing hires with a strong appreciation for writing and storytelling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:42">[00:58:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:15">[00:59:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:32">[00:59:32]</a>. This fosters a culture where employees are willing to take on broader scope and help across functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:08">[01:00:08]</a>.

The company focuses on a "magic and science" approach, where "science" involves extensive user research and understanding customer problems, and "magic" is the intuitive decision-making that emerges from this deep understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:34">[00:45:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:59">[00:45:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:16">[00:46:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:11">[00:47:11]</a>. This emphasis on intuition means they don't rely on A/B testing or specific metrics goals for features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:48">[00:46:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:47">[00:43:47]</a>.

> [!info] Focus on the Main Quest
> For Founders, a key to [[growth_hacking_and_sustainable_growth_strategies | staying focused]] and avoiding distractions ("shiny objects" or "side quests") is to constantly ask: "Is this important to do now?" and "Does this help the customers, does it help the product?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:23">[00:53:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:49">[00:54:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:48">[00:55:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:01">[00:56:01]</a>. This helps prioritize efforts on core product development and customer value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:11">[00:56:11]</a>.

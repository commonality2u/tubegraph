Hiring the right talent for Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is crucial for growth, yet it is often under-resourced compared to other channels like advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Companies like Zillow or eBay, spending tens of millions on ads, should proportionally invest in a strong SEO team to leverage the equally significant traffic potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## When to Invest in SEO Talent

Before hiring, assess if SEO is a viable [[seo_as_a_growth_strategy | growth strategy]] for your company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>:

*   **Addressable Market Size:** Is the market for your product or service large enough to generate significant search traffic? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a> Most markets are, but it's important to confirm by analyzing competitors using tools like Similarweb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.
*   **Existing Authority/Traction:** Google prefers to rank credible domains, not just "SEO farms" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.
    *   **Non-SEO Traffic:** Aim for at least 1,000 daily visits from channels other than search (direct, paid, email, social) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>. This indicates brand credibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>.
    *   **Referring Domains:** Have at least 1,000 referring domains linking to your site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. The more authority you have, the faster and easier you can grow through SEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.

If these benchmarks aren't met, it might be too early to heavily invest in SEO. Focus on overall company growth first, as organic growth often naturally builds SEO authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>. Compare the potential SEO return on investment (ROI) with other channels like paid ads or social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:02">[00:23:02]</a>.

## Types of SEO Roles and Corresponding Talent Profiles

SEO broadly encompasses three areas: Programmatic, Editorial, and Technical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:45">[00:18:45]</a>. The type of talent needed depends on the primary SEO strategy.

### Programmatic SEO

[[ai_and_programmatic_seo | Programmatic SEO]] involves automatically generating pages from a database of information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>, such as product pages for eBay or address pages for Zillow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a>.

*   **Skills Needed:** This is a highly specialized area due to nuances in indexation logic, keyword clustering, and handling User-Generated Content (UGC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:05">[00:46:05]</a>.
*   **Ideal Candidate:** Look for a "growth person with technical ability" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:43">[00:47:43]</a>. They don't necessarily need to write code but must be able to work effectively with engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:28">[00:49:28]</a>.
*   **Where to Find Them:** Instead of focusing on well-known brands, seek individuals who have achieved significant SEO growth (e.g., 80% of traffic from SEO) at less-known companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:05">[00:48:05]</a>. These individuals often demonstrate superior problem-solving skills due to a harder route to success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:34">[00:48:34]</a>.
*   **Day-to-Day Activities:**
    *   Analyzing competitors' sites to reverse-engineer successful patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:45">[00:49:45]</a>.
    *   Defining product requirements for automated page generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:26">[00:50:26]</a>.
    *   Manually or programmatically clustering keywords for category pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:37">[00:50:37]</a>.
    *   Data analysis to track performance and identify new opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:53">[00:50:53]</a>.
    *   Developing and validating hypotheses through testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>.

### Editorial SEO

[[seo_and_content_marketing | Editorial SEO]] focuses on manually written content like articles, guides, and listicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>. It's increasingly driving more traffic than programmatic SEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>.

*   **Skills Needed:** While not easy, it's easier to find talent for editorial SEO compared to programmatic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:59">[00:45:59]</a>. A strong content background is highly valuable, and individuals can learn the specific SEO workflows and [[tools_and_techniques_for_effective_seo | tools]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:51">[00:56:51]</a>.
*   **Ideal Team Structure (MVP):** An SEO manager and a writer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:07">[00:59:07]</a>.
    *   **SEO Manager:** Responsible for defining topics, creating comprehensive outlines, managing the publishing process, and analyzing results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:10">[00:55:10]</a>. They prioritize topics based on search volume, topical authority, and conversion intent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:49">[00:54:49]</a>. This role doesn't typically involve writing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:26">[00:56:26]</a>.
    *   **Writer:** Ideally a domain expert with strong writing skills who can produce content based on the SEO manager's outlines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:51">[00:55:51]</a>. The value comes from underlying factual accuracy and wisdom, not just AI-generated sentences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:35">[01:25:35]</a>.
*   **Content Volume:** Start with 10-30 articles per month to test and validate early performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:06">[00:58:06]</a>. Once positive leading indicators (e.g., ranking in top 20 for target keywords) are observed, scale production to 100+ articles a month if the ROI supports it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:50">[00:58:50]</a>.

### General Considerations for SEO Hiring

*   **In-house vs. Agency:** While an agency can kickstart efforts, Ethan Smith is biased towards in-house teams where possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:38">[00:46:38]</a>.
*   **Organizational Alignment:** SEO efforts often require product changes, so ensure the SEO team is integrated within the product organization or has strong executive buy-in to avoid being "blocked" by resource constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:01">[01:07:01]</a>. The "product-led SEO" approach is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:17">[01:07:17]</a>.
*   **Patience and Leading Indicators:** SEO takes time, usually 6-9 months to see significant results for new efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:57">[00:40:57]</a>. Look for early signals like ranking in the top 20 for less competitive keywords as an indicator of progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:41">[00:42:41]</a>. Avoid prematurely concluding failure; strategies might just need refinement or more time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:41">[00:43:41]</a>.
*   **Intellectual Curiosity:** The SEO field is like being a "detective" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:02">[00:27:02]</a>, requiring constant analysis, hypothesis generation, and testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:33">[01:03:33]</a>. It's a fulfilling area for those who like to do things unconventionally and break things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:19">[01:24:19]</a>.

The [[impact_of_ai_on_seo | impact of AI on SEO]] is primarily in assisting with research, analysis, and outlining, rather than fully automating content creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:33">[01:27:33]</a>.

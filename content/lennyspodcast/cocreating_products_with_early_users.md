## Cocreating Products with Early Users

Stripe's product development philosophy centers on finding the right early users to co-create products with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This approach ensures that products are deeply aligned with user needs and thoroughly refined before broad release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

### The Co-creation Process

The process involves:
*   **Identifying core users:** For Stripe Billing, early users included companies like Figma and Slack, who already used Stripe for payments and had subscription-based business models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:49">[00:18:49]</a>. These companies were "pushing the boundaries" of what was possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>.
*   **Deep engagement:** The development team working on Stripe Billing got to know individuals at these companies personally, understanding their challenges, hopes, and dreams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a>.
*   **Shared development loop:**
    *   Shared Slack channels were used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>.
    *   Product iterations were shown regularly to users for feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>.
    *   The product was only considered ready for a broader audience once this "alpha group was super super happy" with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>.

This methodology leads to a product-oriented engineering team where every engineer exercises attributes often found in product managers at other companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:45">[00:19:45]</a>.

### Core Principles and Practices

Stripe operates on a set of "operating principles," which are distilled behaviors from the most effective Stripes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:04">[00:23:04]</a>. Two key principles directly support co-creation:

*   **Users First:** This principle places users at the center of determining what should be built, fostering deep personal relationships to guide development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:28">[00:23:28]</a>.
*   **Be Meticulous in Your Craft:** This principle emphasizes sweating the details where it matters most for the user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:13">[00:24:13]</a>. An example of this is Stripe's API error messages, which link directly to documentation to help developers solve problems quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:04">[00:25:04]</a>. This attention to detail has resulted in significant improvements, like a 10.5% average revenue increase for users who adopted Stripe's payment elements or checkout solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:07">[00:29:07]</a>.

#### Friction Logging

A widely used process across product teams, including those building internal tools, is **friction logging** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:55">[00:25:55]</a>. This systematic practice helps identify the most effective places to invest time and effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:01">[00:33:01]</a>.

> [!NOTE] How Friction Logging Works
> *   **User Persona:** Put yourself in the shoes of a specific user (e.g., an engineer integrating the Stripe billing API at a company like Atlassian) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>.
> *   **Process Walkthrough:** Go through the entire product flow, from the dashboard to documentation and writing code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:37">[00:26:37]</a>.
> *   **Meticulous Notes:** Record a stream of consciousness, paying particular attention to points of friction that the modeled user would find difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:47">[00:26:47]</a>. Also, praise what works well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:48">[00:34:48]</a>.
> *   **Investment Focus:** These friction points are where Stripe invests heavily to find solutions and make the experience right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a>.

This process is a regular, repeating loop for almost every product team, often led by the PM or engineering manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:10">[00:33:10]</a>. Senior leaders and executives also engage in friction logging to ensure cohesion across parallel efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:09">[00:34:09]</a>.

#### UX Reviews

Stripe conducts both asynchronous and collaborative UX reviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:34">[00:37:34]</a>. Collaborative reviews involve the product team and cross-functional partners (e.g., support groups, executives) walking through the product experience together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:42">[00:37:42]</a>. Issues are logged and discussed openly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:15">[00:38:15]</a>.

A notable practice is "walk the store," where the entire company occasionally reviews critical product flows in a weekly meeting, fostering a shared language and understanding of user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:15">[00:39:15]</a>.

### Organizational Support for User-Centricity

*   **Prioritization:** Stripe's planning processes reserve time to refine the user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:31">[00:35:31]</a>. Issues identified through friction logging and "instant remediations" (fixes for incidents) are prioritized carefully, often ahead of other roadmap work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:04">[00:36:04]</a>.
*   **Continuous Feedback Loop:** Teams are encouraged to establish a mechanism to [[talking_to_customers_for_product_development | listen to users]], quickly get products into their hands, and gather feedback for rapid iteration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:09">[00:43:09]</a>. Stripe's developer tooling and infrastructure enable continuous delivery to production, allowing changes to reach users rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:57">[00:43:57]</a>.
*   **Cross-functional collaboration:** Building products at Stripe is a team sport across various functions. Product managers often lead the effort to bring together engineers, designers, and teams from financial partnerships, legal, risk, and compliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>. PMs are crucial in synthesizing user learnings and shaping product strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:15">[00:21:15]</a>.

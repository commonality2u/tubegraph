Growing one's power is beneficial for career advancement, personal happiness, and reduced stress levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Power dynamics are fundamental to how the world functions, historically and presently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. The acquisition and use of power are not about personality traits but rather skills that can be mastered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>.

## The Uncomfortable Truth About Power
People often feel uncomfortable discussing or pursuing power because the realities of acquiring it often conflict with conventional societal teachings or personal aspirations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. This discomfort is akin to feeling nervous about taking "cod liver oil" â€“ you know it's good for you, but it's not pleasant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>.

However, research by Gerald Ferris and his colleagues demonstrates a strong association between political skill and positive outcomes, including higher salaries, promotions, career satisfaction, and reduced stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

Jeffrey Pfeffer, a professor of organizational behavior at Stanford's Graduate School of Business and author of "The Seven Rules of Power," teaches one of the most popular and oversubscribed courses at Stanford MBA, "Paths to Power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:03">[01:04:03]</a>. He emphasizes that power is a tool, neutral in itself, which can be used for good or ill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. If good people want power to be used for good, then more good people need to acquire power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>.

Individuals from underrepresented backgrounds or those who typically face disadvantages in their careers particularly benefit from learning [[the_seven_rules_of_power | power skills]] because the world is often "stacked against them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

A key principle taught in the "Paths to Power" class is to be less judgmental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. If students are in psychological discomfort or are judgmental of the material, they will not learn anything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. Suspending judgment, especially towards those on one's "critical path" for job accomplishment, is essential for building productive relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. Senior executives often master the skill of not revealing their true opinions of others, which helps in maintaining collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.

## [[the_seven_rules_of_power | The Seven Rules of Power]]

Jeffrey Pfeffer's book, "The Seven Rules of Power," summarizes everything he has learned about building and wielding influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:21">[01:21:21]</a>. These rules are:
1.  [[overcoming_discomfort_in_acquiring_power | Get Out of Your Own Way]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:11">[01:22:11]</a>
2.  Break The Rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:11">[01:22:11]</a>
3.  Appear Powerful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:11">[01:22:11]</a>
4.  Create a Powerful Brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:11">[01:22:11]</a>
5.  [[building_and_wielding_influence | Network Relentlessly]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:11">[01:22:11]</a>
6.  [[role_of_power_in_strategy | Use Your Power]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:11">[01:22:11]</a>
7.  Success Excuses Almost Everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:11">[01:22:11]</a>

These rules are not prescriptive of how the world *should* work, but rather how it *does* work, has worked, and will continue to work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:22">[01:03:22]</a>. They are grounded in social science and logic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:44">[01:03:44]</a>.

### Rule 1: [[overcoming_discomfort_in_acquiring_power | Get Out of Your Own Way]]
The primary barrier to acquiring power is self-sabotage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:45">[01:14:45]</a>. If one views power as "dirty" or "evil," they will naturally avoid the actions necessary for career success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:45">[01:14:45]</a>.

Common psychological barriers include:
*   **Discomfort with Power:** Feeling uneasy about the concept of power itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:45">[01:14:45]</a>.
*   **Imposter Syndrome:** Believing one does not deserve their position or that they are less capable than their peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:45">[01:14:45]</a>. This can manifest as preemptory apologies or constant self-deprecation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:45">[01:14:45]</a>.
*   **Desire to Be Liked:** Prioritizing being liked over competence or getting the job done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:45">[01:14:45]</a>. A famous quote suggests, "If you want to be liked, get a dog" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:45">[01:14:45]</a>. The goal should be to prioritize competence and respect, not active dislike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:45">[01:14:45]</a>.

It's important to acknowledge that others are often no better than oneself, which can alleviate self-doubt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:45">[01:14:45]</a>.

### Rule 2: Break The Rules
Breaking established norms helps one stand out and become memorable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:45">[01:14:45]</a>. Rules are often created by those who benefit from the existing system, so challenging them can be a form of disruption, similar to business strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:45">[01:14:45]</a>.

Key aspects of breaking the rules:
*   **Differentiation:** Doing things differently from competitors to create value and visibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:45">[01:14:45]</a>.
*   **Playing to Strengths:** Focusing on what one is good at, even if it defies conventional roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:45">[01:14:45]</a>. For example, Keith Ferrazzi at Deloitte focused on marketing and brand recognition instead of spreadsheets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:45">[01:14:45]</a>.
*   **Asking for Help:** Counter to the conventional wisdom of self-sufficiency, asking for help is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:45">[01:14:45]</a>. People often overestimate how many times they'll need to ask for help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:45">[01:14:45]</a>. According to Francis Flynn and Vanessa Lake's research, asking for help makes people uncomfortable, but the worst outcome is a "no," leaving one no worse off than before asking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:45">[01:14:45]</a>.

Jason Calacanis, a successful venture capitalist, is cited as a consistent rule-breaker, making many small bets, running a lean operation, and starting his career in journalism, which gave him unique insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:45">[01:14:45]</a>.

### Rule 3: Appear Powerful
How one looks and sounds significantly impacts how others perceive their power and competence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:45">[01:14:45]</a>. [[psychological_principles_in_marketing | Psychological principles in marketing]] and research on body language support this.

Key elements of appearing powerful:
*   **Body Language:** Adopting open postures, making more gestures, and invading personal space (e.g., gentle touching on the arm or shoulder) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:45">[01:14:45]</a>.
*   **Eye Contact:** Maintaining strong eye contact rather than reading from notes, which can make one appear scripted or insincere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:45">[01:14:45]</a>. Jack Valenti, a powerful Washington lobbyist, famously never used notes when appearing before Congress to project complete mastery and control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:45">[01:14:45]</a>.
*   **Vocal Presence:** Speaking louder and with more confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:45">[01:14:45]</a>.
*   **Confidence & Authority:** Avoiding apologies, as they disempower oneself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:45">[01:14:45]</a>.
*   **Strategic Appearance:** Dressing strategically and developing a unique style to be memorable, as exemplified by venture capitalist Laura Chau <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:45">[01:14:45]</a>.

These are skills that can be learned and mastered, like acting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:45">[01:14:45]</a>. Regis McKenna, a public relations firm founder, helped Steve Jobs develop his presentation skills from humble beginnings into a master salesman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:45">[01:14:45]</a>.

### Rule 4: Create a Powerful Brand
In hierarchical organizations, there are fewer positions at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:45">[01:14:45]</a>. To advance, one must be known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:45">[01:14:45]</a>. Building a powerful brand means differentiating oneself and creating value, ensuring that key decision-makers know who you are, beyond just your skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:45">[01:14:45]</a>.

Strategies for building a brand include:
*   **Visibility and Substance:** Having substance is important, but without visibility, no one will know about it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:45">[01:14:45]</a>.
*   **Content Creation:** Writing, starting a podcast, or contributing to books can amplify one's message and reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:45">[01:14:45]</a>. Laura Chau, a VC, used writing, podcasts, and networking dinners to build her brand and get deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:45">[01:14:45]</a>.
*   **Taking Initiative:** Tristan Walker, when seeking a job at Foursquare, started signing up partnerships himself, forcing the founder to notice and hire him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:45">[01:14:45]</a>.
*   **Reframing Self-Promotion:** Thinking of self-promotion not as ego-driven but as amplifying the team's impact or scaling oneself by sharing knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:45">[01:14:45]</a>.

### Rule 5: [[building_and_wielding_influence | Network Relentlessly]]
Many people find networking uncomfortable because they perceive it as "dirty" or insincere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:45">[01:14:45]</a>. However, the first principle of effective networking is generosity: offering help, making introductions, and providing value to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:45">[01:14:45]</a>.

Key aspects of networking:
*   **Knowledge Acquisition:** The broader one's social network, the more people and information they will know <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:45">[01:14:45]</a>. If knowledge is power, networking is a vital way to gain it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:45">[01:14:45]</a>.
*   **Becoming a Broker:** Connecting people and groups that would benefit from being connected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:45">[01:14:45]</a>. This is the core function of venture capitalists, investment bankers, and real estate agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:45">[01:14:45]</a>.
*   **Leveraging Weak Ties:** Building connections with people who are different from oneself (weak ties) is crucial because they provide non-redundant information and introduce one to new networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:45">[01:14:45]</a>. Sociologist Mark Granovetter's research on "the strength of weak ties" shows that better job opportunities often come from these less close connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:45">[01:14:45]</a>.
*   **Proactive Engagement:** Identifying key people to meet and finding creative ways to connect with them beyond formal networking events, such as holding dinners, sharing relevant articles, or making introductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:45">[01:14:45]</a>.

Omid Kordestani, Google's 11th employee, became incredibly powerful by relentlessly networking within Netscape and throughout Silicon Valley, making himself known to virtually everyone, which led to his critical early role at Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:45">[01:14:45]</a>.

### Rule 6: [[role_of_power_in_strategy | Use Your Power]]
The more one uses their power and influence to get things done, the more resources and opportunities they will be given <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:45">[01:14:45]</a>. Success attracts more success; people want to be associated with successful individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:45">[01:14:45]</a>.

*   **Self-Perpetuating Growth:** Mobilizing resources and achieving goals leads to more resources and promotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:45">[01:14:45]</a>.
*   **Confidence and Impact:** Showing that one has power creates more power, as people tend to follow the lead of those perceived as powerful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:45">[01:14:45]</a>. This is observed in animal behavior and human psychology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:45">[01:14:45]</a>.

### Rule 7: Success Excuses Almost Everything
People often fear that if they gain power through unconventional means, their past actions will eventually catch up to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:45">[01:14:45]</a>. However, life is not homeostatic; it is self-fulfilling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:45">[01:14:45]</a>. If someone is perceived as powerful, they tend to become more powerful, and their past missteps are often forgiven or forgotten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:45">[01:14:45]</a>.

Examples provided include:
*   **Lindsey Graham:** Initially critical of Donald Trump, he became a staunch ally, prioritizing relevance and access to power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:45">[01:14:45]</a>.
*   **Historical Figures:** Bill Gates's alleged code theft for Microsoft, Jeffrey Epstein's continued social connections after conviction, and Martha Stewart's brand recovery after jail time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:45">[01:14:45]</a>.
*   **The "Grifter" Example:** A Jewish man who took a company into bankruptcy but walked away with $700 million, living in one of LA's biggest houses. People overlook flaws to be close to money, power, and success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:45">[01:14:45]</a>.

This rule highlights that when people are rich and powerful, the question of whether others associate with them due to their position or their true self often arises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:45">[01:14:45]</a>.

## Learning and Practicing Power

[[importance_of_practicing_public_speaking | Learning power skills]] requires moving through stages of denial, anger, sadness, and eventually acceptance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:45">[01:14:45]</a>. This transition is achieved through practice and coaching, similar to learning a sport or musical instrument <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:45">[01:14:45]</a>.

### "Doing Power" Assignments
Jeffrey Pfeffer's "Paths to Power" course includes practical assignments to help students apply the principles:
*   **Goal Setting:** Students begin by defining their personal goals for the class and what success would look like for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:45">[01:14:45]</a>.
*   **Self-Assessment & Development Plan:** Students evaluate themselves on attributes of power (e.g., energy, focus, conflict tolerance) and create a development plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:45">[01:14:45]</a>.
*   **Resource Creation:** Students are tasked with creating resources that give them leverage, such as initiating awards or projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:45">[01:14:45]</a>.
*   **Acting with Power (Video Exercises):** Students record themselves performing a task (e.g., representing a company in a crisis) and receive feedback on their [[techniques_for_enhancing_public_speaking_skills | public speaking skills]] and presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:45">[01:14:45]</a>.
*   **Personal Brand Statement:** Students write and refine a personal brand statement based on feedback, defining how they want to be known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:45">[01:14:45]</a>.

The principle of "doing power" emphasizes that learning sticks when applied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:45">[01:14:45]</a>. One extreme example is Derek Khan, who, as a "doing power" project, successfully sought to be appointed head of economic policy for Mitt Romney's 2012 presidential campaign and later became Deputy Director of the Office of Management and Budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:45">[01:14:45]</a>.

### Overcoming Discomfort
It is recommended to push oneself slightly out of their comfort zone, rather than attempting radical changes at once, similar to the 15% rule taught in Stanford's "Touchy Feely" class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:45">[01:14:45]</a>. Staying within one's comfort zone prevents growth and improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:45">[01:14:45]</a>.

One effective strategy is to seek coaching or form a personal board of directors to provide advice, social support, and accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:45">[01:14:45]</a>.

### The Price of Power
While power offers significant benefits, it comes with considerable downsides:
*   **Loss of Autonomy:** Powerful individuals often have their schedules and lives controlled by others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:45">[01:14:45]</a>. Jeffrey Pfeffer chose a life of autonomy over becoming the most powerful man in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:45">[01:14:45]</a>. This concept aligns with James G. March's assertion that one can have power or autonomy, but not both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:45">[01:14:45]</a>.
*   **Intense Scrutiny and Lack of Privacy:** Public figures face constant dissection of their lives, finances, and relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:45">[01:14:45]</a>.
*   **Impact on Family:** The pursuit of extreme power can take a toll on personal relationships and family life, contributing to suicides and high divorce rates among those in very high positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:45">[01:14:45]</a>.

The class also explores "the price of power" through examples like Rudy Crew, former New York Schools Chancellor, and the impact on his daughter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:45">[01:14:45]</a>.

## Conclusion
The psychology of power involves understanding human nature, overcoming personal discomforts like [[analyzing_candidate_introspection_and_selfawareness | imposter syndrome]], and adopting strategic behaviors. By embracing the rules of power, individuals can not only advance their careers but also leverage their influence to achieve positive change, as exemplified by Dr. Laura Esserman's profound impact on breast cancer treatment and policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:45">[01:14:45]</a>.

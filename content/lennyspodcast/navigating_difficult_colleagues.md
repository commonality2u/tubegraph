Anuka Gupta, Chief Product Officer at Rubrik and lecturer at Stanford University's Graduate School of Business, shares her strategies for navigating difficult personalities and fostering alignment within teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. She emphasizes the importance of mindset and understanding the underlying motivations of others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:11">[00:38:11]</a>.

## Key Principles for Navigating Difficult Personalities

Anuka strives to embody a mindset of believing she can work with anyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:08">[00:38:08]</a>. Her approach centers on understanding others and reframing personal reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:27">[00:38:27]</a>.

### Understanding Motivations

When encountering a difficult personality, Anuka's first step is to deeply understand what drives that person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:27">[00:38:27]</a>. This could be their commitment to the company's success or their personal career advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:32">[00:38:32]</a>. Once these drivers are identified, she seeks to align their motivations with her own objectives, much like building a product that fulfills a user's desire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:49">[00:38:49]</a>.

To uncover what drives someone, Anuka recommends talking to others who have successfully worked with them, such as their direct reports or peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:43">[00:40:43]</a>. This helps build empathy and context for their behavior and desires in a given situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:06">[00:41:06]</a>.

### Shifting Mindset: From Frustration to Gratitude and Learning

Instead of feeling anger or frustration, Anuka consciously shifts her mindset to gratitude and a positive emotion towards the person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:12">[00:39:12]</a>. She asks herself, "What can I learn from this person?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:21">[00:39:21]</a> Even if she doesn't wish to adopt their specific operating style, everyone has something to teach, whether it's their communication style, ability to rally people, or visionary ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:33">[00:39:33]</a>. This approach is part of having an abundant mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:59">[00:39:59]</a>.

### Tactics for Bringing People Together

*   **Bringing Humor**: Anuka actively tries to bring humor into meetings, starting them on a light note <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. This elevates her own mood and adds levity to the situation for others, which is crucial for a leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
*   **Summarization**: Anuka uses summarization as a powerful tactic to bring diverse voices together and move past conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:31">[00:24:31]</a>. By summarizing what different people are saying in a meeting and asking if the synthesis is correct, she provides clarity and checks for agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>. People often perceive effective summarization as strategic thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>. This also makes people feel heard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:21">[00:24:21]</a>.
    *   **Phrasing**: Anuka might say, "Let me pause here for a second and try to capture what has been said. This is what I've heard... Is everyone in agreement with that or is there some dissent...?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:16">[00:25:16]</a>
    *   **Low-Stakes Summarization**: In virtual meetings, she might summarize in the chat to avoid interrupting the flow, which can invite broader discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:44">[00:26:44]</a>.

Navigating difficult colleagues often involves [[Challenges of feedback in the workplace | giving and receiving hard feedback]]. Anuka shares her insights on how to do this effectively to minimize defensiveness and foster understanding.

### Receiving Hard Feedback

It's natural to feel upset or defensive when receiving negative feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:16">[00:42:16]</a>. Anuka advises:
1.  **Feel the Emotions**: Allow yourself to feel the emotional response without judgment, whether it takes a few hours or days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:35">[00:42:35]</a>.
2.  **Don't React Immediately**: Avoid immediate reactions like disbelief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:54">[00:42:54]</a>.
3.  **Be Curious**: Once the emotional wave passes, approach the feedback with curiosity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:03">[00:43:03]</a>. Ask "Why am I getting this feedback?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:03">[00:43:03]</a> This might involve going back to the person or asking a peer for more context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:09">[00:43:09]</a>.
4.  **Anchor to Company Goals**: Not all feedback requires action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:32">[00:43:32]</a>. Anuka anchors her decisions on what is best for the company and what the company needs from her and her team at that moment, prioritizing "must-haves" over "nice-to-haves" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:37">[00:44:37]</a>.
5.  **Reward Learning**: Create a culture where people are willing to take risks by rewarding the learning process rather than just the outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:15">[00:33:15]</a>. If a decision doesn't work out, frame it as a learning opportunity about customers or the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:29">[00:33:29]</a>.

### [[Practicing radical candor | Giving Hard Feedback]]

When [[Practicing radical candor | giving hard feedback]], Anuka focuses on her delivery and intention, as she cannot control the recipient's reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:11">[00:47:11]</a>.
1.  **Convey Care**: Explicitly state your care for the person and your desire for their success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:25">[00:47:25]</a>. Anuka often says, "I care so much about you and I'm giving you this feedback because I want you to be successful and I want you to be able to reach the pinnacle of what I know you can accomplish" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:28">[00:47:28]</a>. This makes the recipient more receptive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:49">[00:47:49]</a>.
2.  **Be Direct**: Avoid passive-aggressive feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:57">[00:47:57]</a>. State directly what the person is doing or how they are being perceived, and provide actionable steps to change that perception or outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:01">[00:48:01]</a>.
3.  **Preparation**: Prepare extensively before giving feedback, considering how to frame it to resonate without sounding accusatory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:20">[00:48:20]</a>. Provide examples, even personal ones, to illustrate points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:40">[00:48:40]</a>.
4.  **Collaborate on Solutions**: Be part of the solution by brainstorming with the person, rather than just delivering feedback and leaving them to figure it out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:49">[00:48:49]</a>.
5.  **Tailor the Feedback**: Begin by asking the person about their career aspirations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:30">[00:49:30]</a>. This allows Anuka to tailor the feedback to what will genuinely matter for their specific career goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:54">[00:49:54]</a>.
6.  **Frame as Perception**: Frame feedback as "this is how you're being perceived" rather than "you are doing X" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:14">[00:50:14]</a>. This gives the person the benefit of the doubt and allows for a conversation about changing that perception if their intentions differ from how they are seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:46">[00:50:46]</a>.

## Cultivating a Positive Mindset

Anuka believes that the mindset one brings to work is the most important factor for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:38">[01:01:38]</a>. Approaching every situation with a positive mindset can help achieve more than one could possibly hope for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:46">[01:01:46]</a>.

She recommends **journaling** as a powerful tool to build this mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:19">[01:02:19]</a>. By writing down negative thoughts, one can explore why they feel a certain way, identify triggers, and break down abstract rumination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:36">[01:02:36]</a>. This process helps differentiate between irrational feelings and issues within one's control, enabling action or letting go <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:02">[01:03:02]</a>. Anuka views this practice as a form of cognitive behavioral therapy on oneself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:09">[01:04:09]</a>.

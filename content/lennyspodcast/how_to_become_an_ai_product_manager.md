This article is based on a conversation with Aman Khan, Director of Product at Arise AI, who has focused his career on [[building_a_career_in_ai_product_management | building products in the AI space]] at companies like Spotify and Apple. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>

## What is an AI Product Manager (AIPM)?

A Product Manager is generally responsible for bringing together design, engineering, business, and operations to ship impactful solutions for customer problems, acting as a representative of the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. The [[role_of_product_managers_in_ai | AI component]] can be broken down into three main types:

1.  **AI Platform PMs** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>: These individuals build tools for AI Engineers. For instance, Arise AI develops observability and evaluation platforms for artificial intelligence, starting with machine learning and now pivoting towards large language models (LLMs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. This role focuses on enabling AI Engineers to understand and validate the impact of their applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.
2.  **AI Product PMs** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>: In this role, the core product itself is centered around AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. Examples include applications like ChatGPT or NotebookLM, where the core experience is enabled by the underlying AI model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. The job here is to package cutting-edge AI technology and make it consumable for businesses, enterprises, or consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.
3.  **AI-Powered PMs** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>: This type of PM is enabled by AI technology across their entire role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. They might not build core models from scratch but utilize existing LLMs or other models to create the best possible experience for their customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. It's anticipated that most PMs in the near future will become some flavor of an [[the_future_of_product_management_in_the_ai_era | AI product manager]] as AI becomes as common as a database for applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.

## Getting into AI Product Management

It is arguably easier now to break into [[building_a_career_in_ai_product_management | AI product management]] than before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Previously, a deeper foundation and background in machine learning were often required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. However, with the emergence of new AI tools, it's now feasible for a product manager to quickly create prototypes and mock-ups, bringing a higher-resolution starting point to meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. There are numerous YouTube videos demonstrating how to build an app in about an hour, which was not possible even a year ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

### Recommended Skills & Learning

To become an AIPM, it's recommended to:
*   **Understand the fundamentals of Machine Learning and AI:** Learn about the underlying knowledge that has driven this technological evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>. Resources like Andrej Karpathy's videos on the foundations of LLMs can be a starting point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>.
*   **Be driven by curiosity:** Explore what interests you and how AI can be applied to solve problems in those areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>.
*   **Experiment with tools:** Use AI tools to push the boundaries of what's possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>.

### Standing Out as an Applicant

Since there's no specific college degree for AI product management, standing out involves:
*   **Building a portfolio of prototypes/products:** Even if they are just prototypes, demonstrating what you've built with AI helps showcase your thinking and interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>. This directly answers key hiring manager questions: "Can this person do the job?" and "Are they excited about the work?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:17">[00:21:17]</a>.
*   **Showing genuine interest:** Your curiosity and willingness to build your skill set around AI fundamentals and their application to specific industries will make you stand out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>.
*   **Becoming a "Wanderer":** Be comfortable with uncertainty and actively seek out new directions and possibilities for how AI can solve problems, rather than waiting for others to define the path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:09">[00:59:09]</a>.

## [[tools_and_tips_for_ai_product_management | Tools and Tips for AI Product Management]]

AI tools can significantly enhance a PM's efficiency and productivity:
*   **Prototyping and Mockups:**
    *   **Cursor** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:07">[01:10:07]</a> and **Replit** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:07">[01:10:07]</a> are excellent for building functional prototypes quickly, allowing PMs to show "the buttons work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:10">[01:11:10]</a>. Replit's agent can build and host a website from a prompt in seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:45">[00:24:45]</a>.
    *   **Vercel's v0** helps create beautiful landing pages and working UIs from text prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:33">[01:11:33]</a>.
    *   **Websim** is described as a playful tool for quickly creating crazy and wacky prototypes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:07">[01:10:07]</a>.
*   **Graphic Design:**
    *   **Midjourney** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:20">[01:12:20]</a> and **DALL-E** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:22">[01:12:22]</a> can be used for generating logos or visual user stories.
*   **Data Analysis & Customer Insights:**
    *   Tools like **Gong** (for call transcripts) combined with LLMs can extract common problems and pain points from customer conversations, allowing PMs to scale their understanding of customer needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:15">[01:02:15]</a>.

## Thriving as an AIPM: Beyond the Hype

The [[impact_of_ai_on_product_management | impact of AI on product management]] means PMs are arguably the best-positioned function to thrive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:43">[00:42:43]</a>. AI tools excel at building things when told what to do, but the hardest part is knowing *what* to build, finding problems, and articulating them clearly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:18">[00:26:18]</a>. This is precisely the job of a product manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:37">[00:26:37]</a>.

Top 5% AIPMs distinguish themselves by:
*   **Focusing on the Problem, Not Just the Technology** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:37">[00:31:37]</a>: Avoid blindly replicating popular AI interfaces (like building another internal chatbot) just because the technology is available or everyone else is doing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:53">[00:30:53]</a>. Instead, question if it's the right problem to solve for the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:51">[00:31:51]</a>. The ideal AI interface might look very different from a chatbot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:03">[00:32:03]</a>, perhaps optimizing or speeding up existing human processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:10">[00:32:10]</a>. This also applies to the current hype around "AI agents" â€“ don't just build an agent if a foundational model can provide a seamless experience within your existing product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:18">[00:33:18]</a>.
*   **Defining a "Shots Taken" Metric:** Since AI prototypes might not immediately impact business metrics like revenue, create a metric to measure how many experiments or prototypes are being attempted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:08">[00:37:08]</a>. This encourages experimentation.
*   **Running Hackathons:** Get everyone in the organization to try using AI tools hands-on. This removes the perception that the technology is unapproachable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:34">[00:37:34]</a>. Use hackathons to identify problems and see where AI solutions genuinely stick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:17">[00:39:17]</a>.
*   **Obsessing About User Experience Details:** Study successful AI products to understand why they are "magical" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:55">[00:39:55]</a>. Remember that users often want a degree of control, even in automated experiences (e.g., Betty Crocker cake mix needing eggs, self-driving cars still having AC controls) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:04">[00:40:04]</a>. [[challenges_and_advantages_of_ai_in_product_management | AI should make your product easier to use]] and lower the barrier to creation, not necessarily automate the entire problem away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:31">[00:42:31]</a>.
*   **Walking and Chewing Gum (Multi-tasking):** AIPMs must continuously deliver customer value and move business metrics while also making space for prototyping, trying tools firsthand, breaking down product experiences, and learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:24">[00:43:24]</a>. This means accepting that the technology changes fast and experiments might fail, but learning from them is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:50">[00:44:50]</a>.
*   **Bringing Energy:** Show up to meetings with enthusiasm and a positive mindset. This can reduce friction and influence others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:51">[00:49:51]</a>. It also involves being proactive and getting into the details of solving problems, even taking on tasks like sales outreach to gather insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:17">[00:51:17]</a>.
*   **Embracing "Wandering" over "Waiting":** As an AIPM, your role is to be the "Wanderer" who explores new directions and pushes the boundaries of what the company thinks is possible with AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:09">[00:59:09]</a>. While the rest of the organization might prefer to "wait and see" how AI technology evolves, the PM should be actively finding the next path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:33">[00:58:33]</a>. Be comfortable in this "squishy" unknown space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:43">[01:00:43]</a>.
*   **Amplifying Signal through Noise:** Use AI tools (like LLMs with long context windows) to analyze large amounts of data (e.g., meeting transcripts from sales calls) and pull out key insights or common customer problems. This provides a "superpower" to be in many places at once and gather crucial signal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:05">[01:02:05]</a>.
*   **Have Fun and Stay Curious:** Product management can be serious, but a key to success is to genuinely enjoy the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:34">[01:03:34]</a>. Maintaining curiosity and continuously learning will accelerate your ability to iterate and find success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:14">[01:04:14]</a>.

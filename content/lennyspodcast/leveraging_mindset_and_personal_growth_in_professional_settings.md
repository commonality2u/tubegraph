Anuka Gupta, Chief Product Officer at Rubrik, lecturer on product management at Stanford University's Graduate School of Business, and a board member at Tenuity, offers powerful advice on leveraging mindset and [[career_growth_and_personal_development | personal growth]] for professional success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:00">[00:42:00]</a>. Her insights emphasize the importance of internal disposition over external circumstances in navigating challenges and driving impactful results.

## The Power of Mindset

A core tenet of Gupta's philosophy is the transformative power of mindset.

### Finding Fun in the Job
Gupta champions the mindset of figuring out how to have fun in her job, even during the most difficult times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. This approach helps prevent operating from a "mindset of scarcity," where every challenge seems like an "unachievable hurdle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>.
By reframing situations to find enjoyment, one can change their entire approach to difficult situations, opening up more opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>. For example, when faced with the daunting task of changing out all her direct reports in short order, adopting this mindset helped her navigate the situation and overcome fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>.

Tactically, this involves:
*   Asking: "What can I learn from this situation? What can I get out of this that's a positive outcome?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>
*   Bringing humor into meetings to elevate mood and add levity to the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>. As a leader, this transfers a positive mindset to the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:00">[05:02:00]</a>.
*   Recognizing that professional challenges are not as critical as life-or-death situations, allowing for a lighter approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>.

### Managing Energy, Not Just Time
Gupta emphasizes managing emotional and mental energy rather than solely focusing on time management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>. By architecting her day to maximize her energy, she can bring her "full self" to work and difficult situations, fostering an "abundant mindset" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>. Simple actions like ensuring she eats lunch or scheduling difficult tasks during peak energy times can significantly impact her ability to tackle challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:00">[06:04:00]</a>.

## Navigating Interpersonal Dynamics

Gupta's approach extends to interactions with colleagues, particularly in challenging situations.

### Dealing with Difficult Personalities
Gupta operates from the belief that she can work with anyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:11:00">[38:11:00]</a>. When encountering a difficult personality, her strategy involves:
1.  **Understanding their drivers:** Identifying what truly motivates the person, whether it's company success or personal [[career_growth_and_personal_development | career growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:27:00">[38:27:00]</a>. If she needs something from them, she considers how to motivate them by aligning with their desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:49:00">[38:49:00]</a>. This can be achieved by talking to others who have successfully worked with them, including subordinates or peers, to build an empathetic view of their motivations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:41:00">[40:41:00]</a>.
2.  **Cultivating gratitude and learning:** Instead of anger or frustration, she shifts to a mindset of gratitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:14:00">[39:14:00]</a>. She asks herself, "What can I learn from this person?" even if it's about avoiding their behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:21:00">[39:21:00]</a>. This curious approach helps her recognize valuable lessons, fostering genuine gratitude and reinforcing an abundant mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:45:00">[39:45:00]</a>.

### Giving and Receiving Hard Feedback
Gupta is known for her skill in both giving and receiving difficult feedback, crucial for [[candor_and_feedback_in_professional_growth | professional growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:48:00">[41:48:00]</a>.

#### Receiving Feedback
*   **Allow emotional processing:** It's natural to feel upset or defensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:16:00">[42:16:00]</a>. Gupta lets herself feel these emotions without immediate reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:35:00">[42:35:00]</a>.
*   **Be curious, not reactive:** After the initial emotional wave passes, she approaches the feedback with curiosity, asking "Why am I getting this feedback?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:57:00">[42:57:00]</a>. This involves seeking more context from the feedback giver or other colleagues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:09:00">[43:09:00]</a>.
*   **Discern validity and actionability:** All feedback reflects someone's feelings, which are valid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:28:00">[43:28:00]</a>. However, not all feedback requires action. She anchors her decision on "what is best for the company and what does the company need from me and my team at this point in time," distinguishing "must-haves" from "nice-to-haves" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:37:00">[44:37:00]</a>.

#### Giving Feedback
*   **Control your delivery:** While you can't control the recipient's reaction, you can control your body language and what you say <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:11:00">[47:11:00]</a>.
*   **Lead with care and intention:** Explicitly state your care for the person and your desire for their success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:25:00">[47:25:00]</a>. This setup makes the recipient more receptive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:49:00">[47:49:00]</a>.
*   **Be direct and provide actionable steps:** Avoid passive-aggressive feedback. Be direct about perceptions or actions and offer specific, actionable steps for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:55:00">[47:55:00]</a>.
*   **Prepare and tailor:** Prepare thoroughly to frame feedback in a way that resonates without attacking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:20:00">[48:20:00]</a>. She often asks about their career aspirations to tailor the feedback to their goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:30:00">[49:30:00]</a>.
*   **Focus on perception:** Frame feedback as "this is how you're being perceived" rather than "this is what you are doing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:14:00">[50:14:00]</a>. This gives the person the benefit of the doubt and allows for a conversation about changing perceptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:46:00">[50:46:00]</a>.

## Strategic Thinking and Decision Making

Gupta highlights two key aspects of being strategic: articulation and action.

### Defining "Strategic"
Based on her experience and research, Gupta defines being strategic as two main components:
1.  **Articulating a compelling and simple "why":** The ability to explain the rationale behind company and product decisions and directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
2.  **Championing change:** Being a change agent willing to do difficult things that are in the long-term interest of the product or company, even if execution is hard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>.

> "If you have one without the other ultimately people are not going to see you as strategic." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>
> "If you're really good at articulating the why but you're only bringing small ideas to the table then that's not strategic. If you're championing big ideas but you can't articulate the why behind them in a compelling and simple way then you're not going to be seen as strategic either." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>

A practical tactic to appear more strategic is **summarization** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:10">[00:21:10]</a>. By synthesizing different viewpoints in a discussion, a leader can check for alignment and guide the conversation toward a clear direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>. This makes people feel heard and can move past conflict, fostering better decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:21">[00:24:21]</a>.

### The Historian's Approach to Decisions
To become a better decision-maker, Gupta suggests adopting the role of a "historian" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:01">[00:28:01]</a>. This involves deeply understanding past decisions, products, and their outcomes within an organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:28">[00:28:28]</a>.
By learning from past successes and failures, even those you didn't personally experience, you gain crucial context for future decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:07">[00:29:07]</a>. It also helps in addressing existing "baggage" people might have around revisiting similar ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:33">[00:29:33]</a>.

### Making Decisions Quickly
Gupta advocates for making decisions quickly, even with incomplete information.

> "It's not about making the right decision, it's about making the decision." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:32">[00:30:32]</a>

Delaying decisions due to "analysis paralysis" prevents new, high-fidelity information from being gathered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:42">[00:30:42]</a>. As long as a decision is approximately "70% right," it can be iterated upon. The act of committing to a decision and moving forward allows for learning and adaptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:54">[00:30:54]</a>.

To foster a culture where people are comfortable making decisions with incomplete information:
*   **Articulate clear hypotheses and assumptions:** Frame decisions around clear hypotheses, acknowledging what is known and unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:21">[00:32:21]</a>.
*   **Reward learning over outcome:** If something doesn't work, focus on what was learned about the initial hypothesis, customers, or the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:12">[00:33:12]</a>. This promotes a culture of risk-taking and continuous improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:12">[00:33:12]</a>.

## Continuous [[career_growth_and_personal_development | Personal Growth]]

Anuka Gupta's career trajectory and teaching experience at Stanford highlight the importance of continuous [[career_growth_and_personal_development | personal growth]] and learning.

### Learning from Experience
Her own [[career_growth_and_personal_development | career growth]] involved moving from engineering to product management within the same company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:18">[00:51:18]</a>. She advises those looking to break into product management to leverage their existing roles by building credibility, interacting with product teams, and taking on relevant projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:50">[00:51:50]</a>. Each function (e.g., customer support, sales, engineering) provides valuable unique knowledge that can be an asset in a product role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:20">[00:52:20]</a>.

### Mentorship and Teaching
Teaching at Stanford helped Gupta crystallize her own thinking and mental models of product management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:34">[00:56:34]</a>. The questions students asked helped her refine her understanding and provide real-life examples, which she even shared back with her team at work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:09">[00:57:09]</a>. This demonstrates how actively engaging in teaching and mentoring can reinforce one's own expertise.

## Cultivating a Positive Mindset

The overarching message from Anuka Gupta is the profound impact of the mindset you bring to your work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:38">[01:01:38]</a>. A positive mindset can lead to greater achievements than otherwise possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:49">[01:01:49]</a>.

To build this mindset:
*   **Journaling:** Writing down thoughts, especially negative ones, helps to externalize and analyze them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:19">[01:02:19]</a>. This process of exploring "why am I feeling this way?" can help identify irrational thoughts to let go of, or uncover actionable steps within one's control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:46">[01:02:46]</a>.
*   **Self-reflection:** Consciously asking "what can I learn from this person?" and "how can this be fun?" even in frustrating situations, can transform interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:07">[01:02:07]</a>.

> "When something is bothering you or something is hard, the more you actually listen to that part of yourself and like dive into it and explore it and give it a space to share and talk the less power it gets and the more space is created for the stuff you actually want to take space." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:39">[01:03:39]</a>
> "It's like doing cognitive behavioral therapy on yourself." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:09">[01:04:09]</a>

This proactive and reflective approach to mindset, coupled with practical strategies for interaction and decision-making, forms the bedrock of Anuka Gupta's advice for professional success and [[maximizing_human_potential_and_personal_growth | maximizing human potential]].

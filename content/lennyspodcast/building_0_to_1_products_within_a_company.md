Mahika Kapor, a design engineering PM hybrid at Figma, is known as the "go-to person at Figma for leading new 0 to 1 products" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:55">[00:55:55]</a>. She was an early PM on FigJam and is now spearheading the development of a new product launching in June <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:50">[00:50:50]</a>. Her success in [[building_new_products_within_larger_companies | building new products within larger companies]] stems from her ability to develop a compelling vision, gain buy-in for ideas, cultivate conviction and empathy, and foster a strong team culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:26">[01:26:26]</a>.

## The Entrepreneurial Imperative

For a company to remain competitive, it must stay entrepreneurial and constantly consider "what's next" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:39">[01:16:39]</a>. This involves defining industry standards and anticipating competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:47">[01:16:47]</a>. Figma actively fosters an entrepreneurial [[building_and_scaling_a_companys_culture | culture]] through its "run with it" core value, encouraging individuals to "sprint off in a direction" without it being seen as a distraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:04">[01:17:04]</a>.

Many of Figma's "most monumental launches" originated from hackathons and bottoms-up projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:28">[01:17:28]</a>, including multi-edit, Jambot (an AI plugin), and the entire widgets platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:35">[01:17:35]</a>.

## The "Keeper of the Flame" Approach

Mahika views a 0 to 1 project as a "flame" that needs to be constantly stoked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:50">[01:18:50]</a>. The person driving a 0 to 1 idea acts as the "Keeper of the Hearth," responsible for fanning the flames if they risk dying out and ensuring the idea spreads like wildfire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:11">[01:19:11]</a>.

To successfully bring an idea into existence, three core elements are necessary:
1.  **Have the right idea:** This requires deep user empathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:18">[01:21:18]</a>.
2.  **Secure buy-in:** Rally leadership and the team behind the idea with a clear vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:22">[01:20:22]</a>.
3.  **Make it spread:** Ensure the idea builds enough momentum for the entire company or target audience to clamor for its development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:35">[01:20:35]</a>.

## Cultivating a Compelling Vision

Mahika believes "vision is everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. A strong vision, shared by the product manager, the team, and the company, provides an anchor during the "messy" and "chaotic" product development cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. Even when pivoting, being anchored to a singular vision ensures every step feels like "forward progress" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

To craft a compelling vision:
*   **Be inseparable from users and the team:** Don't create in a vacuum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.
*   **Cross-pollination of functions:** Integrate research insights, beautiful designs and prototypes, and engineering feasibility from the vision phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. This ensures the vision is achievable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.
*   **Visual communication:** At Figma, words "only get you so far" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. Pitches combine pain points, solutions, and proof points (like user testimonials or mocks) to make the vision compelling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. They "lean heavily into designing and prototyping even before a project gets a green light" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>.
*   **Unified artifact:** The team should collaborate on a single artifact, like a Figma deck, to ensure shared ownership and passion for the combined deliverable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>.

### Example: FigJam's Vision for Democratic Meetings

For FigJam, the vision centered on creating a more "democratic workplace" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:04">[01:06:04]</a>. An early insight was that brainstorming, a highly democratizing activity where ideas come from anywhere, worked exceptionally well in FigJam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:01">[01:13:01]</a>. The team aimed to expand this generative nature to all types of meetings, where everyone contributes, not just the loudest voice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:20">[01:15:20]</a>. This vision led to features like music and voting that enhance collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:13">[01:16:13]</a>.

## Gaining Conviction and Buy-In

Mahika emphasizes the importance of a PM creating "momentum" for their team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:35">[01:23:35]</a>. She advocates for having "optimism that borders on delusion" and an "almost like reality distortion field" where 'no' is translated into 'not yet' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:14">[01:23:14]</a>.

*   **Build intuition:** Product sense comes from "insatiable curiosity" and constant conversations with users, building a "repository or library" of anecdotes for decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:41">[01:23:41]</a>.
*   **Put out ideas (even if wrong):** "Putting out an idea even if it's like totally wrong is a much better catalyst for getting to a good solution because people are much more likely to react to an idea than to nothing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:15">[01:25:15]</a>.
*   **"Strong opinions, weakly held":** While having high conviction is crucial, be willing to "kill your darlings" if external signals or user feedback suggest a different direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:20">[01:26:20]</a>.
*   **Direct communication:** Be explicit about your confidence level in an idea ("medium confidence," "really strongly about this") to encourage team members to voice their own opinions without fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:53">[01:27:53]</a>. This fosters a [[building_a_productfocused_company_culture | culture]] where everyone feels comfortable speaking up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:19">[01:29:19]</a>.

## Spreading the Idea and Building Hype

It is the PM's responsibility to have a pulse on how everyone feels about a product and to constantly "prop up" and excite people about it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:41">[01:33:41]</a>. "Hype is something that you can't really create hype for something you don't believe in" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:36">[01:36:36]</a>; it comes from getting people to "see what you see" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:44">[01:36:44]</a>.

*   **Leverage large forums:** Utilize company-wide events like sales kickoffs (SKOs), hackathons ([[Building and Scaling Product Innovations | Maker Week]]), or annual showcases (Config) for demos and presentations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:55">[01:36:55]</a>. This provides significant visibility, generating excitement and invaluable product insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:34">[01:37:34]</a>.
*   **Emotional connection:** For FigJam's first anniversary, they treated it like a "full-on birthday party," with Easter egg features hidden as "birthday presents" for users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:33">[01:40:33]</a>. This made users feel special and deeply connected to the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:21">[01:41:21]</a>.
*   **Understand product brand:** Hype generation should align with the product's unique brand of delight or energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:42">[01:41:42]</a>.

## Deep User Empathy and Understanding

Immersion in the user base is critical. Mahika recommends:
*   **Constant conversations:** Talk to users at every opportunity, even in casual settings like dinners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:41">[01:23:41]</a>.
*   **Talk to non-users:** Understand *why* they aren't using the product, as these conversations often yield the "most insightful" feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:41">[01:44:41]</a>. This approach revealed why non-designers weren't using FigJam, leading to features that simplified onboarding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:18">[01:45:18]</a>.
*   **Leverage sales teams:** For niche or internal products where direct user interaction is harder, maintain a "tight relationship" with the sales team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:42">[01:46:42]</a>. Join sales calls to understand customer pain points and cross-pollinate those into the product roadmap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:52">[01:46:52]</a>.
*   **Be the user:** For early-stage companies, founder-market fit is crucial, allowing the PM to act as a "litmus test" for user needs and accelerate the development cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:28">[01:46:28]</a>.

## Leveraging Internal Initiatives (Hackathons, Maker Weeks)

Internal hackathons, like Figma's "Maker Week," are powerful catalysts for 0 to 1 projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:46">[02:00:46]</a>.
*   **Open to all:** Don't limit hackathons to engineers; "anyone can have an idea" and build momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:58">[02:00:58]</a>.
*   **Scrappy execution:** Be willing to be "very clear about like where you're willing to take the hit on like quality or believability" to make the idea feel real quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:30">[02:25:30]</a>. A small code change, like swapping an icon, can communicate a new product's potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:50">[02:25:50]</a>.
*   **Demo Day:** Presenting ideas at a company-wide demo day transforms the evangelization from a single person to a collective effort by peers and colleagues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:30">[02:26:30]</a>.

## Advantages and Challenges of Building Within a Company

[[building_new_products_within_larger_companies | Founding something inside of an existing company]] offers advantages:
*   **Distribution advantage:** Leverage existing user bases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:48">[00:55:48]</a>.
*   **Technical/platform advantage:** Utilize existing infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:50">[00:55:50]</a>.
*   **Reduced risk:** Less personal financial or career risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:57">[00:55:57]</a>.

However, challenges exist:
*   **Decision-making:** It's harder to make executive decisions; buy-in is needed for every step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:10">[00:56:10]</a>.
*   **Speed:** Sometimes it's "harder to move faster" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:17">[00:56:17]</a>.
*   **Recruitment:** Building a team and pitching to internal stakeholders differs from a startup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:28">[00:56:28]</a>.

Mahika's experience founding Design Nation in college demonstrates adapting when initial internal support (like at Princeton) is lacking. She learned to "chase after something" without formal backing, adapting focus from speakers to fundraising or building a legitimate landing page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:12">[01:11:12]</a>.

## Operationalizing Insights & Fostering Team Ownership

*   **Inform roadmap prioritization:** User and sales insights directly influence what features are built or deprioritized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:30">[01:49:30]</a>.
*   **Create artifacts for sales:** Produce materials, like Loom videos, that sales teams can use to evangelize products and their use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:38">[01:49:38]</a>.
*   **Centralized feedback:** Use tools like Slack integrations with task management systems (e.g., Asana) to capture and groom all incoming feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:09">[01:50:09]</a>.
*   **Early staging/dogfooding:** Figma has a "multi-month plus long staging or dogfooding process" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:10">[01:27:10]</a>. Putting a product on staging early generates feedback and makes people feel "invested in your product," believing "I shaped that part of the product" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:14">[01:28:14]</a>. This opens up the product development process, elevating product quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:08">[01:29:08]</a>.
*   **Understand team motivations:** Different team members have different motivations (e.g., some engineers prefer solutions handed to them, others want to contribute to the vision) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:27">[01:30:27]</a>. PMs should directly ask about involvement preferences and make decisions in the open to cater to individuals, fostering a high-functioning team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:50">[01:30:50]</a>.

## Key Takeaways

*   **Shout insights from the rooftops:** If you have a unique insight, share it broadly. This fosters an entrepreneurial [[building_a_productfocused_company_culture | culture]] by inspiring others to contribute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:41">[01:29:41]</a>.
*   **Passion is key:** Deeply caring about what you're building is essential. This passion comes from believing in the product's vision and connecting with the people you work with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:55">[01:53:55]</a>.
*   **Embrace your strengths:** While awareness of weaknesses is important, focus on what you're "amazing at" and lean into those strengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. Build a team that is well-rounded, where individuals are "spiky" in their strengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:51">[01:15:51]</a>.

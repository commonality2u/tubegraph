From: [[lennyspodcast]] <br/> 

Jessica Lax, Vice President of Analytics and Data Science at DoorDash, has built one of the largest and most respected data teams in the tech industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Her philosophy on analytics centers on it being a business impact-driving function, rather than merely a service function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The goal is not just to answer "why," but to provide actionable insights by answering "what do we do now that we know this?" <a class="yt-0:00:11">[00:00:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

## Structuring Data Teams

Lax holds a contrarian perspective on how to structure data teams within companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. She strongly advocates for a centralized data model, or "Center of Excellence," rather than embedding analytics professionals directly into business units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. While understanding the desire of business leaders for embedded teams to have control and camaraderie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>, she believes the benefits of a central model far outweigh the drawbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

DoorDash's analytics team operates centrally, but is divided into "pods" that align with product, engineering, operations, and marketing structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>. This allows team members to be embedded with partner teams, sharing their goals and aligning incentives, while still reporting up through a central organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. This setup helps the analytics team feel like one cohesive unit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.

### Benefits of a Centralized Data Org
*   **Consistent and High Talent Bar**: A centralized structure ensures a uniform standard for hiring and evaluating talent, leading to more consistent and higher-quality hires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.
*   **Growth Opportunities**: It provides broader growth paths for data professionals who might otherwise be siloed in specific business units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. They can explore new problem areas across the company or find management roles that might not exist in a smaller, embedded team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.
*   **Consistency of Methodologies and [[metrics_and_measuring_product_success | Metrics]]**: A central team ensures that definitions for key [[metrics_and_measuring_product_success | metrics]], like "sales," are consistent across the entire company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. This also allows for shared improvements in methodologies, avoiding redundant work across different teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>. It also helps anticipate and address common problems across teams, aiding in scaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.
*   **Team Culture and Brand**: It fosters a unique team culture of learning and sharing, providing support and peer review for team members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>. This not only aids in recruiting top talent but also boosts internal pride and camaraderie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>.

## Proactive vs. Reactive Work

It's challenging to balance exploratory, proactive work with the constant stream of urgent questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>. Lax emphasizes the need to be intentional about carving out time for deep dives and exploratory work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>.
*   **Setting Goals**: Set specific goals for the team around uncovering insights through self-directed work to maintain accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>.
*   **Hackathons**: Organize hackathons where the team dedicates days to investigate interesting problems and find new opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>.
*   **Communicating Trade-offs**: When new requests come in, present the trade-offs clearly to business partners, asking if the new request is more important than existing priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>. This helps partners understand the impact of their requests on the team's planned work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:09">[00:22:09]</a>.

An example of a successful deep dive from a hackathon involved analyzing consumer acquisition through referrals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>. Initially, the channel appeared below average in engagement and payback period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>. Through detailed investigation, including trying to commit referral fraud, the team uncovered significant fraudulent behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>. They found a bimodal distribution: one group of high-quality consumers referring others, and another group exploiting lax fraud rules for free discounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:49">[00:18:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>. This led to recommendations for better fraud checks and referral caps, significantly improving the channel's efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>.

## Hiring for Data Teams

Beyond technical skills, which are table stakes, Lax looks for unique characteristics:
*   **Curiosity**: The ability to "pull on threads" and proactively investigate anomalies without being told <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:51">[00:24:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:03">[00:25:03]</a>. This can be tested by presenting cases with subtle inconsistencies and observing how candidates react <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:44">[00:25:44]</a>.
*   **Problem-Solving**: The capacity to break down complex problems and handle ambiguity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:16">[00:27:16]</a>. Lax uses real-world problems from DoorDash's history in business cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:04">[00:27:04]</a>.
*   **Adaptability and Decisiveness**: How candidates react to being told they are wrong, their ability to incorporate new information and pivot, and their willingness to make a decision even without perfect information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:56">[00:27:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:24">[00:28:24]</a>.

## Defining [[metrics_and_measuring_product_success | Metrics]] and Aligning Incentives

Lax emphasizes learning from "bad [[metrics_and_measuring_product_success | metrics]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:45">[00:44:45]</a>.
*   **Short-Term Proxies for Long-Term Outcomes**: The key is to identify a short-term metric that can be measured and quickly iterated upon, which in turn drives a long-term output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:51">[00:44:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:02">[00:55:02]</a>. For example, retention is a difficult metric to goal on in the short term; instead, identify the inputs that drive retention and test them through experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:02">[00:45:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:17">[00:45:17]</a>.
*   **Simplicity Over Complexity**: Avoid overly complex composite [[metrics_and_measuring_product_success | metrics]] with coefficients, as they are often misunderstood and don't intuitively drive action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:38">[00:45:38]</a>. A simpler, even imperfect, metric that people understand and can discuss across the company will lead to better outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:07">[00:46:07]</a>.
    *   *Example*: A "Merchant Health Score" that was a weighted composite of many factors was abandoned because it was hard to understand and act upon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:56">[00:50:56]</a>. Instead, they focused on simpler, actionable inputs like "number of new merchants getting an order in their first seven days" or "merchant photo coverage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:48">[00:51:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:06">[00:52:06]</a>.
*   **Common Currency for Trade-offs**: Quantify different business levers in a common currency (e.g., Gross Order Value - GOV, or volume) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:40">[00:46:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:53">[00:46:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:26">[00:48:26]</a>. This enables teams to make informed trade-offs between different investments, like lowering prices versus reducing delivery times, by understanding their impact on the ultimate business goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:07">[00:47:07]</a>. This is particularly important for a multi-sided [[key_performance_indicators_for_marketplaces | marketplace]] like DoorDash, balancing supply, demand, and Dasher growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:20">[00:50:20]</a>.
*   **Focus on Edge Cases and Fail States**: While averages are important, actively creating [[metrics_and_measuring_product_success | metrics]] and setting goals around edge cases and "fail states" is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:29">[00:55:29]</a>.
    *   *Example*: "Never delivered" orders, though rare, lead to high churn and significant costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:51">[00:55:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:21">[00:56:21]</a>. Dedicated teams are tasked with eradicating them by understanding why they occur and implementing preventative measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:27">[00:57:27]</a>. These "invisible" problems (like login errors where users don't even enter the data stream) might be missed if only looking at averages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:26">[00:59:26]</a>.

## Fostering Extreme Ownership

DoorDash cultivates a culture of extreme ownership from its leadership, exemplified by its founder and CEO, Tony Xu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:16">[00:34:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:17">[00:41:17]</a>. This means expecting every team member, regardless of their specific role (e.g., data scientist), to focus on solving the problem at hand and driving outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:20">[00:41:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:56">[00:41:56]</a>. This could mean a data scientist picking up the phone to call customers for qualitative insights when data alone isn't enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:47">[00:41:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:47">[00:42:47]</a>. This cross-functional engagement is encouraged and helps team members explore other career paths within the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:51">[00:43:51]</a>.

Early DoorDash culture was marked by a willingness to "roll up your sleeves" and do whatever was needed to win, even tasks outside one's job description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:02">[00:34:02]</a>. An early example involved a sales manager, whose compensation was tied to signing merchants, still participating in 5 AM promotional handouts for consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:46">[00:35:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>. Another highlight was the entire company jumping on customer support calls during a site outage, prioritizing customer well-being over everything else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:51">[00:36:51]</a>.

## AI in Analytics

AI presents opportunities to enhance team productivity. DoorDash is exploring using AI to empower non-technical users to perform tasks like editing SQL queries on their own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:02">[01:04:02]</a>. This reduces the burden on the analytics team and allows them to focus on higher-value work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:37">[01:04:37]</a>. An internal chatbot, "Ask Data AI," is being developed for this purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:52">[01:04:52]</a>.

## Value of Non-Traditional Backgrounds

Jessica Lax herself has a non-traditional background, having started her career in investment banking and becoming a data scientist out of necessity, self-taught in SQL and Python <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:50">[00:29:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:20">[00:41:20]</a>. She values diverse backgrounds in her team, including those with PhDs in statistics, who bring technical depth, combined with her own grounding in driving business impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:51">[00:30:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:06">[00:31:06]</a>.

DoorDash's analytics team is a net importer of talent, with many individuals transitioning from partner teams (engineering, operations, marketing, finance) to analytics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:03">[01:06:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:17">[01:06:17]</a>. These individuals often acquire technical skills on the job or have some prior training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:43">[01:06:43]</a>. This creates a unique environment where team members with different expertise can teach each other, fostering a diverse mix of complimentary skills and experiences from various company stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:09">[01:07:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:01">[01:08:01]</a>.

## Key Takeaways

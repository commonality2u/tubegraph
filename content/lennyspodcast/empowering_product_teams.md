[[empowered_product_teams_vs_feature_teams | Empowered product teams]], unlike traditional feature teams, are given problems to solve rather than a prioritized list of features to build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:53:01">[08:53:01]</a>. This fundamental difference shifts the focus from output to outcomes, allowing teams to leverage their skills and knowledge to discover the best solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:14">[09:05:14]</a>.

## The Chasm Between Product Cultures
Marty Cagan, author of "Empowered" and "Inspired" and founder of Silicon Valley Product Group, expresses frustration that in 2022, there remains a significant "chasm" between how good companies operate and the rest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:28">[04:28:28]</a>. He notes that many individuals working in less effective companies don't believe that true [[empowerment_and_team_autonomy_in_product_management | empowered product teams]] exist, while those in strong product cultures are perplexed by the alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>. This highlights a core misconception about [[common_challenges_faced_by_product_teams_and_how_to_overcome_them | product management]] where many are "so ingrained" in an obsolete model of product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>.

### Feature Teams vs. Product Teams
The distinction between [[feature_teams_vs_product_teams | feature teams]] and real product teams is stark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:32:17">[07:32:17]</a>.

**Feature Teams** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:07:07">[08:07:07]</a>:
*   Are handed a prioritized list of features or projects, often determined quarterly by stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10:07">[08:10:07]</a>.
*   Their primary task is to design, code, test, and deploy these predefined solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40:02">[08:40:02]</a>.
*   They are there to serve the business by cranking out features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:09">[08:44:09]</a>.
*   The product manager's role is often akin to a project manager, herding tasks and ensuring requirements are documented and implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:00:09">[11:00:09]</a>.

**Real Product Teams** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:49:09">[08:49:09]</a>:
*   Are given problems to solve, which can be customer or company problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:55:04">[08:55:04]</a>.
*   Are equipped with the skills to discover the best solutions to those problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:14">[09:05:14]</a>.
*   Push decision-making down to those with the most knowledge, such as engineers working with technology daily and product teams engaging with users weekly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:17">[09:12:17]</a>.
*   Focus on **outcomes** (solving the problem) rather than just **output** (releases) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:04">[09:37:04]</a>. They celebrate when a problem is actually solved and results are accomplished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:09">[10:00:09]</a>.
*   Product managers are responsible for ensuring the solution is valuable and viable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:24:00">[11:24:00]</a>. Designers own usability, and engineers own feasibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:18:00">[11:18:00]</a>.

## Why Companies Struggle to Empower
Steve Jobs, in "The Lost Interview" from 1995, offered a "prescient" theory on why many companies lose their "mojo" and fail to innovate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:20:06">[18:20:06]</a>:
*   As companies grow, product historically became less important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:27:00">[19:27:00]</a>.
*   Leaders were promoted from marketing, sales, and finance, departments that drive growth when innovation stalls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:37:00">[19:37:00]</a>.
*   This leads to a culture where good product people don't want to work and leave for companies that value product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:06:00">[20:06:00]</a>.

This phenomenon is described as a "disease" where companies, due to market share or general success, stop innovating, opting for low-risk optimizations rather than true discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:44:00">[20:44:00]</a>. After founders leave, companies often become "scared" and don't know what is essential versus incidental, leading to a focus on tweaking existing flows rather than creating new value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:38:00">[21:38:00]</a>.

Another "disease" Jobs highlighted is when managers believe "an idea is 90% of the work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:24:00">[23:24:00]</a>. They fail to appreciate the "craftsmanship" of product discovery, where ideas constantly change and evolve through iteration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:42:00">[23:42:00]</a>.

### The Problem vs. Solution Fallacy
A common pitfall for product teams is spending too much time validating problems that founders or stakeholders already know <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:40:00">[25:40:00]</a>. While understanding the problem is crucial, customers ultimately buy solutions, not problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:35:00">[26:35:00]</a>. The real challenge is to develop a solution that is superior to competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:48:00">[26:48:00]</a>. Product teams must save time for "solution discovery" and focus on creating a winning solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:55:00">[26:55:00]</a>.

### The "What" vs. "How" in Product Management
A common misconception is that product managers only determine "the what" (requirements) and not "the how" (the solution) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:36:00">[27:36:00]</a>. This is incorrect. A successful solution must be valuable, usable, feasible, and viable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:13:00">[28:13:00]</a>. Product managers are responsible for ensuring **valuable** (solving a real user problem) and **viable** (working for the business) aspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:31:00">[28:31:00]</a>. These are integral parts of "the how" and require significant skill and work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:42:00">[28:42:00]</a>.

## Fostering Empowerment
For product teams aspiring to be more empowered, several steps can be taken, even within a traditional feature-team environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:02:00">[36:02:00]</a>:

### 1. Shift to Problem-Solving
Instead of being given a feature to build, ask stakeholders what problem they are trying to solve and how success will be measured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:20:00">[37:20:00]</a>. This helps uncover the underlying Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and the actual outcome desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:46:00">[37:46:00]</a>.

### 2. Equip the Product Manager
A product manager on an [[empowered_product_teams_vs_feature_teams | empowered product team]] needs to develop four key areas of expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:19:00">[39:19:00]</a>:
1.  **Users and Customers**: Become an expert on the users and customers, understanding their needs deeply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:25:00">[39:25:00]</a>. This often requires direct engagement, like visiting customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:38:00">[39:38:00]</a>.
2.  **Data**: Be an expert in how the product is used, analyzing user and sales data, and understanding changes over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:14:00">[40:14:00]</a>.
3.  **Business Context**: Learn the different aspects of the business, including marketing, sales, monetization, compliance, regulatory, privacy, and security issues <a class="yt="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:30:00">[40:30:00]</a>. This builds trust with stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:11:00">[41:11:00]</a>.
4.  **Competitive Landscape & Industry Trends**: Understand the competitive environment, industry trends, and relevant thought leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:15:00">[41:15:00]</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> The product manager brings this unique knowledge to the team, which designers and engineers typically don't have, enabling the team to formulate effective solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:29:00">[41:29:00]</a>.

### 3. Provide Strategic Context
Empowered teams need to understand the "big picture" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:02:00">[42:02:00]</a>. This includes the product vision, product strategy, and how their work relates to other teams' efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:06:00">[42:06:00]</a>. Ideally, leaders provide this context, but product managers should seek it out if not readily available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:17:00">[42:17:00]</a>.

### 4. Cultivate Discovery Skills
Product teams require skills and techniques for product discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:28:00">[42:28:00]</a>. Resources like "Inspired" by Marty Cagan, "Continuous Discovery Habits" by Teresa Torres, and "Sprint" by Jake Knapp offer valuable methodologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:37:00">[43:37:00]</a>. These techniques help teams learn what to build by focusing on reasons why users *wouldn't* use a product through evaluative user research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:05:00">[33:05:00]</a>.

> [!TIP]
> When conducting user research, it's crucial for the product manager and designer to be present alongside the researcher to ensure the insights are absorbed directly and acted upon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:43:00">[33:43:00]</a>.

### Sacred Access for Product Managers
Marty Cagan emphasizes three "sacred" areas of unencumbered access for a product manager to succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:33:00">[50:33:00]</a>:
1.  **Users and Customers**: Direct access to understand their needs and challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:49:00">[50:49:00]</a>.
2.  **Engineers**: Working directly with engineers daily to solve problems, rather than through intermediaries like product owners or project managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:15:00">[51:15:00]</a>.
3.  **Stakeholders**: Direct access to business stakeholders to understand business needs and ensure solutions work for the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:54:00">[51:54:00]</a>.

Delegating these core responsibilities to other roles (e.g., certain interpretations of product ops) can severely damage a product manager's effectiveness and a company's ability to innovate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:57:00">[52:57:00]</a>.

## The [[role_of_product_leaders | Role of Product Leaders]] and Coaching
In strong product companies, the [[role_of_product_leaders | role of product leaders]] hasn't changed much in 20+ years, although the techniques have evolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:42:00">[48:42:00]</a>. However, in the broader industry, there's a "mess" with many unqualified product roles and titles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:00:00">[49:00:00]</a>. This is partly due to "agile coaches" who teach process without practical product experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:21:00">[49:21:00]</a>.

Leaders are increasingly recognizing the importance of coaching. Major companies like Microsoft, Google, and Apple highlight coaching as a top principle for their managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:16:00">[46:16:00]</a>. This focus on coaching and avoiding micromanagement is essential for allowing teams to be truly [[empowerment_and_team_autonomy_in_product_management | empowered]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:37:00">[46:37:00]</a>.

### The Disease of Processed People
A major concern in product management is the "disease of processed people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:49:00">[55:49:00]</a>. While scaling is necessary and difficult, there are two primary approaches: scaling with process or scaling with leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:06:00">[56:06:00]</a>. The only way to achieve good outcomes is to scale with leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:16:00">[56:16:00]</a>. Relying on rigid processes, like Safe (Scaled Agile Framework), is seen as a "repackaged waterfall" that, despite being marketed as agile, is its antithesis and will "destroy your company" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:28:00">[56:28:00]</a>. True [[empowerment_and_team_autonomy_in_product_management | empowerment]] comes from trusting and investing in skilled individuals, not from an over-reliance on process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:15:00">[57:15:00]</a>.

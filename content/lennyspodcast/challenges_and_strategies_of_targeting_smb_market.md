Targeting the Small and Medium Business (SMB) market presents unique [[challenges_and_strategies_in_startup_growth | challenges]] and opportunities for startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>. HubSpot, from its inception, made a "high conviction, low consensus" bet to focus exclusively on the SMB market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:12">[00:29:12]</a>. This decision was deliberately contrarian to conventional startup advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:30">[00:51:30]</a>.

## Why SMB is Challenging

Classically, companies that focus on small businesses are very challenging for several reasons:
*   **Scaling Difficulty** It's "very hard" to reach small businesses at scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:32">[00:30:32]</a>.
*   **Adoption Hesitancy** SMBs are often "more old school, not early adopters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:35">[00:30:35]</a>.
*   **Limited Upsell Potential** A single SMB customer is seen as "just like one small customer" who is unlikely to upgrade significantly or roll out to a large group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:39">[00:30:39]</a>. They also tend to not increase spending quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:45">[00:45:45]</a>.

## The Case for SMB

Despite these difficulties, Dharmesh Shaw, co-founder and CTO of HubSpot, advocates for targeting SMBs:

> [!quote] "My advice is absolutely do it. A, because it's hard... but B, okay so I'll I'll tell you this quick story in terms of how we chose and chose FNB [SMB]. So this, my co-founder I met in grad school and he had done software his he was on the kind of sales and marketing side, I was on the product engineering side, didn't know each other before grad school and we met there. But one of the things we kind of as we were kind of noodling on on possible ideas of working together on a startup, we said, 'Oh, we had done both done enterprise software before,' right, the kind of opposite of of SB [SMB]." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:58">[00:45:58]</a>

Dharmesh describes SMB as offering "The Best of Both Worlds" compared to enterprise or consumer markets:
*   **Enterprise-like Benefits**
    *   Customers pay money for the product, avoiding reliance on advertising subsidies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:35">[00:47:35]</a>.
    *   Allows for building an incrementally more valuable, measurable business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:41">[00:47:41]</a>.
*   **Consumer-like Benefits**
    *   Millions of potential customers exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:52">[00:47:52]</a>.
    *   No significant revenue concentration, meaning the company retains control over its product roadmap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:54">[00:47:54]</a>.
    *   Very short feedback loops enable rapid experimentation and risk-taking without catastrophic consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:57">[00:47:57]</a>.

## HubSpot's Contrarian Approach to SMB

HubSpot's strategy for SMB was a deliberate "zig" while others were "zagging" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:52">[00:50:52]</a>:

*   **Focus on the Problem, Not Just a Feature**
    The conventional startup advice is to "focus on one thing and be really, really exceptionally world-class at that one thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:30">[00:51:30]</a>. HubSpot did "exactly the opposite" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:41">[00:51:41]</a>. From year one, they built a broad range of tools (SEO, web analytics, blogging, content management) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:45">[00:51:45]</a>. The reason was to solve the *actual customer problem* of SMBs lacking the "wherewithal" to integrate disparate tools themselves, even if excellent individual tools existed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:06">[00:52:06]</a>.
    
    > [!info] Prioritize the Problem
    > Founders should "fall in love with the problem" rather than the solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:51">[00:54:51]</a>. If, after deeply understanding the customer's problem, it's clear that more than one feature or product is needed, then going wide can be justified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:36">[00:55:36]</a>.

*   **Measuring Success: Not the Best, but Integrated**
    HubSpot had a unique metric for this wide approach: if they were in the top three in any individual product category (e.g., blogging tools), it meant they had "invested too much in that category" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:21">[00:53:21]</a>. Their value proposition was not to be the best in a single tool, but that "everything works so well together" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:34">[00:53:34]</a>.

    > [!info] Rule of Thumb for Going Wide
    > If you choose to go wide, you cannot also be "the best" in every dimension. You can be the best at solving a particular *problem* with an integrated suite, but not necessarily have the best *product* along each individual dimension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:59">[00:55:59]</a>.

*   **Fighting Reverse Gravity**
    In the software market, Dharmesh observes a "reverse gravity" phenomenon: successful companies are always "pulled up" the market, tending to serve larger customers over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:07">[00:49:07]</a>. This occurs because bigger customers typically stay longer, pay more, and have higher Net Promoter Scores (NPS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:19">[00:49:19]</a>. This often leads every successful software company to eventually become an enterprise software company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:43">[00:49:43]</a>.

    However, in the SMB world, companies compete primarily with those "stupid enough to stay focused on SMB" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:58">[00:49:58]</a>, as others naturally drift upwards. While harder to achieve, once the "physics of it" are figured out, an SMB-focused model can be "much more sustainable, much more fun" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:07">[00:50:07]</a>. Dharmesh encourages startups to "at least start there, try to make it work until it gets really, really, really painful and then try some more" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:18">[00:50:18]</a>.

Ultimately, HubSpot's success in the SMB market, even when it was "a hundred times harder" to raise capital for such a venture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:15">[00:48:15]</a>, demonstrates that a deliberate, contrarian approach can yield significant long-term benefits.

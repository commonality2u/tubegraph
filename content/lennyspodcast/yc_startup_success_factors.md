Dalton Caldwell, a managing director and group partner at [[the_role_and_impact_of_y_combinator_in_startup_success | Y Combinator]], has worked with over 20 different batches, providing insights to companies like Instacart, Retool, Brex, DoorDash, and Webflow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. His experience as a co-founder and CEO of two companies, imim (acquired by MySpace) and app.net, an early ad-free Twitter competitor, further informs his tactical and deep understanding of the [[challenges_and_strategies_for_creating_successful_startups | startup journey]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Caldwell's advice often emphasizes perseverance and fundamental principles for [[lessons_from_successful_founders_and_lstartups | startup success]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

## Core Principles for Success

*   **Simple, Pragmatic Advice**: Caldwell frequently advises founders to "sell, make money, don't run out of money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. This seemingly obvious advice is crucial for founders to remain in the right mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
*   **Focus on Fundamentals**: Even for the best founders, being reminded of the fundamentals and basics helps maintain the right mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.
*   **"Just Don't Die"**: A key mantra is "just don't die" and "just keep your startup going" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. This constant affirmation for founders to continue and perform high-quality work is often considered his most impactful advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. The underlying theme across many [[the_role_and_impact_of_y_combinator_in_startup_success | YC]] success stories is that founders often push through situations where, rationally, they should have given up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

### Knowing When to Give Up

While persistence is vital, Caldwell acknowledges there are times when shutting down a startup is the right move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. His advice for this nuanced decision includes:

*   **Are you still having fun?** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>
*   **Do you enjoy spending time with your co-founders?** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>
*   **Does the work profoundly affect you negatively?** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>
*   **Do you still love your customers and your product?** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a> For example, the Airbnb founders continued because they loved their product, their customers, and working with each other, even when things were difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.

It's acceptable to stop if you're truly done, as no one will likely remember a shutdown in 10 or 20 years, provided you maintain integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. Life is short, and there's no need to force oneself to work on something that brings misery just to save face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.

### The "Struggle Train" and Near-Death Experiences

It's common for founders to feel like their batch or company is uniquely struggling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>. Caldwell shared a story from the Winter 2017 batch where two companies, "Vyond" (a VR headset idea) and "Cashew" (a P2P Venmo competitor for the UK), appeared to be the worst performers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. Both teams were despondent about their progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. However, Vyond later pivoted to become Brex (a decacorn), and Cashew became Retool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. The companies that seemed objectively the worst became the most successful in that group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>.

Caldwell asserts that 100% of successful companies go through a "near-death experience" where founders seriously consider giving up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:42">[00:39:42]</a>. It's rare for a company to die purely from running out of money while founders are still positive and full of ideas; more often, it's due to loss of hope, internal conflict, or simply being "done" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:17">[00:38:17]</a>.

## Pivoting for Success

Caldwell is known as the "king of the pivot" for his guidance to founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>.

*   **Getting "Warmer"**: A good pivot usually means getting "warmer" or closer to something you are already an expert at, building on lessons learned from the prior idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>. For example, Brex's founders pivoted from VR headsets to fintech, leveraging their prior experience in Brazil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. Retool's founders built internal tools for their previous startup, which became the foundation for their successful pivot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>.
*   **Discovering Unique Insights**: The original idea doesn't need to be perfect; the process of grinding on an initial idea can lead to unique insights that inform a better pivot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>. Segment, for instance, pivoted multiple times as they gained expertise in analytics from their initial product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>.
*   **When to Pivot**: It's a good time to pivot when the founder is out of ideas on how to make the current product grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>. However, if there are still several good growth ideas that haven't been tried, it's worth continuing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>.

## Identifying Good Startup Ideas

*   **Avoiding "Tarpit Ideas"**: These are ideas that appear to be unsolved problems, generate positive feedback, and seem like good startup opportunities, but many people have tried and failed at them, often since the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:27]</a>. Examples include apps to coordinate friends for social outings or music discovery platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:58">[00:24:58]</a>. A key characteristic of a tarpit idea is that it can receive good initial validation, drawing founders in and getting them stuck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:27">[00:25:27]</a>.
*   **Unique Information Diet**: Founders often gravitate to the same ideas because they consume the same information (podcasts, social media, blogs) as everyone else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:02">[00:22:02]</a>. To find unique ideas, founders should mix up their information diet or explore areas of their personal interest or expertise that are "off the beaten path" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:37">[00:22:37]</a>.
*   **Targeting Unpopular Incumbents**: A practical strategy for finding good ideas is to look for large, publicly traded or private equity-owned companies whose customers hate them (low NPS), indicating a knowable big market with poor incumbent software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a>.

### YC's "Request for Startups"

[[the_role_and_impact_of_y_combinator_in_startup_success | YC]] publishes a "Request for Startups" with 20 categories of ideas they are interested in funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This is meant to inspire founders to consider ideas they might not have contemplated, rather than being exclusive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:22">[00:52:22]</a>. Examples include:

*   **ERPs (Enterprise Resource Planning Software)**: A space with few applications, but often good ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:46">[00:52:46]</a>.
*   **Open Source Companies**: [[the_role_and_impact_of_y_combinator_in_startup_success | YC]] is excited to fund more open source ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:16">[00:53:16]</a>.
*   **Space Companies**: Despite appearing bold, [[the_role_and_impact_of_y_combinator_in_startup_success | YC]] has had success with them and encourages more applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:31">[00:53:31]</a>.
*   **Hard Science/Deep Tech**: Such as ending cancer, spatial computing, or new defense technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:17">[00:54:17]</a>.
*   **Better Enterprise Glue**: Software to connect brittle and janky business systems, especially with AI/LLM improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:51">[00:54:51]</a>.
*   **Small Fine-Tuned Models**: As an alternative to gigantic, generic AI models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:21">[00:55:21]</a>.

## Investor Perspectives and Market Size

When investors say "no," it's often not because a startup is bad, but because the investor has limited investment slots and is waiting for something that meets a higher bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:31">[00:27:31]</a>. Investors are trying to pick opportunities they are most excited about or that can be truly phenomenally big <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:12">[00:28:12]</a>.

For early-stage (pre-seed or [[the_role_and_impact_of_y_combinator_in_startup_success | YC]]-applying) companies, the Total Addressable Market (TAM) is less critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:37">[00:29:37]</a>. Some phenomenally successful startups like Uber or Airbnb had tiny initial TAMs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:53">[00:29:53]</a>. The focus for [[the_role_and_impact_of_y_combinator_in_startup_success | YC]] is on whether founders can get users and grow, and if they're making something people want <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:59">[00:30:59]</a>. While market size eventually matters, it's not the primary concern for early-stage investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:22">[00:30:22]</a>.

## Building and Growing the Startup

*   **Avoid Over-Delegation and Early Senior Hires**: Founders should avoid over-delegating and remain deeply involved in product development, especially in the early stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:40">[00:32:40]</a>. Hiring too many senior people with fancy resumes too early can lead to founders losing sight of the core product and users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:02">[00:34:02]</a>. Founders cannot delegate caring about their users or the quality of the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:28">[00:33:28]</a>.
*   **Prioritize Customer Obsession**: If founders genuinely care about their customers and product, their instincts will guide them to prioritize effectively, spending less time networking with investors and more time being obsessed with the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:39">[00:34:39]</a>.

### Talking to Customers

*   **In-Person Interaction**: It's crucial to talk to potential customers in person rather than hiding behind a keyboard or relying solely on online validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:21">[00:41:21]</a>. Many founders avoid this due to social anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:41">[00:42:41]</a>.
*   **Time Allocation**: Approximately 20-30% of a founder's time, especially early on, should be dedicated to in-person or direct customer meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:20">[00:43:20]</a>.
*   **Overcoming Awkwardness**: Founders must push through the initial awkwardness of meeting people, asking for feedback, and demonstrating their product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:52">[00:42:52]</a>.
*   **The "Collison Install"**: Even after getting a "yes" from a customer, the sale isn't complete until the product is implemented and actively used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:07">[00:47:07]</a>. The Stripe founders, for example, would offer to come to customers' offices and help them install Stripe to ensure activation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:17">[00:46:17]</a>.
*   **Start with Customer Validation**: For aspiring founders who don't know where to begin, Caldwell advises starting with customer validation and pre-selling before writing code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:41">[01:11:41]</a>. Building should only begin once there's conviction that at least one person would use the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:15">[01:12:15]</a>.

## [[attributes_of_successful_startup_founders | Attributes of successful startup founders]]

Caldwell believes personality types don't matter as much; he has seen success from quiet, extroverted, and diverse individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:18">[00:48:18]</a>. What truly sets successful founders apart is:

*   **Strong Desire and Belief**: They genuinely want to succeed and deeply believe in themselves and their ability to make their company work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>. This internal belief is so strong that it "warps the world to bend to that will," convincing employees and others that success is inevitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:51">[00:49:51]</a>.
*   **Building Conviction**: This deep conviction isn't present from day one, especially when a product isn't working or customers aren't there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:37">[00:50:37]</a>. Instead, conviction grows through a "network effect virtual cycle," where positive feedback from customers and data reinforces the belief that the founder is on the right track <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:32">[00:51:32]</a>. For example, Patrick Collison wasn't certain about Stripe until a year or two into its operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:16">[00:51:16]</a>.
*   **Staying Power and Adaptability**: Successful founders in Silicon Valley, such as Sam Altman or Reid Hoffman, demonstrated significant "staying power" and were able to reinvent themselves across multiple eras and career stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:12">[00:57:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:11">[00:59:11]</a>.
*   **Optimism and Energy**: They maintain a high level of optimism and energy, using it as a motor to keep trying and doing good work, even when faced with failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:37">[01:10:37]</a>.

### Contrarian View on Early-Stage Growth Hacking

Caldwell holds a contrarian view that "growth hacking," intensive analytics, and A/B testing are often a waste of time for very early-stage startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:58">[01:05:58]</a>. Much of the advice found online is geared towards later-stage companies that already have product-market fit and scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:12">[01:06:12]</a>. For a startup with no customers, focusing on complex growth theory derived from large tech companies is actively unhelpful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:51">[01:06:51]</a>.

Instead, early-stage consumer companies need a sophisticated understanding of how to get off the ground, such as focusing on a specific segment (like Facebook's initial Harvard penetration) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:50">[01:08:50]</a>. Founders should look at what successful companies did when they were getting their first thousand users, not what they do today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:05">[01:09:05]</a>.

## Personal Reflections

Caldwell emphasizes checking in with oneself to ensure enjoyment in work and life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:55">[01:16:55]</a>. If not, changes should be made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:03">[01:17:03]</a>. For founders, who are in control of their companies, this means actively admitting dissatisfaction and seeking solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:05">[01:17:05]</a>.

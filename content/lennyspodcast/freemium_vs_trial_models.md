The choice between a freemium and a trial model is a crucial decision for companies, especially in the B2B space. While both allow for free product usage, their underlying strategies and impact on growth differ significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:34:00">[42:34:00]</a>.

## Definitions

*   **Freemium:** A model where users are allowed to use a product in some free capacity indefinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:13:00">[42:13:00]</a>. This often includes feature walls or usage limits, but there is an ongoing "forever free" component <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:20:00">[42:20:00]</a>.
*   **Trial:** A model where users are allowed to use a product in some capacity, but it is **time-bound** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:28:00">[42:28:00]</a>.

At their core, freemium and trial are the same in allowing free product usage, but trials add a "superficial time bound" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:39:00">[42:39:00]</a>.

## Downsides of Time-Bound Trials

Time-bound trials can be problematic, particularly for B2B segments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:23:00">[43:23:00]</a>:

*   **Varying Time-to-Value:** The time it takes for a user to realize value from a product can differ significantly. A small startup might complete a project in 24-48 hours, while a large enterprise with many dependencies might need a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:00:00">[43:00:00]</a>.
*   **Alienation of Large Enterprises:** If a trial is, for example, seven days, it will only cater to users in small startups and will "completely alienate" large enterprises who cannot fully try the product within that timeframe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:28:00">[43:28:00]</a>. Users might be too busy to invest time in discovery during a short, stressful trial period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:52:00">[44:52:00]</a>.
*   **Superficiality:** A time component is not a good measure of how long it takes a user to get value from a product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:49:00">[43:49:00]</a>. Instead, it's preferable to use a usage-based metric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:53:00">[43:53:00]</a>.

## Strategic Reasons for Freemium

Instead of a time-bound trial, companies should consider implementing a freemium model with a clear strategy behind it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:09:00">[46:09:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:32:00">[47:32:00]</a>. The biggest mistake is to view freemium solely as a [[monetization_and_churn_optimization | conversion rate optimization]] tactic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:54:00">[49:54:00]</a>.

A freemium strategy should align with business impact and growth, by checking one or more of these boxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:05:00">[50:05:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:25:00">[50:25:00]</a>:

*   **Indirect Monetization (Virality/Network Effects):** If a free offering helps drive acquisition through virality or network effects, it should be free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:38:00">[50:38:00]</a>.
    *   *Example:* Miro offers three editable boards for free. Some users may never pay, but they acquire other users by sharing and collaborating on these boards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:13:00">[48:13:00]</a>. SurveyMonkey had a large free user base that drove 100% of their acquisition, reducing marketing and sales spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:26:00">[48:26:00]</a>.
*   **Proof of Concept (POC) / "Aha!" Moment:** Allow users to achieve their "aha moment" in the free tier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:54:00">[50:54:00]</a>. This lowers the friction of activation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:17:00">[46:17:00]</a>.
    *   *Example:* MongoDB offers a free community cluster for development. While no one would put a production application on it, it allows users to prototype and understand if MongoDB is the right solution without time constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:30:00">[44:30:00]</a>.
*   **Commoditization:** If a feature has become commoditized in the market, it should be offered for free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:49:00">[50:49:00]</a>. The challenge then becomes differentiating the free offering through innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:01:00">[50:01:00]</a>.
*   **Habit Loops:** Include features that create habitual usage, such as notifications or communication channels, in the free tier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:00:00">[51:00:00]</a>.
*   **Strategic Land:** Use freemium to land customers in a segment you may not be monetizing directly now, but plan to expand with later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:45:00">[48:45:00]</a>.
*   **Product Development and Data Collection:** Freemium can be a "breeding ground for adjacent use cases" and personas, allowing companies to discover new trends and pivot their roadmap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:15:00">[49:15:00]</a>. It also allows for collecting data that helps build and improve paid products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:29:00">[49:29:00]</a>.
    *   *Example:* LinkedIn's strong freemium user base and network effects allow them to build and sell separate paid products like Sales Navigator and recruiting tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:42:00">[49:42:00]</a>.

## Choosing Your Freemium Strategy

The overall advice is to "always have something free and self-service" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:24:00">[47:24:00]</a>. The product doesn't need to be entirely free, nor does it need to replace a trial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:25:00">[47:25:00]</a>.

High-friction products, where activation involves connecting to data sources or setting up complex infrastructure (e.g., Amplitude, MongoDB, Twilio, Contentful, Snowflake, Okta, Zendesk, Looker), can still benefit from freemium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:00:00">[46:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:04:00">[47:04:00]</a>. The friction level often depends on the user segment; a small startup may find it easy, while a large enterprise finds it high-friction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:48:00">[45:48:00]</a>.

The goal is to continuously innovate and push down the cost and complexity of providing self-serve options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:41:00">[46:41:00]</a>. [[Open Source and CommunityDriven Software Development | No-code platforms]] are examples of this innovation, enabling users to perform tasks that previously required technical teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:53:00">[46:53:00]</a>.

The fundamental principle is that anything that promotes your growth model should be free, while anything that creates friction for it can be gated in the paid tier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:19:00">[51:19:00]</a>. Companies must ensure their freemium strategy helps achieve growth model outcomes without sacrificing [[monetization_and_churn_optimization | monetization]] potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:33:00">[51:33:00]</a>.

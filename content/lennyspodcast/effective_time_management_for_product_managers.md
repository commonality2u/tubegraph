Shreyas Doshi, known for sharing wisdom on [[improving_product_management_skills | product management]], emphasizes the importance of effective time management for product managers (PMs) to maximize their impact and avoid overwhelm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:59">[00:39:59]</a>. His insights, rooted in real-life experiences at major tech companies like Yahoo, Twitter, Google, and Stripe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>, highlight that not all tasks are created equal for individuals in high-leverage roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:33">[00:41:33]</a>.

## The LNO Framework: Prioritizing Your Time

Doshi's LNO framework provides a structured approach to [[communication_and_prioritization_techniques_for_product_managers | prioritizing]] tasks and managing time effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:20">[00:41:20]</a>. The framework categorizes tasks into three types:

*   **L (Leverage) Tasks**: These tasks yield a significantly higher return (e.g., 10x or 100x) for the effort invested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:42">[00:41:42]</a>.
*   **N (Neutral) Tasks**: These tasks provide a return roughly equal to or slightly more than the effort put in (e.g., 1x effort for 1.1x impact) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:02">[00:42:02]</a>.
*   **O (Overhead) Tasks**: These tasks result in significantly less impact than the effort required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:14">[00:42:14]</a>.

The common pitfall for many ambitious or perfectionist [[Role of Product Managers | PMs]] is treating all task types the same, leading to dissatisfaction and stress despite long hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:25">[00:40:25]</a>. The key is to consciously differentiate and allocate time based on a task's leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:22">[00:42:22]</a>.

### Contextualizing Task Types

A significant insight of the LNO framework is that the same activity can fall into different categories depending on the context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:05">[00:45:05]</a>:

*   **Bug Reports**: Filing a bug report can be an L-task requiring explicit detail if it's for a critical, high-impact issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:34">[00:44:34]</a>. Conversely, it might be an O-task if it's a minor issue where a quick, minimal report suffices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:45">[00:44:45]</a>.
*   **Note-Taking**: Synthesizing and sharing notes from a routine meeting might be a neutral task where quick bullet points are sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:37">[00:45:37]</a>. However, notes from a contentious product review with a CEO on a strategic topic become an L-task, requiring careful language and clarity to avoid misinterpretation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:07">[00:46:07]</a>.

By identifying tasks as L, N, or O, [[Role of Product Managers | PMs]] can focus their most productive and energetic time on L-tasks, allowing their "inner perfectionist" to shine where it matters most <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:55">[00:42:55]</a>. This means consciously reducing time spent on N and O tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:35">[00:43:35]</a>.

## Identifying and Tackling High-Leverage Tasks

[[why_product_leaders_are_so_busy_and_how_to_manage_it | Product leaders are often busy]] constantly solving execution problems, but Doshi suggests that many of these are actually symptoms of deeper [[effective_product_management_strategies | strategy]] or culture problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>. The most impactful, high-leverage tasks are often those that [[Role of Product Managers | PMs]] implicitly know they *should* be doing but procrastinate on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:24">[00:48:24]</a>.

These tasks often include:
*   **Defining Strategy**: [[challenges_in_goal_setting_and_execution_in_product_management | Working on getting the product strategy right]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:54">[00:48:54]</a>.
*   **Writing PRDs for Difficult Features**: Crafting detailed product requirements documents for complex, high-impact features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:35">[00:50:35]</a>.
*   **Aligning Teams**: Mediating and aligning two misaligned teams to foster collaboration and impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:42">[00:50:42]</a>.

Procrastination on L-tasks stems from knowing their high impact and the dedicated attention they require, often coupled with a fear of not being able to deliver effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:35">[00:49:35]</a>. Doshi suggests that [[Role of Product Managers | PMs]] should view these challenges as opportunities, remembering that "the cave you fear contains the treasure that you seek" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:00">[00:53:00]</a>.

### Practical Tactics for L-Tasks:

1.  **Placebo Productivity**: Before tackling an L-task, intentionally fill the preceding days with N and O tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:1:32">[01:1:32]</a>. This "tricks" the mind into feeling productive and prepares for the significant L-task ahead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>.
2.  **Change of Location**: To combat procrastination, work from a different environment when focusing on an L-task (e.g., a coffee shop, co-working space) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:11">[01:02:11]</a>. This shift in physical space can force focus and a different mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:38">[01:02:38]</a>.

These tactics, combined with understanding the LNO framework, provide [[tips_for_new_and_senior_product_managers | product managers]] with actionable strategies to manage their time and maximize their overall impact.

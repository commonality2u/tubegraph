Rahul Vora, founder and CEO of Superhuman, advocates for developing business software using principles from game design. This approach aims to create products that are enjoyable, encourage word-of-mouth referrals, and build a strong brand identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.

## Game Design vs. Gamification

Vora draws a critical distinction between game design and gamification, asserting that gamification "does not work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:27">[01:00:27]</a>. Gamification, in his view, is merely the act of adding superficial elements like points, levels, trophies, or badges to a product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:35">[01:00:35]</a>.

### The Problem with Gamification

The ineffectiveness of gamification is rooted in its negative impact on human motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:43">[01:00:43]</a>. A Stanford study from the 1970s illustrates this:
*   Researchers observed children aged 3 to 4 who were pre-interested in drawing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:54">[01:00:54]</a>.
*   Some children were promised a reward (a certificate with a gold seal and ribbon), while others were not told about any reward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:03">[01:01:03]</a>.
*   After the drawing session, children who expected a reward spent only 8% of their subsequent time drawing, whereas those who expected no reward spent 17% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:29">[01:01:29]</a>.
*   This demonstrates that the "very presence of a reward halved their motivation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:43">[01:01:43]</a>.
*   Rewards are considered extrinsic motivators, meaning they are pursued to earn external goals, and they "massively undermine intrinsic motivation," which is when activities are inherently interesting and satisfying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:52">[01:01:52]</a>.
*   Therefore, gamification often fails because it introduces extrinsic rewards that diminish the intrinsic enjoyment or engagement with the underlying experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:06">[01:02:06]</a>. True success occurs when the "underlying experience was already designed like a game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:13">[01:02:13]</a>.

## Principles of Game Design at Superhuman

As a former professional game designer, Vora notes that there is no single unifying theory of game design; instead, it draws upon psychology, mathematics, storytelling, and interaction design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:33">[01:02:33]</a>. At Superhuman, they focus on five key areas: Goals, emotions, toys, controls, and flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:52">[01:02:52]</a>.

One core principle is to "make fun toys and then combine those into games" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:06">[01:03:06]</a>. Just as a ball is a toy and football is a game, the best games are built from enjoyable "toys" because they are fun on both levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:17">[01:03:17]</a>.

### Example: The Time Autocompleter

A prime example of a "toy" in Superhuman is the Time Autocompleter, which appears when users hit 'H' to snooze or set reminders on emails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:41">[01:03:41]</a>.
*   Users can type in natural language (e.g., "2D" for 2 days, "3 H" for 3 hours, "1 MO" for 1 month) and the system intelligently understands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:49">[01:03:49]</a>.
*   This feature is enjoyable because it encourages "playful exploration" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:01">[01:04:01]</a>. Users experiment to see what it can do, where it breaks, and what happens with complex inputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:07">[01:04:07]</a>.
*   It provides "pleasant surprises," such as automatic time zone conversions (e.g., typing "8 a.m. in Tokyo" converts to Eastern time) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:34">[01:04:34]</a>.
*   Users can even type "never" to snooze an email indefinitely, accompanied by a shrug emoji, which adds a touch of delight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:48">[01:04:48]</a>.

When designing features, Vora encourages asking:
*   Do these features "indulge playful exploration"? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:12">[01:05:12]</a>
*   Are they "fun even without a goal"? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:14">[01:05:14]</a>
*   Do they "elicit moments of pleasant surprise"? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:17">[01:05:17]</a>

By focusing on these elements, companies can create "toys" that can be combined to build a "game" that is genuinely engaging and contributes to a positive user experience in B2B software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:23">[01:05:23]</a>.

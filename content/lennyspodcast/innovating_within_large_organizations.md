Innovating within a large, established company presents unique challenges distinct from those faced by startups. Matt Mohshari, an executive coach who has worked with CEOs of OpenAI, Coinbase, and Notion, highlights these difficulties and provides actionable strategies for fostering innovation, even in scaled environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## Challenges of Innovation in Large Companies

Large companies often struggle with innovation due to the inherent complexities of operating at scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:39">[00:55:39]</a>. When a product has millions of users, the primary concerns become site uptime and security, leading to extensive review processes for any new code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:46">[00:55:46]</a>. This rigorous approval process can significantly delay the development and deployment of new features and prototypes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:06">[00:56:06]</a>. Additionally, internal bureaucracy and the need for numerous buy-ins can stifle rapid iteration and experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:28">[00:55:28]</a>.

The challenge of having too many people in an organization also creates friction in information flow and morale issues, leading to less efficient operation, a concept exemplified by Elon Musk's philosophy that "the best part is no part" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:32">[00:23:32]</a>.

## Strategies for Successful Innovation

To overcome these challenges, Mohshari suggests creating internal structures that mimic the agility and drive of startups, while leveraging the resources of the larger organization.

### 1. Create Internal "YC Startups"
Mohshari's radical idea is to replicate the model of Y Combinator (YC) startups within a larger company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:49">[00:54:49]</a>. This involves:
*   **[[Balancing startup mentality within larger organizations | Founder Mentality Leaders]]**: Staffing these innovation teams with individuals who possess a "founder mentality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:57">[00:54:57]</a>. These individuals are often found among YC alumni whose startups may not have succeeded, as they still possess the drive and willingness to "break glass" and overcome obstacles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:01">[00:55:01]</a>.
*   **Small, Decoupled Teams**: Keep the innovation team very small to avoid the need for extensive buy-in and to enable faster iteration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:24">[00:55:24]</a>. The team should operate independently, ideally not touching the core product's code, to avoid being slowed down by the main company's rigorous approval processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:18">[00:56:18]</a>.
*   **Direct Reporting to CEO**: For maximum autonomy and speed, these small teams should report directly to the CEO, bypassing traditional product, engineering, or design hierarchies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:36">[00:56:36]</a>.

### 2. Establish Separate Legal Entities (C Corps)
A more radical, yet highly effective, approach involves creating entirely new C Corps for new products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:59">[00:56:59]</a>.
*   **Clear Separation**: This makes it clear that the new product is its own entity, distinct from the core business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:04">[00:57:04]</a>.
*   **Reduced Brand Risk**: Teams are more willing to experiment and "fail fast" because they know that potential missteps will not harm the core brand's reputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:55">[00:57:55]</a>.
*   **Example: Clipboard Health**: Wei Deng, CEO of Clipboard Health, successfully implemented this by creating five C Corps in two months, with teams iterating quickly because they weren't concerned about damaging the main brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:44">[00:57:44]</a>.

### 3. Dual Team Approach
Within these new entities, Wei Deng also employs a dual-team approach for each new product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:05">[00:58:05]</a>:
*   **Engineering-Focused Team**: Builds custom code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:10">[00:58:10]</a>.
*   **Customer Relationship-Focused Team**: May not have engineers, building manual or off-the-shelf solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:15">[00:58:15]</a>.
The goal is to see which team makes faster progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:27">[00:58:27]</a>.

### 4. Prioritize Autonomy over Equity
While many might assume significant equity is a key motivator for innovation, Mohshari argues it doesn't matter as much as commonly thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:09">[00:59:09]</a>. What truly motivates people is:
*   **Building Things that Get Used**: A desire to create products that impact the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:17">[00:59:17]</a>.
*   **Autonomy and Ownership**: Control over decision-making and the creative process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:34">[00:59:34]</a>.
*   **Joy as Motivation**: While fear can be a strong, short-term motivator, joy leads to sustained, non-corrosive motivation, allowing individuals to endure longer and enjoy the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:42">[01:00:42]</a>.

Companies like Amazon exemplify this, providing teams with resources and autonomy to "go do" something, leading to successful innovation despite not being known for lavish equity compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:47">[00:59:47]</a>.

Founders and leaders have a significant responsibility to consider the values and governance structures of their companies beyond mere financial success. A company that becomes a "malign force in the world" can be far worse than a startup failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. The stress of being a founder is hard, but what happens to so-called "successes" when they build a company they hate or find abhorrent is a greater concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. If a founder sells a company that becomes something they find abhorrent, even if they get rich, "it's not good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. This includes companies that are alive but almost never going to succeed, trapping their founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:20">[00:56:20]</a>.

## Evolution of Founder Concerns

The questions founders ask have shifted significantly over the last decade, with issues of governance and values becoming far more prominent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:58">[01:31:58]</a>. Modern companies are building products so invasive and powerful that they inherently carry a moral responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:21">[01:32:21]</a>. Many tech companies, while claiming to "change the world," evade moral responsibility by downplaying their impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:32">[01:32:32]</a>. However, the next generation of founders often feels a genuine sense of responsibility to make the world a better place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:05">[01:33:05]</a>.

## AI and Organizational Values

The advent of AI forces a serious reckoning with governance and alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:28">[01:30:28]</a>. AI doesn't act by itself; it's deployed by humans, and its actions will reflect the organizational values (or lack thereof) of the companies that produce it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:35">[01:39:35]</a>. This aligns with Conway's Law, which states that an organization's software reflects its communication structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:53">[01:19:53]</a>. Tech has "severely underinvested and neglected" creating governance and alignment structures, leading to many companies becoming disappointments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:12">[01:20:12]</a>.

AI is poised to change management significantly by altering the individual's span of control, particularly through its ability to summarize vast amounts of information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:52">[01:22:52]</a>. This means future organizations could grant "these kinds of powers... to everybody" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:43">[01:23:43]</a>.

### Ethical Action in Uncertainty
In the face of high uncertainty, especially with technologies like AI, the framework for ethical action is to "pick actions today that make ethical sense in a wide variety of future scenarios and do those" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:01">[01:26:01]</a>. This moves people from paralysis to clear actions like promoting transparency, building capacity, and having competent leaders committed to certain values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:11">[01:26:11]</a>.

## Embedding Values through Governance

For an organization to be trustworthy, the promises it makes must be embodied in its very structure, ensuring they are kept even if the founders or individuals leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:10">[01:35:10]</a>.

### The Spiritual Holding Company
Eric Ries advocates for a "spiritual holding company" model, where a central entity is responsible for the "soul" of the entire ecosystem of companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:22">[01:55:22]</a>. This means encoding promises deeply into the company structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:25">[01:38:25]</a>. This is distinct from the traditional "shareholder primacy theory" of corporations, which Ries contends is "just wrong" even if one only cares about maximizing returns for shareholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:46">[01:53:46]</a>.

### Tactical Implementations
Founders can take several concrete steps to embed values and ensure long-term integrity:
*   **Legal Designations:** Register as a public benefit corporation or social purpose corporation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:01">[01:44:01]</a>.
*   **Foundations:** Allocate a percentage of company shares (e.g., 10%) to a foundation whose trustees are relevant stakeholders (e.g., tribal leaders for companies leveraging indigenous cultures) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:19">[01:44:19]</a>.
*   **Board Mission Pledge:** Require board members to pledge to use their business judgment to support the company's mission, not just the narrow interests of shareholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:32">[01:44:32]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Stock Exchange Venture (LTSV):** Utilize financing instruments where every limited partner (LP) signs a contract to support the company's mission and trustees oversee those shares, ensuring alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:45">[01:44:45]</a>.

These structural changes are crucial because "it's always too early until it's too late" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:52">[01:53:52]</a>. Many founders delay embedding these structures, only to find it impossible once the company is on rails for an IPO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:25">[01:45:25]</a>. If standard articles of incorporation are used, a company often has a "fiduciary duty to say yes" to an acquisition, even if it leads to unethical outcomes like selling cigarettes to children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:05">[01:47:05]</a>.

### Competitive Advantage of Values-Driven Companies
Companies that are truly dedicated to "human flourishing" and create "net new value" tend to outperform their competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:08">[01:38:08]</a>. Examples include Toyota with its long-term thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:38">[01:51:38]</a>, or companies where customer loyalty is "unbelievable" because employees treat customers like their own parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:53">[01:41:53]</a>.

Foundation-controlled public companies in some European countries, like OpenAI, often "outperformed from a financial performance perspective" compared to level-matched public companies without such control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:15">[01:54:15]</a>. This suggests that the investor-centric view of corporations is incorrect, as sacrificing short-term profit for long-term values can lead to greater financial success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:49">[01:53:49]</a>.

## Moving Forward
The overall system of financialized capitalism is often "value destroying," requiring a steady supply of new companies to replace those it collapses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:08">[02:12:08]</a>. As creators of these new companies, founders "get to set the terms" by which this is done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:03">[02:13:03]</a>. It is a [[leadership_and_company_culture | relentless and constant process]] to build a structure where every decision promotes fiduciary duty to "do the right thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:50">[01:48:50]</a>. This involves integrating governance, management structure, operations, and [[company_culture_and_decision_making | company culture]] as a single, cohesive entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:16">[01:49:16]</a>.

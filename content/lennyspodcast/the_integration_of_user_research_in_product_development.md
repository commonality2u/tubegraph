The field of user research is currently undergoing a "reckoning," prompting a reevaluation of its practices and integration within companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:14">[01:27:14]</a>. This shift is driven by observations that, despite good intentions, user research often fails to deliver the expected value or impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:32:05">[08:32:05]</a>.

## User-Centered Performance: A Misguided Approach

A significant challenge identified is "user-centered performance," a symbolic practice of customer obsession that prioritizes signaling over genuine learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This occurs when product teams act as if they care about the user for show, rather than seeking to make different decisions based on insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:09">[02:07:09]</a>.

Common examples of user-centered performance include:
*   A Product Manager (PM) asking a researcher at the end of a product process to "just run a quick user study to validate our assumptions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>. This is too late to genuinely influence decisions, serving merely to "check the box" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:06">[00:36:06]</a>.
*   Executives requesting "executive listening sessions" or focus groups primarily for a performative connection to the customer, rather than genuine learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:53">[02:51:53]</a>.
*   A reluctance to be proven wrong, with many PMs and designers seeking to validate their existing ideas rather than falsify them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00">[00:45:00]</a>.

This phenomenon, often rooted in cognitive biases and ego, prevents real [[The impact of user feedback on product development | impact of user feedback on product development]] from being realized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:54">[02:52:54]</a>.

## A New Framework for User Research

Former Head of Research at Airbnb, Jud Anon, suggests categorizing user research into three types to understand where value is often lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:50">[00:58:50]</a>:

1.  **Macro Research:** This is big-picture, strategic, business-focused, and forward-looking research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:06">[09:06:06]</a>. It aims to understand the market, competitors, and long-term product direction, often involving strategic planning and Total Addressable Market (TAM) studies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:12">[09:12:12]</a>.
2.  **Micro Research:** This type of research is highly technical and focused on usability, enabling a "pixel-perfect" product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:21:49">[09:21:49]</a>. It includes laser-focused studies to understand A/B test results and ensure high-quality execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:17">[09:30:17]</a>.
3.  **Middle-Range Research:** This is described as a "blob place" where research questions are "middle altitude" and focus on general user understanding (e.g., how users think, feel, or behave with a product) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:37">[09:37:37]</a>.

### The Problem with Middle-Range Research

While often interesting to researchers, middle-range research is frequently "not impactful enough for the business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:09">[10:07:09]</a>. It tends to yield insights that are hard to operationalize, triggers post-hoc bias ("that was kind of obvious"), and fulfills a need for performative user-centeredness without driving actual change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:40:02">[10:40:02]</a>. This type of research can delay processes and encourage PMs to rely on research for decisions they should make themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:38:09">[13:38:09]</a>.

## Rethinking Research Integration

To address the current "reckoning" and improve the [[The integration of user research in product development | integration of user research in product development]], fundamental changes are needed:

### For Companies and Product Teams
*   **Deep Integration:** Research should be consistently involved from the beginning to the end of the product development process, not just as a reactive "service function" called in at the end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:48:47">[14:48:47]</a>. This means researchers are "in the room" participating in conversations, helping to frame questions for maximum business impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:09:47">[15:09:47]</a>.
*   **Unified Insights:** Companies should avoid siloing different insights disciplines (e.g., user experience research, consumer insights, market research, data science, customer service feedback) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:07">[00:49:07]</a>. An integrated insights function can synthesize diverse information into a single "insights machine" to fuel decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:50">[00:50:50]</a>.
*   **Prioritize Relationships:** The number of researchers a company needs depends on whether product people have constant research partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:28">[00:57:28]</a>. The goal should be to create influence and strong trusting relationships so that key decision-making meetings cannot happen without the researcher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:09">[00:32:09]</a>.

### For Researchers
*   **Develop Diverse Skills:** Beyond traditional qualitative methods, great researchers possess a "Swiss army knife" of tools, including:
    1.  **Formative/Generative Research:** Forward-looking, innovation-focused, often ethnographic studies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>.
    2.  **Evaluative Research:** Usability testing and micro-level studies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>.
    3.  **Rigorous Survey Design:** The ability to craft surveys for scaled responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>.
    4.  **Applied Statistics:** Essential for understanding A/B testing results and quantitative data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:45">[00:18:45]</a>.
    5.  **Technical Skills:** Historically SQL for running queries, now potentially [[Integration of AI in business and product development | prompt engineering]] for interacting with generative AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:18:57]</a>.
*   **Become Business-Oriented:** Researchers need to understand and speak the language of product and business, including quarterly reports, shareholder calls, company strategies, OKRs, metrics, and conversion funnels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:23">[02:21:23]</a>. This allows them to propose research that directly addresses business problems or opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:04">[02:33:04]</a>.
*   **Ruthless Prioritization:** Researchers must learn to say no and focus on the most important things, as being spread too thinly leads to poor work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:27">[00:48:27]</a>.

## Common Misconceptions About User Research

Several "tropes" or misconceptions about user research hinder its effective use:
*   **"Research just slows us down."** Good research can be done quickly (days, not months) and ultimately speeds up product development by preventing costly mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:52">[00:33:52]</a>. Micro-level research, for instance, can drive significant business value very fast, as exemplified by a "multi-million dollar button" fix at Airbnb based on 48-hour research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">[00:37:37]</a>.
*   **"I can do my own research."** While product people should engage with customers, professional researchers understand how to derive true insights, avoid bias, and properly situate individual user feedback within a broader context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:03">[00:39:03]</a>.
*   **"A/B test everything."** A/B tests tell you *what* happened but rarely *why* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:12">[00:40:12]</a>. Researchers provide the crucial "how and why," which is necessary to learn from mistakes and build better products in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:40]</a>. Ideal outcomes involve strong partnerships between data scientists and researchers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:56">[00:41:56]</a>.
*   **The "Henry Ford quote."** The often-quoted idea that users would only ask for faster horses (implying designers shouldn't listen to users directly) is likely apocryphal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:25">[00:42:25]</a>. More importantly, asking customers directly "what they want" is not what good researchers do; instead, they uncover deeper needs and behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:56">[00:42:56]</a>.
*   **"We knew this already; that was obvious."** This reflects hindsight bias and the "narrative fallacy," where people selectively remember and construct simple stories that make them feel they already knew outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:18">[00:43:18]</a>. Great researchers help expose biases and expand intuition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:35">[00:43:35]</a>.

## Navigating Intuition vs. Data

While intuition plays a role in product development, it is also where biases and blind spots lie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:49">[02:21:49]</a>. To check intuition, product leaders should:
*   Engage "System Two" thinking (slow, methodical analytical thought) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:36">[00:30:36]</a>.
*   Bring in the "wisdom of the crowd" by gathering diverse sources of information and judgment from different individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:58">[00:30:58]</a>.
*   Be wary of relying solely on "dogfooding" or personal product walkthroughs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:01">[01:07:01]</a>. While useful for identifying potential issues, personal usage is biased because the product manager is "nothing like the user" in critical ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:40">[01:07:40]</a>.

Ultimately, the goal of research is to help product managers develop a strong mental model of the domain and user, rather than explicitly telling them what to build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00">[00:45:00]</a>.

## Overcoming Challenges in the PM-Researcher Relationship

The relationship between product managers and user researchers is often challenged, primarily because researchers are not fully included in the product process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>. Product managers can be better partners by:
*   Creating a process that [[integrating_customer_feedback_into_product_development | integrates user researchers]] from beginning to end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.
*   Collaborating with researchers on "ruthless prioritization" of projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:44">[00:51:44]</a>.
*   Actively participating by going into the field with researchers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:09">[00:52:09]</a>.

By fostering strong, engaged relationships and ensuring researchers are active participants, companies can derive maximum value from user research, driving product improvements, metric impact, and growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:58">[01:13:58]</a>. This represents a crucial [[challenges_and_evolution_in_the_user_research_field | evolution in the user research field]] toward greater impact and influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:50">[01:02:50]</a>.

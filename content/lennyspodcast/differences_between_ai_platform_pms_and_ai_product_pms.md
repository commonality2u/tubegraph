A product manager is responsible for bringing together design, engineering, business development, operations, and sales within an organization to ship impactful products that represent the customer and solve their problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>. When considering the [[the_role_of_ai_in_product_management | role of AI in product management]], the "AI component" can be broken down into three main categories of [[impact_of_ai_on_product_management | AI product management]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:54:00">[06:54:00]</a>. This article focuses on the first two: AI Platform PMs and AI Product PMs.

## AI Platform PMs

AI Platform PMs build tools for AI Engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>. An example of this role is Aman Khan's work at Arise AI, which provides an observability and evaluation platform for artificial intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>. Initially, Arise AI focused on machine learning models like ranking, regression, and classification, found in recommender systems or "black boxes" within applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:19:00">[07:19:00]</a>. More recently, they have pivoted towards supporting large language models (LLMs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:00">[07:31:00]</a>.

The interfaces for building on top of LLM providers like OpenAI or Anthropic are nascent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46:00">[07:46:00]</a>. Therefore, the focus for AI Platform PMs is enabling AI Engineers to understand the impact of their models and ensure their applications are performing as expected in terms of business outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>.

## AI Product PMs

AI Product PMs are responsible for products where the core experience is centered around AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:32:00">[08:32:00]</a>. In these roles, the underlying AI model is the "secret sauce" that enables the core product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:53:00">[08:53:00]</a>. Researchers and engineers push the boundaries of AI technology, and the AI Product PM's job is to package that technology into a consumable product for businesses, enterprises, or consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>.

Examples include:
*   ChatGPT, where the core technology is the model itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40:00">[08:40:00]</a>.
*   Notebook LM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:00">[08:47:00]</a>.

The core competency of this role lies in packaging and distributing the AI technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:19:00">[09:19:00]</a>.

## Differentiating from AI-Powered PMs

A third category is the "AI-powered PM," who is enabled by AI technology across the entire product management stack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:00">[09:32:00]</a>. Unlike the other two types, an [[the_role_of_ai_in_product_management | AI-powered PM]] is not necessarily responsible for building the core AI model from scratch or having access to research teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:54:00">[09:54:00]</a>. Instead, they utilize [[tools_and_tips_for_ai_product_management | large language models]] or other AI models to enhance their work and create the best possible experience for their customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:05:00">[10:05:00]</a>.

In the near future, it is expected that most product managers will likely fall into one of these [[the_future_of_product_management_in_the_AI_era | AI product management]] categories, either building tools for other AI adopters, developing cutting-edge AI models, or integrating AI to solve customer problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31:00">[10:31:00]</a>.

## Core Distinctions and Focus Areas

| Feature           | AI Platform PMs                                       | AI Product PMs                                            |
| :---------------- | :---------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Primary Users** | AI Engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>                      | Consumers or Enterprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:00">[09:11:00]</a>                 |
| **What They Build** | Tools, platforms for developing/monitoring AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a> | Core products centered around AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:32:00">[08:32:00]</a>              |
| **Key Objective** | Enable AI Engineers to understand and manage AI impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a> | Package cutting-edge AI technology for user consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:00">[09:06:00]</a> |
| **Underlying Tech** | Observability, evaluation platforms for ML/LLMs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:00">[07:12:00]</a> | Core AI models (e.g., LLMs) as the product's foundation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:43:00">[08:43:00]</a> |

To [[how_to_become_an_ai_product_manager | succeed as an AI PM]], regardless of type, a key takeaway is to be "in love with the problem" and push the boundaries of what is possible with technology to solve it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:40:00">[14:40:00]</a>. It's also critical to focus on the customer problem first, with AI serving as a tool to solve it, rather than simply building AI products for the sake of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:06:00">[36:06:00]</a>.

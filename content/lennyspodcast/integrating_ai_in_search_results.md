The rise of AI has led to a significant [[seo_transformations_with_the_rise_of_ai | shift in how SEO works]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, with AI answers being integrated directly into search results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. This integration, initially feared as an "apocalypse" for SEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, is forcing a pivot in thinking about what SEO traffic means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

## Google's Response to AI
Google and other tech companies were prompted to accelerate their AI integration by OpenAI's ChatGPT, which launched at the end of 2022 and offered written answers to any question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. This sparked discussions about whether Google and SEO were "ending" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

To address Wall Street's concerns and demonstrate their AI capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>, Google first launched Bard (now Gemini) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>. They then introduced what was called Search Generative Experience (SGE), later rebranded as AI Overviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

### Challenges with AI Overviews
Google's initial beta launch of SGE faced significant issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>:
*   **Monetization:** AI answers clashed with Google's ad-driven revenue model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.
*   **Liability:** Concerns arose about Google being deemed a publisher if its AI-generated responses led to harmful actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.
*   **Plagiarism:** Issues around using content from the web without proper attribution or legal clarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.

Despite a temporary rollback due to embarrassing public screenshots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>, Google has relaunched AI Overviews more broadly to non-logged-in users and in new regions like the UK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

## Impact on SEO and User Journeys
The primary impact of AI Overviews is that they push traditional search results down the page, providing answers directly to users, reducing the need to click links <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. This makes traditional content less relevant for certain queries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.

AI Overviews excel at summarizing unstructured data from content and turning it into structured, digestible answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>. For example, a search for headache symptoms can now yield a direct answer about whether to worry, rather than requiring users to browse through multiple pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. This signifies a shift where the "discovery step" of search is being "swallowed up by LLMs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>.

### Top-of-Funnel vs. Mid/Bottom-of-Funnel Searches
The impact on SEO differs based on where a user is in their "buyer journey" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>:

*   **Top-of-Funnel:** These are broad, curious queries (e.g., "top podcast tools" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>, "best beach vacation") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. AI Overviews are a great fit for these, providing quick, summarized answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>. This disrupts sites that traditionally ranked for such queries by providing long-form content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:53">[00:20:53]</a>.
*   **Mid/Bottom-of-Funnel:** These queries show specific intent and lead to deeper research or action (e.g., "Riverside price" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a>, "closest doctor to me") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>. This is where SEO remains crucial, as users are now looking to take action or find a specific solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>.

## Strategies for Success in the AI Paradigm
To succeed in this new paradigm, individuals and companies need to rethink their approach to SEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:02">[00:23:02]</a>.

### SEO as a Product
The key shift is to think of SEO as a product problem, not just a marketing one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>. Product managers should be at the forefront of answering SEO questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:30">[00:23:30]</a>. This involves:
1.  **Understanding the User:** Empathize with the user's self-discovery journey and what problem they are trying to solve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>. If you can't answer what someone will search for, don't do SEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:10">[00:33:10]</a>.
2.  **Deciding on the Asset:** Determine what kind of asset (e.g., a specific page, a tool) needs to be created to meet that user's need, especially for mid-funnel queries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:48">[00:34:48]</a>.
3.  **Building the Product:** This requires design, engineering, and user research resources, overseen by a product manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:52">[00:34:52]</a>. The product itself, not just content, must address the user's need directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:16">[00:35:16]</a>. This approach directly relates to [[leveraging_ai_tools_in_product_management | leveraging AI tools in product management]] and understanding the [[impact_of_ai_on_product_teams | impact of AI on product teams]].

A prime example is Zapier, which created pages that showcased how different apps (e.g., Gmail and Salesforce) could work together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:41">[00:26:41]</a>. Users weren't looking for "Zapier," but they were looking for solutions to connect their existing tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:37">[00:26:37]</a>. Similarly, Tinder recognized its role as a "loneliness solving solution" rather than just a dating app, creating localized pages for "online dating in [city]" that connected users to the app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:51">[00:29:51]</a>.

### Investment in SEO
SEO is not "free" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:30">[00:39:30]</a>. Companies must evaluate if it's the right channel by considering the potential return on investment against other marketing channels like paid ads or influencer campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:41">[00:41:41]</a>. Many B2B SaaS companies, for example, may find that their sales journey requires more than just online content for conversion, making direct sales motions more effective than SEO for early stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:55">[00:38:55]</a>.

### Programmatic vs. Editorial SEO
*   **Programmatic SEO:** Involves taking multiple data sources and automatically generating comprehensive pages. Examples include Tripadvisor combining hotel, city, and user-generated content, or Zillow compiling property values, photos, and neighborhood data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:09">[01:10:09]</a>. This is effective for scale and when users seek specific, data-driven answers (e.g., "value of a home") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:10">[01:12:10]</a>.
*   **Editorial SEO:** Involves writing individual, long-form content pieces. This is less suitable for data-driven queries where a direct answer is preferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:41">[01:13:41]</a>.

Generally, programmatic SEO is seen as a more common success path, particularly when there is significant scale and a clear user use case for the generated pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:07">[01:14:10]</a>.

### Leveraging AI for Content Creation
[[developing_ai_products_and_utilizing_technology | AI can be used as a tool]] to create content, but its usefulness depends on the end goal and user journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:42">[00:59:42]</a>.
*   **Useful applications:** Using AI to write product descriptions on e-commerce sites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:57">[01:00:57]</a>, or for summarizing factual information like earnings reports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:34">[01:03:34]</a>. Google's documentation states that AI itself is not the problem; the helpfulness and usefulness of the content are key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:27">[01:02:27]</a>.
*   **Ineffective applications:** Generating "fluff content" or thousands of blog posts for the sake of content, especially if it doesn't align with the user's specific problem or the product's monetization strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:18">[01:00:18]</a>. Simply copying others' programmatic strategies (e.g., creating templates) without a relevant product fit will not lead to conversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:49">[00:56:49]</a>.

## Google's Dominance and the Future of Search
A recent U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) verdict against Google provided insights into Google's search dominance, revealing it holds 98% of mobile searches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:55">[01:17:55]</a>. This dominance is largely attributed to default partnerships (e.g., with Apple) and strong brand recognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:51">[01:18:51]</a>. Despite the rise of new LLM startups like ChatGPT, Google's entrenched position, built over 25 years with vast user data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:50">[01:21:50]</a>, makes it unlikely they will be unseated as the most dominant search engine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:21">[01:19:21]</a>.

The need for SEO expertise is expected to grow as companies must pivot their approaches in response to [[shifts_in_seo_strategies_in_the_age_of_ai | changing search layouts]] and user behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:35">[01:44:35]</a>. This will require new skills in communication, sales, and strategy rather than just operational expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:40">[01:45:40]</a>.

### Key Takeaways and SEO Myths
*   **SEO is not dying:** Users will always seek information and choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:06">[01:24:06]</a>. Companies will continue to benefit from users taking actions via search, such as buying products or booking services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:38">[01:25:38]</a>.
*   **Don't assume you need SEO:** Evaluate if the user journey for your product or service aligns with search behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:54">[01:26:54]</a>.
*   **Link building is brand building:** Focus on [[building_a_brand_with_ai | building a strong brand]] that naturally earns mentions and links, rather than buying low-quality guest posts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:34">[01:08:34]</a>.
*   **Google is not a black box:** The basics of SEO are simple: build a crawlable, helpful website with relevant content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:21">[01:28:21]</a>.
*   **Traffic alone is not valuable:** The most important metric is conversion (e.g., MQLs, actual sales), not just page views, especially for SaaS companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:57">[00:51:57]</a>.
*   **Technical SEO is not a universal fix:** It's critical for large, complex sites (e.g., millions of pages), but less so for smaller websites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:11">[01:35:11]</a>.
*   **Keyword research tools are indicative, not exact:** Their volume estimates can be highly inaccurate; use them for general understanding of search behavior rather than precise forecasting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:27">[01:42:27]</a>. A top-down market size approach (Total Addressable Market) is often more accurate for forecasting SEO upside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:46">[01:38:46]</a>.
*   **TikTok/Instagram are for top-of-funnel discovery:** While Gen Z uses these platforms for initial searches, Google remains crucial for mid-funnel queries that involve booking, buying, or more specific actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:37">[01:31:37]</a>.

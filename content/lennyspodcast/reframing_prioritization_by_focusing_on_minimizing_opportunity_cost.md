In high-leverage roles, it's crucial to shift prioritization away from merely seeking positive Return on Investment (ROI) and instead focus on minimizing opportunity cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:02">[01:14:02]</a>. This approach encourages focusing on the "best use of time" rather than just a "good use of time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:13">[01:17:13]</a>.

## Understanding the Problem with ROI Mindset

For individuals in high-leverage roles, such as product managers (PMs), founders, engineering leaders, and designers, there are often hundreds of tasks that could yield a positive ROI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:21">[01:14:21]</a>. A positive ROI simply means that the value created by a task is greater than the time invested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:44">[01:14:44]</a>.

However, an exclusive focus on ROI can be suboptimal, or even harmful, in these roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:04">[01:15:04]</a>. The ROI formula places the time taken in the denominator, which often incentivizes working on tasks that take less time to increase the ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:11">[01:15:11]</a>. This can lead to a tendency to prioritize "low-hanging fruit" or "quick wins," which, while not inherently bad, can fill up a person's or team's plate, causing them to miss larger, more impactful opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:04">[01:16:04]</a>.

## The Power of Minimizing Opportunity Cost

Opportunity cost is defined as the value of the optimal option minus the value of the chosen option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:40">[01:16:40]</a>. To minimize opportunity cost means actively working on the most optimal tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:57">[01:16:57]</a>.

Reframing prioritization with an opportunity cost mindset involves asking: "Is this the **best** use of my time?" instead of just "Is this a good use of my time?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:13">[01:17:13]</a>. This subtle yet profound shift can lead to picking tasks that might not have been considered with an ROI-only perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:17">[01:17:17]</a>.

In practice, this means avoiding the pitfall of selecting numerous small-to-medium impact tasks that are well-defined (positive ROI) over ambiguous but potentially game-changing opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:25">[01:18:25]</a>. Often, the bigger opportunities require more upfront work to explore and flesh out, but they hold the potential to meaningfully change a business's trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:10">[01:19:10]</a>.

## Applying the Opportunity Cost Framework

It is not recommended to try and quantify opportunity cost with a spreadsheet, as this is often a "lost cause" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:24">[01:21:24]</a>. Instead, leaders should give teams the freedom and permission to explore and pursue activities that minimize opportunity cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:31">[01:21:31]</a>.

### Example: Strategic Planning with Allocation Percentages

During planning cycles (e.g., quarterly, half-yearly, annually), leaders can provide rough guidance on the percentage of time to be spent on different types of activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:12">[01:22:12]</a>. This approach is reminiscent of Google's classic 70/20/10 model for resource allocation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:17">[01:22:17]</a>.

For instance, a leader might guide their team to allocate:
*   **60% of time** to incrementals, focusing on features that improve users' lives daily (often high-ROI activities) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:12">[01:23:12]</a>.
*   **30% of time** to big, new initiatives. This category is where the focus on minimizing opportunity cost truly shines, as it forces the team to consider one or two significant bets instead of many smaller ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:37">[01:23:37]</a>.
*   **10% of time** to stability and infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:49">[01:23:49]</a>.

This kind of guidance creates the necessary space for teams to pursue impactful, less obvious opportunities, without just filling their time with "quick wins" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:05">[01:24:05]</a>.

This framework complements other prioritization strategies like the [[prioritizing_high_leverage_tasks_using_the_lno_framework | LNO framework]], which categorizes tasks into Leverage, Neutral, and Overhead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:42">[00:41:42]</a>.

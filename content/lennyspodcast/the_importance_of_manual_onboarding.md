Manual or concierge onboarding is a strategic approach where a company provides one-on-one, in-person, or highly personalized guidance to new users during their initial experience with a product or service. This contrasts with automated self-service onboarding flows.

## Superhuman's Approach to Onboarding

Rahul Vora, founder and CEO of Superhuman, adopted a contrarian approach by manually onboarding every single new user for years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:47">[01:47:47]</a>. This was considered "absolutely the right thing to do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:19">[01:48:19]</a>, and users could not use Superhuman without going through this experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:20">[01:48:20]</a>.

### Scale and Duration
At its peak, Superhuman had approximately 20 people dedicated to manual onboarding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:36">[00:48:36]</a>. This allowed them to handle a significant volume of users while maintaining a high-touch experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:47">[00:48:47]</a>.

### Benefits and Strategic Advantages
Superhuman found two primary benefits to this intensive [[customer_onboarding_and_activation | onboarding]] method:
1.  **Excellent User Metrics**: Manual onboarding led to superior metrics across engagement, retention, product-market fit scores, NPS, and virality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:54">[00:49:54]</a>.
    *   It cultivated an "early cohort of soup fans" crucial for building a strong brand and fostering true word-of-mouth virality, rather than relying on viral mechanics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:15">[00:50:15]</a>.
2.  **Strategic Resource Allocation**: In an environment where funding was readily available (e.g., the "zero interest rate phenomenon era" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:37">[00:50:37]</a>), Superhuman could leverage capital to avoid immediately building a comprehensive first-time user experience and traditional growth loops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:42">[00:50:42]</a>.
    *   This allowed their engineers to focus almost exclusively on finding product-market fit, solution deepening, or market widening, rather than expending resources on self-service flows and [[customer_onboarding_and_activation | activation]] for a product that might not yet have found its market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:48">[00:50:48]</a>. This highlights [[the_importance_of_execution_over_strategy | the importance of execution]].

>[!info] Impact on Engineering Focus
>Rahul notes that competitor companies often spent nearly half their engineering budget on self-service flows for products that ultimately failed to achieve product-market fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:05">[00:51:05]</a>. Manual onboarding helped Superhuman circumvent this.

### When to Transition Away
Superhuman eventually transitioned to a primarily self-service model, though the onboarding experience remains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:28">[00:48:28]</a>. The decision to stop manual onboarding was driven by the realization that:
*   Some personality types simply do not wish to go through a one-on-one onboarding process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:57">[00:48:57]</a>.
*   At a certain point, these individuals become important, necessitating a world-class self-service option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:04">[00:49:04]</a>.
*   Building a robust self-service system was a challenging undertaking, as the company's "entire DNA" was initially structured around manual onboarding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:23">[00:49:23]</a>.

## General Advice for Founders
Based on Superhuman's experience, founders considering manual onboarding should weigh several factors:

*   **Financial Feasibility**: Ensure the cost of manual onboarding (e.g., staff salaries) is offset by the value or lifetime value (LTV) of the new customer. Superhuman "always made money doing onboarding" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:15">[00:52:15]</a>.
*   **Market Opportunity**: This strategy is particularly effective for creating a strong brand, especially for consumer-leaning companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:20">[00:51:20]</a>.
*   **Funding Environment**: It is more viable when there is "money falling off trees" or accessible capital to invest in the human-intensive process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:27">[00:51:27]</a>, as seen with some AI companies today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:31">[00:51:31]</a>.
*   **Top-of-Funnel Width**: Be prepared to stop manual onboarding when the target market (e.g., enterprise clients, or "proumers" in the world) becomes wide enough that manual engagement is no longer scalable or economically sensible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:23">[00:52:23]</a>.

>[!warning] When to Stop
>While beneficial, it's crucial for companies to know when to stop relying solely on manual onboarding and to invest in a robust self-service option to capture a broader market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:38">[00:51:38]</a>.

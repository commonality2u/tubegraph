Positioning is a foundational marketing concept that defines how a product is the best in the world at delivering some value that a well-defined set of companies care a lot about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>. It encompasses understanding alternatives, identifying unique differentiators, delivering specific value, defining target customers, and establishing a market category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>. April Dunford, author of *Obviously Awesome*, is recognized as an industry expert on product positioning, having led teams at seven successful B2B startups and worked with over 200 companies to refine their positioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>.

## Identifying a Positioning Problem

Weak positioning can negatively impact all stages of the sales pipeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. Symptoms include:
*   **Sluggish marketing response** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.
*   **Extended sales cycles**, where the "light" doesn't come on for customers until multiple calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.
*   **Customer confusion** during initial sales calls, leading to requests like "Could you just say that again?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.
*   **Misclassification by customers**, for example, "Oh, I get it, you're just like Salesforce" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.
*   **Lack of perceived value**, where customers understand what the product does but not why they would pay for it ("I just don't get why anyone would pay for that") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.
*   **High churn rates** post-sale because customers realize the product isn't what they expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a>.

A significant cause of weak positioning is internal misalignment among founders, marketing, sales, and product teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>. When positioning is working well, it feels "obvious" and clear to target buyers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>.

## The Process of Achieving Differentiated Value

To find and articulate [[Differentiated value in selling | differentiated value]], April Dunford proposes a structured approach:

### 1. Identify [[Sales strategies for B2B and SaaS companies | Competitive Alternatives]]
Start by understanding what a product must beat to win a deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>. This includes:
*   **Status Quo**: What the company is currently doing to solve the problem, even if it's inefficient (e.g., spreadsheets, manual processes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:59">[00:23:59]</a>. In B2B, roughly 40% of deals are lost to [[B2B sales and overcoming indecision | 'no decision']], meaning a loss to the status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:26">[00:24:26]</a>.
*   **Shortlist Competitors**: Other solutions a company might consider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:12">[00:24:12]</a>.

### 2. List Differentiated Capabilities
After understanding the alternatives, list all features, functions, or company capabilities (like pricing or services) that the product offers that competitors do not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:02">[00:25:02]</a>.

### 3. Translate Capabilities into Value
For each differentiated capability, ask "so what?" and determine the actual value it provides to the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:34">[00:25:34]</a>. This process often reveals two or three core value themes that are truly differentiated, not just generally valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:49">[00:25:49]</a>.

### 4. Define Best-Fit Customers
Not every company will care about the unique value in the same way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:27">[00:26:27]</a>. Identify the specific characteristics of target accounts that make them deeply value the unique offering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:31">[00:26:31]</a>. This becomes the definition of the "best-fit customer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:40">[00:26:40]</a>.

### 5. Define Market Category
The market category is the context in which the product is positioned, making its value obvious to the defined best-fit customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:08">[00:27:08]</a>. This step should be derived from the differentiated value and target customers, not initiated arbitrarily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:47">[00:26:47]</a>.

### Example: Help Scout

Help Scout, a customer success software company, operates in a competitive market dominated by players like Zendesk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:50">[00:29:50]</a>.
*   **Alternatives**: Zendesk, other competitors, or even basic email and shared inboxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:06">[00:30:06]</a>.
*   **Differentiated Capabilities**: Features focused on delivering "amazing service" to customers, such as a proper service-oriented shared inbox, assigning a person (not a ticket number), and smart chatbots that only appear when a live person is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:42">[00:30:42]</a>.
*   **Value**: Deepening customer relationships and driving growth through customer loyalty, by treating customers like people, not trying to push them to low-cost channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:31">[00:31:31]</a>.
*   **Best-Fit Customers**: Primarily direct-to-consumer (DTC) or e-commerce brands who view customer service as a growth driver, unlike, for example, a phone company whose main goal is cost reduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:52">[00:31:52]</a>.
*   **Market Category**: Defined as a solution for modern e-commerce companies that see customer success as a growth driver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:08">[00:33:08]</a>.

The output of this process is not just a document of bullet points, but a compelling sales narrative that can be tested with qualified prospects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:01">[00:35:01]</a>.

## Positioning vs. Messaging vs. Branding

These terms are often confused, but serve distinct purposes:
*   **Positioning** is a fundamental input that defines how a company wins in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:48">[00:40:48]</a>.
*   **Messaging** is the text used on a homepage or in communications, which flows from a clear understanding of positioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:30">[00:40:30]</a>. It cannot be effectively written until the target audience and value proposition are understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:53">[00:40:53]</a>.
*   **[[Building a Distinctive Brand in the Software Industry | Branding]]** is about what a company's brand stands for. This, too, depends on understanding the target buyer and market differentiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:21">[00:41:21]</a>.

## The Evolution of Positioning: Early Stage vs. Later Stage

While positioning is crucial, its rigidity should evolve with the company's stage:
*   **Early Stage (Pre-Product-Market Fit)**: It's acceptable for positioning to be a "thesis" or a "little bit loose" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:14">[00:50:14]</a>. The market should be allowed to "pull" the product in a direction that might not have been initially anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:10">[00:51:10]</a>. Attempting to "over-tighten" positioning without sufficient customer data is premature and can lead to incorrect assumptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:58">[00:49:58]</a>.
*   **Later Stage (Post-Product-Market Fit / Growth Stage)**: Once a clear pattern emerges in who loves the product and why (e.g., specific customer characteristics, use of other software, sales team size), then it's time to "tighten things up" and aggressively pursue that market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:15">[00:53:15]</a>. This is when an external expert like April Dunford may be brought in to facilitate alignment or ensure precision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:04">[00:47:04]</a>.

Companies like Magic Leap and Google Glass initially launched with "gee whiz" technology but lacked clear positioning regarding their target market and value, hindering widespread adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:02">[00:42:02]</a>. They later found success by adopting specific B2B use cases and tightening their positioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:01">[00:43:01]</a>. The Segway is a classic example of a product that failed due to a refusal to define its position, leaving customers confused about its purpose and competitive context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:17">[00:45:17]</a>.

## Segmentation vs. Personas

These terms are often confused in marketing, particularly in B2B:
*   **Segmentation** defines how a market is split up, focusing on characteristics of companies (e.g., firmographics like size, revenue, geography, or specific software used, team size, budget) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:25">[00:55:25]</a>. This helps identify actionable target accounts for marketing and sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:01">[00:57:01]</a>.
*   **Personas** describe the characteristics of a particular buyer, focusing on individual hopes, dreams, fears, and goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:52">[00:55:52]</a>. In B2B, typically 5-7 people are involved in a purchase decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:11">[00:58:11]</a>. However, the most critical persona is the **champion**â€”the individual within the target account whose job is to build consensus and champion the deal across the organization, including to the economic buyer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:09">[01:00:09]</a>. Positioning must resonate with this champion first, and then arm them with the narrative to sell internally to other stakeholders (e.g., IT, purchasing, end-users, management) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:32">[01:01:32]</a>. Creating detailed personas for every stakeholder in a B2B deal is often an "utter waste of time" if the champion persona isn't nailed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:12">[01:01:12]</a>.

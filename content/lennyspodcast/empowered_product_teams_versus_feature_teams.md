Marty Cagan, a long-time expert in product management, highlights a significant distinction in the industry between "feature teams" and "empowered product teams," noting that many companies mistakenly operate with the former, leading to inefficiencies and a lack of true innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. He attributes this, in part, to widespread "product management theater" where roles are often over-hired and overpaid for the value they provide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

## The Problem with Feature Teams

Many companies, especially those outside of Silicon Valley, have seen team sizes "get out of hand," leading to the proliferation of roles like agile coaches, product owners, product Ops, and business analysts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>. These roles often function as "assistant product manager types" or, more accurately, project managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:39">[00:38:39]</a>.

In a [[differences_between_feature_teams_and_real_product_teams | feature team]] or "feature factory" model, teams are typically given a roadmap of output—specific features or projects—to design, build, test, and deploy, often with strict deadlines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:49">[02:10:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:05">[02:10:05]</a>. This approach focuses on delivering *output* rather than *outcomes* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:34">[02:13:34]</a>.

> "It is a lot easier to deliver output than it is to deliver outcomes." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">[00:23:54]</a>

In such environments, traditional product managers, especially those focused solely on project management, are often seen as unnecessary or overpaid for their actual contribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>. Engineers and designers might even prefer to manage their own work rather than dealing with someone who "doesn't contribute anything" beyond administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>.

Marty Cagan refers to this as "product management theater" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>, where individuals carry the title of product manager but are not performing the core functions of a "real product manager" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:01">[00:24:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>. This can also extend to leadership, as seen in [[coaching_and_leadership_in_product_management | product leadership theater]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

### The Looming Reckoning
Cagan has warned that these roles are vulnerable, especially with changes in the financial world increasing the cost of funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>, and the predicted impact of [[creating_aipowered_product_teams | generative AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:06">[00:45:06]</a>. Many administrative tasks performed by these roles can be significantly automated by AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:01">[00:53:01]</a>.

> "I have been warning for several year several years that delivery team product owners and feature team product managers are likely to be facing a reckoning as companies realize that these roles are not what they thought they were. From what I can tell that Reckoning has begun and I'm expecting gen AI will only compound this." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:31">[00:29:31]</a>

## The Power of Empowered Product Teams

In contrast, an [[empowering_product_teams_and_operationalizing_context_over_control | empowered product team]] is given *problems to solve*—customer problems or business problems—and their success is measured by whether they solve the problem and deliver tangible *outcomes*, not just shipped features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:46">[02:14:46]</a>. This means a focus on "time to money" rather than merely "time to market" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:13">[02:22:13]</a>.

### Core Competencies and Skills
For an empowered product team to function effectively, certain competencies are crucial:
1.  **Real Product Manager:** Responsible for *value* (for the customer) and *viability* (for the business) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:58">[02:50:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:26">[02:51:26]</a>. This involves deep understanding of users, customers, and data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:55">[02:59:55]</a>. They must also represent various business aspects like compliance, sales, marketing, finance, and legal constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:17">[02:46:17]</a>. An empowered product manager is a "creator," not just a "facilitator" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:17">[02:51:17]</a>.
2.  **Real Product Designer:** Possesses skills in service design, interaction design, visual design, and user research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:09">[03:07:09]</a>.
3.  **Real Tech Lead:** A senior engineer who contributes significantly to the team's technical direction and execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:15">[03:07:15]</a>.
4.  **Real Product Leader:** Managers of product, design, and engineering who know how to coach their people and develop a true product strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:19">[03:07:19]</a>. They set the strategic "bets" for the company, while teams figure out the best solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:54">[04:55:54]</a>.

These roles work side-by-side to create solutions that are usable, feasible, valuable, and viable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:48">[02:28:48]</a>. They understand that [[building_effective_product_teams | smaller teams]] can often produce more and better results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>.

### Key Principles of the Product Operating Model
Marty Cagan's new book, *[[transformed_moving_to_the_product_operating_model | Transformed]]*, outlines 20 principles that define the "product operating model" adopted by the best product companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:53">[03:59:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:06">[04:03:06]</a>. These include:
*   **Innovation over predictability:** Prioritizing genuine innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:48">[04:08:48]</a>.
*   **Learning over failure:** Viewing mistakes as opportunities to learn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:56">[04:08:56]</a>.
*   **Principles over process:** Focusing on underlying principles rather than rigid methodologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:58">[04:08:58]</a>.
*   **Empowered with problems to solve:** Teams are given challenges, not just tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:05">[04:09:05]</a>.
*   **Real ownership:** Teams have a genuine sense of responsibility for their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:04">[04:10:04]</a>.
*   **Addressing product risks:** Proactively identifying and mitigating risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:23">[04:10:23]</a>.
*   **Embracing quick experimentation:** Using rapid testing to validate ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:26">[04:10:26]</a>.
*   **Testing ideas responsibly:** Ensuring tests are conducted ethically and effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:29">[04:10:29]</a>.
*   **Small, frequent, uncoupled releases:** Deploying updates regularly and independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:33">[04:10:33]</a>.
*   **Instrumentation and monitoring:** Ensuring products are tracked to prove outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:40">[04:10:40]</a>.

## Shifting from Feature Teams to Empowered Product Teams

### Individual Agency
While many product managers in feature teams feel "trapped," believing their only option is to quit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:40">[03:03:40]</a>, Cagan argues that individuals have significant agency to improve their skills and influence their companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:47">[03:04:47]</a>. By developing skills in value and viability, a product manager can "raise their game" and contribute at a higher level, which often leads to internal appreciation and promotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:22">[03:38:22]</a>.

> "There is so much they can do today." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>

### Leadership and Transformation
The transformation to an empowered product model requires leadership to "do their job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:11">[04:13:11]</a>. This means setting clear strategic bets and allowing teams the latitude to solve problems effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:54">[04:55:54]</a>. This is a complex shift, as chronicled in Marty Cagan's book, *[[transformed_moving_to_the_product_operating_model | Transformed]]*, which provides case studies of companies that successfully moved to this model, often from industries outside the Silicon Valley bubble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:53">[03:59:53]</a>.

[[impact_of_company_culture_on_product_development | Company culture]] plays a vital role in this transformation. The challenge is that much of the available online content and certifications for product management perpetuate the feature team model, making it difficult for new product managers to learn the "right" way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:39">[03:36:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:39">[03:37:39]</a>.

### Product Ops
The concept of [[role_of_product_managers_versus_project_managers | Product Ops]] is seen as a way to support empowered product teams, particularly in areas like user research and data analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:37">[04:15:37]</a>. However, it can also fall into the "theater" trap if it focuses on "process and governance" or serves as an "assistant" role to product managers who aren't doing their full job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:30">[04:16:30]</a>.

## Role of Product Managers in Startups
For startups, Marty Cagan advises against hiring product managers too soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:40">[04:21:40]</a>. The role of ensuring value and viability (the core of a real product manager's job) belongs to the founder in the early stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:54">[04:22:54]</a>. Bringing in a product manager too early can cause conflict, as it creates "too many cooks in the kitchen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23:41">[04:23:41]</a>. He suggests that a product manager becomes most useful after a certain scale, typically around 20-25 engineers, when the company is also looking to expand into new products or markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:26">[04:24:26]</a>.

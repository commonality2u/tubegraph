Shopify, a significant force in e-commerce, takes a notably unique approach to product development, growth, and decision-making, emphasizing long-term vision over short-term metrics. Archie Abrams, VP of Product and Head of Growth at Shopify, oversees an organization of over 600 people across product, design, engineering, data operations, and growth marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. Shopify powers approximately 10% of e-commerce in the United States and facilitated roughly $235 billion in Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV) in 2023, comparable to the economy of Finland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

## Shopify's Distinct Approach

Shopify's strategy is influenced by a [[developing_longterm_strategic_approaches_in_product_development | 100-year vision]] set by CEO Tobi LÃ¼tke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. This long-term outlook shapes several core aspects of their operations:

*   **No KPIs for Core Product Teams**: Unlike most companies, core product teams at Shopify operate without traditional metrics or KPIs, with decisions often based on "taste and intuition" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:14">[00:48:14]</a>.
*   **Optimizing for Churn**: The [[growth_team_structure_and_collaboration_at_shopify | growth team]] at Shopify [[the_rationale_behind_optimizing_for_churn_at_shopify | optimizes for churn]], a counterintuitive strategy for most companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Experimentation Holdouts**: Shopify maintains long-term holdouts for every experiment, automatically assessing their impact on the business a year, two years, or three years later to revisit decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.

### The Rationale Behind Optimizing for Churn

Shopify's mission is to increase entrepreneurship on the internet by making it as easy as possible to start an online store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. Recognizing that most businesses fail, their strategy is to lower the barriers to entry, enabling as many people as possible to try entrepreneurship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.

Shopify's revenue model primarily derives from payments, which are directly tied to merchant success, rather than solely subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. A small number of highly successful merchants ("winners") can generate substantial GMV, compensating for the larger number of merchants who may not succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. This is likened to angel investing, where a few outlier successes make the entire portfolio profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

Instead of focusing on per-merchant retention, Shopify's growth is measured by the total GMV produced by a cohort of merchants over multiple years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.

## Long-Term Experimentation and Insights

Shopify employs a robust [[building_a_culture_and_platform_for_experimentation | experimentation]] system with long-term holdouts to evaluate the true impact of changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. They constantly re-evaluate experiments one, two, or three years later to see how the GMV curve or distribution differs from initial expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.

*   **Experimentation System**: Shopify uses an internal experimentation system. For changes affecting new merchants, they might run a 50-50 split test for a few weeks. The winner is then shipped to 100% of users, but the original cohort assigned to the experiment is continually monitored for long-term effects. Automated pings remind experimenters to review results at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>.
*   **Counterintuitive Findings**: Roughly 30-40% of experiments that show a short-term lift in metrics (e.g., number of paying shops, first sale) show **no incremental long-term lift** in GMV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>.
    *   **Example 1: Payment Failure Notifications**: Improving notifications for payment failures initially showed major short-term lift. However, long-term analysis revealed no GMV lift. This was attributed to a selection bias: users whose payments failed were often less dedicated to entrepreneurship, and addressing the payment issue didn't fundamentally change their long-term commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:26">[00:38:26]</a>.
    *   **Example 2: Pre-configured Online Store Sections**: Introducing pre-configured sections in the online store editor initially showed no lift in converting to a paying merchant. However, six months later, it had a "massive impact" on the number of people selling and producing GMV. This was because it helped merchants create better, higher-converting stores, leading to earlier sales and sustained engagement with entrepreneurship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:47">[00:40:47]</a>.

*   **Shipping Neutral Experiments**: Shopify sometimes ships experiments that show neutral short-term results if there's good intuition that they will be positive in the long term, or if they align with the desired product experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:23">[00:41:23]</a>.

For companies unable to run long-term holdouts, Archie Abrams advises betting on short-term positive lifts and shipping them, but to "not overestimate the amount of impact that this is having" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:29">[00:29:29]</a>.

### Monetary Friction and Onboarding Personalization

*   **Monetary Friction**: Defined as factors like trial dynamics (length, amount) and incentives (e.g., app store credits). Lowering monetary friction can unlock a class of valuable entrepreneurs by giving them more time to develop their business idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:46">[00:26:46]</a>.
*   **[[onboarding_and_decisionmaking_at_startups | Onboarding]] Personalization**: Collecting more information during sign-up to personalize guidance is a significant growth driver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:50">[00:23:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:46">[00:24:46]</a>. This sets people up for long-term success by simplifying the product experience.

## Decision-Making and Organizational Structure

### "Aim Heavy" Philosophy and 100-Year Vision

Shopify's "aim heavy" philosophy emphasizes building a 100-year company, prioritizing long-term success for merchants and the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:07">[00:42:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:23">[00:42:23]</a>. This means avoiding short-term "chasing" of deals or features that might offer immediate revenue but don't align with the long-term vision of supporting entrepreneurs from the ground up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:30">[00:43:30]</a>.

*   **Technical Architecture Determines Strategy**: A core belief is that the "how" (technical architecture) of building determines strategy more than the "what" or "who" in a technology company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:16">[00:45:16]</a>. This focus on building an adaptable, flexible platform means they sometimes take longer to ship features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:32">[00:45:32]</a>. For example, detailed discussions are held about building robust CSV importers using open-source libraries or core codebase integration, rather than just building a "good enough" solution quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:11">[00:46:11]</a>.

### Absence of KPIs and "Taste"

Core product teams at Shopify operate with [[shopifys_approach_to_growth_without_kpis | no metrics or KPIs]] or OKRs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:12">[00:48:12]</a>. Their focus is on building the "right technical foundation" for the future of commerce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:52">[00:48:52]</a>. Decisions are based on conviction, data (as one piece of the puzzle), qualitative insights, and product "taste" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:02">[00:49:02]</a>.

*   **Pros**: Allows teams to take more risks and ship truly innovative, forward-facing features without short-term metric pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:28">[00:49:28]</a>.
*   **Cons**: Can lead to subjective conversations and "squishiness" in decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:42">[00:49:42]</a>. This is mitigated by a strong, opinionated founder (Tobi) and key leaders (like Glenn, Head of Core Product) who maintain a consistent bar for quality and "taste" across all releases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:51">[00:50:51]</a>. All projects go through a "GSD" (Get Sh\*t Done) system and require a "-2 approval" by group leads (Glenn, Carl, Archie) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:03">[00:52:03]</a>.

### Collaboration Between Growth and Core Product

There's an intentional tension between the growth team (metrics-driven, focused on absolute numbers like total GMV from a cohort) and core product (taste-driven, long-term vision) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:49">[00:54:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:50">[00:25:50]</a>.

*   **Healthy Tension**: The [[growth_team_structure_and_collaboration_at_shopify | growth team]] can suggest changes that drive growth (e.g., moving a button), which might clash with the core team's design "taste." These conflicts are resolved through open discussion, testing, and a mutual commitment to shipping high-quality, polished products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:58">[00:55:58]</a>.
*   **"No Wizard" Principle**: Shopify avoids "wizards" (onboarding carousels or steps that abstract the actual product experience) as a core principle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:05">[00:57:05]</a>. Instead, they work to integrate the principles of simplification and guidance directly into the product experience, like pre-filling sections in the online store editor, which helps users get started without detaching them from the core product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:47">[00:57:47]</a>.

### Founder's Influence on Organizational Structure

The founder's background significantly impacts the organization's focus. Tobi LÃ¼tke, with his engineering background, emphasizes technical architecture. This contrasts with, for example, Airbnb's Brian Chesky, a designer, who focused on the user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:18">[00:47:18]</a>.

## Key Takeaways for Other Companies

For companies considering a "no metrics" approach for product teams, it requires either:
1.  **Metrics as Accountability**: The most common way to drive accountability and focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:05">[01:00:05]</a>.
2.  **Extremely Strong Founder/Leadership Opinions**: A founder or small group of leaders with "extremely strong opinions on what good is and what taste is" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:12">[01:00:12]</a>. Without either, teams risk building "cool stuff" in a haphazard way without accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:22">[01:00:22]</a>. Most companies would benefit more from driving and tracking metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>.

Long-term experimentation, even if not feasible for every company, highlights that many short-term lifts may not translate to long-term impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>. Prioritizing absolute numbers of successful users rather than conversion rates can also align teams toward sustainable growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:50">[00:25:50]</a>.

Giving and receiving feedback effectively is a critical skill for leaders and employees, yet it presents numerous challenges in the workplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:30">[01:30:30]</a>. These difficulties can lead to misunderstandings, strained relationships, and hindered professional growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03:00">[09:03:00]</a>.

## The "Radical Candor" Framework and its Challenges
Kim Scott's "Radical Candor" framework, widely referenced for its approach to feedback, highlights common pitfalls in communication that contribute to these challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>. The framework is based on two dimensions: "care personally" (vertical axis) and "challenge directly" (horizontal axis) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>. Failures occur when one or both of these dimensions are neglected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>.

### Obnoxious Aggression
This quadrant occurs when individuals [[techniques_for_managing_and_delivering_feedback | challenge directly]] but fail to show they care personally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>. It's often mistaken for Radical Candor, leading people to act harshly in its name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>. Obnoxious aggression is problematic because it hurts others and is inefficient; recipients enter a "fight or flight" mode and cannot hear the feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>. Realizing one has acted this way can also lead to a shift towards manipulative insincerity to compensate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>.

### Manipulative Insincerity
This is characterized by a lack of both personal care and direct challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a>. This often stems from self-protective insincerity or extreme frustration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>. While dramatic, it's not the most common problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:00">[06:10:00]</a>.

### Ruinous Empathy
The most common mistake, accounting for approximately 90% of failures, occurs when individuals remember to care personally but fail to challenge directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>. This happens because people are worried about hurting feelings or offending others, withholding [[providing_constructive_feedback | information others would be better off knowing]] in the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:00">[06:25:25]</a>.
*   **Case Study: "Bob"**
    Kim Scott shares a personal story of "ruinous empathy" with an employee named Bob <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>. Despite Bob being charming and well-liked, his work was consistently terrible and riddled with sloppy mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>. Scott, liking Bob and not wanting to hurt his feelings, gave vague, soft feedback, which also stemmed from a manipulative insincerity to protect her own reputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>. This went on for ten months, resulting in Bob's eventual termination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. This lack of direct feedback was unfair to Bob and frustrating for the rest of the team, leading to late deliverables and forcing others to redo his work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>. It risked losing high performers who wanted to do their best work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>.

## Why Feedback is Hard

### Fear of Being Disliked
Many people, often described as "people pleasers," find it inherently difficult to give hard feedback because they want to be liked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>. This need for approval can lead to avoiding direct challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>. Overcoming this involves shifting focus from being liked to genuinely caring about others and their growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>.

### Personal Discomfort and Defensiveness
Giving feedback is difficult and can feel like "cruel and unusual punishment" to some <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>. Receiving feedback can also trigger natural defensive reactions, as being told "I'm wrong" is uncomfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>. Managing these emotional responses is crucial for effective communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>.

### Misinterpretation of Signals
When giving feedback, it's easy to misinterpret facial expressions and body language, especially in remote settings where visual cues are limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>. This "noise over signal" can lead to incorrect assumptions about how feedback is landing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>.

### Impact of Bias and [[cultural_barriers_to_direct_feedback | Cultural Barriers to Direct Feedback]]
Workplace culture often isn't welcoming of direct feedback, making it harder for individuals to be candid without risking retention or being perceived negatively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. Biases, such as the "likability-competence bias" often faced by women, can make it harder for certain individuals to challenge directly without being unjustly accused of obnoxious aggression or being seen as "bossy" or "abrasive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. There are also specific challenges, such as the "angry black woman" stereotype, which can make it significantly harder for Black women to deliver even gentle criticism without negative labeling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>.

## Practical Pitfalls in Delivering Feedback

### Ineffective Solicitation
Asking open-ended questions like "Do you have any feedback for me?" is often a "wasting your breath" moment, as people will typically respond with "everything's fine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Questions need to be more specific and authentic to the asker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>.

### Delaying Feedback
A common pitfall is waiting for a "better moment" to give feedback, which often results in never giving it at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>. Feedback, both praise and criticism, should ideally be given immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>. Saving feedback for one-on-ones or, worse, performance reviews, is ineffective and delays necessary adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>.

### Inappropriate Medium
Delivering feedback asynchronously via email, text, or Slack is discouraged because it prevents gauging how the feedback is landing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>. A synchronous conversation (in-person or phone call) allows for real-time adjustments based on emotional cues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>.

### Focusing on Personality
Feedback should focus on observable actions and their results, not on personality traits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>. Criticizing someone's personality (e.g., "you sound stupid") is only effective in specific, deeply trusting relationships where it's understood as care, but can be deeply damaging otherwise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>.

### Failure to Reward Candor
When someone takes the risk to give critical feedback, especially an employee to their boss, it must be "richly rewarded" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>. Simply saying "thank you" might be perceived as a brush-off if not followed by tangible action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>. If feedback is not rewarded or addressed, people will stop giving it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>.

### Dealing with Disagreement
A challenge arises when receiving feedback that one disagrees with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>. The challenge is to acknowledge the feedback respectfully, find common ground if possible, and then explain the disagreement clearly later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>. Unspoken disagreement poses a greater risk to relationships than open, respectful disagreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>.

## Consequences of Poor Feedback Practices

Poor feedback practices, particularly ruinous empathy, can lead to severe organizational issues:
*   **Loss of Top Performers:** High-performing employees become frustrated when they see underperforming colleagues not being addressed, or when they have to do extra work to compensate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>. This can cause them to seek employment elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.
*   **Decreased Team Performance:** When individuals are not held accountable for poor work, it affects overall team deliverables and quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>.
*   **Unfairness:** It's unfair to the individual not receiving candid feedback, as they are not given the opportunity to improve or find a role where they can excel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>.
*   **Stunted Career Growth:** Without clear, direct feedback, individuals may not be aware of crucial areas for development necessary for their career advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>. [[importance_of_feedback_and_selfawareness_in_career_growth | Self-awareness]] is key for career growth, and feedback is a primary driver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>.

## Addressing Feedback Challenges
To overcome these challenges, individuals and organizations must prioritize soliciting feedback, practicing authentic and specific questioning, delivering feedback immediately and synchronously, focusing on behavior over personality, and, critically, rewarding candor through tangible action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>. This commitment requires emotional discipline but ultimately saves time and fosters stronger relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.

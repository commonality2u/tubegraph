Notion, co-founded by Ivan Zhao, is more than just a productivity tool; it embodies a [[philosophy_and_entrepreneurship | philosophy]] of how to work and exist in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:06">[01:04:06]</a>. Zhao, a deeply philosophical founder, emphasizes the critical role of [[Developing and Implementing Company Values | values]] and aesthetics in product development and company building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

### Foundational Philosophy of Notion

Notion's initial vision stemmed from Zhao's desire to create a product that would allow more people to create software tools for their daily work and life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. This ambition was heavily influenced by Douglas Engelbart's paper, "Augmenting Human Intellect," which posits that computing should not separate builders from users, but rather be a malleable medium that enhances human problem-solving abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:33">[08:33]</a>. This idea became Zhao's obsession and the impetus for starting Notion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00">[09:00]</a>.

However, the early years of Notion, which Zhao describes as "the lost years," revealed a crucial lesson: the world doesn't always want what the founder wants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:57">[01:11:57]</a>. The initial developer tool, designed for everyone to create software, didn't resonate with the majority who simply cared about getting their daily jobs done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:57">[01:19:57]</a>. This led to the realization that the core vision – enabling everyone to create software – needed to be "hidden" within a form factor people *do* care about: productivity software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:20">[01:20:20]</a>. This concept is likened to offering "sugar" (productivity tools) that conceals the "broccoli" (the underlying no-code developer power) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>.

### Values in Product and Business Building

For Zhao, building a product or business involves a delicate balance between market needs (users, revenue) and personal [[Developing and Implementing Company Values | values]] and aesthetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49">[00:49]</a>. He distinguishes between:
*   **Building for winning**:: Optimizing for market scorecard and competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27">[02:27]</a>.
*   **Building for value**:: Creating something authentic to oneself, something desired for the world based on one's taste and aesthetic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36">[02:36]</a>.

While early Notion leaned too much into being an "art project" or "research project" by building solely for the founder's vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:54">[02:19:54]</a>, a business also cannot be *too* focused on just the market, as that leads to building a commodity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:04">[02:22:04]</a>. The most fulfilling and durable energy source comes from creating something authentic that also proves useful to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:09">[02:09:09]</a>.

### Values in Company Culture and Operations

Notion's philosophy extends to its internal operations and culture. The company's internal philosophy is defined as "craft and values," where "craft" refers to skill, taste, and technical know-how, and "values" refer to one's personal worldview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37">[03:37]</a>.

This commitment to [[importance_of_design_and_functionality_in_product_development | design and functionality]] and values is evident in the office environment, which is designed to be cozy and inspiring, like an artist's studio or home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:28">[03:29:28]</a>. This includes careful choices in lighting, wall colors, and furniture to create a pleasant and creative space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44">[03:44]</a>. Conference rooms are named after "Timeless Tools in history" such as the iPhone, Macintosh, and even the Toshiba rice cooker, to inspire the team to create software that lasts and impacts lives for decades, rather than just months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:08">[03:09:08]</a>.

The company also uses the metaphor of Notion as a "small bus" to convey the importance of staying lean and hiring "talent density," ensuring everyone on the bus dictates its speed and the overall work experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40">[03:40]</a>.

### Course Correction Based on Values

Notion has experienced an "organ rejection" when the company deviated from its core values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36">[04:36]</a>. For example, when building project management features like "Sprints," the team initially hardcoded concepts instead of building them using Notion's fundamental "Lego pieces" (modular, composable blocks) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53">[04:53]</a>. This resulted in a product that felt "underpowered" compared to competitors and didn't integrate well with the rest of Notion, leading to customer dissatisfaction and internal technical friction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59">[04:59]</a>. Realizing this deviation, Notion shifted back to its original "Lego way" of building, aligning product development with its core values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59">[04:59]</a>.

### Tools, Human Potential, and an Infinite Game

For Zhao, tools are extensions of humans: "we shape our tools, thereafter our tools shape us" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09">[03:09]</a>. He believes that software, often lacking creativity and beauty, has the potential to amplify these human natures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:09">[04:14:09]</a>. Notion aims to "amplify creativity and beauty in the domain of software" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44">[04:44]</a>, aligning with his personal values and shaping users towards a better version of themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56">[04:56]</a>. The growth of a community where non-programmers can build and sell Notion templates and apps is a testament to this mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25">[05:25]</a>.

Zhao views the continuous evolution of Notion as an "infinite game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17">[04:17]</a>, constantly requiring new skills and adaptations. He advises looking beyond the immediate tech landscape to other industries and historical patterns for inspiration and "clever tradeoffs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46">[06:46]</a>. This holistic perspective, blending philosophical ideals with practical execution and continuous learning, is key to Notion's enduring success and its unique identity in the market.

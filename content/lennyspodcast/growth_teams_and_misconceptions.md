Growth is a relatively new field that has garnered significant interest, leading to a proliferation of "growth hacks" and quick tips, particularly in the age of social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Many of these tips are out of context, specific to one example, or simply do not apply as a general pattern, leading to high rates of failure within growth teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## When Growth Teams Don't Work

### Hiring Too Soon

A major misconception in the growth field is that a growth team is necessary to initiate growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>. This is "absolutely not true" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. Founders and founding teams must first establish how to grow the company to its initial revenue milestones, such as $1 million to $10 million ARR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. Some companies even wait until they are at $100-$200 million ARR before forming a growth team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

It is impossible to outsource the process of figuring out [[developing_a_growth_model_for_a_business | product-market fit]] and distribution to a growth team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. Growth teams are best suited for running experiments on an existing user base with sufficient data volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.

Two specific reasons to delay hiring a growth team:
1.  **Lack of Solid Product-Market Fit (PMF)**: PMF means having a solution to a problem where customers not only use the solution but also retain and stay with the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. If PMF isn't strong, a growth team cannot fix it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>.
2.  **Insufficient Data**: Growth functions require data to analyze, form hypotheses, and apply experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. A small number of users (e.g., 10) is not enough data for a growth team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.

The longer a company defers hiring a growth team, the better, as it trains the entire organization to be responsible for growth, rather than isolating it to a single department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.

### When Business Growth is Declining

Hiring a "shiny growth head" to fix a broader business slowdown is another common mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>. If the overall business is declining, a head of growth is "destined to fail" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>. Growth teams can optimize and potentially lift growth by 10-15%, but they cannot fix fundamental issues with core product or marketing strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. Their role is to amplify existing product-market fit, not to create it or reverse a decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>.

It is a "huge waste of money" to hire a large growth team for a declining business, as the ROI will likely be minimal, and it won't produce the "J curve" acceleration often expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>. Companies should first address core product and marketing issues to at least plateau the decline before introducing a growth team to accelerate new growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>.

## Ineffective Growth Tactics

The field of growth is often plagued by common tactics that repeatedly fail, yet companies continue to invest significant resources into them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:33">[01:54:33]</a>.

### 1. Rebranding or Redesigning Marketing Sites

Rebranding or redesigning a marketing site, especially to drive growth, almost "never ever once" produces good performance results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:49">[01:59:49]</a>. While there are valid reasons for a rebrand (e.g., entering a new market, product evolution), these are typically lagging indicators, requiring substantial future optimization to regain previous performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:50">[02:09:50]</a>.

Often, new CMOs initiate these projects based on personal taste, promising increased acquisition, which "never materializes into anything meaningful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:11">[02:11:11]</a>. Such efforts can lead to millions of dollars in agency spending, months of development, and "very lackluster results" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:04">[02:14:04]</a>. Redesigns, even for products, tend to result in a temporary step back in performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:22">[02:22:22]</a>.

If pursuing a redesign, anticipate a performance hit and allocate an additional three to six months for optimization *after* launch to potentially outperform the original <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:45">[02:24:45]</a>.

### 2. Blindly Copying Competition

While understanding competitors is crucial, blindly copying their tactics or flows in hopes of replicating their success "fails 95% of the time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:07">[02:07:07]</a>. Each product experience is unique to its customer and channel, and observing a competitor's public-facing flow doesn't reveal its underlying effectiveness or context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:23">[02:26:23]</a>.

Copying avoids the essential steps of ideation, user research, customer interviews, and experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:51">[02:26:51]</a>. It leads to "mediocracy" because true leadership comes from innovation, not imitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:12">[02:28:12]</a>.

Benchmarking against competitors is also dangerous, as metrics are often defined differently across companies, making direct comparisons unreliable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:40">[02:28:40]</a>. Benchmarks should be inputs for decision-making, not blind targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:57">[02:29:57]</a>.

> "Copying competition is like the fastest way to mediocracy because you'll never be a leader if you copied somebody else." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:10">[02:28:10]</a>

### 3. Believing Your Problems Are Unique

It is a "huge opportunity cost" to re-engineer solutions from scratch under the belief that your problem is unique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:48">[02:34:48]</a>. In a rapidly evolving market, most problems have been encountered and often solved (or failed at) by others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:10">[02:35:10]</a>.

Instead of starting from zero, leverage:
*   **Competitor Analysis**: As inspiration (not blind copying) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:41">[02:43:41]</a>.
*   **Networking**: Find people who have faced similar challenges and ask them for insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:50">[02:35:50]</a>.
*   **Pattern Recognition**: Identify recurring elements or solutions across different companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:04">[02:42:04]</a>.

Seeking external help requires humility, even if you hold a senior title <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:31">[02:39:31]</a>. It is crucial to learn from others' failures and successes to accelerate progress, as the market doesn't wait for companies to repeat costly mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:34">[02:40:34]</a>.

### 4. Prioritizing Paid/Owned Channels Over Earned Channels

Growth teams often make a significant mistake by prioritizing traditional paid (SEM) or owned (SEO, social media) channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:04">[02:44:04]</a>. While these channels are important for [[Growth hacking as a sustainable business strategy | acquisition]], they rely on external platforms (like Google or social media algorithms) that can change at any time, reducing control and increasing cost of acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>.

The top priority for a growth team should be to create "owned or earned" channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:37">[02:44:37]</a>. This means relying on:
*   **Virality**
*   **Word-of-mouth**
*   **User-generated content (UGC)**

These channels are unique to a company and cannot be directly competed with by rivals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:10">[02:46:10]</a>. Investing in UGC (e.g., user-generated templates, case studies, reviews) is particularly important given shifts in search interfaces towards AI, which reduces credit for generic content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:40">[02:48:40]</a>.

> "If you don't spend enough time on virality and user generated content to create their own earned acquisition, you're going to be in some really big trouble over the next year to two years." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:39">[02:47:39]</a>

While building earned channels is not cheap (it requires significant product, engineering, and marketing resources), it's a sustainable [[developing_a_growth_model_for_a_business | growth model]] that nobody can take away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:07">[02:48:07]</a>.

### 5. Not Evolving Growth Models

Companies often rely too heavily on a single [[developing_a_growth_model_for_a_business | growth model]] that initially worked, failing to anticipate its eventual slowdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:13">[02:51:13]</a>. Just as products need to evolve beyond their initial product-market fit, growth models need continuous expansion through "overlaying other growth models" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:22">[02:53:22]</a>.

This means continuously introducing different growth approaches, such as:
*   **Product-led growth**
*   **Marketing-led growth**
*   **Sales-led growth**

Not doing so leads to diminishing returns (Law of Shitty Click-Throughs) and leaves gaps in the market for competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:02">[02:54:02]</a>. While some growth loops (like Dropbox's sharing loop) can last for many years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:03">[02:53:03]</a>, most have a limited lifespan of five to seven years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:15">[02:53:15]</a>.

Growth teams should allocate 20-25% of their annual time to introducing new growth loops or channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:25">[02:56:25]</a>. These new initiatives may take six months to a year and a half to produce visible revenue, so starting early is critical to avoid a sudden growth slowdown and the desperate need for immediate revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:58">[02:57:58]</a>.

### 6. Not Hiring Advisors

Not hiring advisors is a "huge mistake" that can hinder a growth team's and business's progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:37">[03:01:37]</a>. Advisors provide access to vast networks of data points and patterns, offering invaluable input for decision-making that would otherwise be unavailable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:04">[03:02:04]</a>.

To vet advisors, conduct a paid workshop on a specific problem to see them in action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:14">[03:04:14]</a>. This allows for a practical interview to determine if they can contribute effectively to your team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:01">[03:05:01]</a>. Continuously evaluate an advisor's value on a monthly basis, as some may only be needed for short periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:21">[03:05:21]</a>.

### 7. Excessive Experimentation and Risk Aversion

Growth teams can become paralyzed by "too much risk averseness," testing "every single thing" they touch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:10">[03:06:10]</a>. While experimentation is fundamental to growth, over-experimentation slows progress, velocity, and learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:48">[03:06:48]</a>.

Trust intuition, especially for low-volume areas where A/B testing would take too long (e.g., eight months to reach statistical significance) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:54">[03:07:54]</a>. A good rule of thumb is: if you can't collect the sample size in a month, don't test it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:13">[03:08:13]</a>. Instead, use pre-versus-post analysis, which is powerful and allows for rollbacks if needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:21">[03:08:21]</a>.

Data is a tool, not the sole decision-maker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:37">[03:08:37]</a>. Strategic pivots or high-traffic areas warrant precise scientific measurement where even small differences matter, but many initiatives do not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:01">[03:09:01]</a>. Failure is inevitable in growth, but understanding *where* to aim for precision versus where to just "go for it" is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:55">[03:09:55]</a>.

### 8. Quick Fire Round: Common Time Wasters

*   **Color Optimizations**: Testing shades of blue or green is an outdated tactic from the early 2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:15">[03:11:15]</a>. As long as a color is accessible and bright, "pick a color, move on" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:17">[03:11:17]</a>.
*   **Third-Party Signups (OAuth)**: Adding options like Google, Facebook, or Slack OAuth rarely drives incremental acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:30">[03:11:30]</a>. It typically causes a mix shift in how users sign up rather than increasing overall signups or improving activation/retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:02">[03:12:02]</a>. For developer products, GitHub OAuth makes sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:44">[03:11:44]</a>.
*   **One-Off Emails**: Stressing over a single email's lift is pointless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:17">[03:12:17]</a>. Too few people open or click them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:39">[03:12:39]</a>. Email should be approached as a series of communications, a "whole strategy" interacting with product communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:44">[03:12:44]</a>.
*   **Obsession with Removing Friction**: While eliminating truly horrible or confusing friction is necessary, simply removing steps or oversimplifying to an "oblivion" can cause a product to lose its identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:16">[03:13:16]</a>. "Simplifying onboarding" should never be a roadmap item; it's a solution to a problem like user confusion or lack of education, not a problem itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:05">[03:14:05]</a>.

## Recommended Growth Frameworks

To help understand how to think about growth and circumvent many of the misconceptions above, the following frameworks are highly recommended:
*   **Growth Loops**: Focuses on action-reaction cycles that generate further actions, creating self-contained, sustainable flywheels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:01">[03:16:01]</a>. Referenced by Reforge, Brian Balfour, Casey Winters, and Andrew Chen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:27">[03:16:27]</a>.
*   **Race Car Framework**: Helps categorize growth initiatives into engines (loops), fuel (e.g., paid marketing), turbo boosts (e.g., big conferences), and lubrication/optimizations, providing clarity on their purpose and impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:58">[03:16:58]</a>.
*   **Adjacent User Theory**: From Anu Hariharan and Lenny Rachitsky, this framework guides thinking about growth evolution by considering users outside the ideal customer profile (ICP) and how to optimize their experiences to bring them into the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:34">[03:17:34]</a>.

These frameworks provide powerful mental models for strategic thinking about growth, helping to avoid falling into common pitfalls and [[unorthodox_frameworks_for_growth_and_impact | challenges and misconceptions in strategic thinking]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:24">[03:18:24]</a>.

## Contrarian Opinion: Career Optionality

Full-time jobs are not the only, or necessarily the best, way to monetize skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:17">[03:19:17]</a>. Many people "blindly default" to full-time roles without exploring other options that might better suit their personality, interests, and skill set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:30">[03:19:30]</a>.

While full-time roles are valuable for learning and gaining expertise, they can limit individuals to one company that may not be a cultural or professional fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:28">[03:20:28]</a>. Other monetization models include:
*   Freelancing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:59">[03:20:59]</a>
*   Contracting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:01">[03:21:01]</a>
*   Advising and consulting across multiple companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:04">[03:21:04]</a>
*   Interim engagements with predetermined end dates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:35">[03:21:35]</a>
*   Fractional roles (part-time work) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:39">[03:21:39]</a>
*   Creating courses or newsletters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:48">[03:21:48]</a>

The ultimate goal in a professional journey should be **career optionality** – the ability to choose what work fits one's life, skills, and personality, leading to happiness and energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:41">[03:23:41]</a>. This is different from merely chasing titles, which can lead to dissatisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:36">[03:23:36]</a>.

To build optionality, evaluate opportunities based on whether they expand your "option pool" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:08">[03:24:08]</a>. While earning the right to optionality often starts with building depth and experience in full-time roles, at some point, individuals should explore and test new options in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:17">[03:25:17]</a>. This diversification can create stability in one's career, as it's a menu of options to pick from at any given point in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:52">[03:25:52]</a>.

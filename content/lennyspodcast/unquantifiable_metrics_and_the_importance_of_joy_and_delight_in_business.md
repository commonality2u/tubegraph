In product development and business strategy, there's a strong emphasis on quantifiable metrics and goals. However, a different approach suggests that prioritizing unquantifiable factors like joy, delight, passion, and quality can lead to superior long-term outcomes and foster [[maximizing_human_potential | human potential]].

## The Limitations of Quantifiable Metrics
Many traditional business approaches rely heavily on metrics and KPIs, often leading to a phenomenon known as Goodhart's Law. This principle states that "any metric that becomes a goal ceases to be a good metric" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:50">[01:48:50]</a>. This concept is analogous to "overfitting" in machine learning, where a model learns to cheat on the benchmark or fitness function rather than truly achieving the desired task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:14">[01:14:14]</a>.

Similarly, in business, optimizing solely for [[effective_metrics_and_goal_setting_for_data_teams | metrics]] can lead to:
*   **Overfitting for the quantifiable** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:56">[01:54:56]</a>: Companies often focus on what is easily measurable, creating a "game" where tweaking numbers provides immediate gratification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:08">[01:59:08]</a>.
*   **Neglecting true value** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:21">[01:59:21]</a>: The overlap between the most valuable things a product can do and what is fully quantifiable is estimated to be only around 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:24">[01:59:24]</a>. This leaves 80% of potential value unaddressed by those who focus only on quantifiable aspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:29">[01:59:29]</a>.
*   **Stifling ambition** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:21:00">[09:21:00]</a>: An environment that narrows focus to unambitious goals leads to competition in easily quantifiable areas, missing broader opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:26:00">[09:26:00]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Goodhart's Law
> "Any metric that becomes a goal ceases to be a good metric." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:50">[01:48:50]</a> This principle, derived from the same concept as overfitting in machine learning, highlights the danger of solely relying on quantitative targets.

## The Power of the Unquantifiable: Joy, Delight, and Quality
Instead of being strictly data-driven, a "data-informed" approach allows businesses to prioritize elements that are harder to measure but profoundly impactful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:07">[01:18:07]</a>. These include:
*   **Taste, quality, passion, love, and hate** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:41">[01:59:41]</a>: These strong emotions and intrinsic values are powerful motivators.
*   **Fun and Delight** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:04">[01:01:04]</a>: These are considered "the most powerful unquantifiable things in the world of business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:04">[01:01:04]</a>. If all metrics are pointing down but people are having more fun, it's believed that metrics will eventually start to go up after a time delay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:30">[02:11:30]</a>.
*   **Craftsperson's deep satisfaction** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:51">[01:59:51]</a>: The feeling of a job well done can be a better proxy for success than passing unit tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:51">[01:59:51]</a>.

This perspective challenges the aesthetic of "sophisticated" business, which often equates pessimism and metrics-driven approaches with intelligence, while optimism and a focus on fun are perceived as naive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:56">[02:53:56]</a>. However, "almost all the alpha in the world is now in exactly the things that are unobvious but true and the things that people dismiss as naive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:27">[02:54:27]</a>.

## How to Prioritize the Unquantifiable
Companies like Shopify operate by being comfortable with unquantifiable things and avoiding [[avoiding_traditional_metrics_for_product_development | traditional metrics for product development]] like KPIs and OKRs in core product teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:59">[01:17:59]</a>. While they are extremely data-informed and have sophisticated systems for data analysis, decisions are ultimately made by human judgment ("pilots" in a "cockpit") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:17">[02:08:17]</a>. This approach leads to better results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:38">[02:08:38]</a>.

Key aspects of this operational philosophy include:
*   **Focusing on Brand and Pride**: Asking questions like "Are you representing your brand?" and "Are you proud of a thing that you have built?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:55">[02:09:55]</a>.
*   **Acceptance of Unquantifiable**: Cultivating an environment where it's acceptable for someone to say, "hey this is actually just like really great and we're shipping this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:07">[02:22:07]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Vision**: A 100-year vision for the product and mission helps align decisions toward long-term value, beyond short-term quantifiable gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:08">[01:16:08]</a>. This allows for playing "positive sum games with your customers" which is the "ultimate growth hack" on a long enough timeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:37">[01:09:37]</a>. This relates to [[balancing_customer_focus_and_business_metrics | balancing customer focus and business metrics]].
*   **The Positional Game**: In a business analogy to chess, companies often focus on "tactics" (short-term gains, conversion rates) but should prioritize the "positional game" (building trust, expanding territory, product scope, and deep reliance) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:25">[01:10:25]</a>. Tactics are necessary to "not go out of business," but the positional game creates enduring value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:19">[01:11:19]</a>.

## The Role of Product Leaders
Product leaders play a crucial role in ensuring that these unquantifiable factors are prioritized:
*   **"Giving a shit"**: The quality of a product is a direct reflection of "how much the people who created it gave a shit about product" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:19">[01:37:19]</a>. Product leaders must infectiously care about the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:07">[01:39:07]</a>.
*   **Building Empathy**: This care can be fostered by building empathy for the people using the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:43">[01:37:43]</a>.
*   **Looking Around Corners**: Product leaders must understand the product and its context better than everyone else, anticipating future needs and challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:35">[01:38:35]</a>.

## Maximizing Potential through Unquantifiable Goals
The drive to maximize [[maximizing_human_potential | human potential]] extends beyond internal teams to the product's users. For example, by rigorously simplifying complex processes and improving UX, more businesses are created on a platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:30">[01:20:30]</a>. This focus on [[operationalizing_quality_and_design_excellence_in_product_teams | quality and design excellence]] directly leads to more entrepreneurial activity.

It's about making entrepreneurship more common by lowering barriers, especially given that starting a business is an "act of pure courage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:11">[01:21:11]</a>. Software that automates complex tasks like taxes or payments "actually causes more entrepreneurship" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:26">[01:24:26]</a>. This demonstrates how an initial intuition about value can be rigorously proven over time, showing the long-term impact of prioritizing user experience and reducing psychological friction over mere quantifiable gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:45">[01:24:45]</a>.

By focusing on the unquantifiable core of delight, passion, and true quality, businesses can build enduring value and foster widespread positive impact.

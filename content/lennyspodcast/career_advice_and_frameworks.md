Bengali Kaba, a seasoned product leader with experience at Facebook, Instagram, Instacart, and YouTube, shares his insights on [[career development and growth strategies | career development]] and various frameworks for professional and product growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## How to Choose Where to Work and What to Work On

Kaba developed a framework to help individuals objectively assess their career path, particularly when feeling stuck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. This framework, detailed in his blog post "How to Choose Where to Work and What to Work On," posits that career success is driven by **Impact** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

> "The framework is really that there's impact that you're really trying to drive and that is the thing that is the most important and the impact is only achievable by looking at two sets of kind of variables: a set of variables related to the environment, a set of variables related to your skills" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

Impact is crucial because compensation, leveling, and scope are all reflections or derivatives of the impact an individual drives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. For a product manager, impact means:
*   Driving extreme clarity about product problems, opportunities, focus, and prioritization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.
*   Delivering on that impact by making quick progress and demonstrating consistent results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.

### The Impact Equation: Environment x Skills

To maximize impact, one must evaluate and work on two key components: Environment and Skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.

#### Environment
The environment consists of six critical variables, each scored annually from 0 (poor) to 2 (greatly benefiting):
1.  **Manager:** The most important variable, as a great manager can address many other environmental issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>.
2.  **Resources:** Availability of team members, budget, etc. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.
3.  **Scope:** The breadth and depth of one's responsibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.
4.  **Team:** The skills and composition of the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.
5.  **Compensation:** Feeling fairly compensated to view work as meaningful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.
6.  **Company Culture:** A supportive and inclusive environment that enables best work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.

It's crucial to be honest when scoring these variables to identify limitations and areas for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>. For instance, Kaba realized at Facebook that his scope was too broad, and concurrent manager changes made it difficult to navigate, leading him to seek a better fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>. When facing challenges, it's vital to clearly articulate them to your manager and collaborate on a plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>. Understanding your manager's optimizations and taking on adjacent tasks can also create synergies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>.

#### Skills
Building skills requires consistent evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a>. Key skills include:
*   **Communication:** Often the most impactful, allowing individuals to tell compelling stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:18:57]</a>.
*   **Influence** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:49">[00:18:49]</a>
*   **Leadership** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>
*   **Strategic Thinking** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>
*   **Execution** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a>

To develop these skills:
*   **Be a voracious reader:** Consume content from thought leaders to build your toolkit and mental models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:55">[00:19:55]</a>.
*   **Cultivate a "stable of mentors":** Instead of one mentor, aim for three or four, meeting each monthly on different weeks to ensure consistent support and diverse perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:18">[00:20:18]</a>. To find mentors, ask trusted contacts for recommendations based on specific challenges or areas you want to learn about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:03">[00:24:03]</a>.
*   **Learn by watching others:** Product management involves an art and a science; observe how others hone their craft, deliver work, and lead teams, then emulate their effective strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">[00:21:11]</a>. Kaba learned from George Le at Instagram how to listen, recast discussions, and crystallize action items to build trust and clarity in meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:31">[00:22:31]</a>.

## Understand Work

Kaba champions a concept called "Understand Work," a core tenet of Facebook's old framework "Understand, Identify, Execute" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:57">[00:25:57]</a>. This contrasts with the "Identify, Justify, Execute" anti-pattern, where teams build based on an identified idea and then seek data to justify it, often leading to unimpactful launches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:17">[00:27:17]</a>.

> "First you have to really understand from first principles what is actually going on" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:41">[00:27:41]</a>.

Understand Work is an **intentional affordance** (a planned time allocation) within the execution process to de-risk projects and gain knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:51">[00:27:51]</a>. It's explicitly put on the roadmap, not assumed to happen in the background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:15">[00:28:15]</a>.

**Operationalizing Understand Work:**
*   **Shift balance:** Initially, a team might do more understand work (e.g., 40%) and less execution (e.g., 60%), but as understanding grows, the mix shifts towards more execution (e.g., 80-85%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:50">[00:31:50]</a>.
*   **Identify knowledge gaps:** Determine what is known with confidence (data-driven) and what needs to be understood (missing data, research, or insights) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:21">[00:32:21]</a>.
*   **Cross-functional involvement:** All functions (engineering, data science, product management, design, marketing, go-to-market) can and should contribute to understand work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:17">[00:36:17]</a>.
    *   *Engineering:* Code refactoring, instrumenting data for visibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:28">[00:36:28]</a>.
    *   *Data Science:* Analyzing activation metrics, understanding proxy metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:51">[00:36:51]</a>.
    *   *Product Management:* Figuring out partnership strategy, dogfooding the product from different user perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:04">[00:37:04]</a>.
*   **Parallel Paths:** Teams simultaneously execute on high-conviction ideas and conduct understand work. This parallel process provides continuous learnings and insights, leading to a "velocity multiplier" over timeâ€”subsequent sprints result in better, faster execution with a higher win rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:56">[00:29:56]</a>.
*   **Balance with shipping:** While dedicated time for understanding is crucial, teams must still ship. Prioritize a portfolio of work, including low-effort, high-impact executions and cheap tests that provide rapid learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:11">[00:38:11]</a>.

At Instagram, early understand work involved instrumenting the signup funnel, which had no logging, to identify where users were dropping off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>. This revealed a significant issue with account churn due to users not being able to log back in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:20">[01:20:20]</a>. Solving this problem by simplifying login options and offering to save credentials not only boosted monthly active users but also unexpectedly led to an increase in multi-account usage and content creation, eventually leading to a dedicated "multiple accounts" team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:39">[01:22:39]</a>.

## Managing Complex Change

To improve cultures and speed up teams, Kaba utilizes a framework for managing complex change, with five components:
*   **Vision:** A clear direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:06">[00:42:06]</a>.
*   **Skills:** The capabilities of the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:06">[00:42:06]</a>.
*   **Incentives:** Motivation for desired behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:06">[00:42:06]</a>.
*   **Resources:** Adequate support and tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:11">[00:42:11]</a>.
*   **Action Plan:** Clear steps for execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:11">[00:42:11]</a>.

Missing any component leads to specific negative outcomes:
*   Missing Vision = Confusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:43">[00:42:43]</a>
*   Missing Skills = Anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:47">[00:42:47]</a>
*   Missing Incentives = Resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:50">[00:42:50]</a>
*   Missing Resources = Frustration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:06">[00:42:06]</a> (not explicitly stated, but implied by chart)
*   Missing Action Plan = False Starts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:54">[00:42:54]</a>

Leaders can observe these outcomes to diagnose where to intervene and pull the right "levers" for change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:08">[00:43:08]</a>. Action plans are easier to institute (e.g., better PRD frameworks, meeting structures), while changing vision and skills takes more time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:25">[00:43:25]</a>. Kaba often brings a "deck of skills and frameworks" to align teams on common mental models, such as "product craft" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:45">[00:43:45]</a>.

## Coaching and Team Building

Kaba's background in education influences his approach to product management, viewing it as a team sport where leaders are coaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:52">[00:51:52]</a>. Just as a teacher influences students, a PM influences cross-functional teams without direct authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:40">[00:46:40]</a>.

Key aspects of this philosophy:
*   **Product as a Team Sport:** Focus on enabling and coaching team members to maximize their roles, rather than the "PM as CEO" analogy. Not everyone needs to be a star player; strong role players are vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:01">[00:52:01]</a>.
*   **Coaching Tree:** Leaders should take pride in developing their team members, helping them grow into future leadership roles, much like a college basketball coach's legacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:54">[00:52:54]</a>.
*   **Bloom's Taxonomy:** This educational framework describes levels of critical thinking (knowledge, comprehension, application, analysis, synthesis, evaluation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:02">[00:48:02]</a>. Kaba uses it to diagnose where team members (including managers) are struggling, identify skill gaps, and provide targeted support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:28">[00:48:28]</a>. This ensures people are met where they are, rather than just told to "figure things out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:05">[00:49:05]</a>.

## Career Transitions and Learning

Kaba's non-traditional career path, including six years in education and a stint on Wall Street before tech, shaped his approach to leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:48">[00:45:48]</a>. He emphasizes:
*   **Similarities in Influence:** The skills of communication, vision, and influence needed to manage a classroom of children are highly transferable to leading cross-functional teams in tech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:40">[00:46:40]</a>.
*   **Understanding Company DNA:** During his time at Instacart, Kaba realized a mismatch between his strategic, systems-building approach and the company's need for tactical, "in-the-weeds" execution, which was deeply rooted in its operations-focused DNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:38">[01:29:38]</a>.
*   **Pre-Employment Research:** When considering a new role, conduct "understand work" by talking not only to current employees (who may present the "best version" of the company) but also to former employees (who offer a "raw and different" perspective) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:13">[01:31:13]</a>. Triangulating this information helps ensure alignment with the company's true needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:54">[01:31:54]</a>.

### First 90 Days Strategy
In the first 90 days of a new job, Kaba focuses on:
*   **Observing Team Meetings:** Sitting in and listening to how teams operate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:11">[01:36:11]</a>.
*   **Knowing People "By Name and Story":** Taking the time to understand individuals' professional and personal passions and perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:25">[01:36:25]</a>. This investment builds trust, making people more receptive when it's time for the leader to share their thoughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:52">[01:36:52]</a>.

## Growth and Flywheels

Kaba is known for his focus on "flywheels" to drive growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:10">[00:55:10]</a>. This involves understanding the value proposition at every point of a product's experience, especially in multi-sided marketplaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:48">[00:55:48]</a>.

### The Adjacent User Theory
A key concept for driving product growth, especially in hypergrowth companies, is the **Adjacent User Theory** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>.
*   **Identify the Next User:** Understand who is using your product today and why, but crucially, identify the "next user" who *could* be using the product but currently isn't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:33">[01:03:33]</a>.
*   **Dogfood as the Adjacent User:** Experience the product from their perspective to see what's broken or missing for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:04">[01:06:04]</a>. This often means creating a new account to avoid the skewed perception of a power user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:42">[00:56:42]</a>.
*   **Observe and Learn:** Talk to these users, watch them use the product in real-time, and identify their needs and "jobs to be done" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:47">[01:06:47]</a>.

**Examples:**
*   **Instagram:** As Instagram grew rapidly, new users (e.g., from India or the Philippines) had different tech savviness and phone types, leading to a decline in conversion rates despite no product changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:30">[01:05:30]</a>.
*   **Instacart:** The original user might have been an office admin, but the adjacent user could be a busy parent or a single city-dweller. Understanding their unique needs (e.g., making it easy to buy ingredients for a specific meal like "taco Tuesday" instead of individual items, or simplifying reordering of staple groceries) is critical for growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:40">[00:58:40]</a>.

### Growth Opportunities and Compounding Loops
Most growth opportunities lie in the **onboarding to habit-building experience** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:02">[01:09:02]</a>. Many teams fail to understand the product's "aha moment" or how to build habit around it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:17">[01:09:17]</a>.
*   **Retention is Key:** A strong top-of-funnel is important, but if users aren't retaining, it's a "leaky bucket." Focus on making the first few months' experience great <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:49">[01:09:49]</a>.
*   **Compounding Growth Loops:** Build multiple acquisition channels that reinforce each other. At Instagram, growth was not solely due to virality (invitations) but also:
    *   **Celebrity Partnerships:** A savvy team taught celebrities how to use Instagram to tell their stories, setting platform norms and generating media attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:49">[01:10:49]</a>.
    *   **SEO:** News articles linking to celebrity Instagram accounts and web profiles (launched as a critical part of international growth) created a powerful SEO engine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:33">[01:11:33]</a>.
    *   **Paid Media:** Used on top of these organic signals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:21">[01:12:21]</a>.
    These engines compounded, magnifying top-of-funnel efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:30">[01:12:30]</a>.

Facebook's global people recommendations also relied on understanding cultural context. In India, common names and non-Western descriptions on profiles led users to rely on photos to identify friends. Realizing this, Facebook changed its approach to friend recommendations in that region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:07">[01:26:07]</a>.

## Life Motto

Kaba often shares a motto: "People and teams don't really reach their goals; they fall to the level of their system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:34">[01:37:34]</a>. This applies to both personal life (e.g., maintaining balance) and professional settings (e.g., rigorous systems and processes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:44">[01:37:44]</a>.

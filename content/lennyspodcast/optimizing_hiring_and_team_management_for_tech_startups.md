Varun Mohan, co-founder and CEO of Windsurf (Kodium), discusses his company's approach to [[hiring_and_team_dynamics_in_highgrowth_ai_startups | hiring and team dynamics]] in the rapidly evolving AI space, emphasizing lean operations, ruthless prioritization, and a strong culture of agency.

## Hiring Philosophy: The "Dehydrated Entity"

Kodium's core philosophy for [[hiring_and_retaining_top_talent_in_tech | hiring]] is to be the smallest company possible to satisfy its ambitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>. The goal is not to idolize being a tiny company, but to maintain operational efficiency and focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>.

### When to Hire
Kodium only hires for a role when they are "underwater" in that function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:41">[00:24:41]</a>. This means waiting until the existing team is overwhelmed and actively asking for help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:35">[00:25:35]</a>.

> "I wanted the company to almost be like this dehydrated entity. Every hire is like a little bit of water and we only go back and hire someone when we're back to being dehydrated." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>

This approach prevents:
*   **Internal Politics:** When people are hired without a clear need, they may "manufacture" work that isn't important to demonstrate impact, leading to internal politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>.
*   **Lack of Focus:** A company that is trying to do too many things and has more people than necessary risks failing at its most important objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.

### Benefits of Lean Hiring
Operating with a lean team, where everyone is "underwater," forces ruthless prioritization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:27">[00:26:27]</a>. Team members will naturally focus on the most important tasks, as they lack the bandwidth for less critical work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:36">[00:26:36]</a>. This aligns with the principle of winning by excelling at one thing, rather than being mediocre at many <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:51">[00:26:51]</a>. This constant need to decide what *not* to do is clarifying for everyone in the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:26">[00:29:26]</a>.

## What to Look for in Hires

When [[effective_hiring_and_firing_strategies | hiring]], Kodium looks for candidates who:
*   **Meet a High Technical Bar:** This is a foundational requirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>.
*   **Are Passionate about the Mission:** Candidates should genuinely care about the company's goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:08">[00:31:08]</a>.
*   **Are Willing to Work Hard:** In a competitive space like AI, hard work is crucial. The company does not promote a "chill" work environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:22">[00:31:22]</a>.
    *   A "dog whistle" during interviews is when candidates emphasize working "smart" but avoid discussing working "hard" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:31">[00:31:31]</a>.
    *   If some team members aren't pulling their weight, it can lower the bar for the entire team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:55">[00:31:55]</a>.
*   **Exhibit High Agency:** This is an undervalued skill where individuals proactively build things and are not just told what to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a>. Startups need people who innovate and do "crazy things" to avoid failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:36">[00:22:36]</a>.

Kodium's engineering interview process has an extremely low acceptance rate, partly due to a demanding take-home assignment that filters out a large portion of candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:07">[00:33:07]</a>. While AI tools are allowed in interviews, candidates must still demonstrate their problem-solving ability on their feet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:58">[00:33:58]</a>.

## Team Structure and Dynamics

Kodium operates with a [[building_and_managing_a_successful_tech_team | flat organizational structure]] for its core engineering team, comprising over 50 engineers out of approximately 160 total employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>.

### Product Management
For core engineering, Kodium does not have traditional product managers. Instead, engineers themselves are expected to "flex" into more product-oriented roles, leveraging their intuition as developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:03">[01:01:03]</a>.

For its enterprise segment, which involves complex requirements (e.g., FedRAMP compliance) not inherently understood by engineers, the company employs a "product strategy" function with three individuals who bridge customer needs with technical capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:58">[01:01:58]</a>.

### Team Size and Flexibility
Kodium follows the "two-pizza team" concept, maintaining small, agile teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:27">[01:02:27]</a>. This ensures that leaders remain deeply involved in the technology rather than becoming "armchair quarterbacks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:39">[01:02:39]</a>. Teams are highly flexible and can quickly shift priorities based on central planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:57">[01:02:57]</a>. Value to the company is tied to project impact, not team size, and individuals can move between projects as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:06">[00:30:06]</a>.

## The Impact of AI on Engineering and Hiring

While AI is expected to write over 90% of code, Kodium believes this does not negate the need for human engineers. Engineers do more than just write code; they review, test, debug, design, deploy, and navigate code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:29">[01:04:29]</a>.

AI tools offer significant productivity improvements (30-40%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:10">[01:05:10]</a>. This means the ROI of building technology has increased, leading companies with high technology ceilings to potentially hire *more* engineers, not fewer, to capitalize on increased productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:56">[01:05:56]</a>.

Kodium's sales team, which includes over 80 people, has even started building their own apps using Windsurf, saving the company significant costs on SaaS products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:10">[00:50:10]</a>. This highlights how AI empowers domain specialists to build custom tools, potentially disrupting verticalized niche software products that traditionally rely on complex feature sets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:51">[00:51:51]</a>.

## Strategic Innovation

Kodium maintains a focus on long-term bets that aim to cannibalize its existing product every 6 to 12 months, making the current product look "silly" or "dumb" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:20">[01:07:20]</a>. This tension between iterating incrementally based on user feedback and making disruptive long-term bets is crucial for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:58">[01:07:58]</a>. The company aims to constantly reprove itself in ways users aren't even asking for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:50">[01:07:50]</a>.

## Lessons Learned

Varun Mohan emphasizes the importance of being "okay with being wrong faster" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:12">[01:09:12]</a>. Startups must constantly reevaluate hypotheses and move into uncomfortable spaces more frequently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:15">[01:10:15]</a>. This counteracts the natural tendency to "drink your own Kool-Aid" and maintain irrational confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:46">[01:09:46]</a>.

Mohan's advice for individuals in the AI space is to "get your hands dirty" with AI products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:57">[01:10:57]</a>. Building apps, making mocks, and modifying existing codebases using these tools can make individuals a "force multiplier" within their organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:30">[01:11:30]</a>. The ability to make quick changes to a codebase, even as a product manager, commands respect and increases effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:44">[01:11:44]</a>.

Rahul Vora, founder and CEO of Superhuman, advocates for building business software with [[impact_of_design_on_business_growth | game design principles]], asserting that this approach makes products fun, encourages users to share them with friends, and fosters deep user engagement and brand loyalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. This strategy is distinct from mere gamification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:27">[01:00:27]</a>.

## Distinguishing Game Design from Gamification

Gamification typically involves adding superficial elements like points, levels, trophies, or badges to a product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:35">[01:00:35]</a>. According to Vora, this approach generally fails because it undermines intrinsic motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:08">[01:02:08]</a>.

### Why Gamification Falls Short

Research from Stanford in the 1970s illustrates this point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:47">[01:00:47]</a>:
*   Children aged 3-4 who were pre-interested in drawing were divided into two groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:55">[01:00:55]</a>.
*   One group was told they would receive a reward (a certificate) for drawing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:03">[01:01:03]</a>. The other group was not offered a reward and did not expect one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:08">[01:01:08]</a>.
*   Children in the non-rewarded group spent 17% of their time drawing on subsequent days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:29">[01:01:29]</a>.
*   Conversely, children who expected a reward spent only 8% of their time drawing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:36">[01:01:36]</a>.

The study highlights the difference between:
*   **Intrinsic Motivation**: Doing things because they are inherently interesting and satisfying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:54">[01:01:54]</a>.
*   **Extrinsic Motivation**: Doing things to earn external rewards or achieve external goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>.

The presence of a reward can significantly decrease intrinsic motivation, which is why gamification often fails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:04">[01:02:04]</a>. When gamification *does* seem to work, it is often because the underlying product experience was already designed like a game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:13">[01:02:13]</a>.

## Principles of Game Design in Practice

While there is no single unifying theory of game design, it draws upon psychology, mathematics, storytelling, and interaction design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:39">[01:02:39]</a>. Superhuman has identified five key areas for applying game design principles to its product:
1.  Goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:56">[01:02:56]</a>
2.  Emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:56">[01:02:56]</a>
3.  Toys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:56">[01:02:56]</a>
4.  Controls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:59">[01:02:59]</a>
5.  Flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:59">[01:02:59]</a>

### The "Make Fun Toys" Principle

A core principle in Superhuman's design philosophy is to "make fun toys and then combine those into games" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:06">[01:03:06]</a>. The best games are built from engaging "toys" because they are fun on both the toy and game levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:27">[01:03:27]</a>.

#### Example: Superhuman's Time Autocompleter
The time autocompleter, activated by hitting 'H' for snoozing or setting reminders on emails, is a key "toy" in Superhuman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:41">[01:03:41]</a>.
*   It interprets various inputs like "2D" for 2 days, "3H" for 3 hours, or "1MO" for 1 month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:53">[01:03:53]</a>.
*   Its fun lies in indulging "playful exploration," with users discovering its capabilities and limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:05">[01:04:05]</a>.
    *   Typing a series of "10" results in October 10th at 10:10 PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:16">[01:04:16]</a>.
    *   A series of "2" becomes February 2nd, 2022, at 2 PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:20">[01:04:20]</a>.
    *   It handles complex inputs like "in a Fortnite and a day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:27">[01:04:27]</a>.
    *   It performs time zone math, allowing inputs like "8 AM in Tokyo" to convert to the local time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:36">[01:04:36]</a>.
    *   Users are delighted to discover they can type "never" to snooze emails indefinitely, accompanied by a shrug emoji <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:48">[01:04:48]</a>.

This feature, while not award-winning, is surprisingly fun because it encourages playful exploration, provides enjoyment without a specific goal, and elicits moments of pleasant surprise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:01">[01:05:01]</a>.

By designing features that:
*   Indulge playful exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:12">[01:05:12]</a>.
*   Are fun even without an explicit goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:14">[01:05:14]</a>.
*   Elicit pleasant surprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:17">[01:05:17]</a>.

Companies can create "toys" within their software that can then be combined to build a more comprehensive, game-like experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:23">[01:05:23]</a>. This approach contributes to building a strong brand and fostering authentic word-of-mouth virality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:08">[01:00:08]</a>.

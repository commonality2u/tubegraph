## AI in Coaching

Outpace's initial plan was to consider [[role of AI in product teams | AI integration]] into their coaching platform as a long-term, multi-year endeavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:01">[01:13:01]</a>. However, significant advancements in AI, particularly from platforms like OpenAI, Stable Diffusion, and Midjourney, accelerated their roadmap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:06">[01:13:06]</a>.

Outpace leverages AI, specifically OpenAI, to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of their coaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:18">[01:13:18]</a>. Their product integrates content and coaching, where users engage in weekly sessions that include audio lessons and interactive exercises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:27">[01:13:27]</a>. The text content from participant responses to specific questions is used to prompt AI, which generates suggestions for coaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:46">[01:13:46]</a>.

### AI-Powered Feedback and Coaching Styles
Coaches can request AI suggestions for feedback on particular responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:02">[01:14:02]</a>. A remarkable aspect of this [[AI Integration in Product Development | AI integration]] is the ability to simulate different leadership styles through varied AI prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:12">[01:14:12]</a>. For example, AI can generate:
*   Action-oriented suggestions with next steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:16">[01:14:16]</a>.
*   Sympathetic suggestions focusing on a person's feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:21">[01:14:21]</a>.
*   Inquisitive suggestions that ask follow-up questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:25">[01:14:25]</a>.
*   Informative suggestions providing frameworks and advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:28">[01:14:28]</a>.

This allows coaches to tailor AI-generated feedback based on their knowledge of the individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:06">[01:14:06]</a>.

## Impact of AI on Product Management and the Workplace

Ravi Mehta expresses significant excitement about the rapid advancements in AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:12">[01:15:12]</a>. He highlights that the [[Impact and challenges of AI in product management | impact of AI]] is not about replacing people but rather about amplifying their capabilities and making them more effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:40">[01:14:40]</a>. This perspective applies to various fields, including image and text generation, where AI serves as an excellent starting point for human work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:51">[01:14:51]</a>.

### The Role of AI in Shaping Product Management Skills
The competence of "user experience design" in product management is broad and can encompass products involving AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:16">[00:59:16]</a>. For example, if a product manager is building machine learning (ML) models, the "experience" might refer to the training models or the systems used to identify their effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:01">[00:59:01]</a>. This suggests that understanding the underlying systems and how they perform will be a critical part of [[the_role_of_ai_in_shaping_product_management_skills | product management skills]] for AI-driven products.

The rapid progress of AI means that product visions for the future are being realized much faster than anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>, prompting continuous re-evaluation of future goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:07">[01:15:07]</a>. This dynamic environment emphasizes the need for adaptability in product development and strategic planning.

Visualization is a highly effective technique for managing [[overcoming_public_speaking_anxiety | public speaking anxiety]] and [[managing_presentation_nerves_and_stage_presence | presentation nerves]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This method, supported by research dating back to the 1980s from the University of Oregon, helps to desensitize individuals to the speaking environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Core Concept of Visualization

Instead of imagining the audience in a distracting or inappropriate manner, visualization focuses on seeing oneself in the speaking space and interacting positively with the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. It functions similarly to how athletes use visualization to prepare for competitions, helping speakers feel more comfortable and confident by mentally placing them in the room before the actual event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

## How to Practice Visualization

A good visualization practice involves several steps:
*   **Deep Breathing** Begin with deep breathing to calm the body and mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.
*   **Envision the Environment** Either close your eyes or look at a picture of the speaking environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. Speakers are often advised to see the room, even if it's just from an online picture, to mentally prepare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.
*   **Picture the Audience** Envision yourself in the room with the audience, ideally knowing who some of the individuals are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.
*   **Rehearse the Entire Event** Visualize the entire speaking process, from getting up to the stage, delivering the presentation, seeing it well-received, and even stepping off the stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. This acts as a mental dress rehearsal, preparing you for what you will experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.

This technique doesn't require a lot of time; a five-minute session can be beneficial, and repeating it a couple of times can further enhance its effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

## Modern Tools and Benefits

Virtual reality (VR) tools are emerging that can also help with visualization, allowing users to program specific audience sizes and responses (e.g., responsive or distracted) to simulate real-world speaking scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.

The ultimate goal of visualization, as with many [[tips_for_improving_public_speaking_and_overcoming_fear | techniques for improving public speaking]], is to make the actual speaking experience feel familiar rather than new and novel, thereby increasing comfort and confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. By continuing to calm oneself during visualization, it helps to create distance from the anxiety that might otherwise be felt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.

Shopify, an e-commerce platform, employs a highly unique and successful approach to its [[developing_and_implementing_company_structures_and_operating_systems | organizational structure]] and [[company_culture_and_decision_making | team dynamics]], heavily influenced by a long-term vision and unconventional metrics management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:06">[01:04:06]</a>. Archie Abrams, VP of Product and Head of Growth at Shopify, leads an organization of over 600 people across product, design, engineering, data, operations, and growth marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:50">[00:50:50]</a>.

## Scale and Unique Business Model

Shopify accounts for approximately 10% of e-commerce in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>, processing about $235 billion in Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV) globally in 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>, an economy roughly the size of Finland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>. While Shopify charges a subscription, most of its revenue comes from payments tied directly to merchant success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:39:00">[07:39:00]</a>. This means that a few highly successful merchants can make an entire cohort profitable, allowing Shopify to prioritize lowering barriers to entry for entrepreneurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a>.

## Long-Term Vision and Metric Philosophy

Shopify operates with a "hundred-year vision" set by CEO Tobi Lütke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>. This long-term perspective dictates priorities and product roadmaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>, allowing for strategic decisions that may not yield immediate short-term gains but ensure foundational strength for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>.

### Metrics and KPIs
A striking aspect of Shopify's [[shopifys_unique_approach_to_growth_without_kpis | approach to growth]] is the general *absence* of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for core product teams; they are "essentially banned" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>. Instead, decisions are based on "taste and intuition" and building towards the long-term vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>.

> "metrics aren't actually a driver of how you all think at Shopify" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>
> "kpis are basically banned... okrs are banned" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>

This philosophy extends to how teams track success:
*   **Focus on Absolute Numbers:** Teams are incentivized to think about the absolute number of people who complete a journey, rather than local conversion rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>. Optimizing for conversion rates can lead to implicit behaviors that make the preceding step harder, thus reducing the total number of people entering the funnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>.
*   **Churn and Retention:** Unlike most companies that prioritize reducing churn, Shopify's growth team optimizes for churn by making it as easy as possible to get started, understanding that successful merchants will eventually make the business extremely successful through payments and services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:00">[07:10:00]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Experimentation:** Shopify keeps long-term holdouts for every experiment, automatically reviewing their impact one, two, and three years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>.
    *   This long-term monitoring often reveals that short-term lifts in metrics (e.g., first sale, paying shop conversion) may not translate into long-term GMV growth, with 30-40% of experiments showing no sustained incremental lift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.
    *   Conversely, some experiments that initially show neutral short-term effects can have massive long-term impact by identifying and supporting valuable merchant segments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>. This leads to the practice of shipping neutral experiments if there's good intuition about their long-term benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>.
    *   The internal experimentation tool provides automated updates on experiment results at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, fostering accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.
*   **GMV as a North Star:** Shopify primarily focuses on the total GMV (Gross Merchandise Volume) produced by a given cohort of merchants over several years, rather than per-merchant metrics or retention rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. This power-law based metric guides overall business success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.

### Organizational Structure
Shopify's product organization is structured into three major groups, each with different time horizons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>:
1.  **Core Product:** Focuses on building the "hundred-year" right things for commerce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. This team operates without traditional metrics, prioritizing conviction, technical foundation, and product sense over short-term KPIs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>. The *how* (technical architecture) is considered more important than the *what* or *who* by Toby Lütke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>.
2.  **Merchant Services:** Builds tools like payments and shipping, with a shorter to medium-term horizon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>.
3.  **Growth:** Focuses on the end-to-end customer journey, bringing new merchants on and ensuring their success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>.

#### [[building_and_structuring_a_highperforming_growth_team | Growth Team Structure]]
Archie Abrams' growth organization comprises two main groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>:
*   **Growth R&D:** The traditional product, design, engineering, and data teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>. It's further divided into three pillars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>:
    1.  **Growth Product:** Covers the full merchant lifecycle from landing pages, sign-up, onboarding, and monetization (trials, incentives) to engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.
    2.  **Tools (Ad Pillar):** Builds internal tools like the experimentation platform, communication platform, business intelligence tooling, and marketing technology (MarTech) to support both growth and other Shopify teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>.
    3.  **Customer Support:** Uniquely, the customer support group sits within growth. This is to integrate support as part of the merchant journey, from getting started to scaling a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>. They build tooling and experiences to empower support advisors and enhance self-serve options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>.
*   **Growth Marketing:** A more traditional channel setup, including paid acquisition, media buying, affiliate marketing, email, content, and SEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>. This team is focused on driving initial traffic to Shopify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>.

### Collaboration and Dynamics
*   **Founder-Driven "Taste":** With KPIs banned in core product, "taste" drives what's shipped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>. This relies on an "opinionated founder or set of people who are driving what good looks like" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:41">[00:59:41]</a>. Toby Lütke and Glenn, Head of Core Product, hold a high bar for quality and how everything fits together, reviewing every project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>.
*   **Regular Project Reviews:** Every six weeks, R&D group leads (including Toby) review "every single project across the company" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>. Each project requires a video presentation and an "ok2" approval from a group lead like Glenn or Archie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:00">[05:18:00]</a>.
*   **Growth and Core Product Partnership:** Despite different operating models, the growth and core product teams maintain a strong partnership built on respect and trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>. Growth teams are allowed to touch any part of the product, but they must ensure high quality and be prepared to iterate based on long-term outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>.
*   **"No Wizard" Principle:** A specific principle within Shopify's product development is "no wizards" (onboarding carousels or setup flows that simplify the product outside of the actual experience) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>. Instead, the focus is on integrating guidance and personalization directly into the core product experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>.
*   **Integration of Sales Motion:** Shopify has layered a sales motion onto its historically Product-Led Growth (PLG) model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>. This requires [[organizational_dynamics_affecting_strategy | challenging traditional thinking]] and building "hybrid journeys" that allow merchants to choose between self-service and sales assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>. This shift has necessitated rebuilding attribution and LTV models to prevent suboptimal investment decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>.
*   **Embedded Marketing:** Shopify does not have a CMO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. Instead, marketing leads are embedded throughout the organization (growth marketing, revenue marketing, brand team, product marketing, consumer-side marketing) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>. This ensures marketing is closely tied to relevant outcomes, allowing for faster movement with less coordination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. This model relies heavily on the strong intuition of leaders like Toby and President Harley on brand vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>.

## Key Learnings
*   **Monetary Friction:** Lowering monetary friction (e.g., trial dynamics, incentives, pricing) can be highly impactful, often unlocking a class of entrepreneurs who might otherwise give up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>.
*   **Onboarding Personalization:** Nailing sign-up flows, collecting the right information, building trust, and personalizing guidance during onboarding provides enormous and consistent impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>.
*   **Founder's Influence:** The founder's background and deep understanding of a core area (e.g., Toby's engineering focus on architecture) significantly shapes the company's operating model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>.
*   **Accountability:** Companies without metrics-based accountability need an "extremely strong founder or set of folks who have extremely strong opinions on what good is and what taste is" to avoid a "haphazard" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:50">[00:59:50]</a>.

<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a> Shopify is also notable for being one of the few remaining fully remote tech companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>, with current hiring across all functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:12">[01:17:12]</a>.

Shas Doshi, in a live podcast recording at the Lennys' Friend Summit, shared crucial questions he wished he had asked himself earlier in his product management career. These questions address common pain points for product leaders, including being overwhelmed by busyness and frustration, and highlight the critical role of [[developing_and_deploying_a_product_strategy | strategy]] and effective [[decision_making_in_product_management | decision making]] in product leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Why Product Leaders Are So Busy: The Impact of Scope and Lack of Strategy

Product leaders often find themselves constantly stressed and busy, leading to dissatisfaction and even physical ailments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. While many are familiar with productivity tips like maintaining to-do lists, using frameworks (e.g., LNO), and managing calendars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>, these are often insufficient. The primary "immovable force" that overwhelms product leaders is the ever-growing scope of their responsibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. No amount of efficiency can overcome a scope that is too large <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

### The Pitfalls of Annual Planning

Annual planning is a significant example of how scope and ineffective processes contribute to busyness. This process can consume four to six weeks, filled with spreadsheets, meetings, managing dependencies, and stakeholder engagements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. Despite the effort, these plans are often forgotten by the end of February due to unforeseen customer escalations and subsequent revisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>. The common adage, "Plans are useless but planning is everything," is often invoked to justify this time-consuming cycle, but its true meaning is rarely understood or applied effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>.

### The Power of a Real Product Strategy

Shas realized that a real, aligned [[developing_and_deploying_a_product_strategy | product strategy]] can drastically reduce the time spent on planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>. For a major product at Stripe, having a clear and universally aligned [[importance_of_company_mission_and_strategy_in_product_development | product strategy]] allowed him to complete the entire planning process in just three days, in contrast to the weeks peers spent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>.

Having a robust [[developing_and_deploying_a_product_strategy | strategy]] provides a clear framework for:
*   Resolving [[importance_of_Communication_and_Prioritization_for_Product_Managers | prioritization]] problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>.
*   Streamlining planning processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>.
*   Rigorously evaluating customer escalations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>.

## Poor Product Decisions Lead to Busyness

A key reason for persistent busyness is often the lack of good product [[decision_making_in_product_management | decisions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>. Product teams frequently make decisions without thoroughly considering customer motivation, differentiation, or distribution approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>. Instead, [[decision_making_in_product_management | decisions]] are often based on engineer availability rather than strategic impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>.

### The Misconception of "Two-Way Doors"

The concept of "two-way door" [[decision_making_in_product_management | decisions]] – those that are easily reversible – is often misapplied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>. While this concept can be valuable at an executive level, for a typical product leader, most seemingly reversible [[decision_making_in_product_management | decisions]] are in practice "one-way doors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>.

Committing to features without proper diligence leads to:
*   Significant time investment (weeks) for development and ramp-up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:36">[00:20:36]</a>.
*   Pressure to present positive results at business reviews, often relying on anecdotal evidence when adoption is low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:28">[00:21:28]</a>.
*   Subsequent demands to add more "bells and whistles" to meet "table stakes," leading to further commitments and accumulation of technical debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a>.

These rushed [[decision_making_in_product_management | decisions]] create a cycle of accumulating unnecessary work, causing increased busyness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>.

> "Sometimes it is useful to pause for 2 minutes or two days days or two weeks before making that decision because frankly most doors that look like two-way doors are actually one-way doors. They are two-way doors at Bezos's level but as a PM leader for you they are one-way door and that's what's making you busy." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>

## The Importance of "Good Taste" in Product Management

Product leaders often focus on "taste" in terms of user experience and design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:32">[00:29:32]</a>. However, Shas emphasizes a deeper form of taste: the ability to identify what is truly good and impactful, independent of immediate results or external validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:47">[00:31:47]</a>.

### Execution vs. Strategy

Early in his career at Google, Shas was in an environment where "strategy is for MBAs" and "execution is everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:36">[00:26:36]</a>. He adopted this belief until his experience at Twitter post-IPO around 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:44">[00:27:44]</a>. Despite having incredible assets, Twitter was struggling to meet its potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:04">[00:28:04]</a>. Shas realized Twitter's biggest issue was a lack of a real, compelling, cohesive [[developing_and_deploying_a_product_strategy | product strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:26">[00:28:26]</a>.

His time at Stripe further solidified the immense [[importance_of_product_vision_and_strategy_alignment | value and importance of having a clear strategy]] for highly successful products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:10">[00:29:10]</a>.

### Developing Good Taste in Beliefs

"Good taste" in product leadership extends to the beliefs chosen to adopt, which then dictate how one manages, leads, and makes [[decision_making_in_product_management | decisions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:05">[00:30:05]</a>. Shas realized he lacked "good taste" in how he evaluated and chose what to believe, leading to an unconscious adoption of patterns and ideas based on catchy metaphors ("two-way door" vs. "reversible/irreversible [[decision_making_in_product_management | decisions]]") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:06">[00:34:06]</a>, alliterations ("fail fast" vs. "fail quickly") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:11">[00:35:11]</a>, or authority bias (e.g., "Bezos said it") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:53">[00:34:53]</a>.

True "taste" involves shedding these social and authority proofs to evaluate ideas rigorously, independently, and with critical thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:55">[00:36:55]</a>. This shift enables significant growth as a product leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:08">[00:37:08]</a>.

> "Thinking is cheap, so you should do more thinking, not less." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:37">[00:35:37]</a>

By focusing on developing a clear, actionable [[developing_and_deploying_a_product_strategy | product strategy]] and cultivating good "taste" in [[decision_making_in_product_management | decision making]] by thinking rigorously, product leaders can avoid unnecessary busyness and frustration, leading to more impactful and fulfilling work.

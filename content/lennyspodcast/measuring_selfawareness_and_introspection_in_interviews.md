Identifying self-awareness and introspection in candidates is crucial for understanding their capacity for [[role_of_feedback_and_selfassessment_in_pm_development | growth]] and [[candor_and_feedback_in_professional_growth | candor]]. Several interview questions can reveal a candidate's ability to reflect on their experiences, understand their motivations, and acknowledge their limitations.

## Unpacking Success and Challenges

### What do you attribute your success to (and you can't say luck)?
Aika Senft, former Head of Product at Roll, asks this question to gauge a candidate's self-awareness and curiosity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. Humble individuals might default to "luck," so by removing that option, the question prompts deeper [[questions_for_personal_and_career_reflection | reflection]] on personal contributions and understanding of their journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

### Tell me about a time something went wrong.
Paige Castello, Co-Head of Product Management at Asana, uses this question to understand a candidate's mindset when faced with failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>. This includes product failures, team dysfunctions, or any situation where things didn't work out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>. The response reveals how they evaluate situations and perceive themselves when outcomes are negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>.

### Tell me something you did that worked out but not for the reason you thought it would, or tell me something you did that was a good decision that didn't work.
Io Odumala, Chief Product Officer at Carbon Health, asks these questions to assess introspection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>. The goal is to see if candidates are reflective about their decisions, understand the true reasons for success or failure, and incorporate those lessons into their future decision-making processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>.

### Tell me about something you're most proud of.
Katie Dill (Head of Design at Stripe), Kairi Saarinen (CEO of Linear), and Camille Hearst (Product Leader at Spotify) all favor this question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. It helps interviewers understand a candidate's taste, judgment, motivations, and what they consider to be a "good" outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. It reveals what a person values and how they think <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>, as well as their work ethic and what "good" looks like to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.

## Gauging Self-Perception and Growth Potential

### Fast forward three years, what's different about you then?
Ben Williams, former VP Product at Snyk, asks this to identify signals of humility and self-awareness regarding personal and professional growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. He looks for candidates who can openly discuss areas they need to improve or work on to grow as individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>. This links directly to [[questions_for_personal_and_career_reflection | personal and career reflection]].

### What would your siblings say about you?
Melum Quan-Burwitz, Head of Growth at Deel, asks this to understand what candidates think others perceive of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>. A good answer demonstrates sincerity and self-awareness, especially when acknowledging their siblings might tease them or point out less flattering traits. This shows a "humbleness" that is valued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>.

### Tell me about something you've learned about yourself that revealed a limitation in how you work.
Scott Belsky, Chief Strategy Officer at Adobe, uses this question to test introspection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>. It reveals whether a person can be open and reflective when they encounter struggles or limitations, or if they tend to blame others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>.

### Do you consider yourself lucky?
Scott Belsky also likes this question because it can reveal a candidate's comfort level with acknowledging privilege and external factors in their success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>. Those who are comfortable admitting luck demonstrate a certain level of security and humility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>.

## Assessing Authenticity and Independent Thought

### What's something that everyone takes for granted that you think is essentially hogwash or inaccurate?
Nel Singal, VP of Product at Facebook, asks this to break the typical "interview mindset" where candidates try to predict what the interviewer wants to hear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>. This question forces a genuinely [[candor_and_feedback_in_professional_growth | opinionated]] response, revealing authenticity and original thought, which can prevent dismissing high-quality candidates who struggle with conventional interview formats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>.

## Leveraging References for Self-Assessment Insights

### What feedback will I be giving this person in their first performance review?
Paul Adams, Chief Product Officer at Intercom, asks this question during reference calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>. It's a powerful question because it's difficult for a referee to dodge and provides incredibly honest and actionable insights into the candidate's areas for [[role_of_feedback_and_selfassessment_in_pm_development | development]] and [[candor_and_feedback_in_professional_growth | feedback]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:15">[00:20:15]</a>.

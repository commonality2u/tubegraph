Yuki Yamashita, Chief Product Officer at Figma, shares his "love-hate relationship" with OKRs (Objectives and Key Results), stemming from his career focus on core product experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:56">[00:40:56]</a>. He notes that while OKRs are meant to drive [[role_of_okrs_in_strategic_alignment_and_execution | alignment and execution]], teams often face [[challenges_and_pitfalls_in_using_okrs | challenges in goal setting and execution]].

## Initial Challenges with OKRs

When working on core product experiences, Yuki often felt that OKRs were "performative" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:22">[00:41:22]</a>. He identifies two main issues:
1.  **Secondary Metrics**: Teams might create secondary metrics that are measurable but don't genuinely reflect business impact or retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:30">[00:41:30]</a>.
2.  **Ambitious Business Goals**: Alternatively, teams might set ambitious business goals that they don't have full control over, with many indirect factors influencing the outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:02">[00:42:02]</a>. This often leads to an inability to prove that the team's efforts directly moved the top-level metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:33">[00:42:33]</a>.

## Evolution of Goal Setting at Figma

At Figma, Yuki observed that OKRs were initially treated like a "to-do list or a task list," where the focus was on completing tasks by the end of the quarter rather than achieving meaningful impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:54">[00:42:54]</a>. Quarterly OKR review meetings were "dreadful" because it was hard to understand what teams genuinely cared about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:07">[00:43:07]</a>.

### Deprecating OKRs for "Headlines"

Due to these issues, Yuki initially deprecated the formal OKR system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:41">[00:43:41]</a>. Instead, he asked teams to focus on their "headline" â€“ the philosophical objective they were optimizing for, without stressing about immediate measurability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:46">[00:43:46]</a>. This allowed for qualitative and quantitative measures, with a focus on understanding the overarching goal and evolving metrics over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>.

### Reintroducing OKRs and "Commitments"

Figma later reintroduced OKRs with greater rigor, supported by a growing data science team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:49">[00:44:49]</a>. However, a new challenge emerged: teams were not fully committed to moving their OKRs, often treating them as "post-rationalizations" for projects already underway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:09">[00:45:09]</a>. Yuki observed that many engineers couldn't recall their team's OKRs when asked, indicating a disconnect between daily work and stated goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:21">[00:45:21]</a>.

To address this, Figma experimented with the term "commitments" instead of OKRs, hoping to foster a deeper sense of responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:48">[00:45:48]</a>. This approach aimed to formalize the connection between the 'why' (the problem) and the 'what' (the project) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>.

## Philosophies for Effective Goal Setting

Despite ongoing experimentation, Yuki has developed three core philosophies for what makes a "good OKR" or goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:30">[00:46:30]</a>:

*   **Legendary**: The goal should be easily understood and memorable to everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:42">[00:46:42]</a>.
*   **Actionability**: It should inspire action and encourage different approaches to work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:53">[00:46:53]</a>.
*   **Authenticity**: The goal must genuinely reflect the team's daily efforts and intentions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:04">[00:47:04]</a>.

Yuki emphasizes that Figma is still learning and evolving its approach to goal setting, acknowledging that they "haven't quite cracked the code" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:37">[00:47:37]</a>.

> "We are very far from perfect, and I really eager to learn from everyone else as well." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:59">[01:02:59]</a>

This open mindset reflects the belief that "the way we work, the way we run product processes as product managers... is itself very much a work in progress" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:24">[01:02:24]</a>.

## Connecting Goals to Team Motivation

One key aspect of effective goal setting is fostering personal accountability and "bottoms-up energy" within teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:24">[00:39:24]</a>. Yuki observes that engineers are highly motivated to fix problems they personally experience, leading to more efficient and creative solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:50">[00:37:50]</a>. This aligns with his emphasis on product managers owning the "why" behind product decisions, allowing teams to make informed choices even without explicit instructions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>.

Figma's engineering team employs the "five whys" method in post-mortems to uncover root causes, a practice that can also be applied to understanding the underlying reasons for customer problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:15">[00:21:15]</a>.

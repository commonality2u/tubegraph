Measuring engineering productivity is a common and often challenging topic for engineering leaders. The current market environment, characterized by reduced team sizes and a push for efficiency from venture capitalists, has intensified the need to assess and demonstrate engineering effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:39">[04:47:39]</a>.

## Approaches to Measuring Productivity

### Benchmarking
One initial approach is to benchmark spending against industry data. This involves analyzing R&D and engineering spend compared to similar venture-backed companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:06">[04:56:06]</a>.
*   **Pros:** It's a straightforward mechanical exercise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:06">[04:56:06]</a> and can provide a defensible answer to placate boards or investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:06">[04:56:06]</a>.
*   **Cons:** This method is not insightful and doesn't genuinely help in effectively running the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:02">[05:14:02]</a>.

### Qualitative Insights and Engineer Feedback
A more insightful method involves directly engaging with engineers.
*   Engineers generally know if their teams are effective or not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:00">[05:09:00]</a>.
*   They can often explain why things aren't working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a>, providing "crumbs" that experienced leaders can trace to contributing causes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>.
*   **Challenge:** This qualitative understanding is difficult to present to boards or external stakeholders who rely on metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:07">[05:09:07]</a>.

### Aligning with Business and Product Goals
A crucial step is to align engineering evaluation directly with the business and product goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>.
*   Engineering teams should be accountable to product goals, rather than blaming other functions for failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>.
*   The primary purpose of engineering is to support the product and customers, not to build novel systems unless they serve that purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:52">[05:51:52]</a>.
*   **Practical application:** Demonstrate productivity by showing a roadmap of "meaningful meaty things" with impact accomplished in the last six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a>. The ability to populate this list indicates effectiveness; an empty list indicates concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a>.

## Specific Metrics and Frameworks

### DORA Metrics
The book "Accelerate" by Nicole Forsgren, Jean Kim, and Jez Humble (not mentioned in transcript, but common knowledge) introduces four key metrics often used in [[developer_productivity_measurement | software engineering leadership]]:
1.  Lead time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:00">[05:09:00]</a>
2.  Incident remediation time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>
3.  Failure rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>
4.  Frequency of deployments (not explicitly mentioned in this segment but implied from DORA)
*   **Tools:** Many startups offer dashboards to instrument these metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>.
*   **Sponsor Example:** DX, a platform for [[developer_productivity_measurement | measuring and improving developer productivity]], is designed by researchers behind Frameworks such as DORA and SPACE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. It combines qualitative and quantitative insights to provide clarity on developer performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>.

### Warnings about Metrics
*   **Diagnosis vs. Performance:** DORA metrics are excellent for *diagnosis* (e.g., slow deployments indicate areas for improvement) but do not inherently make a company good or bad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>. They don't, for example, dictate whether engineers should be terminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>.
*   **"Fake" Metrics:** Reporting on "Sprint points" to a board is considered "totally fake" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:00">[06:04:00]</a>.
*   **Perfectionism vs. Action:** Experts often focus on why every measure is imperfect, leading to measuring nothing at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>. It's crucial to be comfortable measuring something, even if it's not perfect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41:00">[06:41:00]</a>.
    *   **Educational Opportunity:** Imperfect metrics can serve as a starting point to educate stakeholders about the nuances and underlying data, helping them develop a more sophisticated understanding of engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:00">[06:55:00]</a>.

> [!NOTE] DORA metrics can be a good enough starting place for reporting to executives, even with their known imperfections. The process of addressing questions about these imperfections is an opportunity to educate and increase sophistication in understanding engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>.

## Current Industry Changes
The shift from a "zero-interest rate era" to today's market has significantly impacted engineering.
*   **Hiring vs. Leading:** Engineering managers, who previously spent half their time or more on hiring, now conduct fewer interviews, shifting their focus to leading teams, delving deeper into details, and determining optimal team sizing and allocation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>.
*   **Accountability:** There's a return to treating engineers as peers and holding them accountable, rather than "coddling" or "sheltering" them from real problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:57:00">[06:57:00]</a>. This shift allows engineers to be placed in more senior leadership roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:02:00">[07:02:00]</a>.
*   **Team Dynamics:** Teams are now disappearing, being cut down, or consolidated, a stark contrast to the growth-focused environment of the past decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>.

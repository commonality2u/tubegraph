This article synthesizes insights from experienced product leaders on the types of questions they ask and what they look for in strong answers, providing valuable guidance for candidates preparing for interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Understanding Interviewer Intent

Effective interview preparation involves understanding the underlying motivations behind an interviewer's questions. By recognizing what interviewers are trying to uncover, candidates can better tailor their responses to demonstrate desirable qualities.

### Assessing Self-Awareness and Curiosity

A common question asked by product leaders, like Aka demano (former Head of Product at Roll), is: "To what do you attribute your success, and you can't say luck?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a> This question aims to gauge a candidate's self-awareness and curiosity, looking for individuals who have reflected on their journey and the reasons for their current position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

### Evaluating Resilience and Problem-Solving

Jeff Charles (Head of Product at Ramp) asks, "What's the hardest thing you've ever done?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a> This question seeks to understand a candidate's definition of "hard," how they overcame difficulties, how they collaborated with others, and their level of agency in resolving challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. Similarly, Paige Castello (Co-Head of Product Management at Asana) asks, "Tell me about a time something went wrong" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a> to evaluate a candidate's mindset and ability to evaluate situations when things aren't working well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>.

### Uncovering Foundational Thinking and Prioritization

Shashir Marocha (CEO and Co-founder of Coda) uses a unique thought experiment: presented with a teleportation device to bring to market, what would you do? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a> The key twist is that the scientists will only answer two questions before expecting a plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. This tests a candidate's ability to identify critical, impactful questions, revealing their capacity for simplification and strategic thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

> [!TIP]
> When faced with open-ended or hypothetical scenarios, identify the one or two "irreducible questions" that would provide the most critical information to formulate a plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. For example, regarding the teleportation device, essential questions could be "Is it safe enough for humans?" and "Is it more expensive to buy them or to run them?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

### Demonstrating Storytelling and Persuasion

Yuki Yamashita (Chief Product Officer at Figma) often asks candidates to "describe a time when you're part of a controversial product decision" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. Interviewers look for the ability to set up the conflict, understand its importance, represent both sides, and maintain an even-keeled perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. Another approach is to ask about a big problem they worked on, with the interviewer assessing if the candidate's storytelling compels them to want to work on that problem themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. This highlights the importance of [[conversational_public_speaking_techniques | storytelling]] and communication skills for product roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

## Highlighting Accomplishments and Values

Several product leaders, including Katie Dill (Head of Design at Stripe), Ki sarin (CEO of Linear), and Camille Hurst (Product Leader at Spotify), favor the question: "Tell me what work you are most proud of" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.

This question helps interviewers understand:
-   A candidate's taste and judgment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.
-   What motivates them and what they consider a good outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.
-   What they like to do and where their "gravity pulls them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.
-   Their values and how they think about things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.
-   Their motivations, work ethic, and what "good" looks like to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> Candidates should be prepared to discuss accomplishments they are genuinely proud of, explaining the process and the reasons for their pride <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.

Lauren isord (Head of Growth at Notion) similarly asks, "Tell me about a time that you delivered something that was impactful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>, looking for how candidates define impact and whether they have an intrinsic motivation for business impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>.

## Navigating Ambiguity and Introspection

### Structuring Ambiguity
J-Z (Head of Product at Webflow) focuses on how candidates navigate ambiguous situations, which is a significant part of a Product Manager's role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. Good answers involve putting structure and a path forward through ambiguity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>, seeking inputs, and defining milestones to assess progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.

### Reflective Thinking
IO Omalo (Chief Product Officer at Carbon Health) asks, "Tell me something you did that worked out but not for the reason that you thought it would work or tell me something you did that was a good decision that didn't work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>. This question aims to gauge a candidate's introspection and their ability to reflect on decisions, learn from outcomes, and incorporate those learnings into future approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>.

Scott Belsky (Chief Strategy Officer at Adobe) likes to ask about something people have learned about themselves that reveals a limitation in how they work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>. This tests introspection and whether they can be open about struggles rather than blaming others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>.

## Revealing Authenticity and Personal Growth

### Breaking Conventional Wisdom
Nel Singal (VP of Product at Facebook) asks, "What's something that everyone takes for granted that you think is essentially hogwash or inaccurate?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a> This question is designed to break the typical "interview mindset" where candidates try to predict what the interviewer wants to hear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>. It requires genuine, opinionated responses, assessing authenticity and original thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>.

### Humility and Self-Awareness
Ben Williams (former VP Product at Snyk) asks, "Fast forward three years, what's different about you?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a> While many might default to discussing future roles or titles, the interviewer is looking for signals of humility and self-awareness regarding areas of personal and professional growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. Candidates who are open about areas they need to work on to grow themselves are highly valued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.

Melum Quan Burwitz (Head of Growth at Deal) asks, "What would your siblings say about you?" (or parents if no siblings) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>. This question seeks sincerity and self-awareness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>, looking for candidates who acknowledge potential humorous or critical perspectives from those who know them best, rather than giving a perfectly curated answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>.

### Alignment of Values
Candidates themselves can use strategic questions to evaluate a potential employer. A powerful question a candidate can ask is, "Tell me about the diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging initiatives that you've recently personally been involved with" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>. This allows the candidate to test the alignment of their personal values with those of the interviewer and the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>.

## Preparing for Reference Calls

Once a candidate has successfully navigated the interview process and is being considered for an offer, reference calls become a critical step. Paul Adams (Chief Product Officer at Intercom) recommends asking referees: "What feedback will I be giving this person in their first performance review?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a> This question makes it difficult for referees to avoid providing honest, specific feedback, revealing valuable insights that might not emerge from standard questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>.

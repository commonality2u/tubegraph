Notion's journey from its inception in 2013 to becoming a globally recognized product offers insights into the balance between a grand vision and market realities when [[Developing and communicating a product vision | developing and communicating a product vision]].

## The "Lost Years" and a Pivotal Realization

In its early years, Notion spent three to four years, described as "the Lost Years," trying different versions of its product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. The initial vision was to enable "everybody [to] make and create their software" by building an easy-to-use developer tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

However, after a couple of years of trying this approach, the team learned that "most people just don't care" about creating software directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This led to a crucial realization:
> "Let's hide our vision which is everybody can create their software in the form factor that people do care" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

This shift meant focusing on what people use every day: "productivity software" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. It took Notion two years to pivot to building a productivity tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

### The "Sugar and Broccoli" Metaphor

Co-founder and CEO Ivan Xiao describes this strategic pivot using the metaphor of "sugar called the broccoli" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>:
> "People don't want to eat the broccoli but people like sugar so give them the sugar that highy your brocc inside of it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

The "broccoli" represents the core vision of empowering everyone to create software, while the "sugar" is the easily digestible form of a productivity suite that users readily adopt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. This approach allowed Notion's underlying "no code developer power" to be discovered as users delved deeper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.

This early period also involved rebuilding the product many times, including restarting the codebase due to building on a wrong technical foundation (Web Components instead of React) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>.

## Balancing Vision with Business Realities

[[Building Web Products with AI Tools | Building a product]] or business requires a delicate balance between the founder's personal values and aesthetics, and the need for users and revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.
*   **Too much self-focus:** Leads to an "art project" or "research project" with no users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
*   **Too much business-focus:** Results in building a "commodity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

Ivan emphasizes that [[Developing and communicating a product vision | building for value]]—creating something authentic to oneself that is also useful for others—provides a more durable and fulfilling energy source for long-term endeavors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:59">[00:20:59]</a>.

## Tools as Extensions of Human Potential

Notion is seen as more than just a productivity tool; it embodies a "philosophy of how to work and be" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. This perspective is deeply philosophical:
> "Tools are extensions of us and once they extend us once we shape them once we bring them to to World they can come back to shape us" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:09">[01:03:09]</a>.

This idea is influenced by early computing pioneers like Douglas Engelbart and Alan Kay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. Engelbart's original paper, "Augmenting Human Intellect," highlighted the highest leverage in software making: giving people the ability to use computing to augment their problem-solving ability or intellect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

Notion strives to amplify human creativity and beauty through software, believing these are inherent human natures worth extending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:41">[01:04:41]</a>. This aligns with the company's internal philosophy of "craft and values," where craft involves applying technical know-how and taste to make clever tradeoffs to create something new and useful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:41">[00:37:41]</a>.

## [[Building and scaling AIenabled tools | Horizontal Product Development]] and the Role of AI

Notion's goal has always been to [[Building and scaling AIenabled tools | build a meta tool]], a "Lego for software" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:04">[00:52:04]</a>, which inherently means creating a horizontal platform.
*   **Lego Bricks vs. Lego Boxes:** While the core product offers "Lego bricks" (fundamental building blocks like relational databases), the market often demands "Lego boxes" (ready-made solutions for specific use cases) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:28">[00:52:28]</a>. This requires shifting the mindset, especially for enterprise customers, to provide specific "solutions" that address their business needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:47">[00:52:47]</a>.
*   **Go-to-Market Strategy:** While vertical software naturally has a clear market, horizontal products need to create their own "wall" to define their go-to-market strategy and messaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:50">[00:53:50]</a>.
*   **Initial Use Case:** Notion stumbled upon document and notes as a key entry point, providing a large "top of funnel" for growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:49">[00:56:49]</a>. This B2C2B strategy meant personal users adopting Notion for simple tasks like note-taking and document sharing, then bringing it to their workplaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:03">[00:57:03]</a>.

### AI's Impact on Horizontal Tools

The advent of large language models (LLMs) has been a "gift" for building tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:19">[00:58:19]</a>. AI is particularly good with bundled offerings and horizontal tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:02">[00:59:02]</a> because it excels at reasoning, understanding, and searching information when it's all in one place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:49">[00:58:49]</a>.

This has opened new opportunities for Notion:
1.  **AI Writer:** Integrating AI writing capabilities into existing daily work surfaces like writing and task management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:40">[00:58:40]</a>.
2.  **AI Q&A/Connectors:** Leveraging AI to answer questions based on information within Notion and through external connectors (e.g., Jira, Zendesk) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:10">[00:59:10]</a>.
3.  **AI for Assembly:** The most fascinating aspect is AI's ability to piece things together. As Notion has built "Lego blocks for knowledge work" over years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:08">[01:00:08]</a>, an AI coding agent on top could create "any kind of knowledge customer software customer agent" for various vertical use cases <a class="yt="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:14">[01:00:14]</a>. This addresses a historical weakness of Lego-like systems: the difficulty for non-builders to piece things together from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:42">[00:59:42]</a>.

## The Cycle of Bundling and Unbundling

The market constantly shifts between bundling and unbundling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:49">[01:00:49]</a>.
*   **Early Computing:** An unbundling phase with many applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:42">[01:01:42]</a>.
*   **Microsoft Era:** Microsoft bundled everything into one suite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>.
*   **SaaS Era:** Unbundling happened again with many vertical SaaS solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:05">[01:02:05]</a>.
*   **Current Trend:** With AI and macro-economic factors, the market is shifting back towards a bundling approach, where more value can be created through integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:20">[01:02:20]</a>.

Understanding this cyclical trend helps determine whether a solution should be vertical or horizontal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:40">[01:02:40]</a>.

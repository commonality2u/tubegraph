Many companies face the strategic decision of whether to prioritize [[productled_growth_strategy | product-led growth]] or sales-led approaches. Elena Verna, an expert in growth strategy, emphasizes that these two models are not mutually exclusive but rather sequential and complementary, forming a "layering game" where companies introduce one and then build the next on top to amplify existing growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The most successful companies execute both correctly and together, avoiding the mistake of viewing them as an "either/or" decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:58">[00:27:58]</a>.

## Defining the Approaches

### What is Product-Led Sales?
[[Productled sales strategy | Product-led sales]] is defined as a growth model where a company leverages product usage to generate leads for sales, essentially putting pressure on the product to create pipelines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>. It specifically banks on "hand raisers" and product qualification criteria that lead to an Enterprise-level contract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>.

According to Elena Verna, [[productled_sales_strategy | product-led sales]] focuses on:
*   **User Value:** Driving expansion through the value users derive from the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:16">[00:37:16]</a>.
*   **Cost of Acquisition:** Offering an "incredible cost of acquisition" because it's based on acquiring a user, which is significantly cheaper than acquiring a buyer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:22">[00:37:22]</a>.
*   **Pipeline Creation:** Generating pipeline based on product usage, rather than traditional marketing qualified leads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:29">[00:37:29]</a>.

### What is Traditional (Sales-Led) Sales?
In contrast, the traditional sales-led model typically starts with a marketing qualified lead or prospecting and outbound efforts to find a buyer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:05">[00:41:05]</a>. This often involves many demos and extensive "wine and dining" to convince a buyer to purchase the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:14">[00:41:14]</a>. Sales often aims to sell as much as possible upfront to the entire organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:25">[00:41:25]</a>.

## The User Journey and Sales Involvement

### Product-Led Sales Journey
The journey for [[productled_sales_strategy | product-led sales]] begins with acquisition and some form of self-serve usage, which can be through a freemium model or self-serve monetization, without any human involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:09">[00:39:09]</a>.

On top of this usage, companies develop the ability to understand how closely users are approaching a point where the entire enterprise could benefit from the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:30">[00:39:30]</a>. This often involves identifying "network effects" within the organization's user base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:41">[00:39:41]</a>. Companies then score users based on volume, velocity, breadth of feature use, behavioral tactics, or demographics to determine the probability of successfully selling to the entire organization based on existing usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:02">[00:40:02]</a>.

Sales then gets involved in two main ways:
1.  **Hand-Raisers:** Creating organic hand-raisers by pushing levers to drive usage and generate sales leads via form completion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:28">[00:40:28]</a>.
2.  **Outbound:** Identifying users who act like hand-raisers but haven't formally "raised their hand," then outbound prospecting to find an Enterprise buyer or get an introduction through the user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:44">[00:40:44]</a>.

In [[productled_sales_strategy | product-led sales]], the product itself serves as the sales enablement material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>.

### Traditional Sales Journey
In contrast, traditional sales begins with finding a buyer through marketing qualified leads or prospecting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:05">[00:41:05]</a>. Sales teams conduct many demos and nurturing activities to persuade the buyer to purchase the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:12">[00:41:12]</a>. Often, usage only occurs after the purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:18">[00:41:18]</a>. This can lead to "utilization issues" because the product is sold for the entire organization before widespread adoption, requiring ongoing effort to justify the initial large cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:22">[00:41:22]</a>.

## Key Differences and the Future

Elena Verna predicts that [[productled_sales_strategy | product-led sales]] will "box out" traditional top-down sales organizations in the next decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:52">[00:36:52]</a>. The reason is that [[productled_sales_strategy | product-led sales]] empowers users to become sales agents, shifting sales pressure onto the product and its users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:15">[00:38:15]</a>. This means Enterprise buyers are increasingly "boxed out" of the decision-making process, as the decision-making power has shifted to the user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:27">[00:38:27]</a>.

Companies starting with a sales-led acquisition model should not abandon it when looking to add a [[productled_growth_strategy | product-led growth]] motion. Instead, they should "hunker down" on their existing sales-led strategy and overlay a [[productled_growth_strategy | product-led]] approach to amplify existing growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:48">[00:27:48]</a>.

## Common Pitfalls

A common [[common_pitfalls_in_productled_sales | pitfall]] for companies that start with a [[productled_growth_strategy | product-led growth]] model is that they become addicted to large average contract values (ACVs) from early Enterprise deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:15">[00:29:15]</a>. This often leads them to double down on hiring more salespeople and investing in Enterprise marketing, neglecting their product usage growth and [[productled_growth_strategy | product-led]] tactics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:25">[00:30:25]</a>.

This strategy leads to a slowdown because only about 30% or less of buyers are already within the product's user base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:01">[00:30:01]</a>. When companies let go of their [[productled_growth_strategy | product-led]] initiatives, the sales-led inbound that relied on usage starts to dry up, leading to a massive slowdown in Enterprise pipeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:38">[00:31:38]</a>.

### Avoiding the Downfall
To prevent the downfall of [[productled_growth_strategy | product-led growth]] being "crushed" by sales:
*   **Don't Compare ACVs:** Recognize that the average contract value in a [[productled_growth_strategy | product-led growth]] or self-serve model is likely lower because you're entering the account much earlier than with a sales top-down approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:17">[00:35:17]</a>. [[productled_sales_strategy | Product-led sales]] is an expansion game, not about landing the largest deal from the beginning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:49">[00:35:49]</a>.
*   **Focus on User Delight:** Avoid over-correcting your product roadmap to focus exclusively on Enterprise features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:02">[00:36:02]</a>. Continuously innovate and delight users so they remain the primary selling agents within their organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:17">[00:36:17]</a>. Building solely for Enterprise buyers signals a shift away from the roots of [[productled_growth_strategy | product-led growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:27">[00:36:27]</a>.
*   **Recognize Signs of Slowness:** Be vigilant for signs of slowing growth and avoid pushing only sales and marketing to fix the problem if the origin of growth was [[productled_growth_strategy | product-led]] adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:49">[00:34:49]</a>.

The strategic reason for having a [[productled_growth_strategy | freemium]] model must be clear, whether it's for indirect monetization, serving a specific segment, or collecting data for future product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:59">[00:49:59]</a>. Anything that creates friction for the growth model should be gated in the paid offering, while anything that promotes the growth model should be part of the free offering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:09">[00:51:09]</a>.

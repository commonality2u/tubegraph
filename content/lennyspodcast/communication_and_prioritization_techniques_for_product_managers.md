Lenny's podcast welcomed Ian McAllister, author of a classic post on what separates a top 1% Product Manager (PM) from a top 10% PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Ian, who has managed over 100 [[Role of Product Managers | product managers]] and spent 12 years at Amazon, shared insights on [[improving_product_management_skills | product management skills]] and the "working backwards" process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Core Skills for [[Tips for new and senior product managers | New Product Managers]]

For [[Tips for new and senior product managers | new PMs]], three skills are foundational: communicate, prioritize, and execute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>. These are the core building blocks for any stage in a [[Role of Product Managers | product career]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>.

### Communication

Being a better communicator is a continuous effort throughout a [[Role of Product Managers | product career]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>.
Early experiences at Microsoft and Amazon highlighted the importance of clear communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>:
*   **Answer First, Then Explain:** Instead of rambling or providing background, answer the question directly, then elaborate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>. Sometimes, just answering and shutting up is effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>.
*   **Use Numbers:** Employ data to answer questions effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>.
*   **Own Your Problems:** Take responsibility for issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>.
*   **Continuous Improvement:** Reflect after interactions (meetings, emails, elevator conversations) on how communication could have been better, and apply those lessons next time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>. Ask your manager for feedback on your communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:58">[00:22:58]</a>.
*   **"The Operator's Manual":** Ian developed this guide, originally called "The Book of Kim" (after his manager Kim Rackmuller), to capture best practices and avoid common communication pitfalls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>.

### Prioritization

Prioritization is considered the number one key tool of a [[Role of Product Managers | product manager]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>. It extends beyond just selecting the next project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>:
*   **Dimensions of Prioritization:** Includes choosing themes for a roadmap, projects within a theme, sequencing projects, and determining how much of a project to build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>.
*   **[[Effective Time Management for Product Managers | Time Management]]:** What one chooses to spend time on is also a function of prioritization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>.
*   **Impact Multiplier:** A PM with strong innate prioritization skills can generate five times the impact of someone without it, even with the same skill, intelligence, and resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>.
*   **Amazon Fit:** Ian's early success at Amazon was attributed to his hunger for impact and ability to prioritize projects with the greatest leverage, aligning with Amazon's "working backwards" approach from a fitness function or metric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:19:00]</a>.

### Execution

Execution is crucial for every [[Role of Product Managers | PM]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>. It involves shaping what needs to be built into a simple, compact package with the highest possible impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>. A PM has ownership in ensuring the team (designers, data scientists, engineers) is performing well, resourced properly, and continuously improving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>. PMs are the "motive power" behind execution and impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>.

## Advanced Skills for [[Tips for new and senior product managers | Senior Product Managers]]

For [[Tips for new and senior product managers | senior PMs]], while communication remains critical, other attributes become increasingly important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:16">[00:23:16]</a>.

### Think Big

Senior PMs should always be "hunting for bigger elephants" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:25">[00:23:25]</a>. This means constantly asking if an idea, solution, or problem being solved could be bigger and more impactful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a>.

Thinking big involves taking a wider view of what product success entails, beyond just typical product scope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:51">[00:30:51]</a>. It means understanding that one "owns it until you find somebody else to own it," identifying constraints or barriers to product success, and actively removing them, regardless of their origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:10">[00:31:10]</a>. This aligns with the advice to "think like an owner" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:45">[00:31:45]</a>.

### Earn Trust

Trust is the "currency of a product manager and a [[Role of Product Managers | product leader]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:09">[00:32:09]</a>. It is built by repeatedly setting and meeting expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:38">[00:24:38]</a>:
*   **Predictability:** Consistently hitting goals, forecasting, and delivering what was promised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>.
*   **Honesty:** Always telling the truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>.
*   **Accountability:** Owning mistakes and not repeating them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a>.
*   **Alignment:** Understanding the goals of other individuals and organizations and actively seeking alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:57">[00:33:57]</a>. Being willing to forge alliances, rather than being bullheaded, leads to greater success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:10">[00:34:10]</a>.

!!!info Example: Airbnb
Ian reflected on an experience at Airbnb where he focused heavily on building out the customer support technology platform to improve efficiency and reduce costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:40">[00:34:40]</a>. While the team accomplished amazing things, he felt he hadn't spent enough time truly partnering with the customer support leadership team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:30">[00:35:30]</a>. The learning was that even with the "right product" and "right strategy," if the necessary support and relationships aren't built, it may not land as intended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:24">[00:36:24]</a>.

### Driven by Impact, Not Promotion

The ultimate goal for a [[Role of Product Managers | PM]] should be to wake up every day focused on having the biggest impact possible for the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:53">[00:25:53]</a>. This focus naturally leads to growth and promotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:32">[00:26:32]</a>. For [[Tips for new and senior product managers | senior PMs]], the expectation shifts from just shipping features to sensing out opportunities for bigger impact and influencing roadmaps and prioritization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:26">[00:27:26]</a>. This impact-driven mindset fuels a "flywheel of [[Role of Product Managers | product leadership]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:07">[00:28:07]</a>.

## Amazon's "Working Backwards" Process

Ian spent 12 years at Amazon, a company where people tend to stay for long periods due to its structured thinking, focus on metrics, and continuous learning environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">[00:37:37]</a>.

### What is "Working Backwards"?

"Working backwards" is fundamentally about starting and obsessing with the **problem** you're trying to solve for the customer, and being guided by it to develop the solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:11">[00:47:11]</a>.

### Common Mistakes in Implementation

Teams often implement "working backwards" incorrectly by starting with a solution they want to build and then retrofitting a problem to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:22">[00:47:22]</a>. This is evident when discussions revolve around combining existing technologies or services ("we could put them together and make a meal out of it") rather than a compelling customer problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:33">[00:57:33]</a>.

### Mechanism vs. Core Concept

The "press release and FAQ" (Frequently Asked Questions) is a **mechanism** Amazon uses to enforce the "working backwards" principle, not the core concept itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:40">[00:50:40]</a>. While useful as a template for teams learning the process, the key is the underlying mindset of starting with the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:15">[00:51:15]</a>.

The press release typically includes a problem paragraph, followed by the solution, a customer quote, and then the FAQ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:56">[00:50:56]</a>. Jeff Bezos famously taught Ian that if a press release "doesn't have a problem paragraph, there's not really a problem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:01">[00:42:01]</a>.

### "Legitimate Plan to Succeed" (The FACT)

The FAQ component, also known as the "FACT" (Frequently Asked Questions/Committed-to-Action Timeline), ensures there's a legitimate plan for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:51">[00:55:51]</a>. According to Jeff Bezos, when investing in something new, three criteria must be met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:05">[00:56:05]</a>:
1.  Is it a big idea? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:10">[00:56:10]</a>
2.  Is it something we (the company) should be doing? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:12">[00:56:12]</a>
3.  Is there a legitimate plan to succeed? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:25">[00:56:25]</a>

The FACT section helps test the internal components, finances, technical hurdles, and other considerations early on, building trust that the idea deserves resources to move forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:40">[00:56:40]</a>.

### Operational Rigor and Continuous Improvement

Jeff Wilkie, Amazon's former SVP for worldwide Discovery, instilled an "operator" mindset and continuous improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:30">[00:42:30]</a>. The weekly Business Review (WBR) meetings, led by Wilkie, involved reviewing metrics for different business areas, probing leaders on variances and trends, and driving accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>. This mechanism cascaded through the organization, teaching leaders to understand their business deeply and enabling a culture of continuous improvement, which is vital for [[effective_product_management_strategies | product management strategies]] beyond just building new features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:31">[00:44:31]</a>.

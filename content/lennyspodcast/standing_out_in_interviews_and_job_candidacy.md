Ethan Evans, a former Vice President at Amazon and executive coach, provides insights on how to stand out as a candidate during the [[interviewing_techniques_for_product_management | interview process]] and throughout one's career journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:08">[01:35:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:10">[01:36:10]</a>. He emphasizes the importance of demonstrating impact, enthusiasm, and proactivity.

## Key Factors in Interviews

According to Ethan Evans, backed by evidence, the top two factors in any interview are:
*   **Appearance** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:37">[00:36:37]</a>: Candidates should look interested in the job, not appear in pajamas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:40">[00:36:40]</a>.
*   **Enthusiasm** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:39">[00:36:39]</a>: People want to work with those who want to work with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:51">[00:36:51]</a>. Appearing judgmental or requiring sales pitches will turn off interviewers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:56">[00:36:56]</a>. Candidates should express excitement about the opportunity and demonstrate knowledge of the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:11">[00:37:11]</a>.

### Beyond Cosmetics: Demonstrating Impact
The biggest factor beyond appearance and enthusiasm, especially at higher levels, is discussing impact rather than just tasks performed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:21">[00:37:21]</a>.
*   **Focus on Impact** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:27">[00:37:27]</a>: Leaders hire to solve problems or fulfill needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:34">[00:37:34]</a>. Candidates should highlight what they've done that made a difference and helped past employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:42">[00:37:42]</a>.
*   **Show Leadership (Impact)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:51">[00:37:51]</a>: Doing work makes you a worker, but having an impact makes you a leader, demonstrating a higher level of contribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:54">[00:37:54]</a>. This includes solving big problems and changing company or customer outlook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:05">[00:38:05]</a>.
*   **Business Understanding** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:11">[00:38:11]</a>: Interviewers look for candidates who understand the business and have contributed positively to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:14">[00:38:14]</a>.

### Virtual Interview Tips
For virtual interviews, which are increasingly common, candidates should:
*   **Show Dedication** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:33">[00:38:33]</a>: Avoid taking interviews from a car or having the camera off, unless absolutely necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:39">[00:38:39]</a>.
*   **Project Presence** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:43">[00:38:43]</a>: Eye contact, body language, and gestures are still important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:43">[00:38:43]</a>. Be fully present and project excitement and appreciation for the opportunity through the camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:54">[00:38:54]</a>.
*   **Prioritize Well-being** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:06">[00:39:06]</a>: A good night's sleep and coffee can be beneficial for being fully engaged and energetic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:08">[00:39:08]</a>. Don't over-obsess with content; how you come across is very valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:20">[00:39:20]</a>.

## The Magic Loop: A Framework for Career Growth and Visibility

Ethan Evans' "Magic Loop" is a five-step process that can help individuals grow their [[career_development_and_growth_strategies | career]] in almost any circumstance, including those with challenging managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. This framework, though primarily for career growth, inherently helps individuals stand out by demonstrating initiative, helpfulness, and strategic alignment, making them more attractive candidates for internal promotions or external opportunities.

The "Magic Loop" steps are:
1.  **Do your current job well** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>: You must be performing at a solid level, ensuring your boss doesn't wish you were different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. This requires talking to your manager to address any problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
2.  **Ask your boss how you can help** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>: Very few people do this, setting you apart and building a collaborative relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.
3.  **Do what they ask** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>: Fulfill the requests, even if the work isn't your favorite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.
4.  **Connect their needs to your goals** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>: Return to your manager and ask if there's a way you can help them that would also help you reach your goals (e.g., changing roles, getting a raise, learning a new skill) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. Managers help those who help them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. This step requires clarity on your own goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.
5.  **Repeat** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>: Continuously engage with your manager to work towards your goals while helping them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.

The "Magic Loop" is effective because it's rare for managers to be offered help, and having an ally is a huge relief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>. It leverages the human nature of reciprocity ("you help me, I'll help you") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>. Many employee-manager relationships are oppositional, but this framework fosters partnership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>. This process also implicitly forces the identification of gaps needed for advancement and encourages sharing personal career goals with the manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:54">[00:20:54]</a>.

## Navigating Career Setbacks and Mistakes

Even significant failures can be overcome with the right approach. Ethan Evans shares a personal story of failing on an important project for Jeff Bezos, Amazon's CEO at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:14">[00:41:14]</a>.

### Lessons from Failure
When facing a major professional setback:
1.  **Own the mistake** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:28">[00:44:28]</a>: Immediately admit it's not working and take responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:32">[00:44:32]</a>.
2.  **Proactive communication** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:39">[00:44:39]</a>: Provide frequent, detailed updates on the situation, the plan, and expected next steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:45">[00:44:45]</a>. This rebuilds trust and prevents micromanagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:12">[00:51:12]</a>.
3.  **Work hard to fix the problem** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:55">[00:51:55]</a>: Pull out all stops, even if it's uncomfortable, to recover from the mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:12">[00:52:12]</a>. This demonstrates ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:36">[00:52:36]</a>.
4.  **Face the challenge in person** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:56">[00:47:56]</a>: Confronting difficult conversations face-to-face makes it harder for others to remain angry compared to email exchanges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:13">[00:49:13]</a>.
5.  **Persevere** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:06">[00:53:06]</a>: Don't quit or let shame paralyze you. Everyone makes mistakes, and it's possible to recover and even thrive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:11">[00:53:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:51">[00:55:51]</a>.
6.  **Learn from the mistake** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:35">[00:56:35]</a>: Reflect on what went wrong and adjust your approach. For example, prioritizing reliability over a surprise launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:19">[00:58:19]</a>.
7.  **Support your team** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:26">[00:59:26]</a>: Be there for team members who might feel undue responsibility for mistakes, even if no one is explicitly blaming them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:14">[01:00:14]</a>.

## Amazon Leadership Principles: Qualities of Strong Candidates

Ethan Evans contributed to drafting one of Amazon's 14 core leadership principles: **Ownership** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:02">[01:01:02]</a>. The key phrase he proposed for this principle is "an owner never says that's not my job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:27">[01:02:27]</a>. This reflects a proactive mindset where individuals take responsibility beyond their immediate duties.

Another crucial principle is **Bias for Action**, which emphasizes that speed matters in business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:30">[01:03:30]</a>. Many decisions are reversible, making it important to move fast and be decisive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:36">[01:03:36]</a>. In competitive environments, being quick is necessary, as early bets can lead to success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:48">[01:03:48]</a>. This principle needs to be balanced, as excessive speed can lead to errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:16">[01:04:16]</a>.

These principles highlight traits that make a candidate stand out: taking full responsibility, being proactive, acting with appropriate urgency, and contributing beyond their defined role.

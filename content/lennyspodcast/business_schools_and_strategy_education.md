Many individuals struggle with [[importance_of_strategy_and_decision_making_in_product_management | strategy]] due to educational shortcomings and the nature of the task itself. [[challenges_and_misconceptions_in_strategic_thinking | Strategy]] is intellectually challenging and emotionally intimidating, as it involves making choices to do some things and not others, leading to accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Current State of Strategy Education

The quality of strategy education in business schools "generally sucks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Educationally, people are often unprepared, and this lack of preparation extends to their experiences within companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. The academic field of strategy, known as the "strategy academy," has veered onto a "crazy theoretical bent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

### The Resource-Based View of the Firm

A significant issue is the pervasive adoption of the "Resource-Based View of the Firm" (RBV) within business schools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. This theory, considered "silly and nobody uses it out in the world," posits that strategy is primarily about building resources, assuming that if resources are built, success will follow ("if you build it they will come") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

Critics argue that RBV is problematic because:
*   It "begs the question" of which resources to invest in building, and is "silent on that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.
*   It is considered a "dumb Theory" that offers nothing useful regarding resource investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.
*   Academics adopted it partly out of jealousy of Michael Porter, caricaturing his "positioning school" as merely finding attractive market positions to exploit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.
*   Practical application is rare; analysis methods like VRIN or VRIO are met with "eye-rolls" and are seldom used in the business world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.

Despite its perceived limitations, the RBV holds significant sway in academia. In most leading business schools, teaching alternative or integrated approaches to strategy is "illegal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>. A former Dean and professor of strategy, Roger Martin, recounted being unable to teach his own approach for credit at his business school, even as the "most powerful person," because departments maintain "100% control" over curriculum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>. He noted that securing a job at many top business schools requires an "enthusiastic yes" to the Resource-Based View of the Firm, effectively a "loyalty test" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.

## An Integrated Approach to Strategy

Roger Martin's "strategy choice cascade" offers an integrated set of choices designed to compel desired customer action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>. This framework addresses five key questions:
1.  **What's your winning aspiration?** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>
2.  **Where to play?** (On what playing field/battlefield will you compete?) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:09">[00:22:09]</a>
3.  **How can you win?** (Either by creating better customer value or being lower cost than competitors) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:28">[00:22:28]</a>
4.  **What capabilities do you have to have that your competitors don't?** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>
5.  **What enabling management systems have to be put in place?** (To build and maintain those capabilities) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:51">[00:22:51]</a>

The truth about [[elements_of_a_successful_strategy | strategy]] is that it's "both and" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a> â€“ it involves both "where you play" (positioning) and your "capabilities," and these must be linked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.

## Becoming a Strategist

Roger Martin emphasizes that there is no "mythical beast called a great natural strategist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:17">[01:19:17]</a>. Great strategists share one common trait: they "just practice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:26">[01:20:26]</a>. For instance, A.G. Lafley, often considered a strategy genius, had been [[becoming_more_strategic | practicing strategy]] for decades before becoming CEO of Procter & Gamble, giving him "more reps" than almost anyone else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:32">[01:19:32]</a>.

Instead of aiming for "perfection," individuals should focus on "betterment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:15">[01:16:15]</a>. This means identifying the "single most painful gap" between current and desired outcomes, and then making different choices to solve that problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:32">[01:15:32]</a>. By continually working on closing these "gaps," they will progressively get smaller, leading to continuous improvement and strategic prowess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:20">[01:16:20]</a>.

The advice for aspiring strategists is:
*   Be encouraged, not discouraged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:04">[01:21:04]</a>.
*   The "worst thing to do is to wait" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:08">[01:21:08]</a>.
*   "Nobody sets that ever amounts to anything" by saying they'll get to strategy later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:17">[01:21:17]</a>.

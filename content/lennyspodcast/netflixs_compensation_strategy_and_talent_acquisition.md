Netflix's approach to compensation and talent acquisition is deeply rooted in its unique organizational philosophy, which prioritizes a [[netflixs_culture_of_high_talent_density_and_excellence | high talent density]]. This core belief, established by founder Reed Hastings, aims to create a workplace where individuals thrive and achieve excellence in their outcomes, leading to a strong sense of fulfillment [00:00:26, 00:00:44, 00:29:03, 00:29:25].

## High Talent Density: The Foundation
The concept of high talent density is not merely an end goal but a fundamental prerequisite for other aspects of Netflix's [[netflixs_culture_of_high_talent_density_and_excellence | culture]], such as candor, continuous learning, pursuit of excellence, and freedom and responsibility [00:00:11, 00:29:59]. Maintaining this high bar requires actions that can feel unnatural, like consistent feedback and making difficult decisions about personnel [00:30:15, 00:31:00].

### Compensation Philosophy
Netflix employs a "personal top of market" compensation strategy [00:39:34]. This means they aim to be highly competitive in pay to attract and retain talent [00:39:40, 00:40:01]. However, the goal is not for pay to be a "golden handcuff" but rather to be a competitive offering that complements a challenging and rewarding work environment [00:39:43, 00:40:08].

### Talent Acquisition Approach
Netflix's hiring strategy focuses on bringing in individuals who will enhance the team and push its thinking, rather than simply fitting a predefined skill set [00:40:40, 00:41:09]. The aim is to introduce "additive skills" and "additive perspectives" that make the team stronger [00:41:12, 00:41:06]. This involves assessing not just baseline skills but also qualities that make candidates exceptional or capable of elevating the existing team [00:41:29, 00:41:34, 00:41:36, 00:41:40]. The underlying belief is that top performers want to work with other top performers, and maintaining a high bar prevents a decline in collective performance [00:42:05, 00:42:07, 00:42:19].

### Maintaining the Bar: The Keeper Test
To uphold high talent density, Netflix utilizes a mental model known as the [[importance_of_candid_feedback_and_the_keeper_test_at_netflix | Keeper Test]] [00:31:45, 00:33:29]. Managers are encouraged to regularly ask themselves: "If this person on my team came to me and said I'm leaving today, I have a different opportunity and I would like to take it, would I do everything I could to keep them at Netflix?" [00:31:53, 00:32:06]. If the answer is no, it signals that a tough conversation about the individual's fit or role at Netflix is necessary [00:32:09, 00:32:26].

This test, while feeling "heavy," facilitates open communication about performance and expectations, preventing surprises if a separation occurs [00:32:20, 00:32:41, 00:33:00]. The absence of traditional performance reviews at Netflix means that feedback is expected to be ongoing and real-time, making the Keeper Test a crucial tool for continuous evaluation [00:34:32, 00:35:10, 00:35:36]. While the high bar can create nervousness, knowing where one stands through such candid conversations is often preferred over uncertainty [00:37:48, 00:38:33].

NuBank, a significant player in the fintech space, currently serves over 90 million customers in Latin America, making it larger than Coinbase, Robinhood, Affirm, Sofi, and Lemonade combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. Remarkably, 80 to 90% of NuBank's growth comes through word of mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. The company aims to be fundamentally different, not just incrementally better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This ambition extends to its vision for the [[future_of_product_management_with_ai | future of fintech and banking]], which centers on a holistic, globally unified, and AI-powered approach to financial services.

## The Vision: A Personal Banker for Everyone

NuBank envisions a future where banking is fundamentally different than it has been for the last 100 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:44">[00:59:44]</a>. The core idea is to shift from "putting a bank branch in your pocket" to building a "personal banker" for everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. Currently, only about 10 million people globally have access to private bankers, typically requiring significant wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:08">[01:00:08]</a>. NuBank believes this job can be democratized to all eight billion people on the planet, and done *better* than the current high-end service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:16">[01:00:16]</a>.

This grand vision is built on several key principles and hypotheses:

### Holistic Financial Solutions
NuBank aims to provide a full solution across the "five or six financial seasons" of someone's life: spending, saving, investing, borrowing, and protecting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:39">[01:04:39]</a>. This signifies a move beyond discrete financial products to an integrated, comprehensive offering.

### Global Bank on a Single Codebase
A significant goal is to build the first global bank on a single codebase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:15">[01:05:15]</a>. While traditional global banks (like Citi or Santander) often grow through acquisition and operate on distinct technology infrastructures, NuBank believes in leveraging a single codebase to achieve efficiency and scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:11">[01:06:11]</a>. This is challenging in fintech due to local regulations and higher stakes compared to online advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:50">[01:05:50]</a>.

### Social Mechanics and Automation
NuBank believes that financial lives are inherently social, and currently, it's difficult to share financial goals or manage shared expenses with family members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:39">[01:03:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:01">[01:04:01]</a>. They also aim to leverage self-driving automation to simplify routine tasks like paying bills or saving for education, acknowledging that many financial lives are "harshly unoptimized" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:49">[01:06:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:40">[01:07:40]</a>.

### Leveraging Artificial Intelligence
[[how_ai_is_changing_the_startup_landscape_and_opportunities_for_innovation | AI technologies]] are seen as crucial to turbo-boost these tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:29">[01:07:29]</a>. While the term "AI" is currently overhyped, NuBank is exploring how to build "AI-native" products rather than merely appending AI features to existing ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:16">[01:11:16]</a>. The goal is to design products from the start with AI tools in mind, similar to how companies adapted to the mobile-native mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:23">[01:11:23]</a>. This includes using AI to provide insights and make smart financial moves accessible to customers who may lack sophisticated financial education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:22">[01:08:22]</a>.

The company believes this new era of banking, driven by [[ai_interfaces_and_future_trends_in_software_development | social technologies]], self-driving capabilities, and [[future_of_ai_in_consumer_and_enterprise_applications | AI]], can redefine the financial experience globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:51">[00:59:51]</a>. NuBank aims for this [[inventiveness_and_innovation_in_business | reinvention of banking]] to emerge from cities like São Paulo, Mexico City, or Bogotá, rather than traditional tech hubs like San Francisco or London <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:09">[01:09:09]</a>.

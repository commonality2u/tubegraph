Hiring effective UX researchers requires understanding the evolving needs of the field and identifying key skills beyond traditional qualitative methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>. Jud Anon, who helped build the user research practice at Facebook and was a longtime head of research at Airbnb, shares insights on what to look for and how to evaluate candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>.

## Qualities of a Great Researcher

The best researchers possess a "Swiss army knife" of skills, indicating a multi-method approach rather than relying on a single tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>. While the first iteration of [[the_state_of_ux_research_in_the_tech_industry | user research]] was primarily qualitative, the field needs to evolve beyond this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>.

Effective researchers should have proficiency in five key areas:
1.  **Formative or Generative User Experience Research** – This involves forward-looking, innovation-focused, and open-ended research, often ethnographic, to understand where a product should go <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>.
2.  **Evaluative Research** – This includes methods like usability testing, which falls under [[understanding_and_analyzing_user_behavior | micro research]] to ensure a high-quality product is released <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>.
3.  **Rigorous Survey Design** – The ability to craft effective surveys is crucial for gathering scaled responses from diverse communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>.
4.  **Applied Statistics** – Understanding basic statistics is essential, especially in a world dominated by A/B testing, to interpret results accurately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>.
5.  **Technical Skills (SQL/Prompt Engineering)** – Historically, this involved SQL for querying data; today, it extends to [[natural_language_interfaces_in_ux | prompt engineering]] for interacting with generative AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.

Beyond these technical skills, effective researchers need to:
*   **Be business-oriented**: Understand the company's business goals, read quarterly reports, listen to shareholder calls, and know the company's OKRs, metrics, and conversion funnels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>. They should frame research questions in the language of business problems and identify opportunities in the funnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>.
*   **Focus on falsification, not validation**: A great researcher's mindset is to look for ways their assumptions might be wrong, rather than seeking to validate existing ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.
*   **Build strong relationships**: This enables them to be consistently engaged in the product development process from beginning to end, rather than being a reactive "service function" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>.
*   **Be excellent communicators**: They must be able to articulate complex problems simply and tailor their message to different audiences, such as a PM versus an executive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>.

## Interviewing for Research Skills

When interviewing candidates, it's effective to present a "juicy open-ended research question" and observe how they propose to handle it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>. A strong answer will typically involve a multi-method approach, considering how the research could be conducted in different timeframes (e.g., a day, a week, or a month) depending on the desired depth and breadth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.

*   **Look for a "Swiss Army Knife"**: While many researchers may be deeper in one method than another, the goal is to find individuals who can apply a variety of tools, or build a team where combined expertise covers all five areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>.
*   **Assess communication skills**: Ask candidates to explain a complex topic simply, as if to a five-year-old. This reveals their ability to break down problems and provide clear intuition, a differentiator between good and great professionals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>.

## The Ideal Researcher-Product Manager Partnership

The relationship between Product Managers (PMs) and researchers is often challenging, largely because researchers are not fully included in the product development process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>. To leverage researchers effectively:
*   **Integrate research from the start**: PMs should ensure researchers are part of the process from beginning to end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>. A great researcher should be involved in framing the right questions that drive maximum business impact and product improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>.
*   **Collaborate on prioritization**: PMs should partner with researchers on "ruthless prioritization" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>. A researcher's plate should ideally consist of only two large projects and one small one, ensuring high-quality work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>.
*   **Avoid "user-centered performance"**: This refers to symbolic customer obsession that signals care without genuinely seeking to make different decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>. Examples include asking for a "quick user study" at the end of a product process just to validate assumptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>, or executive listening sessions that are more for show than learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. PMs should avoid wanting to validate their ideas and instead be open to being proven wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.
*   **Understand the value of research beyond A/B tests**: While A/B tests can show *what* happened, they rarely explain *why* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>. Researchers provide the "how and why" that helps teams avoid future mistakes and build better products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>. Strong partnerships between data scientists and researchers are crucial for this integrated understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>.
*   **Avoid over-reliance on personal intuition**: While intuition is valuable, it's prone to biases and blind spots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>. Researchers help expand horizons and challenge intuition with evidence, especially when doing product walkthroughs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>.
*   **Recognize that "anyone can talk to a user" isn't research**: While democratizing feedback is good, a researcher can turn raw feedback into valuable insights and help avoid biases from anecdotal information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>.

## Structuring the Research Team

Instead of siloing different insights disciplines (like UX research, consumer insights, market research, or customer service feedback), companies should aim to create an integrated insights function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>. This ensures all relevant customer feedback fuels a single, unified insights machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>.

Regarding team size and ratios, the organizing principle should be **relationships** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>. A company has "enough" researchers when those who need a consistent research partner have one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>. It's better to create "pain of loss" by demonstrating the impact of a well-resourced researcher, prompting other teams to advocate for more headcount, rather than spreading researchers too thinly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>.

Even early-stage startups can benefit significantly from a researcher. A single researcher with a "Swiss army knife" of skills can provide incredible value, helping with major iterations or pivots, and providing evidence for tough decisions, rather than relying solely on guesswork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:16">[01:00:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:47">[01:00:47]</a>.

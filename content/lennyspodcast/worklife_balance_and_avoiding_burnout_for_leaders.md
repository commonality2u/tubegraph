Brian Chesky, CEO and co-founder of Airbnb, discusses his approach to [[strategies_for_avoiding_burnout_in_highspeed_environments | work-life balance]] and how he helps his team avoid burnout, particularly after shifting his leadership style to be more hands-on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>.

## The Paradox of Involvement

Initially, when Chesky became more involved in the details of the product, it resulted in significantly more work for about one to two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:13">[05:11:13]</a>. However, after this period, the company "turned the corner," and he found he had *more* time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:25">[05:12:25]</a>. This is because:
*   Everyone started rowing in the same direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:28">[05:12:28]</a>.
*   He didn't have to attend as many meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:30">[05:13:30]</a>.
*   People would execute tasks even without his direct presence, indicating a strong culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:34">[05:13:34]</a>.
*   There were fewer internal conflicts and less employee turnover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:47">[05:14:47]</a>.
*   His role became more proactive, leading to more positive surprises rather than constant problem-solving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:55">[05:15:55]</a>.
*   Intervening in dysfunctional projects from early stages saved time and effort compared to fixing issues later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:06">[05:16:06]</a>.

## Personal Strategies for Balance

While acknowledging he's not a "poster child" for [[strategies_for_avoiding_burnout_in_highspeed_environments | work-life balance]] historically, Chesky shares several personal practices he employs to step away from work and avoid burnout:

*   **Alternating Weekends** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19:19">[05:19:19]</a>: He works intensely one weekend and takes the next weekend completely off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:40">[05:21:40]</a>. He notes this might adjust to a single day off per weekend if he had a family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>.
*   **Consistent Exercise** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:35">[05:35:35]</a>: He never misses a workout, including 20 minutes of morning cardio daily and gym sessions three to four times a week for weights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:35">[05:35:35]</a>.
*   **Healthy Eating** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:47">[05:48:47]</a>: He follows a structured diet with five to six meals a day, similar to a bodybuilding diet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:13">[05:49:13]</a>.
*   **Adequate Sleep** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:24">[05:58:24]</a>: He prioritizes getting a good amount of sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:24">[05:58:24]</a>.
*   **Creative Outlets** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a>: He enjoys drawing and reading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a>.

### The Importance of Relationships
Chesky emphasizes that healthy relationships are crucial for happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:51">[05:53:51]</a>. He learned that during his entrepreneurial journey, he became isolated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:37">[05:54:37]</a>. His strategy now includes:
*   Maintaining constant contact with a core group of friends, including old high school and college friends, often through group chats and annual trips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:01">[05:59:01]</a>.
*   Creating new shared experiences through travel with friends, rather than just reliving old stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:04">[05:55:04]</a>.
*   Prioritizing time with family, such as staying at his sister's apartment when in New York City <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:04">[05:55:04]</a>.

He highlights that a leader's time should be proactively managed based on strategy, not just reacting to incoming emails or meeting requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:01">[05:57:01]</a>. He distinguishes between "fake work" (things that feel like work but don't move the ball forward) and "meaningful work" that aligns with long-term strategy and personal relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:06">[05:37:06]</a>. This deliberate prioritization helps avoid the [[challenges_product_leaders_face_busyness_and_frustration | feeling of busyness without productivity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:53">[02:09:53]</a>.

Chesky advises that if you consider your life finite, it would completely change how you prioritize your time, leading to saying "no" to less important things and "yes" to more meaningful ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:19">[05:57:19]</a>.

EPO is presented as a next-generation AB testing and feature management platform. It was built by alums of Airbnb and Snowflake and is designed for modern growth teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

## Role in Experimentation

Companies such as Twitch, Miro, ClickUp, and DraftKings utilize EPO to power their experiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. [[importance_of_ab_testing_and_experimentation | Experimentation]] is crucial for driving growth and understanding the performance of new features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

### Key Benefits and Features

EPO enhances [[importance_of_ab_testing_and_experimentation | experimentation]] velocity and provides rigorous, deep analysis in a way that other commercial tools may not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

The platform offers:
*   Advanced statistical methods to reduce experiment time by weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
*   An accessible user interface (UI) for detailed performance analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
*   Out-of-the-box reporting to avoid prolonged analytical cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
*   Easy sharing of experiment insights with teams, which helps in sparking new ideas for the [[importance_of_ab_testing_and_experimentation | AB testing]] flywheel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

EPO supports [[importance_of_ab_testing_and_experimentation | experimentation]] across various use cases, including product growth, machine learning, monetization, and email marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

> "When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved most was our [[building_a_culture_and_platform_for_experimentation | experimentation platform]] where I could set up experiments easily, troubleshoot issues, and analyze performance all on my own. EPO does all that and more..." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>

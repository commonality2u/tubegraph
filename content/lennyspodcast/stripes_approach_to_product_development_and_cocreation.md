Stripe's Approach to Product Development and Co-creation
------------------------------------------------------

Stripe's philosophy for product development centers on deeply understanding and collaborating with its users to build economic infrastructure for the internet. David Singleton, Stripe's Chief Technology Officer, emphasizes a user-first, meticulous, and collaborative approach that permeates the entire organization. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>

### Core Philosophy: User-First and Product-Minded Builders
Stripe's core thesis is that the internet economy will continue to grow in importance, and the company aims to make it easier for businesses to get started and operate within this economy. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a> This mission attracts product-minded builders who are motivated by helping businesses at scale. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>

The company's initial product, a credit card payments API, was born from the founders' own frustration with the difficulty of accepting online payments, leading them to solve a "profound problem" for businesses. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a> As Stripe scaled, its [[building_products_at_stripe | product building process]] became driven by paying close attention to usersâ€”understanding what they get from existing products and what adjacent problems they wish Stripe could solve. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a> This user-centric mindset attracts individuals who seek deep problem understanding and agency in devising solutions. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>

Stripe's approach to [[building_products_at_stripe | product development]] involves a rigorous iterative process, starting with a minimal viable product (MVP) to get something into users' hands quickly, followed by continuous feedback and refinement. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:07">[00:43:07]</a>

### Co-creation with Early Users
A hallmark of Stripe's [[building_products_at_stripe | product development]] is co-creating products with a select set of early users. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>

*   **Stripe Billing Example**: When [[building_products_at_stripe | building Stripe Billing]], the team identified existing users with subscription business models, such as Figma and Slack. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a> The team worked closely with these companies, forming personal relationships with individuals operating their systems to understand their challenges and aspirations. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a>
*   **Shared Development Loop**: They used shared Slack channels and regularly showed product iterations to this "alpha group," gathering feedback. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a> A product was only considered ready for a broader audience once this initial group was "super, super happy" with it. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>

This co-creation strategy means that every engineer [[building_products_at_stripe | building product at Stripe]] inherently possesses and exercises many attributes typically found in Product Managers (PMs) at other companies. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:45">[00:19:45]</a>

### The Role of Product-Minded Engineers
Stripe was notably late in hiring its first product manager, operating for many years with an engineering-led approach. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a> This was possible because the early engineering team was "extremely product minded," with every member effectively acting as a PM. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a> The developer-focused nature of Stripe's initial products meant that the best PMs were often technical or former engineers, bringing user insight and strategy to the fore. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>

While PMs now play a crucial role, engineers retain a deep product orientation, continuously engaging with users and bringing insights into the product development loop. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>

### Cross-Functional Collaboration and Product Management
[[Building products at Stripe]] is seen as a "team sport" involving various functions beyond the typical engineering, product, and design teams. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:03">[00:20:03]</a> Given the nature of Stripe's financial infrastructure products, which abstract complex financial systems and regulations, functions like financial partnerships, legal, risk, and compliance are involved from early development phases. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:22">[00:20:22]</a>

Product Managers serve a pivotal role, providing the "locomotion" to unite these cross-functional partnerships. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a> They are frequently responsible for:
*   Synthesizing user learnings. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:15">[00:21:15]</a>
*   Leading user interactions. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:22">[00:21:22]</a>
*   Bringing [[developing_and_implementing_product_strategy | product strategy]] to ensure long-term paths align with current efforts. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:29">[00:21:29]</a>

### Meticulousness in Craft
Stripe operates under the principle of "be meticulous in your craft." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:58">[00:21:58]</a> This principle balances the need for speed with a commitment to quality, particularly where it impacts users the most. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:20">[00:24:20]</a>

*   **Error Messages Example**: An early example of meticulousness is the decision to link API error messages directly to relevant documentation, turning a point of friction into a moment of delight and problem-solving for developers. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:02">[00:25:02]</a> This attention to detail, even in "edge cases," builds trust and encourages further adoption of Stripe products. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:19">[00:27:19]</a>
*   **Checkout Flow Optimization**: By meticulously scrutinizing and optimizing checkout flows, including building the payment element and hosted surfaces like Stripe Checkout, Stripe has achieved significant revenue uplift for users (e.g., 10.5% average increase for users migrating to these surfaces). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:24">[00:28:24]</a>

### Operationalizing Meticulousness
To operationalize meticulousness, Stripe uses several key practices:

*   **Friction Logging**: This widely used process involves role-playing as a specific user (e.g., an engineer integrating the Stripe Billing API at a company like Atlassian) and meticulously documenting the experience, paying particular attention to points of friction. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:55">[00:25:55]</a>
    *   It is a regular task for many product teams, often led by PMs or engineering managers, who conduct end-to-end product flow walkthroughs and write friction logs. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:04">[00:33:04]</a>
    *   Senior leaders and executives also engage in this practice to ensure cohesion across parallel work streams. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:06">[00:34:06]</a>
    *   A simple template is used: state the goal, explicitly define the user persona, and maintain a clear stream-of-consciousness log, including positive observations. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:24">[00:34:24]</a>
    *   The observations from friction logs help prioritize fixes and improvements, which are allocated dedicated time within team roadmaps. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:15">[00:36:15]</a>
*   **UX Reviews and "Walk the Store"**:
    *   UX reviews involve asynchronous friction logging and collaborative walkthroughs with the product team and cross-functional partners (e.g., support groups, executives). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:31">[00:37:31]</a> Issues are logged and openly discussed to determine necessary actions. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:15">[00:38:15]</a>
    *   "Walk the Store" is an occasional practice where the entire company reviews critical product flows together during weekly meetings, fostering a shared language and alignment on user experience. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:15">[00:39:15]</a>
*   **"Crying Octopus"**: A minor but impactful change is a button in every developer tool, an emoji of a crying octopus, which allows engineers to frictionlessly report "paper cuts" or problems. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:32">[01:27:32]</a> The developer productivity team reviews these submissions to prioritize their roadmap. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:47">[01:27:47]</a>

### Continuous Learning and Adaptability
Stripe is a continuously learning organization, especially regarding reliability. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:56">[00:55:56]</a> This includes:
*   **Incident Response**: Systematic review of incidents to identify root causes and prevent future issues, with these fixes prioritized over other roadmap work. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:47">[00:56:47]</a>
*   **Chaos Testing**: Injecting errors to ensure systems respond without impacting users. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:21">[00:57:21]</a>

### Strategic Planning and Prioritization
Stripe's planning process is effective despite internal challenges, largely due to its rapid growth necessitating frequent re-evaluation of how planning is done. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:51">[01:14:51]</a>

*   **First Principles Thinking**: Stripe avoids simply adopting existing systems, instead thinking from first principles to design planning processes tailored to their unique needs and user base. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:15">[01:15:15]</a>
*   **User Focus**: Critical to planning is a clear understanding of the target users for each product area, whether very small businesses or multinational corporations. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:02">[01:17:02]</a>
*   **Inverted W Process**: This iterative planning approach involves:
    1.  Teams surfacing initial ideas. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:49">[01:17:49]</a>
    2.  Product leaders synthesizing these into a draft company strategy. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:58">[01:17:58]</a>
    3.  Distributing the draft back to teams for refinement and alignment. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:07">[01:18:07]</a>
    4.  Synthesizing again before final distribution. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:14">[01:18:14]</a>

### Impact of AI and Machine Learning
Stripe has been using machine learning (ML) at the core of its products for years, notably in its fraud detection solution, Radar, and for catching bad actors. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:17">[01:01:17]</a> The company integrated Transformer technology (the basis for large language models) into these systems over a year ago, significantly impacting their ability to solve user problems. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:59">[01:01:59]</a>

Stripe also leverages AI for:
*   **Powering AI Startups**: Many AI businesses, including OpenAI (for ChatGPT Plus), use Stripe for monetization, subscriptions, and financial operations, allowing them to focus precious engineering resources on innovation. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:44">[01:02:44]</a>
*   **Developer Documentation**: GPT-4 is used to read and embed Stripe's extensive documentation, enabling natural language querying for developers. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:50">[01:03:50]</a>
*   **Sigma Product**: Large language models enhance the Sigma product (for SQL queries across Stripe data) by allowing users to ask questions in natural language, which the engine then converts into SQL queries. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:03">[01:05:03]</a>
*   **Internal Efficiency**: AI technologies are used to answer user questions faster and improve internal collaboration. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:21">[01:05:21]</a>
*   **Internal LLM UI**: Stripe built an internal UI for GPT-4 to handle sensitive data, including shared "presets" or prompts to help various job families (marketing, support, etc.) leverage the models effectively. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:56">[01:05:56]</a>
*   **GitHub Copilot**: Stripe makes Copilot available to engineers and conducted rigorous trials that showed it improves productivity, especially in generating test cases and boilerplate code, freeing engineers to focus on higher-level problems. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:12">[01:07:12]</a>

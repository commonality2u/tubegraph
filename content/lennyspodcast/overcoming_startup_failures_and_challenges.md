Dalton Caldwell, Managing Director and Group Partner at Y Combinator (YC), has worked with over 10 years and 21 YC batches, seeing thousands of startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. His experience provides valuable insights into the common [[challenges_and_misconceptions_of_startup_success | challenges and misconceptions of startup success]], and strategies for [[resilience_in_startups | resilience in startups]].

## The Mantra: Just Don't Die

A core piece of pragmatic advice given to founders is simply to "sell, make money, don't run out of money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Caldwell emphasizes that even the best in their field need to be reminded of fundamentals to stay in the right mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. His mantra, "just don't die," is about constantly affirming the need to keep the startup going and to continue doing high-quality work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

Many successful startup stories from YC reveal that founders often reach a point where, rationally, they should have given up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. For instance, the founders of Airbnb faced multiple instances before YC where their venture objectively wasn't working and was causing personal hardship, yet they irrationally chose to persevere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. This highlights the necessity of an "irrational intention to keep going" even when external circumstances and internal feelings suggest defeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. Success often appears as an "overnight success" only after numerous "near-death experiences" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.

### Knowing When to Give Up

While perseverance is key, there are situations when it might be the right decision to shut down a struggling startup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. Caldwell offers nuanced advice:
*   **Are you still having fun?** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a> If the founders still enjoy the work, spending time with co-founders, and genuinely love their customers and product, it's a strong signal to keep going <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.
*   **Negative Impact:** If the venture is profoundly affecting mental health, relationships, or team dynamics negatively, it might be time to stop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.
*   **Fear of Failure:** Founders shouldn't force themselves to continue solely to avoid losing face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:15">[01:11:15]</a>. In the long run, if one maintains integrity and honesty, most people won't remember a company being shut down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:06">[01:10:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:15">[01:10:15]</a>. Life is short, and pursuing something that makes one miserable due to fear of failure is a significant opportunity cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:12">[01:11:12]</a>.

Most startups don't die from running out of money, but because founders "lose hope" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:28">[00:37:28]</a>, or because their "idea doesn't work," they "have a big fight with their co-founder," or they "don't want to do this anymore" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:45">[00:38:45]</a>. Every single startup founder will go through a point where they feel like all hope is lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>.

### The Brex and Retool Stories

The Winter 2017 YC batch is a testament to this [[resilience_in_startups | resilience in startups]]. Two companies, Vyond (a VR headset idea) and Cashew (a P2P Venmo competitor in the UK), were objectively seen as the worst-performing in the batch, with founders feeling ashamed and despondent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:30">[01:12:30]</a>. However, Vyond pivoted and became Brex, a decacorn, while Cashew pivoted and became Retool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:41">[01:13:41]</a>. Both, which seemed doomed at the time, became the most successful companies in their group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:53">[01:13:53]</a>.

## The Art of the Pivot

A good pivot is like "going home" â€“ it gets "warmer" by moving closer to something the founders are already expert at and builds on prior learnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:46">[01:14:46]</a>.
*   **Brex:** The founders, who had prior experience in FinTech in Brazil, pivoted from VR headsets to a FinTech solution, aligning with their expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>.
*   **Retool:** Their pivot was based on similar internal tools they had built during internships and for their previous venture (Cashew), leveraging their knowledge of dashboards and operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:14">[01:15:14]</a>.
*   **Segment:** Started as software to help students signal confusion in class. They learned about analytics while building this, pivoted to an analytics competitor, and then to a JavaScript tool to send events to multiple endpoints, which became their core product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:38">[01:16:38]</a>. The final idea for Segment couldn't have been conceived at the start because they only gained the necessary expertise by grinding on earlier ideas for years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:25">[01:17:25]</a>.

A good time to pivot is when a founder is "out of ideas" on how to make the current one grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:15">[01:18:15]</a>. However, if there are still several good growth ideas that haven't been tried, it's worth pursuing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:26">[01:18:26]</a>. Airbnb, for example, tried many "zany ideas on growth," including selling cereal, before running out of options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:35">[01:18:35]</a>.

### Finding Unique Startup Ideas

To find unique ideas, founders should avoid having the same "information diet" as everyone else, which leads to similar ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:02">[02:22:02]</a>. Instead, they should:
*   **Go off the beaten path:** Explore ideas from personal experience, such as Brex and Retool did <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:25">[02:41:25]</a>.
*   **Go deeper into personal interests/expertise:** Find something specific that others wouldn't think of in the same way, like marketplaces for specific collectibles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:04">[02:47:04]</a>.
*   **Disrupt incumbents with low NPS:** Find large, publicly traded or private equity-owned companies whose software is hated by customers. This identifies a knowable big market with an incumbent ripe for disruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:07">[02:07:07]</a>. Zip (a procurement software company) successfully applied this strategy by identifying a hated incumbent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:07">[02:09:07]</a>.

### Tarpit Ideas to Avoid

"Tarpit ideas" are consistently bad startup ideas that founders gravitate towards and get stuck in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:37">[02:37:37]</a>. A true tarpit idea:
*   **Seems like an unsolved problem** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:25">[02:42:25]</a>.
*   **Receives lots of positive feedback** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>.
*   **Can be initially validated** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>.

Examples include apps to coordinate with friends for going out, which have been tried since the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>, or music discovery startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. Another example is Foursquare clones, which were popular for years but ultimately didn't work as independent businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>. These ideas are appealing and draw founders in, leading them to get stuck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:37">[02:37:37]</a>.

## Avoiding Common Pitfalls

### Investor Rejection
Founders often seek complex reasons for investor rejection, but it's simpler: investors have limited investments they can make, and even if they like an idea or founder, they only choose opportunities that excite them or appear "phenomenally big" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>. It's not about the founder doing something "wrong" like a bad Zoom setup; it's about the investor having better options or being risk-averse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.

### Market Size (TAM)
The importance of Total Addressable Market (TAM) depends on the investment stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. While critical for later-stage investments with high valuations, it matters less at the earliest stages (pre-seed or YC applications) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. Many hugely successful startups like Uber, Airbnb, or Razorpay (India's largest payment processor) had tiny TAMs at their inception, requiring belief in massive future growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. Early-stage investors like Caldwell prioritize user acquisition and whether people want the product over rigid TAM calculations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.

### Over-delegation and Hiring Challenges
Founders should avoid over-delegating and remain deeply involved in product and customer interactions, especially in the early stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>. A common trap is hiring "super senior people with fancy resumes" too early <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>. This often happens due to investor pressure to scale the team or demonstrate growth, but it can lead to founders taking their "eye off the ball" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>.

Founders need to prioritize their time effectively. If they genuinely care about their customers and product, their instincts will guide them on where to focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>. Spending excessive time on networking with investors, for example, might be a distraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>. Being "obsessed with product" is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>.

### Talking to Customers
Not talking to customers is a primary reason startups fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>. While founders know they should talk to customers, many don't actually do it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>.
*   **In-person interaction:** It's crucial to get out and talk to people in person, rather than hiding behind a keyboard or relying on online ads for validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>.
*   **Overcoming social anxiety:** Many founders avoid direct customer interaction due to shyness or the fear of looking stupid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>. This awkwardness must be powered through, as it often becomes enjoyable once accustomed to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>.
*   **Time allocation:** Roughly 20-30% of a founder's time should be dedicated to in-person meetings or calls with potential customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>.

Examples of effective customer interaction:
*   **Brex & Retool:** Talked to other founders within the YC network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:00">[04:19:00]</a>.
*   **Zip:** Directly messaged (DM'd) people on LinkedIn for advice on procurement products, which led to early beta testers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23:00">[04:23:00]</a>. They did hundreds of these calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:00">[04:35:00]</a>.
*   **Stripe (The Collison Install):** The founders would proactively visit customers "in the neighborhood" to help them implement Stripe, even taking control of their keyboards to ensure successful integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>. This highlights that sales isn't complete until the product is implemented and used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>.

### Contrarion View: Growth Hacking Too Early
For very early-stage startups with few or no customers, focusing on "growth," "growth hacking," extensive analytics, and A/B testing is a "total waste of time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:58">[01:05:58]</a>. This advice, often geared towards later-stage companies, confuses seed-stage founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:19">[01:06:19]</a>. The inclination to dive into complex growth theory instead of simply acquiring and talking to the first customer is an "anti-pattern" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:35">[01:06:35]</a>. Foundational steps are to "get a first customer, getting one customer, and talking to that person" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:57">[01:06:57]</a>.

## Attributes of Successful Founders

Successful founders don't necessarily share a specific personality type; they can be quiet, extroverted, or anything in between <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:14">[00:48:14]</a>. The key [[attributes_of_successful_startup_founders | attribute of successful startup founders]] is an intense internal belief and desire to make the company work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>. They believe "I'm the one" and "I won't accept this not working," even when all objective data suggests failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:11">[00:49:11]</a>. This strong internal conviction can "warp the world" around them, convincing employees and others that success is inevitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:43">[00:49:43]</a>.

This conviction often builds over time. Early on, when a product isn't working, founders may not feel this strong belief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:50">[00:50:50]</a>. However, as they pivot to a good idea, gain customers, and see the product perform better, their obsession and conviction grow in a virtuous cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:50">[00:50:50]</a>.

## YC's Request for Startups
YC regularly publishes a "Request for Startups" (RFS) to inspire founders to apply with ideas beyond the common ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>. These lists are not exclusive but aim to broaden the "information diet" of founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>. Examples of desired ideas include:
*   ERPs (Enterprise Resource Planning software) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>.
*   Open-source companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>.
*   Space companies, even if perceived as too bold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>.
*   New defense technology, bringing manufacturing back to America, and solutions to end cancer (deep tech/hard science) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>.
*   Better "Enterprise glue" (software to connect brittle business systems) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>.
*   Small fine-tuned AI models as alternatives to gigantic generic ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>.

These are areas YC feels are "under-tapped" by founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>.

## Final Advice
For aspiring founders, the tactical advice is to start with customer validation before writing code or raising money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:54">[01:11:54]</a>. If potential customers show genuine excitement, it's a "green light" to pursue the startup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:01">[01:12:01]</a>. Building should commence once there's conviction that at least one person would use the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:15">[01:12:15]</a>.

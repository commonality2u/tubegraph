Jessica Lax, Vice President of Analytics and Data Science at DoorDash, has built one of the largest and most impactful data teams in tech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:30">[00:54:30]</a>. She shares insights on how to [[building_and_managing_growth_teams | build and scale]] a data organization, emphasizing a business-impact-driven approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:05">[01:14:05]</a>.

## Core Philosophy of Analytics Teams

Lax views analytics as a business impact-driving function, not purely a service function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. The goal is not just to answer "why," but to answer "what do we do now that we know this?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. Analytics teams should find opportunities, have a point of view on decisions, and bring data-driven insights to the table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. They must earn their seat at the table by bringing opportunities for the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.

## Structuring Data Teams: Centralized Model

Lax strongly advocates for a centralized data organization model, or "Center of Excellence," over embedding analytics within business units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. While understanding the appeal of embedded teams (ownership, camaraderie, roadmap control) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>, she believes a central model is superior.

At DoorDash, the analytics team is centralized but divided into "pods" that map perfectly with product, engineering, operations, and marketing structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>. This means data professionals are de facto embedded with partner teams, sharing the same goals, even though their reporting structure is central <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. This fosters alignment and ensures analytics is a thought partner, not just a service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.

### Benefits of a Centralized Model
*   **Consistent and High Talent Bar**: Ensures a consistent standard for technical and soft skills during hiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.
*   **Growth Opportunities**: Provides clear career paths, allowing team members to move between different areas of the company or into management roles if available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. This helps [[building_a_highperformance_team | retain talent]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.
*   **Consistency of Methodologies and Metrics**: Prevents different teams from having varying definitions of key metrics (e.g., sales) or reinventing analytical models (e.g., churn prediction) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. This also aids [[building_and_optimizing_internal_link_architecture | scaling]] by identifying common problems across teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.
*   **Strong Team Culture and Brand**: Fosters a unique culture of learning and sharing within the analytics team, which is important for recruiting and engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>.

## Balancing Proactive vs. Reactive Work

It is crucial to be intentional about carving out time for exploratory work and deep dives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>. Setting goals around finding self-directed insights helps hold the team accountable, as reactive inbounds often take priority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>.

### Example: DoorDash's Referral Fraud Deep Dive
During a hackathon, the data team investigated why the consumer acquisition referral channel showed below-average engagement and payback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>. They actively tried referring each other and even committed referral fraud to understand the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>. This deep dive revealed a bimodal distribution: one group of high-quality referrers and another engaging in fraudulent behavior (e.g., posting codes online for free discounts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:49">[00:18:49]</a>. This led to recommendations for better fraud checks and caps on referrals, significantly improving the channel's efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>.

To manage requests and carve out time for high-ROI, self-directed work, Jessica recommends:
*   **Establish Clear Operating Models**: Leadership should set rules for working so junior staff aren't always forced to say no <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:17">[00:21:17]</a>.
*   **Align Goals**: Because the analytics team shares goals with business partners, they can easily frame conversations around shared priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:32">[00:21:32]</a>.
*   **Communicate Tradeoffs**: Always share what else would have to drop if a new request is taken on. This helps business partners understand the implications and prioritize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:19">[00:22:19]</a>.

## Hiring for Data Teams

Beyond a high technical bar, Jessica looks for unique characteristics:
*   **Curiosity**: The inability to teach curiosity makes it a critical trait. Curious individuals are self-motivated to "pull on threads" and dig deeper even when a question is answered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:51">[00:24:51]</a>.
*   **Self-Motivation**: The drive to investigate proactively without being told <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:34">[00:25:34]</a>.

### Testing for Curiosity and Decision-Making in Interviews
*   **Case Studies with Ambiguity**: Present a business case with something "not quite right" to see if candidates notice or how they react when it's pointed out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:44">[00:25:44]</a>.
*   **Problem-Solving and Ambiguity**: Observe how candidates break down problems, handle ambiguity, and incorporate new information when told they are wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:18">[00:27:18]</a>.
*   **Point of View**: Push candidates to make a decision or state a point of view even with incomplete information, as this reflects real-world scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:24">[00:28:24]</a>.

## Non-Traditional Backgrounds in Data

Jessica herself came from a non-traditional background (first GM at DoorDash, social gifting startup, investment banking) and is self-taught in SQL and Python <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:01">[01:01:01]</a>. This background has allowed her to hire highly technical individuals (PhDs in statistics, machine learning experts) while keeping the team focused on driving business impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:31">[00:30:31]</a>.

### Benefits of Diverse Backgrounds
*   **Focus on Business Impact**: A non-traditional background emphasizes pragmatism and driving business impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:58">[00:30:58]</a>.
*   **Cross-Pollination of Skills**: Team members from diverse backgrounds (engineering, operations, marketing, finance) bring different expertise and can teach each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:03">[01:06:03]</a>.
*   **Understanding of Different Company Stages**: Hiring from startups and large organizations provides both "hustle and grit" and experience with [[innovating_within_large_organizations | scaling]] problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:04">[01:08:04]</a>.

## Fostering Extreme Ownership

The culture of "extreme ownership" at DoorDash, instilled by CEO Tony Xu, means employees are willing to "roll up their sleeves" and do whatever is necessary to win, even if it's outside their job description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:56">[00:33:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:04">[00:34:04]</a>.

*   **Example from Early Days**: The Boston sales guy, whose compensation was tied to signing merchants, would still join the team at 5 AM in winter to hand out promo codes and Kind bars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:46">[00:35:46]</a>. This showed a shared desire to grow the business beyond individual goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:07">[00:36:07]</a>.
*   **Customer-First Approach**: The entire company, even in early days, would drop everything to handle customer support during site outages, ensuring refunds and deliveries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:51">[00:36:51]</a>.
*   **"WeDash" Program**: All DoorDash employees go "dashing" or do customer support four times a year. This builds empathy with consumers, Dashers, and merchants, and helps identify bugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:30">[00:38:30]</a>.
*   **Data Scientists on the Phone**: If data reveals an unexpected outcome, data scientists are expected to pick up the phone and call customers for qualitative insights, rather than waiting for a separate research team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:55">[00:42:55]</a>. This encourages team members to go outside traditional data science bounds into product management or engineering work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:31">[00:43:31]</a>.

## Defining and Aligning Metrics

Jessica has learned valuable lessons about picking good metrics and aligning incentives:
*   **Short-Term Proxy Metrics for Long-Term Outcomes**: Instead of "retention" (hard to drive in the short term), focus on measurable inputs that drive retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:51">[00:44:51]</a>. Experiment to test if these short-term inputs indeed drive the desired long-term output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:24">[00:45:24]</a>.
*   **Keep it Simple**: Avoid complex composite metrics that nobody understands. Even if a simpler metric isn't "perfect," intuition and understandability across the company are more important for driving outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:33">[00:45:33]</a>.
    *   *Example*: A complex "Merchant Health Score" was replaced by simpler, actionable metrics like "new merchants getting an order in seven days" and "merchant photo coverage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:56">[00:50:56]</a>.
*   **Quantify in a Common Currency**: Understand how different metrics across the company equate to one another. By quantifying all business levers (price, selection, quality, delivery times) in common terms (e.g., Gross Order Value (GOV) or volume), teams can make informed tradeoffs and quicker decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:40">[00:46:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>. This is particularly crucial for complex, multi-sided marketplaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:20">[00:50:20]</a>.
*   **Focus on Edge Cases and Fail States**: While averages are important, actively look at and set goals around edge cases and "disaster deliveries" (e.g., "never delivered" orders) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:29">[00:55:29]</a>. Even if rare, these terrible experiences lead directly to churn and are costly, often missed by looking only at averages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:01">[00:58:01]</a>. Sometimes, issues like login errors are not visible in data because affected users cannot access the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:26">[00:59:26]</a>.

## Global Data Organizations

When managing a global data organization, Jessica notes more similarities than differences across countries, including consumer and "Dasher" behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:37">[01:00:37]</a>. However, complexities arise from different currencies, languages, and regulations (e.g., EU vs. non-EU countries) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:01">[01:01:01]</a>. Often, problems encountered in new markets feel familiar, allowing for informed instincts while still encouraging testing due to potential cultural differences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:31">[01:01:31]</a>.

## Leveraging AI in Data Teams

Jessica is excited about using AI to make the data team more productive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:07">[01:03:07]</a>. DoorDash uses an internal tool called "Ask Data AI" (named after their Slack channel) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:52">[01:04:52]</a>. This chatbot empowers non-technical users to edit queries or get advice on writing SQL, reducing reliance on the analytics team's bandwidth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:02">[01:04:02]</a>.

Manual onboarding is a strategy where new users are personally guided through their initial experience with a product, often in a one-on-one setting. Superhuman, an email client, famously adopted this approach for years to achieve product-market fit and foster a strong brand.

## Superhuman's Approach to Manual Onboarding

In its early days, Superhuman insisted on a one-on-one concierge onboarding experience for every new user. Users could not access the product without going through this process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>. This commitment was central to the company's DNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:23:00">[05:23:00]</a>.

At its peak, Superhuman had approximately 20 people dedicated to manual onboarding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>.

### Benefits of Manual Onboarding

Superhuman found two primary benefits to this intensive [[activation_and_onboarding_strategies | onboarding]] method:

1.  **Superior User Metrics** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>: Manual onboarding significantly boosted key user metrics such as engagement, retention, product-market fit scores, Net Promoter Score (NPS), and virality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>. This created an early cohort of "superfans" crucial for building brand and driving word-of-mouth growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>.
2.  **Strategic Resource Allocation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:00]</a>: During periods of readily available funding (e.g., the "zero interest rate phenomenon era"), manual onboarding allowed Superhuman to bypass the immediate need to build a complex first-time user experience or traditional growth loops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>. This enabled engineers to focus all their efforts on finding product-market fit, [[developing_and_launching_new_products_in_a_company | solution deepening]], or market widening, rather than on self-service flows or [[activation_and_onboarding_strategies | activation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:00">[06:09:00]</a>. Other companies, by contrast, might spend up to half their engineering budget on these areas before even finding product-market fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:12:00">[06:12:00]</a>.

### When to Stop Manual Onboarding

While effective, manual onboarding isn't a permanent solution. Superhuman transitioned to a self-service model because:
*   **Accessibility for All Personality Types**: Some users prefer not to go through a one-on-one onboarding process, and at a certain scale, these individuals become important to serve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>.
*   **Scalability**: For a company aiming for a mass market (e.g., enterprise clients or a broad user base), the top-of-funnel width eventually necessitates a shift away from manual processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>.
*   **Cost-Effectiveness**: While Superhuman always ensured manual onboarding was profitable, there comes a point where the cost of individual attention outweighs the benefits for the broader market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>.

> [!INFO] Transitioning to Self-Service
> Building a world-class self-service option after years of manual onboarding was a "terrifying" and difficult task for Superhuman, as the company's entire foundation was built around the manual approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>. However, they persevered and now offer a robust self-service experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>.

### Considerations for Implementing Manual Onboarding

Founders considering manual onboarding should evaluate:
*   **Profitability**: Ensure that the revenue generated from newly onboarded customers outweighs the cost of the manual process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>.
*   **Market Context**: This strategy is particularly effective for consumer-focused companies aiming to build a strong brand through word-of-mouth, especially when there's an abundance of capital to invest in the upfront human resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>. AI companies, for example, might find this strategy viable today due to current funding trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>.

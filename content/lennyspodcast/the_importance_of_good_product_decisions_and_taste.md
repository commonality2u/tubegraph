Shas Doshi emphasizes the critical role of making good product decisions and developing a strong "taste" in product development, which goes beyond superficial aesthetics. He reflects on lessons learned from his career at Google, Twitter, and Stripe.

## The Cost of Poor Product Decisions: Why Product Leaders are So Busy

A primary reason for product leaders feeling perpetually busy and stressed is a pattern of making poor product decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>. While efficiency tools and prioritization frameworks are known, they often fail to address the root cause of being overwhelmed: an ever-growing scope that no amount of productivity hacks can manage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.

### The "Two-Way Door" Fallacy

A common pitfall is the misapplication of concepts like "two-way doors," where decisions can be easily reversed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>. Shas argues that for most product leaders, what appears to be a "two-way door" is often a "one-way door" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>. Rushing decisions without deep thought into customer motivation, differentiation, or distribution leads to issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>. Many product decisions are made based on superficial factors, such as an engineer's availability, rather than rigorous strategic analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>.

This leads to a cycle of feature debt:
1.  **Commitment to Feature**: A feature is committed to, taking weeks to build and ramp up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:36">[00:20:36]</a>.
2.  **Lack of Adoption**: At a Quarterly Business Review (QBR), the feature shows little adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:28">[00:21:28]</a>.
3.  **Anecdotal Justification**: Product leaders resort to favorable anecdotes when data is absent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>.
4.  **Feature Expansion**: Sales or customers demand more "bells and whistles" to meet "table stakes," leading to commitments for even more work on a feature that perhaps should not have been built initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>.
5.  **Accumulated Debt**: This process accumulates significant "feature debt" over time, constantly increasing workload <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>.

> "Sometimes it is useful to pause for 2 minutes or 2 days or 2 weeks before making that decision, because frankly most doors that look like two-way doors are actually one-way doors. They are two-way doors at Bezos's level but as a PM leader for you they are oneway door and that's what's making you busy." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:52">[00:23:52]</a>

Shas advises that [[effective_decision_making | thinking is cheap]], and product leaders should engage in more deliberate thought rather than less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:37">[00:25:37]</a>.

### The Value of a Real Product Strategy

Having a clear, aligned product strategy can significantly reduce the busyness and frustration associated with annual planning and prioritization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>. A well-defined strategy can make planning a "breeze" and provide a rigorous framework for handling sales escalations or other unexpected demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>.

## Cultivating Good Taste in Product Leadership

Shas's second key question is, "Do I actually have good taste?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:53">[00:25:53]</a>. He initially bought into the Google mantra that "we don't do strategy here, strategy is for MBAs... we are all about execution" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:36">[00:26:36]</a>. However, his experience at Twitter post-IPO, around 2014, revealed that despite incredible assets (product, network effects, brand, talent), the company was struggling because of a fundamental product strategy problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:15">[00:28:15]</a>. This was a critical realization that changed his perspective on the importance of strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:49">[00:28:49]</a>.

### Redefining "Taste" in Product

Traditionally, [[the_role_of_intuition_and_taste_in_product_development | taste]] is often associated with aesthetics, such as "beautiful pixels" or "perfect product" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:32">[00:29:32]</a>. However, Shas suggests a deeper meaning for product leaders:

> "Taste is about the ability to identify what is really good without needing to see its results." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:41">[00:31:41]</a>

It requires no taste to recognize success after the fact (e.g., Nvidia's CEO in 2024, Patrick Mahomes as a great quarterback now) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:13">[00:32:13]</a>. True taste lies in recognizing "game before the game is called" or "in the practice session" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>. Similarly, merely being a "stuff grader" who criticizes everything requires "zero taste" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:41">[00:33:41]</a>.

### Avoiding Common Biases that Distort Taste

Product leaders often fall prey to biases that hinder [[understanding_and_building_taste_in_design | building good taste]]:
*   **Overly excited by cool metaphors**: Concepts like "two-way doors" are popular because they are catchy, not necessarily because they are better than less catchy but more descriptive terms (e.g., "reversible and irreversible decisions") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:06">[00:34:06]</a>.
*   **Authority bias**: Ideas gain traction simply because a respected figure (like Bezos) said them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:51">[00:34:51]</a>.
*   **Impressions by alliterations**: Phrases like "fail fast" are appealing due to their alliteration, even if "fail quickly" means the same thing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:04">[00:35:04]</a>.
*   **Impressions by complicated charts and math**: Being swayed by complex visuals or data that one doesn't fully understand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:02">[00:36:02]</a>.

To truly develop taste and become a rigorous, critical thinker, product leaders must shed these patterns and evaluate ideas independently of their "social proof" or "authority proof" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:31">[00:36:31]</a>. This rigorous self-evaluation is essential for personal and professional growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:08">[00:37:08]</a>.

Notion, co-founded and led by Ivan Zhao, faced significant [[challenges_in_early_startup_growth_and_product_pivots | challenges]] in its initial years, which Zhao refers to as the "Lost Years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. The company, founded in 2013, spent its first three to four years searching for product-market fit and iterating on its core idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

## The Foundational Vision and Early Pivots

Ivan Zhao's initial inspiration for Notion came from realizing that many people struggled to create and interact with software, even for basic tasks like building a web portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. This led him to the work of computing pioneers like Douglas Engelbart and Alan Kay, who envisioned a world where there was no separation between builders and users of software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. Engelbart's paper, "Augmenting Human Intellect," particularly obsessed Zhao with the idea of giving people the ability to use computing to augment their problem-solving abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

Initially, Notion pursued a vision where "everybody can make and create their software," attempting to build an extremely easy-to-use developer tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. However, after a couple of years, they learned that "most people just don't care" about creating software to optimize their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. This first version was "more about what I wanted than what people wanted" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>.

The realization came to "hide our vision" (everyone creating software) within a "form factor that people do care" about: productivity software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This shift was encapsulated by the metaphor: "We call the sugar called the broccoli. People don't want to eat the broccoli but people like sugar so give them the sugar that hide your broccoli inside of it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. It took Notion two years to pivot to building a productivity tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Technical Rebuild and Financial Strain

Beyond product vision, Notion also faced severe technical [[challenges_in_early_startup_growth_and_product_pivots | challenges]] during its early years. The team had to rebuild the entire codebase multiple times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>. They initially bet on "Web Component from Google," a competing technology to React at the time, which proved unstable and led to unknown bugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>. This forced them to "restart a company" and rebuild the whole product on a more stable technological foundation, as they were "going to run out of time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>.

Financially, the company struggled, running out of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>. Ivan's mother helped kickstart the company and later provided a loan to "bridge us" during difficult times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>.

## The Japan Reset and Persistence

During one of the "rebuild phases," when Notion realized the product needed to be a productivity software with hidden "Lego Power" but was built on the wrong technical foundation, they made a drastic decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>. They laid off all employees, reducing the team back to just Ivan and his co-founder Simon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>. Morale was "really low" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>.

To cope, they decided to move to Japan to change the scenario and disconnect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>. During this period, they were able to save money by subleasing their apartment and office in San Francisco <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>. Ivan and Simon spent their time "coding every day and... design every day," describing it as "some of the happiest moment" due to their strong working relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>.

## Lessons from Perseverance

Ivan Zhao offers several insights into how he and Simon persevered through these [[overcoming_startup_failures_and_challenges | overcoming startup failures and challenges]]:
*   **Emotional Resilience**: Ivan describes himself as having a disposition where "high is never too high low is never too low" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a>. He would "just go to sleep then next day I'm just reset" when feeling down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>.
*   **Courage to Reset**: "Definitely don't be afraid to reset. I think courage is quite important" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>. He emphasizes that finding "better abstractions" can lead to rapid progress that compounds faster than linear effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:04">[00:23:04]</a>.
*   **Balance of Vision and Market**: Building a product involves balancing personal "value" and "aesthetic" with the market's demand for users and revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:36">[00:20:36]</a>. Too much self-focus leads to an "art project" with "no user," while too much business focus creates a "commodity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:54">[00:21:54]</a>. Building for value, however, provides a "more durable energy source" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>.
*   **Avoiding Momentum Traps**: Be wary of momentum taking you in the wrong direction; be prepared to rethink and restart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:39">[00:24:39]</a>.

## The Gradual Arrival of Product-Market Fit

Product-market fit for Notion was not a sudden "boom Milestone achieve" but a "very gradual" process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:59">[00:25:59]</a>. It manifested as people starting to care about the product, reaching out, and paying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:29">[00:25:29]</a>. A notable sign was when investors started "knocking on the door," some even sending dog food to their non-public office address, indicating strong traction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:30">[00:26:30]</a>. Despite the investor interest, Ivan recognized it was often for "external validation" and focused on building a better product based on customer feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:06">[00:28:06]</a>.

## Later Challenges and Growth

Even after finding its stride, Notion faced significant [[challenges_and_strategies_in_startup_growth | challenges and strategies in startup growth]]. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the company experienced a massive surge in usage, which led to a near-crisis with its infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:32">[00:49:32]</a>. Notion was running on a single instance of a PostgreSQL database and was "running out of... space to store everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:47">[00:49:47]</a>. This "Doomsday Clock" meant they were weeks away from a complete shutdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:01">[00:50:01]</a>. They had to halt all new feature development and dedicate "every almost every engineer in the company" to sharding the database to prevent a catastrophic failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:10">[00:50:10]</a>.

Despite the near-death experiences and extended search for product-market fit, Notion's persistence and willingness to [[overcoming_startup_failures_and_challenges | overcome startup failures]] and pivot led to its success as a widely used productivity tool.

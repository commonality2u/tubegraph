From: [[lennyspodcast]] <br/> 

The role of a product owner has seen a surprising surge in growth, becoming the third fastest-growing role in tech within the U.S. alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>. This phenomenon is particularly notable outside of traditional software-first companies, such as banks, telecom, and pharmaceutical industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:14:00">[10:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:36:00">[22:36:00]</a>.

## Historical Context: The Emergence of the Product Owner Role

The product owner role did not originate from [[the_role_of_product_managers | product management]] as it is widely understood today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:05:00">[20:05:00]</a>. Instead, it emerged from the desire to help developers prioritize their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:10:00">[20:10:00]</a>.

### Agile Manifesto and Scrum

The Agile Manifesto, written in 2001 by a group of software developers (not product managers), laid out principles for building better software through improved development practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:02:00">[12:02:00]</a>. Among these, Scrum was codified by Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland, outlining roles and processes for software development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:57:00">[13:57:00]</a>.

The initial Scrum Guide described the product owner as responsible for "maximizing the value of work done" by the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:08:00">[16:08:00]</a>. Crucially, it noted that the product owner did not necessarily need to be a product manager; they could be a customer (often an internal one asking for software) or a developer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:50:00">[16:50:50]</a>. However, later versions of the Scrum Guide removed this specific mention, leading to a broader misconception about the role's strategic depth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:09:00">[17:09:00]</a>.

### Product Owner Training

Product owner training typically involves short, often two-day classes that focus on tactical aspects like breaking down backlogs, conducting stand-ups, and prioritizing work for developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:37:00">[18:37:00]</a>. These trainings generally do not cover essential [[the_art_and_role_of_product_management | product management]] skills such as experimentation, market research, or data analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:55:00">[18:55:00]</a>. This limited scope often leads to product owners becoming "order-takers" who merely translate requirements into user stories, without strategic input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:57:00">[19:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:37:00">[37:37:00]</a>.

## Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe)

The Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) emerged from the desire to scale Scrum and other agile processes across large organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:36:00">[26:36:00]</a>. It provides a highly prescriptive operating model, appealing to executives in large enterprises (tens of thousands of people) who are looking for a clear roadmap for software development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:01:00">[37:01:00]</a>.

### SAFe's Distinction Between Product Manager and Product Owner

SAFe introduces a clear split between the product manager and product owner roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:21:00">[30:21:00]</a>. In SAFe, the product owner is part of the agile team, working directly with Scrum Masters and developers to manage the backlog and delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:25:00">[30:25:00]</a>. The product manager, on the other hand, sits at a higher level, focusing on strategy, working with system architects and Release Train Engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:34:00">[30:34:00]</a>.

### Challenges with SAFe

Melissa Perry, CEO and founder of The Product Institute, strongly advises against using SAFe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:17:00">[49:17:00]</a>. While SAFe can provide rigor for release trains and coordinating multiple teams, it often becomes overkill and focuses on process over actual value delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:01:00">[37:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:50:00">[50:50:00]</a>.

Key issues with SAFe include:
*   **Lack of Discovery** Product owners in SAFe environments often lack time for customer discovery or market research, as their schedules are filled with "Big Room Planning" and back-to-back Sprints focused on committed roadmaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:16:00">[31:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:58:00">[31:58:00]</a>.
*   **Developer Reliance** Developers can become overly reliant on product owners to define and prioritize all work, hindering their initiative on areas like tech debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:41:00">[32:41:00]</a>.
*   **Disconnected from Value** The process often prioritizes fulfilling a roadmap over ensuring the product delivers actual value or helps achieve company goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:36:00">[33:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:40:00">[44:40:40]</a>.
*   **Career Path Limitations** For product owners, SAFe can create a tactical "order-taker" role with a limited [[career_development_for_product_owners_and_product_managers | career development for product owners and product managers]] path that doesn't easily lead to strategic product management roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:40:00">[34:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:50:00">[45:50:00]</a>. Some organizations even separate product owner and product manager roles into different business lines or reporting structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:47:00">[34:47:00]</a>.

While some companies find initial success with SAFe, many end up "ripping it up and making it into something else," indicating that a rigid, by-the-book approach is not sustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:00:00">[36:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:31:00">[49:31:00]</a>.

## The Role of a Product Manager

In contrast to the product owner, the [[the_role_of_product_managers | product manager role]] in software-native companies (like those in Silicon Valley) originated from a business perspective where software *is* the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:00">[11:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:51:00">[11:51:00]</a>.

[[the_role_of_product_managers_versus_project_managers | Product managers]] engage in end-to-end product management, including:
*   Market research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:24:00">[11:24:00]</a>
*   Customer engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:26:00">[11:26:00]</a>
*   Working closely with developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:26:00">[11:26:00]</a>
*   Iterating on products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:27:00">[11:27:00]</a>
*   Understanding and influencing strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:01:00">[35:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:25:00">[55:25:00]</a>

Major tech companies like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Netflix do not typically employ product owners; they rely exclusively on product managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:21">[01:02:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:43">[01:02:43]</a>.

## Challenges and Responsibilities in Product Management

The "Agile Industrial Complex" refers to how agile methodologies and certifications are often marketed, with companies making money through consulting and certifications rather than focusing on true product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:12">[01:07:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:35">[01:18:35]</a>. This has led to a misunderstanding of what a product owner or product manager truly does <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:56">[01:09:56]</a>.

A key [[challenges_and_responsibilities_in_product_management | challenge]] in large organizations is the focus on process over outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:50">[01:19:50]</a>. Instead of asking "What are we achieving?" or "How are we serving our customers?", the discussion often revolves around meeting schedules and rigid procedures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:17">[01:19:17]</a>.

## Recommendations for Companies and Leaders

For companies undergoing digital transformations, simply adopting a framework like SAFe is not enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:18">[01:18:18]</a>. Instead, leaders should focus on a comprehensive product operating model that includes:
*   **Product Strategy**: Clearly defining product strategy tied to business goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:51">[00:41:51]</a>.
*   **Organizational Design**: Structuring teams around products, not components, and ensuring sufficient coverage of skilled product managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:08">[00:42:08]</a>.
*   **Product Operations**: Building infrastructure for data access, customer feedback, and user research to enable product teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:21">[00:42:21]</a>.
*   **Culture and Incentives**: Rewarding value delivery and outcomes, not just shipping features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:58">[00:42:58]</a>.
*   **Talent and [[coaching_and_leadership_in_product_management | Leadership]]**: Bringing in experienced product leaders who understand how to run large-scale technology organizations and can apply those lessons to diverse industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:33">[00:52:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:10">[00:53:10]</a>.
*   **Clear Career Paths**: Eliminating the confusing distinction between product owner and product manager titles and creating a unified [[career_development_for_product_owners_and_product_managers | career development for product owners and product managers]] ladder (e.g., Associate PM, Product Manager, Senior PM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:51">[01:11:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:59">[01:12:59]</a>.

The C-suite must recognize that software strategy is intertwined with overall company strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:37">[01:21:37]</a>. Appointing Chief Product Officers (CPOs) can ensure that software enables competitive advantage and innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:55">[01:21:55]</a>.

## Advice for Product Owners

If you are a product owner feeling stuck in a tactical role, here's how to develop your skills and advance your [[career_development_for_product_owners_and_product_managers | career]]:
*   **Push for Strategic Involvement**: Take ownership of understanding the broader context of your work. Challenge the assumption that your role is solely about working with developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:16">[00:57:16]</a>.
*   **Engage with Customers**: Seek opportunities to talk to customers and participate in customer research, even if it means stripping back some user story writing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:03">[00:59:03]</a>.
*   **Focus on Value and Outcomes**: When discussing work, ask "What do we hope will happen when we release this?" and "What metrics are we going to change?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:32">[00:59:32]</a>.
*   **Update Your Resume**: Shift your resume's focus from process-oriented tasks (e.g., "prioritized backlog") to value-driven achievements (e.g., "solved X problem for users resulting in Y metric improvement") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:26">[01:03:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:03">[01:05:03]</a>. Consider adding "Product Manager" to your title on your resume to reflect your broader skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:29">[01:06:29]</a>.
*   **Be Skeptical of Certifications**: While some large enterprises may require Certified Scrum Product Owner (CSPO) certifications for hiring or promotion, they often do not reflect a deep understanding of [[the_art_and_role_of_product_management | product management]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:42">[01:06:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:07">[01:10:07]</a>. Tech companies prioritize experience over certifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:37">[01:08:37]</a>.
*   **Advocate for Career Paths**: Ask your leaders about your [[career_development_for_product_owners_and_product_managers | career path]] and what's next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:47">[00:58:47]</a>. A collective "groundswell" of product owners asking this can prompt organizations to formalize career ladders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:07">[01:00:07]</a>.
*   **Seek Mentorship and Exposure**: Find leaders and experienced individuals within or outside your organization who exemplify good product management practices and learn from them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:03">[01:16:03]</a>.
*   **Consider Internal or External Moves**: If your current organization doesn't support genuine product management, consider moving laterally within a large corporation to a different business unit or seeking opportunities at companies that are software-first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:52">[01:01:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:32">[01:01:32]</a>.

## The Evolution and Future of Product Management

The core of agile methodologies is about moving quickly and delivering great value to customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:27">[01:17:27]</a>. Rigid processes that hinder this agility, like those that lead to "work about work" instead of actual results, should be questioned and adapted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:17">[01:19:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:01">[01:20:01]</a>.

While large, non-software native companies face unique [[challenges_and_responsibilities_in_product_management | challenges]], they can still learn from successful software companies. The key is to adapt principles, not dogmatically apply identical processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:52">[01:20:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:10">[01:21:10]</a>. The [[the_evolution_and_future_of_product_management | evolution of product management]] dictates that digital and software strategies are becoming increasingly intertwined with overall company strategies, making a strong product focus at the C-suite level essential for long-term success and innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:15">[01:22:15]</a>.

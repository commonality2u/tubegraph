Nikita Beer, a seasoned app developer and entrepreneur, holds a controversial view regarding [[Product management and innovation | product management]], stating that he doesn't believe it's "real" [00:00:04]. His perspective is largely shaped by his experience as a Product Manager at Facebook, where he observed a significant disconnect between the perceived role and the actual responsibilities within a large tech company.

## The Role of a Product Manager in Large Tech Companies

Nikita's tenure as a [[Role of Product Managers | Product Manager]] at Facebook revealed that there was "very little [[Product management and innovation | product management]] that you do" [01:03:04]. His observation points to a departure from traditional expectations:
*   **Administrative Focus** [[Product management misconceptions | Product Managers]] are primarily involved in "writing a documents" and acting as "the team secretary and running around getting approvals" from various cross-functional teams like legal and privacy [00:01:07], [00:01:10], [01:04:16], [01:04:29].
*   **Detachment from Design** In large tech companies, [[Role of Product Managers | Product Managers]] are often "completely detached from the design process" [01:06:06], [01:07:09], [01:07:22]. Design is handled by a separate "design vertical of org" [01:00:02], which means PMs aren't typically involved in "designing the hierarchy, the pixels, the flows" [00:01:17], [01:07:47]. This was particularly challenging for Nikita, who considers himself a designer at his core [01:04:09], [01:07:19].
*   **Data Analysis by Others** [[Role of Product Managers | Product Managers]] often do not directly analyze data, as this is handled by data scientists [01:04:24]. PMs may only "parsing some of the reports that they get back" [01:04:27].

Nikita describes the environment at Facebook as almost "academic" regarding social network development, with extensive studies on user retention and system processes [01:05:57], [01:06:28]. However, despite this rigorous approach, the hands-on [[Product management and innovation | product management]] work is limited.

## [[Challenges and Strategies in Product Management | Challenges]] of [[Product management and innovation | Product Management]] in Large Companies

Building "zero to one" products (completely new initiatives) within a large company like Facebook proved "much much more difficult" [01:11:13] than in a startup environment. Several factors contribute to this:

*   **Risk Aversion and Verbalization Difficulty** It's challenging to verbalize and present unconventional ideas for new products to seasoned professionals and VPs who may care about "how something might reflect on them personally" [01:10:07], [01:11:31], [01:11:41]. Ideas driven by "hunches" are hard to defend without existing market signals [01:11:13], [01:11:41].
    *   For instance, an app for teens to flirt would likely not be presented to a group of "McKenzie Consultants" [01:11:31].
    *   This environment incentivizes copying existing successful products rather than innovating entirely new concepts, as presenting a "number one app in the United States and we don't own it" [01:11:13] is a more defensible position if a project fails [01:11:41].
*   **Slow Response to Market Signals** Large companies take a significant amount of time to respond to competitive threats or new market opportunities. The process can involve:
    1.  A Product Manager making a post about a trending app [01:11:55].
    2.  Market research teams conducting studies [01:11:55].
    3.  Developing framing decks and getting VP reviews [01:11:55].
    4.  Development taking "six to 12 months" [01:11:55].
    5.  Realistically, most large companies take "12 to 24 months to respond to competitive threats in the market" [01:11:55].
*   **Regulatory Scrutiny and Scale** While large companies abstract away concerns about funding and legal bills [01:12:00], they introduce "regulatory stuff that you have to deal with" [01:12:09], which can be burdensome for product development [01:12:00].

### Alternative Approaches

Nikita notes that companies like Snapchat and Apple have a different organizational structure where "designers run the show" [01:50:00]. This approach has led to "novel products" [01:50:03], but it also presents its own set of problems, as the sheer "force of will" [01:50:14] required to launch a product in a large organization (due to regulatory scrutiny and scaling) still necessitates someone to project manage [01:50:21].

## The "Not Real" Aspect of Product Management in Big Tech

Nikita's strong opinion that [[Product management and innovation | product management]] is "not real" in big tech stems from the PM's detachment from the core product development process [01:49:02]. For "zero to one initiatives" and standalone apps, he believes the PM should be "designing the hierarchy, the pixels, the flows" [01:51:18]. Products "live and die in the pixels" [01:51:28], making the PM's direct involvement in design crucial, especially for consumer products [01:51:31]. While some might argue this view is exaggerated, particularly for growth initiatives, it highlights a fundamental difference from the startup world where PMs are deeply embedded in design and data analysis [01:50:50].

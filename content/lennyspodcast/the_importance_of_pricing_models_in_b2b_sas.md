When discussing pricing, many people immediately focus on the dollar figures, which is merely a price point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. However, price should be viewed as a measure of value, similar to how a liter measures volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The core question is whether people genuinely want and would buy your product, leading to the entire [[willingness_to_pay_conversations_in_product_pricing | willingness to pay]] conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

For B2B SaaS companies, the "how you charge" is often more critical than "how much you charge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:06">[01:00:06]</a>. Focusing solely on the price point without considering the underlying [[unique_pricing_and_product_adoption_strategies | monetization model]] can lead to significant sub-optimization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:26">[01:02:26]</a>.

## Pricing Model Examples

The effectiveness of a pricing model can be illustrated by various examples, both within and outside the SaaS industry:

*   **Michelin Tires:** In the highly price-sensitive tire market, Michelin introduced a new, longer-lasting tire for moving trucks. Instead of asking for a 20% premium, they shifted their pricing model to charge based on the number of miles driven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:37">[01:00:37]</a>. Truckers favored this "pay as you go" model because it allowed them to invoice their end customers directly for tire costs, making it a variable expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:09">[01:01:09]</a>. This demonstrates that if a physical product like a tire can be sold on a consumption model, most software products can explore a similar route <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:52">[01:01:52]</a>.
*   **Segment (B2B SaaS):** Before its acquisition by Twilio, Segment initially priced its services based on the number of APIs. However, as they expanded to different personas within companies, the concept of an API became less clear to non-technical buyers like marketing personnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:30">[01:02:30]</a>. By working with consultants, they identified that "monthly tracked users" was a more intuitive and fairer metric, aligning with how customers perceived value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:48">[01:02:48]</a>. This change in the pricing metric, similar to Michelin's per-mile model, proved highly effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:05">[01:03:05]</a>.

## Choosing the Right Pricing Model

There are broadly three types of pricing strategies: skimming (premium pricing), penetration (volume-driven, low margins), and maximization (balanced approach) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:50">[00:53:50]</a>. Within these, B2B SaaS companies typically consider a few options for *how* to charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:17">[01:08:17]</a>:

*   **Subscription:** Best when customers demand predictable bills or usage is consistent month-over-month (e.g., Tide Pods) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:26">[01:04:26]</a>. Also suitable when usage is intermittent, but the value delivered is ongoing (e.g., LifeLock for identity theft protection) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:01">[01:05:01]</a>. It can simplify the pricing conversation (e.g., Spotify, Netflix) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:23">[01:05:23]</a>.
*   **Pay-as-you-go / Usage-based:** Makes sense when customers desire low commitment or less friction, fostering easier onboarding and growth (e.g., AWS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:45">[01:05:45]</a>. Ideal for variable usage or when customers demand transparency and fairness, even if it means less predictability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:58">[01:05:58]</a>. Also applicable when usage is intermittent and value is episodic (e.g., movie tickets, flights), or when underlying costs scale with usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:27">[01:06:27]</a>. Crucially, requires clear, trackable, and value-attributable metrics that customers agree upon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:50">[01:06:50]</a>.
*   **Freemium:** Offering a free version to attract users before converting them to paid tiers.
*   **Hybrid Models:** Combining fixed fees with usage-based components (e.g., HubSpot, marketplaces with platform fees and transaction breaks) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:10">[01:07:10]</a>.

> It's essential to deeply consider your specific business, customer base, and services provided to determine the most appropriate model, rather than just adopting what's currently in vogue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:30">[01:07:30]</a>.

### Price Metrics and Structure

Beyond the core model, consider the [[segmentation_and_its_impact_on_product_pricing_strategy | price metric]] (what measure you charge on, e.g., per seat, per user, per API call, per department) and the price structure (flat, tiered, two-dimensional) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:25">[01:08:25]</a>. A two-dimensional structure, for instance, could offer a better per-user price as more users and departments adopt the product, incentivizing "wall-to-wall" adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:11">[01:09:11]</a>.

## Testing Pricing Models

To determine the most effective pricing model, conduct break-even exercises with customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:45">[01:10:45]</a>. Present economically identical options (e.g., a 3% transaction fee vs. a flat fee plus a lower percentage) and observe which model customers prefer. While rational individuals should be indifferent, anecdotal evidence suggests people consistently choose one option over another, revealing underlying preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:15">[01:11:15]</a>.

## Navigating Downturns with Pricing Models

In economic slowdowns, strategic pricing model adjustments can help mitigate churn and retain customer relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:37">[01:28:37]</a>.

*   **Offer Lesser-Expensive Alternatives:** Instead of resorting to simple price discounts, which can set a new, lower price expectation for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:30">[01:29:30]</a>, offer a de-featured product version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:12">[01:29:12]</a>. This maintains price integrity by exchanging value for the lower cost, keeping customers within your ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:40">[01:29:40]</a>.
*   **Implement Non-Pricing Actions:** Provide more product value, adjust contract terms (e.g., longer commitments for stability), or modify payment terms (e.g., extended payment windows) instead of direct price reductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:09">[01:30:09]</a>.
*   **Shift Business Models:** Downturns can be opportune times to transition to an outcome-based or usage-based pricing model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:10">[01:31:10]</a>. If customers are using less of the product, a usage-based model might lead to lower bills, making it an attractive option during tough times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:27">[01:31:27]</a>. This allows for a smoother transition to a model that can recoup more value when economic conditions improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:38">[01:31:38]</a>.

By proactively considering and strategically implementing the right pricing model, B2B SaaS companies can better align with customer needs, drive adoption, and foster sustainable growth.

Will Larson, current CTO at Carta and former software engineering leader at Stripe, Uber, and Calm, shares insights into [[effective_leadership_and_strategic_thinking|engineering leadership]] and [[leadership_and_management_development|management development]] based on his extensive experience and writings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. He emphasizes the evolving landscape of the engineering field and strategic approaches to common challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

## Evolving Landscape of Engineering Leadership

The market has shifted significantly from the "zero interest rate era" to a more constrained environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. This change impacts how engineering leaders operate:

*   **Shift from Hiring Focus** Previously, engineering managers often spent half their time or more on hiring, sometimes conducting six back-to-back interviews daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. Now, this focus has shifted, with some doing two or zero interviews a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. Top performers previously defined by hiring prowess now need to demonstrate other competencies, such as leading teams, delving into details, and determining the right sizing for engineering teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.
*   **Treating Engineers as Peers** Historically, engineers were sometimes "coddled" or "sheltered" from critical business problems, leading to a perception of treating them like children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. In the current environment, there's an opportunity to treat engineers as peers, placing them in senior [[effective_leadership_and_strategic_thinking|leadership roles]] and holding them accountable for real problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. This accountability, which was previously challenging due to high retention concerns, allows engineers to grow and take on senior roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

## [[effective_leadership_and_strategic_thinking|Systems Thinking]]

[[effective_leadership_and_strategic_thinking|Systems thinking]] is a valuable approach, but it comes with a caveat: reality is always right, and your model is always wrong if it conflicts with reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

### Definition and Application
[[effective_leadership_and_strategic_thinking|Systems thinking]] involves conceptualizing situations in terms of "stocks" and "flows" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>:
*   **Stocks** are things that accumulate (e.g., number of fish in a lake, number of people fishing) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>.
*   **Flows** represent movement between stocks (e.g., fish decreasing due to fishing, fish reproducing) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>.

This approach helps in understanding how various components evolve over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.

### Example: Hiring Pipeline
Applying [[effective_leadership_and_strategic_thinking|systems thinking]] to a hiring pipeline involves:
*   **Stocks:** Potential candidates, sourced candidates, candidates in various interview stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>.
*   **Inflows/Conversions:** Sourcing, outreach, referrals, conversion rates at each stage (recruiter screen, hiring manager screen, offer stage) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.

By modeling this, organizations can identify bottlenecks:
*   **Hiring managers struggling with conviction:** Many candidates reach the offer stage, but few offers are extended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>.
*   **Offers not accepted:** Many offers extended, but few candidates accept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>.
*   **Insufficient candidates:** Good decision-making and closing, but not enough candidates entering the pipeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>.

Analyzing historical data against the model helps pinpoint where to focus efforts, preventing "big changes with no data" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>.

## [[engineering_productivity_and_strategy_evaluation|Engineering Strategy]]

Will Larson argues that while every function, including engineering, inherently has a strategy, it's often not written down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>.

### Importance of Documentation
Writing down a strategy allows for:
*   **Improvement:** A documented strategy can be debugged and refined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">[00:18:24]</a>.
*   **Consistency:** It helps ensure consistent application across different layers of the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>.

### "Boring Strategies"
Often, effective strategies are "boring" because they impose constraints, which can be initially frustrating for some engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>:
*   **Standardized Tools:** A good strategy for most companies is to use only the tools they already have (e.g., standard programming languages, databases, cloud providers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>. This focuses energy on valuable company problems rather than building new tooling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>.
    *   *Example: Stripe's Ruby Monolith:* Despite some engineers disliking it, this policy focused engineers on building innovative features for users, not on supporting different programming languages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:40">[00:23:40]</a>.
*   **Self-Owned Infrastructure:**
    *   *Example: Uber's Own Data Centers:* Uber's policy to use only its own data centers (not the cloud) was annoying but allowed rapid global expansion, such as spinning up in China in three months, bypassing geopolitical constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:07">[00:22:07]</a>.

These constraints enable faster movement and focus on what truly matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:20">[00:24:20]</a>. Bad strategy often stems from a "willful disbelief" of accurate diagnosis regarding constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:58">[00:24:58]</a>.

### Richard Rumelt's Definition of Strategy
Richard Rumelt's definition of strategy includes three components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:22">[00:21:22]</a>:
1.  **Diagnosis:** What is the current status quo and reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:25">[00:21:25]</a>.
2.  **Guiding Policies:** How to address the diagnosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>.
3.  **Actions:** How to implement those guiding policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:37">[00:21:37]</a>.

Larson notes that for engineering, strategy is often about clarifying how future decisions will be made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>.

## [[engineering_and_product_management_integration|Improving PM-Eng Relationships]]

The core problems in Engineering Manager (EM) and Product Manager (PM) relationships are often misaligned incentives and a lack of mutual understanding of each other's needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:39">[00:41:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:55">[00:42:55]</a>.

### Understanding Needs
Before attempting to resolve conflict, ensure a deep understanding of what the other person truly cares about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:04">[00:43:04]</a>. Often, there's a compromise solution that satisfies everyone's needs without extra time, but it requires willingness to dig deeper beyond stated desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:27">[00:43:27]</a>.

### Aligned Incentives
A powerful strategy is to force the idea that EM-PM pairs should generally have the same performance rating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:06">[00:44:06]</a>. This drives shared perspective and accountability for the overall outcome, rather than just functional constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:50">[00:44:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:10">[00:45:10]</a>.

### EM's Invisible Constraints
PMs often don't realize that EMs are stressed about giving their teams interesting work, which can sometimes conflict with product goals like shipping many "boring" experiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:08">[00:47:08]</a>. This invisible constraint can make EMs seem unreliable. Understanding these underlying pressures allows for more honest conversations and navigating trade-offs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:50">[00:47:50]</a>.

## [[engineering_productivity_and_strategy_evaluation|Measuring Engineering Productivity]]

The question of measuring engineering productivity is increasingly important, especially with a focus on efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:45">[00:48:45]</a>.

### Approaches
1.  **Benchmarking against Funding:** A mechanical way to compare R&D and engineering spend with industry benchmarks from VC funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:16">[00:49:16]</a>. This provides a defensible answer for boards but doesn't offer insights for effective organizational management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:55">[00:49:55]</a>.
2.  **Talking to Engineers:** Engineers usually know if their teams are effective and why. Leaders can "trace the crumbs" from their complaints to diagnose contributing causes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:31">[00:50:31]</a>.
3.  **Aligning with Business/Product Goals:** Engineering evaluation should be wholly accountable to product goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:30">[00:51:30]</a>.
4.  **Showcasing Impactful Work:** Demonstrating a roadmap of "meaningful, meaty things that have impact" in the last six months is powerful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:03">[00:52:03]</a>. If this list is empty, concerns are valid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:30">[00:52:30]</a>.

### Metrics and Tools
*   **DORA Metrics:** Influential in *Accelerate* by Nicole Forsgren, Gene Kim, and Jez Humble, these four metrics (lead time, incident remediation time, failure rate, and deployment frequency) are excellent diagnostic tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:51">[00:52:51]</a>. They indicate where to focus improvements but don't directly determine if a company is "good" or "bad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:30">[00:53:30]</a>.
*   **Embrace Imperfection:** Engineers often dismiss metrics because they're not perfect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:23">[00:54:23]</a>. However, it's crucial to get comfortable measuring *something*, even if imperfect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:41">[00:54:41]</a>. Imperfect metrics provide an opportunity to educate stakeholders on nuances and the "rich data underneath" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:50">[00:54:50]</a>.

## Defining Company Values

When defining company values, it's essential to ensure they are:

1.  **Honest:** Values must genuinely reflect what the company actually does, not just what it aspires to be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:07">[00:57:07]</a>. If actions contradict stated values (e.g., claiming "users first" but not acting on it), it undermines trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:56">[00:56:56]</a>.
2.  **Applicable:** Values should be useful in navigating real-world decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:33">[00:57:33]</a>.
    *   *Example: "Optimize Globally" (Stripe) vs. "Do What's Good for Your Team" (Uber):* These opposing values clearly dictated how decisions should be made within each organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:47">[00:57:47]</a>.
3.  **Reversible:** A value should have a plausible opposite or show who wouldn't fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:01">[00:59:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:39">[01:00:39]</a>. If its opposite is absurd (e.g., "we build bad software," "we don't solve customer problems that matter"), it's likely an "identity value" that describes who you want to be but isn't useful for decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:05">[00:59:05]</a>.
    *   *Example:* "Integrity" is an identity value, as no company would claim to be anti-integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:32">[01:01:32]</a>.
    *   *Example:* Netflix's "we're a team, not a family" is reversible, clarifying that not everyone fits their culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:12">[01:00:12]</a>.

Companies often have too many values (e.g., 17) and should aim for a memorable few (e.g., four) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:23">[01:01:23]</a>.

## [[challenges_and_strategies_in_product_management|Failure Story]]: Dig V4 Rewrite

Will Larson recounted his experience at Dig, particularly the problematic "Dig V4" rewrite around 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:22">[01:02:22]</a>.

### Background and Decision
Dig faced competition from social networks like Twitter and Facebook, necessitating a move towards social functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:12">[01:03:12]</a>. The existing version couldn't support this, leading to a decision to undertake a complete rewrite, a decision Larson notes "never works out for anyone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:49">[01:03:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:51">[01:03:51]</a>.

### The Catastrophic Launch
The launch involved wiping and re-imaging existing servers, but the new site kept crashing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:41">[01:04:41]</a>. It took approximately a month to get the site fully functional again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:52">[01:04:52]</a>. During the initial days, engineers had to write a caching system from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:20">[01:05:20]</a>. For about three weeks, every server required a restart every 12 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:39">[01:05:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:43">[01:05:43]</a>. The core bug was eventually identified as a "super silly" issue related to how Python initiates variables used as default parameters, missed due to a developer unfamiliar with Python <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:51">[01:05:51]</a>.

### Lessons Learned
Despite the heroic efforts to stabilize the site, the company still "went to zero" from a business perspective, largely due to an earlier SEO change that dramatically reduced traffic and monetization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:58">[01:06:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:40">[01:09:40]</a>. However, this period was immensely formative for Larson's career:
*   He learned a tremendous amount about software and operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:04">[01:07:04]</a>.
*   He became a manager within two and a half years of his career, effectively running the entire engineering team as many others left or were laid off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:16">[01:07:16]</a>. This accelerated his [[leadership_and_management_development|leadership and management development]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:42">[01:07:42]</a>.

Such challenging experiences, though difficult in the moment, often become the most powerful for learning and bonding with colleagues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:50">[01:07:50]</a>.

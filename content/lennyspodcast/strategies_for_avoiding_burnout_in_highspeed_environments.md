Working in a high-speed environment is often perceived as a direct path to burnout. However, Jeff Charles, VP of Product at Ramp, suggests that velocity, when managed correctly, can actually be a way to [[worklife_balance_and_avoiding_burnout_for_leaders | avoid burnout]] by fostering impact and flow states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:52">[02:51:52]</a>.

## Velocity as an Antidote to Burnout

Contrary to popular belief, Jeff argues that burnout often occurs when individuals put a lot of effort into tasks that don't lead to progress or impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:53">[02:59:53]</a>. High velocity, by enabling quick execution and tangible results, can help mitigate this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:04">[03:04:04]</a>.

### Impact and Flow State
The key to avoiding burnout lies in feeling a sense of impact and achieving a "flow state" where work becomes thrilling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:15">[03:00:15]</a>. Organizations that make it difficult to enter this flow state, through excessive distractions or cross-functional demands, contribute to burnout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:30">[03:30:30]</a>. Jeff likens it to runners who love running, where the activity itself isn't a chore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:08">[03:08:08]</a>.

### Meaningful Work and Empowerment
For individuals to feel good about the effort they're putting in, the work must be meaningful to *them*, not just to their superiors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>. Management's role is to ensure every team member feels the company's goals are *their* goals, giving them problems to solve and empowering them with solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:52">[03:19:52]</a>. If teams feel the work is pushed onto them or they lack alignment and empowerment, burnout is inevitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:52">[03:19:52]</a>.

## Operationalizing Burnout Prevention
Ramp employs several strategies to maintain high velocity while preventing burnout at an organizational level:

### Reducing Low-Leverage Work and Meetings
A significant drain on productivity and morale comes from time-consuming, low-leverage activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.
*   **No Status Meetings:** Status updates are done asynchronously through operating systems and in real-time, freeing up meeting time for collaboration, ideation, and decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>.
*   **Cutting Process and Documents:** Adding excessive processes and documents to hold teams accountable can be highly demotivating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:58">[02:26:58]</a>.
*   **No Ticket Writing by PMs:** Product Managers don't write tickets; their contract is the vision, priority, and high-level spec, pushing the breakdown of work onto engineering teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:36">[00:59:36]</a>. This increases trust and speeds up execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:05">[01:00:05]</a>.

### Protecting Core Teams
Small, single-threaded teams with a clear focus are essential for velocity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:51">[00:59:51]</a>. To protect these teams from distractions and chaos:
*   **Dedicated Protectors:** Ramp uses rotational production engineers to shield core teams from escalations and bugs, and product operators to protect PMs from documentation, release management, and customer requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>.
*   **Autonomy for New Products:** Teams working on "big bets" or new products (zero-to-one) are typically pulled from different existing teams and have no responsibility for existing products, allowing them to focus entirely on their new goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.

### Quality Control Mechanisms
To ensure that high velocity doesn't compromise quality, Ramp has control mechanisms:
*   **Voice of Customer:** Every negative product review is shared monthly with the tech lead, PM, and designer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>.
*   **Operational Overhead:** Teams are measured on the percentage of support tickets originating from their product area, normalized by user count, and are expected to maintain a low burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:52">[02:21:52]</a>.
*   **Direct Bug Assignment:** Bugs are directly assigned to the on-call engineer, making them feel the impact and encouraging quick fixes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.
*   **User Confusion Metrics:** Support tickets due to customer confusion are tracked. If this number is elevated, teams are restricted from shipping new features until these issues are fixed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>.

## Setting Expectations and Managing Chaos
Ramp sets clear expectations for new hires: the environment will be somewhat chaotic, with frequent product changes and the need to constantly be on one's toes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>. This transparency helps people embrace the trade-off for innovation and value delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:30">[03:30:30]</a>.

While the specifics of product development may change, Ramp's core strategy and vision (e.g., being a spend management platform that helps companies spend less) remain consistent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. This long-term alignment helps prevent "thrash" where people feel like leaders are constantly changing their minds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:21">[03:20:21]</a>.

## Personal Strategies for Well-being

### [[strategies_to_improve_focus_and_productivity | Deep Work]]
To counter busyness, Jeff prioritizes "deep work" time, especially for complex problem-solving.
*   **Blocking Time:** Schedule dedicated blocks for deep thinking, typically outside of peak communication hours like early mornings, late afternoons, or even a weekend day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:50">[04:52:50]</a>.
*   **Structured Thinking:** For a tough question, write it down simply, then focus on answering it through personal thought before seeking external information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>. Writing clearly helps in thinking clearly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>.

### Health and Self-Care
Managing a team has a significant impact on physical and mental health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:09">[01:13:09]</a>. Jeff views being a leader at a high-growth startup like being an athlete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:19">[01:13:19]</a>. Tools like Whoop, which provide data-driven insights into recovery and health, can be valuable for focusing on well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:27">[01:12:27]</a>.

### Task Management and Digital Hygiene
To free up mental "headspace" for processing rather than memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:55">[01:55:55]</a>:
*   **Immediate Note-Taking:** At the end of every meeting, record tasks owed by oneself and others clearly, with deadlines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:51">[01:54:51]</a>.
*   **Daily Grooming:** Group tasks into logical chunks (tactical vs. strategic, important vs. less important) and send reminders for items owed by others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:31">[01:55:31]</a>.
*   **Minimize Interruptions:** Turn off notifications, check email only once a day, and check Slack only at the top of the hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:29">[01:14:29]</a>.
*   **Tool Proficiency:** Become highly proficient with the tools used daily (e.g., calendar, Slack, email) to optimize workflow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:05">[01:15:05]</a>.

## Conclusion
Ultimately, the ability to operate at high velocity without burning out is fundamentally linked to the quality and empowerment of the engineering and design talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:01">[02:59:01]</a>. Leaders must prioritize hiring top talent and then trust and empower them to deliver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:05">[01:00:05]</a>. Jeff advises listeners to "be kind to yourself" and maintain a growth mindset, continually thinking from first principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:05">[01:16:05]</a>.

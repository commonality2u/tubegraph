Many organizations often mistake issues as stemming from a lack of training for their personnel. However, it is frequently found that the actual problem lies in how goals are set and how [[product_management_strategies_and_frameworks | strategy]] is deployed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Without proper strategic context, even trained individuals lack direction on what to work towards, highlighting the need for a holistic approach to transformations and setting up a product organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

Melissa Perry, a renowned expert in product organizations, has observed more product organizations closely than possibly anyone else, having worked with over 4,000 product managers and more than 30 companies in deep consulting roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:11">[00:31:11]</a>. Her insights reveal that the most common problems product teams face, particularly in scaling SaaS companies, revolve around defining and deploying strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

## Identifying Lacking Product Strategy

A key challenge for scaling SaaS companies is transitioning from a single product to a multi-product portfolio and managing its complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. At this stage, companies often need to rethink and prioritize their entire strategy, a task many have not undertaken before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. Even successful companies that scale rapidly may plateau and face the same challenge of needing to re-prioritize and rethink their strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.

[[signs_of_a_lacking_or_poorly_implemented_product_strategy | Signs of a lacking or poorly implemented product strategy]] include:
*   **Lack of executive awareness** Executives and board members express that they "don't really know what's going on in tech or product" or if goals are being achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.
*   **Disconnected efforts** Teams are working intensely ("like dogs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>) but core business metrics are not improving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:08">[00:22:08]</a>. The product and tech functions appear as a "black box" to leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:13">[00:22:13]</a>.
*   **Missing Middle** A disconnect exists between high-level company vision and the day-to-day work of product teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>. Teams might know what they are building but not "why" it ladders up to company objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:28">[00:28:28]</a>.
*   **Lack of alignment** Different answers across the organization when asked about the vision or goals, indicating a lack of alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:50">[00:23:50]</a>. Executives may have different goals, leading to internal conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:51">[00:28:51]</a>.
*   **Unclear Vision** A company vision that is too vague (e.g., "be the backbone of healthcare" without elaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:03">[00:24:03]</a>) and doesn't clearly state future changes, unique value, or what the company will *not* do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:16">[00:24:16]</a>.

## Formulating a Product Strategy

When an organization realizes something is not working, but is unsure how to fix it, it's often a signal to either hire a strong leader or engage outside expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:19:59]</a>. [[Effective product management strategies | Effective product management strategies]] require taking action, even if it means drastic change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>.

A comprehensive strategy should include:
1.  **Vision** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:05">[00:31:05]</a>:
    *   Should be concrete enough for people to picture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:14">[00:36:14]</a>.
    *   Lofty, far enough away that it's not immediately achievable with one build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:39">[00:36:39]</a>.
    *   Not what the company is today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:52">[00:36:52]</a>.
    *   Clearly articulate how the company will be *different* from competitors and what it will *not* do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:09">[00:37:09]</a>.
    *   Define who future customers will be and how the value provided will change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:47">[00:37:47]</a>.
    *   Consider writing the vision as a two-pager or combining it with visual presentations and diagrams to show relationships and color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:46">[00:34:46]</a>.
2.  **Strategic Intents/Business Outcomes** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:53">[00:24:53]</a>:
    *   These are major business movers for the next two to three years (e.g., going up/down market, geographical expansion, entering new markets) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:02">[00:25:02]</a>.
    *   Clearly prioritize these at the executive level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:13">[00:25:13]</a>.
3.  **Product Initiatives** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:44">[00:31:44]</a>:
    *   Problem-oriented around big customer problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:51">[00:31:51]</a>.
    *   Usually made up of multiple epics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:57">[00:31:57]</a>.
    *   Authored by product leadership (directors, VPs) for their scope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:40">[00:31:40]</a>.
4.  **Solutions/Epics** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:12">[00:32:12]</a>:
    *   Tactical solutions product teams build to address product initiatives and strategic intents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:14">[00:32:14]</a>.

## Deploying and Improving Strategy

A well-deployed strategy ensures that product teams deeply understand how their work impacts the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:14">[00:28:14]</a>. Everyone should be telling the same story about what they are working on and why it contributes to specific customer and business value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:54">[00:27:54]</a>.

### Enhancing Strategic Thinking
To improve at strategy:
*   **Practice imagining:** Even if not in a strategic role, imagine what you would do if you were in the Chief Product Officer's (CPO) position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:18">[00:39:18]</a>. This builds experience in asking strategic questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:33">[00:39:33]</a>.
*   **Talk to leaders:** Understand their thought process, how they set priorities, and what data they analyze <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:53">[00:39:53]</a>.
*   **Engage with other departments:** Talk to sales about win-loss analyses and why competitors are chosen. Connect with other subject matter experts to understand market movements and innovations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:24">[00:40:24]</a>.
*   **Leverage data:** Strategy requires internal and external data. Internal data from financial systems and user analytics helps monitor strategy and decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:35">[00:41:35]</a>. External data from customer research and market research informs strategic direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:04">[00:46:04]</a>.
*   **Make decisions:** Don't wait for 100% certainty. Make the best informed decision possible, and be willing to correct course if data indicates it's the wrong one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:20">[00:42:20]</a>.
*   **Analyze others:** Study how successful companies developed their strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:24">[00:43:24]</a>. This reveals that different frameworks can work, as long as they involve asking the right questions, looking at data, and deeply understanding the market and customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:38">[00:43:38]</a>.

### The Role of Product Operations

As product management scales, challenges arise in standardization, career paths, and data accessibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:10">[00:44:10]</a>. This is where a dedicated product operations function becomes crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:13">[00:45:13]</a>.

Product operations typically comprises three areas:
*   **Internal Data & Insights** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:34">[00:45:34]</a>: Helps surface data from various internal systems to monitor strategy, track OKRs, and inform decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:50">[00:45:50]</a>.
*   **Customer Research & User Insights** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:04">[00:46:04]</a>: Focuses on external data, market research, and standardizing approaches to customer interviews to ensure efficiency and avoid customer fatigue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:28">[00:46:28]</a>. It scales user research to enable more people to conduct it effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:51">[00:46:51]</a>.
*   **Standardizing Processes & Cadences** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:31">[00:47:31]</a>: Defines rhythms for strategic check-ins, roadmap updates, and planning sessions. It standardizes processes that touch other divisions (e.g., sales, product marketing) to ensure smooth collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:35">[00:47:35]</a>. It does not dictate internal team processes like stand-ups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:10">[00:48:10]</a>.

### Continuous Learning for Product Managers
To avoid burnout from the abundance of information and to continuously improve:
*   **Focus on execution:** Learn by doing your job first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:34">[00:49:34]</a>.
*   **Self-reflect:** Analyze what's working and not working in your role, then choose specific areas for deep dives to fill skill gaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:40">[00:49:40]</a>.
*   **Adapt frameworks:** Understand the basic product framework (talking to users, working with teams, testing, iterating, measuring success) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:58">[00:50:58]</a>, but adapt specific processes (like agile) if they don't serve your needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:41">[00:51:41]</a>. Everything should be iterated on and adapted if it doesn't work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:47">[00:51:47]</a>.

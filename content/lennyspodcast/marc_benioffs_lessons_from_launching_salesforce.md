Marc Benioff, co-founder and CEO of Salesforce, attributes much of the company's enduring success to the lessons learned during its initial launch. Salesforce, now the second-largest B2B SaaS company globally, worth around $350 billion at the time of recording and making $35 billion a year in revenue, employed unconventional and memorable tactics to gain attention in a "noisy world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>.

## The Legendary Launch Event (February 22, 2000)

The launch of Salesforce in 2000 is considered one of the most legendary in startup history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>. At the time, Salesforce aimed to convince people that the future of software was in the cloud (SaaS), not on the desktop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>. To achieve this, Benioff's team executed a highly disruptive marketing campaign:

*   **"End of Software" Campaign** Salesforce utilized "end of software" logos and mascots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>.
*   **Fake Protests at Siebel Conference** During Siebel Systems' user conference in San Francisco, Salesforce hired actors to stage a protest outside the venue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>.
    *   The actors carried picket signs with slogans like "the end software is near" and "no software" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>.
    *   To amplify the impact, other actors in a van posed as a news crew ("K-NMS - No More Software"), interviewing the "protesters," leading Siebel's CEO, Tom Siebel, to call the police, mistaking it for a legitimate media event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>.
*   **Grand Launch Event** The same night, Salesforce held its own large launch event at a top theater in San Francisco, featuring a well-known band <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>.

While these tactics might seem "frivolous," Benioff believes they were crucial for getting the name out and differentiating Salesforce in a crowded market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>.

## Key Lessons from the Launch

Benioff outlines several core [[Entrepreneurship lessons and strategies | entrepreneurial strategies]] and principles derived from Salesforce's early days and applied to subsequent launches:

### Throw Everything Against the Wall
The core philosophy is to try many things and see what resonates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Benioff states, "I am looking to try to find the winning tactic and turn it into a winning strategy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>. This approach involves:
*   **Continuous Experimentation:** Like comedian Chris Rock testing jokes in clubs before a Netflix special, entrepreneurs should test many ideas to see what works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:43">[00:22:43]</a>.
*   **Avoiding Arrogance:** Do not assume one specific thing will definitively work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:01">[00:24:01]</a>.

### Cultivating a Beginner's Mind
Benioff emphasizes the importance of maintaining a "beginner's mind" (Japanese: *shoshin*) to remain open to possibilities and new ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:23">[00:23:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:13">[00:52:13]</a>.
*   "In the beginner's mind I have every possibility, but in the expert's mind I have few and in some cases maybe none" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>.
*   This mindset helps in assessing how to move forward, evolve, inspire, and motivate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>.

### Being an Orchestra Leader, Not Just One Instrument
For entrepreneurs, it's crucial to manage all aspects of the business simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:14">[00:45:14]</a>. Success is not just about product, sales, or marketing; it's about harmonizing all stakeholders: investors, employees, and customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:02">[00:45:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:49">[00:45:49]</a>.

## Applying Lessons to New Initiatives: Agent Force

Benioff applies these same principles to current [[Salesforces innovation and future direction | Salesforce's innovation and future direction]], such as the launch of Agent Force, a new AI product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:18:54]</a>.
*   **Going "All In":** He aims to get the entire company and its customers focused on Agent Force, recognizing a "window of opportunity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>.
*   **Diverse Marketing Tactics:** This includes commissioning ads with celebrities Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson, using help.salesforce.com to showcase the product, training salespeople, and aggressive marketing against competitors like Microsoft's Co-pilot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>.
*   **Expansion of Distribution:** Hiring 1,000 to 2,000 additional account executives specifically for Agent Force to ensure broad reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:36">[00:21:36]</a>.
*   **Customer Stories:** Emphasizing telling customer success stories, like that of Disney, to highlight the product's impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>.
*   **Engaging the Ecosystem:** Encouraging Salesforce's millions of "Trailblazers" to become "Agent Blazers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:16">[00:25:16]</a>.
*   **Activating Existing Customers:** Motivating Salesforce's 135,000 customers to activate the new product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:26">[00:25:26]</a>.

## The Journey is the Reward

Benioff discourages obsessing over stock prices, viewing them as a distraction. He believes "the stock isn't the goal...the journey is the reward," a sentiment he shared with Steve Jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:28">[00:30:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:50">[00:30:50]</a>. He still considers Salesforce a "startup," regardless of its size, emphasizing a constant state of innovation and growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:03">[00:31:03]</a>. The entrepreneurial life is a "rollercoaster," marked by continuous challenges and transformations, rather than a linear path to success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:50">[00:49:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:24">[00:50:24]</a>. This requires a "growth mindset" and an embrace of continuous improvement, or "Kaizen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:07">[00:52:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:20">[00:52:20]</a>.

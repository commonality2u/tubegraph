From: [[lennyspodcast]] <br/> 

Naomi Gleit, Head of Product at Meta, is the company's longest-serving executive after Mark Zuckerberg, having joined as employee number 29 at Facebook (now Meta) almost 20 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. She has witnessed the company scale from 30 employees to a $1.5 trillion business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. As Head of Product, she feels responsible for Meta's entire Product Manager (PM) community, focusing on PM performance, culture, onboarding, and training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>. Gleit views PMs as a significant point of leverage for accomplishing company goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>. Her approach to [[improving_product_management_skills | product management]] is characterized by several key principles, often referred to as "Naomi-isms."

## Core Principles for Product Management

### Frameworks for [[Product management strategies and frameworks | Extreme Clarity]]

Gleit strongly believes in using frameworks to drive [[Product management strategies and frameworks | extreme clarity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. [[Product management strategies and frameworks | Extreme Clarity]] ensures that everyone has the same understanding of the facts, even if they disagree on the best path forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:15">[00:49:15]</a>. This approach minimizes misunderstandings and allows conversations to focus on substantive disagreements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:45">[00:49:45]</a>.

### Canonical Everything

A crucial element of achieving clarity is having "canonical everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:09">[00:50:09]</a>. This includes:

*   **Canonical Nomenclature:** Establishing a shared vocabulary with defined terms to prevent confusion from different words describing the same things (e.g., distinguishing "consistency" from "accuracy" in performance metrics) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:11">[00:50:11]</a>.
*   **Canonical Documents:** Every project should have one central, canonical document that serves as the single source of truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:33">[00:53:33]</a>. This document should link to all other related documentation and contain essential information like:
    *   Discrete areas of work (workstreams) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:08">[00:54:08]</a>.
    *   Single-threaded owners (STOs) for each workstream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:11">[00:54:11]</a>.
    *   The team's agreed-upon process for working together (e.g., canonical meetings, email lists, chat groups) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:49">[00:54:49]</a>.
*   **Canonical Visuals:** Using visual representations of frameworks and real-time editing slides during meetings to document decisions and next steps clearly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:07">[00:51:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:04">[00:55:04]</a>. Numbered lists are preferred over bulleted lists for easy reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:25">[00:52:25]</a>.

### Simplification and the "School Pyramid"

When tackling complex or "gnarly" projects, Gleit focuses on simplification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:07">[00:45:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:12">[00:56:12]</a>. This involves:

*   **Understanding at a "Kindergarten Level":** Breaking down complexity to its most basic building blocks before adding details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:41">[00:56:41]</a>.
*   **School Pyramid:** Creating a curriculum for every level of the project's understanding, from kindergarten to PhD, to ensure everyone on the team is on the same page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:07">[00:57:07]</a>.

### Prioritizing Perfect Execution

Gleit emphasizes achieving "perfect execution" on projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:41">[00:58:41]</a>. The rationale is that only with perfect execution can one accurately evaluate whether the strategy was correct or flawed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:48">[00:58:48]</a>. This prevents ambiguity when a project fails, clarifying if the issue was strategy or poor execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>.

### The PM as a Conductor

Gleit's primary metaphor for a PM is a "conductor" of an orchestra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:54">[00:45:54]</a>.

*   **Orchestra Analogy:** The product team is an orchestra with various functions (legal, policy, comms, data analytics, engineering, design) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:20">[00:46:20]</a>. Just as a conductor ensures each instrument plays its part while maintaining harmony and tempo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:34">[00:46:34]</a>, a PM ensures team members are playing their roles correctly and working together cohesively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:36">[00:46:36]</a>.
*   **Behind-the-Scenes Leadership:** The PM is not the "star of the show" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:10">[00:47:10]</a>; conductors often don't say anything during a performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:14">[00:47:14]</a>. This reflects a leadership style that focuses on elevating the team and leading from behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:43">[01:18:43]</a>. However, there are times when the PM needs to step forward and provide more vocal direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:09">[01:19:09]</a>.

### Developing a Strong First-Party Perspective

PMs should develop their own "first-party perspective" rather than simply delegating thinking or outsourcing their viewpoint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:24">[01:21:24]</a>.

*   **Dedicated Thinking Time:** This requires blocking out significant time (e.g., two to three hours) for strategic thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:07">[01:23:07]</a>.
*   **Sparring Partners:** Engaging with one or two trusted individuals (e.g., a chief of staff or head of data) can help clarify thinking and bounce ideas, which is more effective than large meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:18">[01:23:18]</a>.

## Lessons from Facebook's Growth Team

Gleit played a key role in Facebook's early growth team, which pioneered many techniques now common in tech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[00:02:57]</a>.

### The Power of Retention and Activation Metrics

*   **Shifting Focus:** The growth team initially focused on acquisition but realized that retention was a much bigger lever for net growth, as churn and resurrection lines were larger than new user acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:56">[02:26:56]</a>.
*   **"7 Friends in 10 Days":** This legendary activation metric (or 10 friends in 14 days) represented the point at which a user's likelihood of retention significantly increased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:24">[02:26:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:39">[02:39:39]</a>. The specific numbers were less important than having a clear, rallying goal that everyone could optimize for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>.
*   **Product-Driven Growth:** The team championed the idea that product and engineering, not just marketing, were the biggest drivers of growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:28">[02:29:28]</a>. This led to optimizing registration, invite flows, and new user onboarding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:36">[02:29:36]</a>.

### The "Understand, Identify, Execute" Framework

In 2009, the growth team paused all roadmap items except data instrumentation to establish a data-driven approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:13">[02:30:13]</a>.

1.  **Understand:** Instrumenting every step of the registration and onboarding flows to understand user behavior and drop-off points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:18">[02:30:18]</a>.
2.  **Identify:** Pinpointing key opportunities for growth based on the data (e.g., a 20% drop-off at the email confirmation step) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:28">[02:30:28]</a>.
3.  **Execute:** Building products to address identified opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:48">[02:30:48]</a>.

This product-driven, data-driven approach was extended beyond growth to other areas like social impact, where a product-based fundraising model replaced a traditional foundation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:01">[02:31:01]</a>. Similarly, Facebook's community-driven translation feature allowed users to translate the site in-line, supporting over 100 languages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:51">[02:32:51]</a>.

### Removing Barriers (Macro and Micro)

Growth efforts focused on removing barriers for users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:31">[02:39:31]</a>.

*   **Macro Barriers:** Expanding access to Facebook beyond college students to high schoolers, work networks, and eventually anyone with an email address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:50">[02:39:50]</a>. This also included addressing issues like smartphone access or internet affordability (e.g., Internet.org) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:14">[02:40:14]</a>.
*   **Micro Barriers:** Optimizing product flows to reduce friction. An example is allowing users to confirm their account by clicking *any* notification, not just a specific confirmation email, thus proving ownership and removing a minor barrier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:42">[02:40:42]</a>.
*   **Importance of Onboarding:** The need for a new user onboarding experience became apparent as Facebook expanded beyond college campuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:05">[02:35:05]</a>. This onboarding guided users through essential steps like uploading a profile picture and finding friends, directly driving the activation metric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:10">[02:36:10]</a>.

## Running Effective Meetings

Meetings are viewed as high-value, high-cost uses of time, and Gleit employs specific tactics to maximize their productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:58">[01:06:58]</a>.

*   **Pre-reads and Agendas:** Send a pre-read and agenda at least 24 hours before the meeting. Some leaders will even cancel meetings if the pre-read isn't provided on time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:05">[01:07:05]</a>.
*   **Real-Time Editing:** Use a visual aid (e.g., a slide deck) and edit it in real-time during the meeting to document decisions and next steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:55">[01:07:55]</a>. This ensures [[Product management strategies and frameworks | extreme clarity]] and prevents post-meeting confusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:15">[01:08:15]</a>.
*   **Decision-Focused:** Meetings should ideally be decision-making sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:04">[01:08:04]</a>. For decisions, present three options with a clear recommendation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:08">[01:08:08]</a>.
*   **Traffic Light Evaluation:** Instead of flat pros and cons lists, use a "traffic light" table to evaluate options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:47">[01:09:47]</a>. Rows represent options, columns represent criteria (e.g., legal, policy, privacy, product, engineering feasibility), and cells are color-coded (red, yellow, green) based on how each option stacks up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:05">[01:10:05]</a>. This visual approach allows for quick understanding and structured input from different functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:39">[01:10:39]</a>.
*   **Post-Meeting Notes:** Send meeting notes, decisions, and next steps via "reply all" to the calendar invite within 24 hours after the meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:30">[01:08:30]</a>. The calendar invite serves as the canonical unit for communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:40">[01:08:40]</a>.

## Supporting Personal Habits

Gleit emphasizes the importance of personal habits that support her professional performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:35">[01:12:35]</a>:

*   **Four Must-Haves:** Eat, sleep, alone time, and exercise are essential for optimal performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:50">[01:12:50]</a>.
*   **Prioritizing Sleep:** Using tools like eight sleep mattresses, eye masks, and blackout shades to ensure high-quality sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:01">[01:13:01]</a>.
*   **Non-Negotiable Exercise:** Starting every morning with a workout is a non-negotiable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:32">[01:13:32]</a>. Exercise provides significant mental health benefits and teaches valuable lessons about tackling hard things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:37">[01:14:37]</a>.
*   **"Stand Up Into Your Fear":** A surfing lesson that applies to life and work: commit to a challenge and push through fear rather than pulling back, as hesitation can be more counterproductive and unsafe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:36">[01:35:36]</a>.
*   **"Pressure is Privilege":** A life motto that reminds her to be grateful for challenging opportunities, even when feeling nervous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:12">[01:33:12]</a>.

## Mark Zuckerberg's Leadership Insights

Gleit's long tenure has given her unique insights into Mark Zuckerberg's leadership:

*   **"Learn-it-all, not a know-it-all":** Zuckerberg is characterized by his rapid upskilling, mastering new areas quickly (e.g., Chinese, MMA, public speaking) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:47">[01:15:47]</a>.
*   **"Small Group" Dynamics:** His core executive team, known as the "small group," is largely composed of long-tenured individuals motivated by Meta's mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:09">[01:21:09]</a>. They are often "disagreeable givers"—people who are motivated to do what's best for the company but aren't afraid to push back or provide direct, honest feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:31">[01:21:31]</a>. This culture ensures an accurate feedback loop for leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:05">[01:23:05]</a>.
*   **Structured Meetings:** The "small group" has both a weekly strategic meeting (open-ended discussion) and a weekly operational meeting (highly structured, with project owners speaking to weekly updates) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:27">[01:25:27]</a>.

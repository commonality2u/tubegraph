The relationship between tools and [[maximizing_human_potential_and_personal_growth | human potential]] is cyclical: tools are extensions of humans, and once shaped and brought into existence, they can in turn shape their creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:25">[01:13:25]</a>. This idea is central to the philosophy behind Notion, which aims to amplify creativity and beauty in software by allowing more people to create software tools for their daily work and life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:43">[06:44:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:41">[01:04:41]</a>.

## Augmenting Human Intellect

The vision for Notion was influenced by early computing pioneers from the 1960s and 70s, such as Douglas Engelbart and Alan Kay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:14:00">[08:14:00]</a>. For these pioneers, there was no separation between builders and users; computing was seen as a single, malleable medium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:34:00">[08:34:00]</a>.

Engelbart's paper, "Augmenting Human Intellect," inspired the idea that making software or knowing how to code and [[the_importance_of_design_in_modern_products | design]] is the "highest leverage thing" one can do for others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:00">[08:41:00]</a>. This means giving people the ability to use computing to enhance their problem-solving abilities or intellect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52:00">[08:52:00]</a>.

A key point of inspiration comes from Xerox Parc's Alto system, which ran Smalltalk, where everything was malleable and there was no concept of separate applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:00">[09:30:00]</a>. Steve Jobs, while impressed by the graphical user interface, reportedly missed the underlying power of this object-oriented environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:18:00">[10:18:00]</a>. This led to a conventional application framework being adopted for personal computing, rather than the more flexible Smalltalk approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31:00">[10:31:31]</a>. Notion's goal is to enable a return to that original vision of software creation for everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>.

## Balancing Vision and Market Needs

Notion's initial concept was to build a developer tool that would allow everyone to create software easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. However, after two years, it became clear that most people don't care about creating software to optimize their work; they simply need to get their jobs done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>.

The key realization was to "hide the vision" (everyone can create their software) within a "form factor that people do care" about: productivity software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>. This is metaphorically described as giving people "sugar" (productivity tools) with "broccoli" (the underlying software creation power) hidden inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>.

> "The first version of Notion was more about what I wanted than what people wanted." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>

Building a product or business involves a balance between having users and revenue (building for winning in the market) and building something that aligns with one's personal values and aesthetic (building for what one wants the world to have) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>.

*   Too much focus on oneself or "art project" results in no users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>.
*   Too much focus on business leads to building a commodity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>.

The most fulfilling and durable energy source comes from creating something authentic to oneself that also happens to be useful for others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.

## The Craft of Product Design

Notion's philosophy emphasizes "craft and values." Craft refers to applying one's values to technical know-how to make clever trade-offs and create something new and useful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. This mindset is applied to building the product, the business, and the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>.

[[the_importance_of_design_in_modern_products | Design]] is also critical, extending to the physical workspace. Offices should be pleasant and inspiring, feeling more like an artist's studio or a home to foster [[leveraging_creativity_through_extreme_product_design | creativity]] and ease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>. This includes thoughtful choices like wall colors, lighting, and furniture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>.

Conference rooms at Notion are named after timeless tools in history (e.g., iPhone, Macintosh, Lamy 2000 pens, Toshiba rice cooker, Sony transistor radio) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>. This is meant to inspire the team to create software products that last for decades and fundamentally change how people interact with the world, much like these physical tools did <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.

> "The problem is that there's just a tremendous amount of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product." â€“ Steve Jobs, quoted by Ivan Zhao <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>

### Abstraction and Trade-offs
[[leveraging_first_principles_thinking_in_product_management | Understanding abstraction]] and systems is crucial for product success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>. A small kernel of code, like a hundred lines of Lisp-inspired code in Smalltalk, can compound and unlock immense value, similar to how math can lead to complex behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>. This allows for quick recovery from "sunk costs" by finding a better way to build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>.

Product and business makers constantly face trade-offs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>. This involves deciding what to give up based on market demands and new technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>. New technologies, like AI language models, are seen as new "materials" (e.g., aluminum enabling mass air travel) that unlock new ways of making trade-offs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>.

## Tools Shaping Humans

The core belief is that "we shape our tools, thereafter our tools shape us" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:09">[01:03:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:30">[01:03:30]</a>. The question becomes whether the tools being brought into the world extend the "good" parts of human nature or the "zero-sum" or negative aspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:54">[01:03:54]</a>.

Notion, described as "Lego for software," aims to amplify [[leveraging_creativity_through_extreme_product_design | creativity]] and beauty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:09">[01:04:09]</a>. This aligns with the idea that these are fundamental human natures that are worth amplifying through software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:21">[01:04:21]</a>. The most fulfilling experience for a toolmaker is seeing users create their living by selling Notion templates or apps, even without being software engineers, thus fulfilling the original mission of enabling more people to create software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:25">[01:05:25]</a>.

The ability to look beyond the immediate tech sphere and draw ideas from other industries and historical patterns is seen as crucial for product makers to solve problems in new and interesting ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:29">[01:06:29]</a>.

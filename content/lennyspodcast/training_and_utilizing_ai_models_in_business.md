Marily Nika, a Product Lead at Meta focusing on metaverse avatars and identity, and a former Google employee who worked on Google Glass and machine learning in speech recognition, shares insights on how businesses can [[leveraging_ai_in_product_development | leverage AI in product development]] and effectively train and utilize AI models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. She also teaches a popular course on AI and product management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Strategic Approach to AI Adoption

Nika advises against falling into the "shiny object trap" of doing AI just for the sake of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Instead, businesses should ensure there's a specific problem or pain point that needs to be solved in a smart way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Once the problem and a high-level solution are identified, then the focus can shift to implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

> "Don't do AI for the sake of doing AI. Make sure there is a problem there, make sure there is a pain point that needs to be solved in a smart way." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>

For Product Managers (PMs), an AI PM focuses on solving the right problem, not just shipping a product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>. This means identifying a problem for which a data scientist can create a model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>.

## Role of AI in Product Management

Nika believes that in the future, all product managers will be AI product managers because every product will be AI by default <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>, requiring personalized experiences, effective recommender systems, and automation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.

This shift means product managers will need to:
*   **Collaborate with Research Scientists**: PMs must become comfortable working with research scientists who can produce smart models for automation, personalization, and recommendations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.
*   **Embrace Uncertainty**: AI projects, especially those involving research, often involve uncertainty. Unlike traditional product development with clear launch timelines, AI research might lead to shutting down projects if they don't yield expected results after a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. PMs need to get used to this uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.
*   **Focus on Desirability, Viability, and Feasibility**: A successful AI product is at the intersection of what's desirable by users, viable for the business, and feasible from a research scientist and technical perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.

### Practical Use of AI Tools for PMs

Marily Nika personally uses [[role_of_ai_in_enhancing_productivity_tools | AI tools]] like ChatGPT in her day-to-day workflow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
*   **Mission Statements**: ChatGPT can help rewrite mission statements to be understood and inspiring for all disciplines, including leadership, junior staff, stakeholders, and even competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.
*   **User Segmentation (Personas)**: ChatGPT can generate user segments that a human might not consider, providing motivations and pain points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. For example, when creating a fitness band without a screen, ChatGPT can suggest diverse interested parties like young professionals or those who dislike daily charging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.

## When to Invest in AI

### When AI is a Good Approach
AI can improve products by making them:
*   More secure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>
*   Personalized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>
*   Enhanced with features like fraud detection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>
*   More ethical (e.g., in healthcare) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>
*   Faster or more accurate (e.g., in shopping recommendations) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>

Essentially, any area with user behavior data can be improved with AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>. Businesses should start by assessing their data collection and dashboards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.

### When AI May Not Be a Good Approach
*   **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**: AI should not be used for an MVP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>. Training models with powerful machines can take weeks and is a waste of data scientists' time if the idea isn't validated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>. Instead, fake the AI functionality with a Figma prototype to gauge user interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>.
*   **Lack of Data**: AI should be used when there is existing data, or data from an adjacent product that can be leveraged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>. The amount of data needed varies:
    *   Simple classification (e.g., cat vs. dog photo) may only need 15-20 labeled photos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>.
    *   Complex applications like voice recognizers or NLP require thousands of data points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>.
    *   Startups often lack sufficient data to build their own models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>.

### Building vs. Using Pre-trained Models
Large tech companies offering services like speech recognition or their own GPT-like AI often need to train and refine their own models using more diverse data to maintain quality and differentiate from competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>. While data packages are available, using generic datasets results in similar quality across companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>.

For many applications, especially for startups, it makes more sense to leverage existing models like ChatGPT or Midjourney <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>.

## Understanding AI Models

A model can be conceptualized as a "kid's brain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>.
*   **Input and Output**: It takes an input (e.g., an image or audio) and recognizes patterns to produce an output, often with a probability of certainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a>. For example, a speech model takes voice input and outputs a text transcription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">[00:21:11]</a>.
*   **Training Process**: Training involves providing a large volume of labeled data (e.g., thousands of cat and dog images) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>. The model processes this information, learns patterns, and then can identify new, unseen inputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a>.

## Practical Applications and Tools

### Noteworthy Applications
*   **Google Glass Language Translation**: Google's AR/VR team demonstrated Google Glass's ability to transcribe and translate spoken language in real-time, displaying it on the screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:45">[00:21:45]</a>. This showcases AI's potential to break down communication barriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>.
*   [[new_applications_of_ai_in_startups | New applications of AI in startups]] include:
    *   **Medical Diagnosis**: Students in Marily's course developed an AI model that could take x-ray images and identify potential patient issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:57">[00:37:57]</a>. They also aimed to create a recommender system for next steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:30">[00:38:30]</a>.
    *   **Industrial Maintenance**: A company used drones to photograph wind turbines, then uploaded images to [[tools_and_tips_for_ai_product_management | AutoML]] to identify which turbines needed maintenance, reducing work time from weeks to hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:45">[00:39:45]</a>.

### Tools for Training Models with Minimal Effort
*   **AutoML**: Offered by Google Cloud, AutoML allows users to train high-quality custom machine learning models with minimal coding effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:18">[00:39:18]</a>. It requires a significant number of pre-corrected photos or images but handles the training process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:31">[00:39:31]</a>.

## [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_implementing_ai_solutions | Challenges and Opportunities in Implementing AI Solutions]]

While AI offers immense potential, there are specific challenges for businesses and AI Product Managers:
*   **Uncertainty of Results**: Research and hypothesis development can lead to models that don't produce optimal results or answer initial questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:41">[00:29:41]</a>. PMs need to encourage their teams through this uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>.
*   **Leadership Buy-in**: Changing the perception of AI and managing its adoption from a leadership perspective can be tricky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:11">[00:30:11]</a>.
*   **Data Collection**: Obtaining sufficient good, clean data is difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:23">[00:30:23]</a>. Businesses may need to be creative, even collecting data from public interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:27">[00:30:27]</a>.
*   **Career Trajectory**: In research-heavy AI roles, launches may be less frequent, which can impact traditional PM career progression. It's important to clarify assessment criteria with hiring managers early on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:42">[00:30:42]</a>.

## Getting Buy-in for AI Investments

To secure investment in AI projects, particularly for "big bets" that might take six months to a year to validate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:35">[00:31:35]</a>:
*   **Leverage Adjacent Product Successes**: Use examples of successful AI-first products launched by the company or in the industry to inspire leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:15">[00:32:15]</a>.
*   **Propose a "Kill Criteria"**: Define a rollback plan and the maximum negative impact if the project doesn't succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:42">[00:32:42]</a>.
*   **Build Trust**: The more trust a PM has within the company, the easier it is to get buy-in for risky, innovative projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:56">[00:32:56]</a>.
*   **Embrace Failure**: Companies that welcome failure foster an environment where teams are more willing to try ambitious AI initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:05">[00:33:05]</a>.

## Learning and Developing AI Skills

For PMs aspiring to be strong AI PMs or looking to integrate AI into their products:
*   **Don't Be Overwhelmed**: Learning about AI doesn't require a technical background, and PMs won't typically need to code or train models themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>. No-code approaches to model training also exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.
*   **Change Mindset**: Think about how existing data can be leveraged to improve products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.
*   **Hands-On Experience**:
    *   **Shadow Researchers**: If working at a company with AI researchers, spend time talking to and observing them to understand their work and the potential of AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a>.
    *   **Learn to Code (Fundamentals)**: Even with [[emergent_capabilities_of_ai_models | AI tools]] and no-code applications, understanding basic coding provides confidence and a deeper understanding of how tools are created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:09">[00:24:09]</a>. This is analogous to learning classical music fundamentals before playing modern songs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:42">[00:24:42]</a>.
    *   **Online Courses and Bootcamps**: Resources like Coursera (e.g., Stanford's "Introduction to AI"), Career Foundry, General Assembly, and Coding Dojo can help gain practical skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:30">[00:26:30]</a>.
*   **Develop Core AI Product Management Skills**: Understand the unique aspects of the AI product development lifecycle, which often involves managing the problem itself before focusing on the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:22">[00:28:22]</a>.
*   **Create Your Own AI Product**: Hands-on projects, like those developed in Marily Nika's Maven course, provide invaluable learning experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:18">[00:37:18]</a>. Some students have even used their projects to raise funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:29">[00:37:29]</a>.
*   **Stay Updated with Academia**: Follow research blogs and platforms like arXiv, as academic research often precedes mainstream AI applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:38">[00:33:38]</a>. This helps bridge the gap between research and productization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:04">[00:34:04]</a>.

Marily Nika's course "AI and Product Management" covers the differences between regular and AI product development, idea creation, productionizing AI solutions, partnering with research scientists, and career pathways in AI PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:53">[00:35:53]</a>. The course emphasizes creating an AI product end-to-end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:21">[00:37:21]</a>.

From: [[lennyspodcast]] <br/> 

The term "growth hacking" was coined by Sean Ellis, one of the earliest and most influential thinkers in the field of growth. While it has sometimes been misinterpreted as a collection of one-off "hacks," Ellis originally defined it as scrutinizing every aspect of a business's operations to understand its impact on growth, contrasting it with traditional textbook marketing approaches that startups often cannot afford <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:04">[00:47:04]</a>. His focus was on creating sustainable [[growth_strategies_for_saas_businesses | growth]] by efficiently acquiring customers into an experience that makes them want to continue using the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:12">[00:47:12]</a>.

## Product Market Fit: The Foundation of Growth

A core tenet of Ellis's philosophy is that true [[product_market_fit_and_growth_strategy | growth]] cannot be achieved without first establishing [[product_market_fit_and_growth_strategy | product market fit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:09">[01:49:09]</a>. He emphasizes that if no one truly cares about a product, any efforts to grow will likely fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>. The most significant reason for startup failure is often that people simply don't care about the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:05">[00:34:05]</a>.

### The Sean Ellis Test (Product-Market Fit Test)

To assess [[product_market_fit_and_growth_strategy | product market fit]], Ellis developed the "Sean Ellis Test" (also known as the product-market fit test), a seemingly simple idea with profound impact on the startup world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

#### The Question and Threshold

The test centers on a single question posed to users who have experienced the product: "How would you feel if you could no longer use this product?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. Users are given choices: "very disappointed," "somewhat disappointed," or "not disappointed/not applicable (already stopped using the product)" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

The key indicator of [[product_market_fit_and_growth_strategy | product market fit]] is when a high percentage of users (ideally 40% or more) respond that they would be "very disappointed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. This 40% threshold emerged from observing patterns across many startups in Silicon Valley: products that hit this percentage tended to do well, while those below it struggled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

#### Leading vs. Lagging Indicator

Ellis clarifies that the test is a *leading indicator* of [[product_market_fit_and_growth_strategy | product market fit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. The *lagging indicator*, or ultimate test, is actual user retention and continued usage of the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. The test's value lies in providing early feedback, even with an MVP, allowing companies to understand if their product resonates with anyone before long-term retention data is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.

#### How to Use the Test Effectively

*   **Focus on the "Very Disappointed" Group:** The primary utility of the test is to identify and deeply understand the subset of users who would be "very disappointed." These are the "must-have" users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.
*   **Deep Dive into Their Needs:** Ask follow-up questions to this group, such as "What is the primary benefit that you get?" (initially open-ended, then multiple choice) and "Why is that benefit important to you?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:10">[00:44:10]</a>. This helps uncover the core problems they are solving and the context in which they use the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>.
*   **Lean into Core Value:** Use these insights to:
    *   **Reposition the Product:** Like Lookout, which pivoted from a broad mobile security app to focusing on antivirus functionality after discovering it was the "must-have" feature for its 7% "very disappointed" users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. This repositioning led to a 40% "very disappointed" score in two weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.
    *   **Streamline Onboarding:** Design the initial user experience to deliver the core value quickly (speed to value) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.
    *   **Refine Messaging:** Set the right expectations upfront to attract users who truly need the product's core benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.
    *   **Inform Product Roadmap:** Double down on features important to "must-have" customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>.
*   **Ignore "Somewhat Disappointed" (with a caveat):** Ellis initially advised ignoring users who would be "somewhat disappointed" because focusing on their "nice-to-have" feedback could dilute the product for "must-have" users, making it good for everyone but great for no one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:41">[00:41:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:00">[00:42:00]</a>. However, companies like Superhuman found a nuanced approach: identify the core benefit for "must-have" users, then ask "somewhat disappointed" users who also value that benefit what they need for it to become a "must-have" for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:25">[00:42:25]</a>.
*   **Consider Switching Costs:** Products with high user investment (e.g., building a website on Webs.com or setting up an event on Eventbrite) might show artificially high "very disappointed" scores due to switching costs, which is still a valid indicator but important to understand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:47">[00:21:47]</a>.

#### When to Administer the Test

The ideal time to ask the question is after users have genuinely used the product, ideally two or more times, and within the last week or two (i.e., they haven't churned yet) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:34">[00:22:34]</a>. This focuses on activated users who have experienced the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:10">[00:23:10]</a>. A minimum of 30 responses is generally recommended for a reliable sample size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:17">[00:33:17]</a>.

#### Limitations

The test is generally widely applicable but may not be suitable for one-off products (e.g., watching a movie or attending a workshop) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>. Cultural differences can also affect the 40% threshold (e.g., Brazilians might be more optimistic, leading to a higher threshold like NuBank's 50%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:25">[00:27:25]</a>. NuBank even applies this test down to the feature level, requiring 50% "very disappointed" scores for new features before public launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:37">[00:39:37]</a>.

## Building a Sustainable Growth Engine

Once [[product_market_fit_and_growth_strategy | product market fit]] is established (e.g., a 40% "very disappointed" score), the next step is to [[developing_a_growth_model_for_a_business | build a flywheel]] that continuously delivers that "must-have" value to as many *right* people as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:47">[00:48:47]</a>. This [[developing_a_growth_model_for_a_business | growth model]] prioritizes efficiency over just acquisition.

### Sean Ellis's Growth Prioritization Sequence

Ellis recommends a specific sequence for focusing [[building_and_scaling_a_growth_team | growth team]] efforts:

1.  **Activation:** This is the most critical starting point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:03">[00:51:03]</a>. Users are at the highest risk of churning early if they don't quickly reach that "must-have" experience or "aha moment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:59">[00:53:59]</a>. A rapid improvement in activation can dramatically unlock [[growth_strategies_for_saas_businesses | growth]], as seen with LogMeIn, which increased its sign-up-to-usage rate by 1,000% in three months, transforming its acquisition channels from scaling to $10,000/month to $1 million/month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:50">[00:55:50]</a>.
    *   **Tactics:**
        *   **Understand the "Why":** Qualitatively research why users abandon the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:02">[00:58:02]</a>. For LogMeIn, asking users why they didn't download revealed skepticism about the "free" offering, which was solved by presenting a clear choice between free and paid options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:08">[00:59:08]</a>.
        *   **Increase Desire, Reduce Friction:** These are the two primary levers for driving conversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:36">[01:01:36]</a>.
        *   **Define Activation Metrics:** Pick an "aha moment" metric that reflects a user's first valuable experience with the product. It should be experienced early in the user journey (ideally in the first session or day) and correlate with long-term retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:59">[01:03:59]</a>.

2.  **Engagement & Referral:** After activation, focus on retaining users and encouraging them to bring in others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:35">[00:51:35]</a>.
    *   **Engagement:** Understand the natural usage cycle of the product. Setting a North Star metric (like Facebook's shift from Monthly Active Users to Daily Active Users) can incentivize teams to improve engagement frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:51">[01:17:51]</a>. This change at [[growth_strategies_and_frameworks_used_at_facebook | Facebook]] had a significant impact on making the product more addictive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:43">[01:18:43]</a>.
    *   **Referral:** [[productled_growth | Referral programs]] are powerful accelerants when a product already has strong word-of-mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:15">[01:15:15]</a>. Dropbox's legendary [[productled_growth | referral program]] was built on an already passionate user base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:58">[01:14:58]</a>. Offering incentives on both sides (referrer and referred) often works best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:28">[01:13:28]</a>.
    *   **Freemium:** For a freemium model to work, the free product must be so good that it naturally generates word-of-mouth, while the premium version offers sufficient differentiation for upgrades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:55">[01:15:55]</a>.

3.  **Revenue Model Optimization:** Ensure the business model is effective and profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:39">[00:51:39]</a>.

4.  **Customer Acquisition (Channels):** Only after the internal loops are optimized should a company "obsess" over customer acquisition channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:41">[00:51:41]</a>.
    *   **Efficiency is Key:** The acquisition landscape is highly competitive, so inefficient conversion, retention, or monetization will make scalable, profitable customer acquisition nearly impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:19">[00:53:19]</a>.
    *   **Identify Angles:** Before engaging with a company, Ellis looks for at least two or three viable customer acquisition angles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:09">[00:52:09]</a>.
    *   **Talk to Customers:** A powerful tactic is to ask existing customers: "How did you find this product?" and "How do you normally find products like this?" This provides invaluable insight into potential acquisition channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:19">[01:10:19]</a>.
    *   **Demand Generation vs. Demand Harvesting:** Distinguish between creating new demand (e.g., OOH advertising like Bounce's signs) and harvesting existing demand (e.g., SEO or paid search for users actively looking for a solution) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:48">[01:06:48]</a>. This approach is part of [[marketplace_growth_strategies | marketplace growth strategies]].

### The North Star Metric

A crucial step in [[developing_a_growth_model_for_a_business | developing a growth model]] is defining a North Star Metric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:02">[00:50:02]</a>. This metric should:
*   **Reflect Value Delivery:** Capture the units of value being delivered to customers, reflecting the "must-have" experience identified by the Sean Ellis Test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:07">[00:50:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:51">[01:19:51]</a>.
*   **Be Up and to the Right:** A quantifiable metric that can continuously increase over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:40">[01:20:40]</a>.
*   **Correlate with Revenue (but not be Revenue):** While it should ultimately lead to revenue growth, revenue itself shouldn't be the North Star Metric. Focus on increasing value for the customer, and revenue will follow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:46">[01:20:46]</a>.
*   **Be Time-Capped:** Including a time component (e.g., "daily active users" vs. "monthly active users") encourages more frequent engagement and provides a more actionable metric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:19">[01:21:19]</a>.
*   **Examples:** Airbnb's "Nights Booked" and Uber's "Weekly Rides" are good examples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:47">[01:22:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>.

## Evolution and Challenges in Growth

[[growth_strategies_for_saas_businesses | Growth strategies]] have evolved significantly. In the past, simply being data-driven in customer acquisition was enough to win. Today, most online marketers are data and test-driven, necessitating super efficiency across *all* parts of the business (conversion, retention, monetization) to remain competitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:14">[01:25:14]</a>.

The biggest challenge now is driving cross-functional collaboration between marketing, product, sales, and customer success teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:15">[01:26:15]</a>. These teams are not traditionally used to working together, making it hard to implement effective testing programs across the entire [[developing_a_growth_model_for_a_business | growth engine]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:33">[01:26:33]</a>. Companies successful in this often implemented these collaborative approaches very early <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:46">[01:26:46]</a>.

### Prioritization with ICE

To facilitate effective testing, Ellis also developed the ICE prioritization framework (Impact, Confidence, Ease) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:19">[01:27:19]</a>. The "Impact" score already includes the potential reach of an experiment, making the "Reach" component in the RICE framework (from Intercom) an unnecessary addition in his view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:38">[01:27:38]</a>. The framework helps systematically compare ideas and explain why certain experiments are chosen, fostering better idea generation across the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:57">[01:28:57]</a>.

### The Role of AI in Growth

AI is poised to significantly impact [[advising_and_growth_hacking_for_startups | growth hacking]]:
*   **Modeling Outcomes:** AI can help model potential outcomes of experiments, providing more informed predictions for prioritization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:51">[01:29:51]</a>.
*   **Dispassionate Recommendations:** AI systems can identify underperforming business areas and suggest experiments without ego-driven bias, facilitating cross-functional alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:05">[01:32:05]</a>.
*   **Analysis Bottleneck:** AI can alleviate the bottleneck often found in the analysis phase of high-velocity experiment programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:45">[01:32:45]</a>.

## Key Takeaway: Asking the Right Questions

Ultimately, Sean Ellis's approach to [[growth_strategies_for_saas_businesses | growth]] and [[product_market_fit_and_growth_strategy | product market fit]] boils down to a fundamental principle: asking the right question at the right time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:11">[01:33:11]</a>. This applies to understanding customer needs, identifying activation barriers, or discovering new acquisition channels. Deeply understanding the problem through qualitative and quantitative research leads to much better experiments and effective solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:15">[01:11:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:02">[01:34:02]</a>. This is an example of an [[unorthodox_frameworks_for_growth_and_impact | unorthodox framework for growth and impact]].

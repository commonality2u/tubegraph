Bengali Caba, a Director of Product Management at YouTube and former Head of Growth at Instagram and VP of Product at Instacart, emphasizes the critical role of "understand work" in driving impact and accelerating product growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This concept, originating from an old Facebook framework, prioritizes deep user and problem comprehension before jumping into solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:57">[00:25:57]</a>.

## The "Understand, Identify, Execute" Framework

Caba highlights a common "anti-pattern" in product development: "identify, justify, execute" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:17">[00:27:17]</a>. This occurs when a team decides what to build, pulls data to justify it, and then invests significant time in execution, only for the product to fail because it didn't address real user needs or pain points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:45">[00:26:45]</a>.

Instead, Caba advocates for "understand, identify, execute" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:39">[00:27:39]</a>. The first and most crucial step is to truly [[integrating_user_research_effectively_into_product_development | understand from first principles]] what is actually happening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:43">[00:27:43]</a>. This approach ensures that teams have a clear grasp of user problems, existing alternatives, and the product's true value before committing to development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:55">[00:26:55]</a>.

### Operationalizing Understand Work

"Understand work" is an intentional allowance in the execution phase, designed to de-risk a project and gather crucial insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:51">[00:27:51]</a>. It must be explicitly planned and treated as an actionable item, rather than assuming it will happen informally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:15">[00:28:15]</a>.

Initially, when a team does not fully understand a problem space, the balance of work should lean more towards "understand work" (e.g., 40%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:53">[00:31:53]</a>. As understanding grows, this mix can shift to a higher percentage of execution (e.g., 80-85%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:06">[00:32:06]</a>.

Teams should ask:
*   What is known with confidence from existing data? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:26">[00:32:26]</a>
*   What needs to be understood because data, research, or insights are missing? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:30">[00:32:30]</a>

This process involves:
*   **Cross-functional collaboration** Engineers, data scientists, designers, product managers, and even go-to-market and marketing teams should be involved in this planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:41">[00:37:41]</a>.
*   **Identifying knowledge gaps** It helps clarify root causes, "jobs to be done," and the right use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:16">[00:29:16]</a>.
*   **Asking the right questions** Teams are empowered to challenge ideas by asking what needs to be understood before building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:32">[00:29:32]</a>.

**Examples of "Understand Work":**
*   **Engineering:** Analyzing code for refactoring, ensuring scalability, or instrumenting logging for better data visibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:27">[00:36:27]</a>.
*   **Data Science:** Working on activation metrics or understanding proxy metrics to inform what to build and where to focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:51">[00:36:51]</a>.
*   **Product Management:** Figuring out partnership strategies before launch, dogfooding the product in various user states, or mapping out customer funnels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:04">[00:37:04]</a>.

At Instagram, an early example involved instrumenting the signup funnel, which initially lacked detailed logging, to identify where users were dropping off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:46">[00:39:46]</a>. At YouTube, Caba's team for paid virtual goods focused on mapping the live ecosystem and understanding user funnels before shipping product iterations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:05">[00:33:05]</a>.

## Benefits: "Slow Down to Speed Up"

While seemingly counter-intuitive, "understand work" leads to faster, more impactful growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:10">[00:34:10]</a>.
*   **De-risking and Clarity:** By investing time upfront, teams gain clarity and de-risk projects, leading to a higher likelihood of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:51">[00:27:51]</a>.
*   **Velocity Multiplier:** This approach creates parallel paths of work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:56">[00:29:56]</a>. Every sprint or roadmap involves both executing on high-conviction items and conducting "understand work" for future initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:04">[00:30:04]</a>. This compounds over time, leading to greater velocity and higher win rates for shipped features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:37">[00:30:37]</a>. Instagram, for instance, achieved 60-70% positive and shippable experiments per quarter due to effective de-risking and understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>.
*   **Uncovering New Opportunities:** The insights gained from "understand work" can reveal unexpected opportunities. At Instagram, fixing account access issues (like simplifying login with an "Omni box" and saving credentials) not only retained millions of users but also highlighted a surprising amount of content creation from secondary accounts, leading to the development of a dedicated "multiple accounts" team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>. This demonstrated how solving a core problem could unveil a new growth engine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:43">[01:23:43]</a>.

## The "Adjacent User" Theory

A key part of "understand work" for growth is understanding the "adjacent user" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:28">[00:56:28]</a>. This refers to the potential user who is not currently using the product but could be, if certain barriers were removed or needs met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:01">[01:07:01]</a>.

For hyper-growth products like Instagram, the user base changes rapidly, making it crucial to constantly identify and understand who the "next user" is and why the product isn't currently working for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:36">[01:03:36]</a>. This involves:
*   **Dogfooding from a fresh perspective:** Using the product as if you're a brand new user, with no prior history or informed knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:53">[00:56:53]</a>.
*   **Persona understanding:** Identifying their motivations, use cases, and specific pain points that differ from existing power users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:25">[01:04:25]</a>.
*   **Direct engagement:** Talking to, watching, and visiting these users to observe their real-time interactions with the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:47">[01:06:47]</a>.

An example from Instacart involved realizing that while power users might be office admins, the adjacent user could be a parent of multiple children at home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:10">[01:06:10]</a>. For these users, the value proposition shifts from convenience to necessity. Improving the "reorder" functionality at Instacart, which was initially cumbersome, significantly boosted retention because it addressed a core need of daily grocery shoppers: repurchasing staple items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:57">[01:00:57]</a>. Similarly, Facebook's "people recommendations" in India needed to account for common names and cultural contexts to make friend suggestions relevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:11">[01:26:11]</a>.

## The [[role_of_product_leaders | Role of Product Leaders]] in Fostering Understanding

[[role_of_product_managers | Product managers]] often face the challenge of feeling like they can't change anything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:01">[01:06:01]</a>. Caba emphasizes that a great manager is crucial because they have the power to allocate resources, adjust scope, and address cultural issues that hinder impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:25">[01:16:25]</a>. Leaders must encourage teams to embrace "understand work" by making it a planned part of their roadmap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:21">[00:37:21]</a>.

Caba's personal experience, particularly his background in education, informs his approach to [[improving_product_management_skills | coaching teams]]. He believes that [[building_trust_and_driving_impact_in_product_management | building trust]] and enabling teams is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:11">[00:46:11]</a>. Just as a teacher leads a classroom of students who "owe them nothing," a product leader must use clear communication, vision, and influence to get cross-functional teams aligned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:51">[00:46:51]</a>.

By systematically applying "understand work," teams can reduce risks, uncover unforeseen opportunities, and significantly increase their velocity and success rate, transforming initial "confusion" or "anxiety" into sustained product growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:43">[00:42:43]</a>.

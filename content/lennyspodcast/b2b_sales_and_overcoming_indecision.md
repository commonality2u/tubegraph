Many [[Sales strategies for B2B and SaaS companies | B2B purchase processes]] end in no decision, with estimates ranging from 40 to 60% failing to close [00:00:00]. The majority of these "no decisions" do not occur because the old solution is better; instead, buyers often cannot confidently make a choice [00:00:16]. This indecision leads them to delay the purchase, viewing delay as a safe, risk-free option [00:00:29].

April Dunford, a renowned authority on product positioning and author of *Obviously Awesome*, delves into this challenge in her new book, *Sales Pitch* [00:00:41]. Her framework aims to guide sales teams to better pitch and sell products by helping potential customers get excited and make a confident buying decision [00:01:03].

## The Problem with Traditional Sales Pitches
Many traditional [[Sales strategies for B2B and SaaS companies | B2B sales pitches]] are essentially product expositions, focusing heavily on features without explaining their underlying value or how they fit into the market [00:06:09]. This approach leaves customers overwhelmed and unsure why they should choose one product over another [00:09:20].

Buyers in [[Differentiated Value in B2B Markets | B2B software]] are often first-time purchasers of a specific type of software [00:20:21]. They are overwhelmed by research, lack a clear picture of the market, and struggle to define their purchase criteria [00:20:49]. Their primary concern is making a bad choice, which could jeopardize their job or reputation [00:22:16].

### The Peril of Indecision
The fear of making a bad decision is a significant hurdle, often surpassing the challenge of convincing a customer to switch from the status quo [00:25:09]. Rather than losing deals solely because the current product is "good enough," many are lost due to sheer customer indecision [00:25:35]. This fear leads buyers to choose inaction, viewing it as the safest, least risky option [00:23:09].

Interestingly, research from Matt Dixon's *The Jolt Effect*, which analyzed 2.5 million sales calls, indicates that attempting to induce FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) in indecisive customers actually makes them *less* likely to close a deal [00:26:50]. This is because it adds more stress to an already stressed-out buyer, often leading to paralysis [00:27:08].

## April Dunford's Sales Pitch Framework
Dunford's framework addresses buyer indecision by adopting a "teaching mindset" [00:19:32]. It aims to help customers understand the market, weigh their options, and build confidence in their decision [00:21:47].

The framework consists of two main parts:
1.  **The Setup** [00:13:37]: Focuses on the market and the company's point of view.
2.  **The Follow-Through** [00:14:14]: Showcases the product's [[Differentiated Value in B2B Markets | differentiated value]].

### 1. The Setup (About the Market)
The setup aims to align the customer's worldview with the company's by providing context and framing the problem. It should be a conversation, not a monologue, involving active discovery [00:18:11].

*   **Insight into the Market** [00:13:15]: This is the company's unique point of view or a deeper problem within the problem [00:13:18].
    *   *Example (Help Scout)*: For [[B2B growth and consumerization | digital businesses]], customer service is a growth driver, not merely a cost center [00:13:28]. This challenges the traditional view of customer service as a cost to minimize [00:07:46].
    *   This insight should resonate with the target audience [00:17:09]. If a customer fundamentally disagrees (e.g., they still view customer service as a cost center), they are likely not a good fit and the deal should be disqualified [00:16:50].

*   **Pluses and Minuses of Alternative Solutions** [00:13:40]: Paint a picture of the entire market, discussing the pros and cons of other approaches to solving the problem [00:13:47].
    *   *Example (Help Scout)*:
        *   **Shared Inbox**: Easy to use, reps love it [00:08:14]. Problem: Outgrown as the business scales, lacking features like assignments or prioritization [00:08:16].
        *   **Traditional Help Desk Software**: Offers advanced features [00:08:27]. Problem: Hard to use, designed for cost reduction (e.g., assigning ticket numbers, pushing to self-serve) [00:08:32].
    *   Being honest and giving credit to alternatives builds trust, framing the seller as a guide [00:45:19].

*   **Perfect World Conclusion** [00:13:55]: Lead the customer to agree on what a "really good solution" would look like, based on the insights and alternative analysis [00:14:00]. This is the point where the company gets agreement on their worldview [00:56:26].
    *   *Example (Help Scout)*: A perfect solution for a [[B2B growth and consumerization | digital business]] would be as easy to use as a shared inbox, with features to support growth, and built from the ground up to deliver amazing customer service [00:11:10].
    *   If the customer aligns with this "perfect world," the deal is essentially won, as the seller's product is positioned as the only one that can deliver it [00:56:40].

### 2. The Follow-Through (About Your Product)
Once alignment is achieved, the pitch shifts to demonstrating how the company's product delivers on the "perfect world" characteristics.

*   **Introduce Your Product** [00:17:21]: Briefly state what the product is and for whom [00:57:21].
    *   *Example (Help Scout)*: "We're Help Scout, customer service software for [[B2B growth and consumerization | digital businesses]]" [00:57:36].

*   **Differentiated Value** [00:14:18]: Showcase the unique value the product delivers that alternatives cannot [00:14:49]. This is the core of the pitch [00:57:58].
    *   It's the answer to "Why pick us over the other alternatives?" [00:39:22].
    *   [[Differentiated Value in B2B Markets | Differentiated value]] stems from unique capabilities (features, pricing, support, breadth of portfolio) [00:40:08].
    *   *Example (LevelJump, sales enablement software)*:
        *   **Differentiated Capability**: Built on top of Salesforce [00:41:42].
        *   **Value**: Sales enablement data is integrated with sales data [00:42:01].
        *   **Further Value**: This integration allows measuring whether enablement improves "time to first deal" or "time to make quota" [00:42:12], ultimately leading to more revenue faster [00:42:25].
    *   The [[Differentiated Value in B2B Markets | differentiated value]] often informs the market insight, which is the context that makes the value important [00:42:48].

*   **Proof** [00:14:43]: Provide evidence that the claims are true, often through customer case studies or independent third-party verification [00:14:48]. Show "before and after" scenarios [00:58:55].

*   **Handle Objections** [00:14:58]: Address common unspoken concerns (e.g., cost, adoption difficulty, security) [00:15:03]. In [[Sales strategies for B2B and SaaS companies | B2B sales]], the buying team can consist of 5-7 people, and while the "champion" drives the deal, others (like IT, finance) can kill it with operational objections [00:31:12]. The sales team, having done many deals, should proactively arm the champion to handle these [00:32:13].

*   **The Ask** [00:15:21]: Clearly state the desired next step in the [[Sales strategies for B2B and SaaS companies | sales process]], whether it's closing the sale, scheduling a proof of concept, or defining a project [00:15:24].

## Implementation and Impact
### For Product Teams
[[Role of product teams in sales | Product teams]] play a crucial role in deeply understanding [[Differentiated Value in B2B Markets | differentiated value]] [00:37:06]. A common pitfall is that this valuable information from product doesn't reach sales, who often focus only on features [00:37:22].

To avoid this, a cross-functional team (product, marketing, sales) should work together on positioning and defining [[Differentiated Value in B2B Markets | differentiated value]] [00:37:40]. This collaboration ensures richer definitions and enables the sales pitch to directly reflect the positioning [00:38:15]. Marketing often becomes the "stewards" or "positioning police" once the positioning is set [01:07:00].

### Testing and Rollout
The process involves:
1.  **Building the Pitch**: Involve [[Building a successful sales team | sales management]] in building the new pitch to ensure buy-in [01:01:55].
2.  **Training a Top Rep**: Train the best sales representative on the new pitch, ensuring they are comfortable with it [01:02:07].
3.  **Pilot Testing**: Have the top rep test the pitch with qualified prospects (not existing customers) [01:02:24].
4.  **Iterate and Refine**: After each pitch, huddle to discuss what worked and what didn't, making adjustments to wording or slide order [01:02:43].
5.  **Achieving Buy-in**: The rep knows the pitch is successful when they feel it works better than the old one and refuse to go back [01:03:16].
6.  **Company-Wide Rollout**: Film the successful pitch for training and have the top rep sell the new pitch to the rest of the sales team [01:03:55]. This "sales teaching sales" approach is more effective than marketing unilaterally throwing materials over the wall [01:04:24].

### Expected Impact
Companies that implement this framework can see an immediate uplift in [[Sales strategies for B2B and SaaS companies | sales metrics]]. This often translates to a higher percentage of deals converting into opportunities after the first substantive call [01:04:41]. Some companies have reported doubling the number of deals converting from a first sales call to an opportunity simply by tightening up the pitch [01:09:30]. This approach is seen as low-hanging fruit to "squeeze more juice out of the lemon," especially when budgets are tight [01:09:09]. The positioning process itself can take about a week, with the full rollout and impact felt within a month for motivated companies [01:05:46].

## Category Creation vs. Niche Play
While some argue that category creation is the only path to a legendary business, Dunford offers a different perspective, emphasizing that the vast majority of legendary businesses did not create their categories [00:49:00]. Google didn't create search, nor did Facebook create social networking [00:49:09].

Most companies, even successful category creators, start as niche players in existing categories [00:49:51]. This is because an existing market category helps answer the fundamental question, "What is this thing all about?" [00:50:02]. For example, Salesforce initially positioned itself as "CRM for very small businesses," leveraging an existing market understanding [00:50:11].

Dunford argues that it's often more common for companies to "shave off a piece of the market, dominate that, and then successfully branch out" [00:53:15]. This is similar to Geoffrey Moore's "bowling pin strategy," where a company targets an underserved segment (the lead pin) to gain a beachhead, then expands to adjacent segments [00:53:48]. Category creation often occurs when a company is already a dominant player (e.g., $200-400 million in revenue) and chooses to expand the boundaries of the category to sustain growth [00:51:14].

Dunford cautions against early-stage category creation attempts, as fast followers with fresh funding can often learn from the pioneer's mistakes and overtake them [00:52:48].

## Distinction from Other Frameworks
Dunford distinguishes her approach from frameworks that start with a "shift" or "trend" in the world (e.g., Andy Rasin's approach) [01:10:43]. While such frameworks might work in specific, often "edgy" conditions, they have limitations:
*   **Lack of [[Differentiated Value in B2B Markets | differentiated value]]**: They assume "new" is inherently valuable and "old" is inherently bad, which isn't always true, especially when multiple new solutions exist [01:11:16].
*   **Ignores Indecision**: This approach doesn't account for customer indecision where "old is good" because it's safe [01:12:05]. Buyers want to know "what's better" beyond just "it's new" [01:12:27].
*   **Non-Unique Trends**: Starting with a broad trend is often not unique to the company, as competitors can also leverage the same trend [01:12:47]. The pitch should ideally highlight something no competitor can claim [01:13:37].
*   **Investor vs. Sales Pitch**: Trend-based pitches are more suited for investor pitches, which deal with longer timelines and theoretical market disruption [01:13:50]. Sales pitches, however, are about immediate value and exchanging money right now, and focusing too much on the distant future can cause buyers to delay [01:14:20].

April Dunford emphasizes that her frameworks are starting points, encouraging users to experiment and adapt them to their specific situations [01:15:23]. The ultimate goal is to be useful to others and help them make confident decisions [01:28:58].

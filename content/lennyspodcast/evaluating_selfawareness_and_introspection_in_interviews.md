Evaluating a candidate's [[importance_of_feedback_and_selfawareness_in_career_growth | self-awareness]] and ability to introspect is a key aspect of the interview process. Many experienced product leaders use specific questions designed to uncover how candidates reflect on their experiences, understand their motivations, and acknowledge their limitations. These questions aim to go beyond standard interview answers and reveal a candidate's genuine thought process and authenticity [00:17:15].

## Questions for Assessing Self-Awareness

### Attributing Success (Aka Demano, Head of Product at Roll)

Aka Demano, former Head of Product at Roll and PM at Stripe, asks candidates:
> "To what do you attribute your success, and you can't say luck." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>

This question aims to gauge a candidate's [[importance_of_selfawareness_and_personal_operating_principles | self-awareness]] and curiosity by prompting them to reflect deeply on their journey and success [00:03:46]. Humble people often default to saying "luck," so the constraint forces a more introspective answer [00:03:40].

### Future Self-Reflection (Ben Williams, Former VP Product at Snyk)

Ben Williams, former VP Product at Snyk, uses the question:
> "Fast forward three years, what's different about you then?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>

While many candidates might focus on aspiring roles or titles, Williams looks for signals of humility and [[importance_of_feedback_and_selfawareness_in_career_growth | self-awareness]] regarding personal and professional growth areas [00:13:33]. He wants to see candidates who are open about where they need to improve [00:13:40].

### External Perception (Melanie Quan Burwitz, Head of Growth at Deal)

Melanie Quan Burwitz, Head of Growth at Deal, asks:
> "What would your siblings say about you?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a> (or parents if no siblings [00:14:53]).

This question is highly telling of what a candidate believes others think of them [00:14:57]. Quan Burwitz looks for sincerity and [[importance_of_feedback_and_selfawareness_in_career_growth | self-awareness]]. A humble and self-aware individual will acknowledge that their siblings might tease them or point out their quirks, rather than giving an overly perfect answer [00:15:07].

### Learning from Failure (Paige Costello, Co-Head of Product Management at Asana)

Paige Costello, Co-Head of Product Management and Head of AI at Asana, asks:
> "Tell me about a time something went wrong. What was it? What did you do about it?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>

This [[behavioral_and_situational_interview_techniques | behavioral interview question]] focuses on situations where the product or team failed, as this is an inevitable part of the work [00:15:47]. The response reveals a candidate's mindset, how they discuss difficult situations, and how they perceive themselves when things aren't going well [00:15:58].

### Revealing Limitations (Scott Belsky, Chief Strategy Officer at Adobe)

Scott Belsky, Chief Strategy Officer at Adobe, likes to ask about:
> "Something people have learned about themselves that reveal a limitation in how they work." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>

This question serves as a test of introspection, assessing whether a person can be open and reflective when they encounter their limits or struggles, or if they tend to blame others [00:18:39].

Belsky also asks:
> "Do you consider yourself lucky?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>

He finds this question fascinating because it can reveal whether someone is comfortable admitting luck, which often indicates a secure individual, as opposed to someone who is insecure about their position and unwilling to acknowledge external factors [00:18:56].

### Reflecting on Outcomes (IO Omalu, Chief Product Officer at Carbon Health)

IO Omalu, Chief Product Officer at Carbon Health, poses questions that tease out introspection:
> "Tell me something you did that worked out but not for the reason that you thought it would work," or "Tell me something you did that was a good decision that didn't work." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>

The goal is to determine if the candidate is reflective about their past decisions, understanding why they succeeded or failed, and whether they incorporate these learnings into future decision-making [00:18:10].

## General Approaches to Uncover Introspection

*   **Challenging Conventional Wisdom**: Nel Singal, VP of Product at Facebook, asks: "What's something that everyone takes for granted that you think is essentially hogwash or inaccurate?" [00:16:24] This question aims to break the typical "interview mindset" where candidates try to predict what the interviewer wants to hear [00:17:01]. It forces a genuine, opinionated response, revealing authenticity [00:17:22].
*   **Navigating Ambiguity**: Jay-Z, Head of Product at Webflow, uses [[behavioral_and_situational_interview_techniques | behavioral questions]] to understand how candidates navigate ambiguous situations [00:11:36]. She looks for candidates who can structure a path forward, seek inputs from others, and define milestones to evaluate progress [00:11:54]. This reflects an ability to self-assess and adapt.
*   **Curiosity**: Ben Williams generally looks for curiosity throughout the interview, noting that good Product Managers (PMs) ask "why" constantly, similar to a six-year-old child [00:13:52]. This indicates a continuous desire to understand and learn, which is foundational to introspection.

## Reference Calls

For reference calls, Paul Adams, Chief Product Officer at Intercom, suggests asking:
> "What feedback will I be giving this person in their first performance review?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>

This question is effective because it prevents the referee from dodging a genuine answer and provides actionable insights into the candidate's areas for growth [00:20:15].

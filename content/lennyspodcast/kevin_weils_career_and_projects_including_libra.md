Kevin Weil is the Chief Product Officer at OpenAI, a company he describes as "maybe the most important and most impactful company in the world right now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:44">[01:32:44]</a>, being at the forefront of AI and AGI, and potentially superintelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:41">[01:37:41]</a>.

## Early Career and Joining OpenAI

Weil's career includes significant roles as head of product at Instagram and Twitter, and he was also a co-creator of the Libra cryptocurrency at Facebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:08">[01:43:08]</a>. He has also served on the boards of Planet, Strava, the Black Product Managers Network, and the Nature Conservancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:15">[01:49:15]</a>.

The transition to OpenAI happened quickly after he had planned to take a summer break from work after leaving Planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:02">[01:12:02]</a>. Having known Sam Altman lightly for years, Weil reached out when considering his next move, as he enjoyed working on "big like tech forward sort of, you know, next next wave kind of things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:55">[01:43:55]</a>. This time, Altman suggested he talk to OpenAI directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:39">[01:58:39]</a>. The recruiting process moved very fast, with Weil meeting most of the management team within a few days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:11">[01:13:11]</a>. Despite a nine-day period of "agony" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:20">[01:15:20]</a> where he didn't hear back, attributing it to internal busyness, he ultimately joined the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:08">[01:15:08]</a>.

## The Libra Project

Kevin Weil describes Libra (later renamed Novi) as "probably the biggest disappointment of my career" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:59">[00:56:59]</a>. He "fundamentally" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a> believes the world would be a better place if the product had shipped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. The project aimed to solve real-world problems, such as the high fees in the remittance space (people paying 20% to send money home) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>. The vision was to enable instant, cheap, and simple money transfers via WhatsApp and Messenger, similar to sending a text message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>.

Libra was designed to be a new blockchain with a basket of currencies, integrated into WhatsApp and Messenger, allowing users to send money like 50 cents for free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>.

Weil admits that they didn't "play all of our cards perfectly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:43">[01:19:43]</a>. They tried to launch too many new things at once: a new blockchain, a basket of currencies, and deep integration into major messaging platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:51">[01:19:51]</a>. This overwhelmed the world with "a lot of change at once" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>. Additionally, the project launched when Facebook's reputation was at its "absolute nater" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:06">[01:20:06]</a>, making them an unfavorable "messenger" for such a significant change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:14">[01:20:14]</a>.

Despite the project's failure to launch as intended, the underlying technology, which was open source, lives on in companies like Aptos and Mysten, both of which are doing well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:27">[01:21:27]</a>. Weil still believes it "should exist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>, noting that the current U.S. administration is crypto-friendly and Meta's reputation has improved, suggesting they "should go build it now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:03">[01:21:03]</a>.

## Approach to Product at OpenAI

Working at OpenAI is different from Weil's previous experiences due to the "pace" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:20">[01:16:20]</a> and the constantly evolving underlying technology. Unlike traditional tech where the building blocks are relatively fixed, AI means "every two months computers can do something they've never been able to do before" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:01">[01:17:01]</a>. This requires completely different thinking about product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:07">[01:17:07]</a>.

### Working with LLMs
Large Language Models (LLMs) differ significantly from traditional software:
*   **Fuzzy Inputs/Outputs**: Unlike defined inputs leading to defined outputs, LLMs excel at "fuzzy, subtle inputs" based on human language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:46">[01:17:46]</a> and don't give the exact same answer every time, though they are "spiritually the same" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:58">[01:17:58]</a>.
*   **Performance Variability**: The right product design depends on how often the model gets things right (e.g., 60% vs. 95% vs. 99.5%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:11">[01:18:11]</a>.
*   **Evals**: Writing "evals" (evaluations), which are like quizzes or unit tests for models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:22">[01:19:22]</a>, is becoming a core skill for product managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:03">[01:19:03]</a>. Evals help understand model capabilities for specific use cases and enable continuous learning and fine-tuning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:40">[01:20:40]</a>. Weil believes the quality of AI is "almost like capped in how amazing it can be by that how good we are at Evals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:35">[01:22:35]</a>.

### Product Development Principles
*   **Iterative Deployment**: OpenAI's philosophy is to "ship and iterate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:39">[01:30:39]</a>, learning alongside society about the models' capabilities, differences, and quirks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:44">[01:30:44]</a>.
*   **Model Maximalism**: They don't spend excessive time building "scaffolding" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:39">[01:31:39]</a> around models that aren't perfect, because "in two months there's going to be a better model" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:46">[01:31:46]</a> that will surpass current limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:48">[01:31:48]</a>. Developers are encouraged to build products "right on the edge of the capabilities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:59">[01:31:59]</a>, as the models will quickly improve to support them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:05">[01:32:05]</a>.
*   **Bottoms-Up Approach**: OpenAI encourages a "very strongly bottoms up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:26">[01:28:26]</a> product development, leveraging passionate engineers, PMs, and designers who have strong opinions and understand model capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:38">[01:28:38]</a>. This approach accepts mistakes as part of moving fast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:55">[01:28:55]</a>.
*   **Lightweight Roadmapping**: While they do quarterly roadmapping and year-long strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:09">[01:27:09]</a>, they operate with the understanding that "plans are useless; planning is helpful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:24">[01:27:24]</a> (an Eisenhower quote) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:22">[01:27:22]</a>. The planning moment is valuable for reflection and dependency checking, but the roadmap itself is expected to change due to rapidly evolving technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:57">[01:27:57]</a>.
*   **Research and Product Integration**: OpenAI is evolving from a pure research company to both a "world-class research company and a world-class product company" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:51">[01:46:51]</a>. They prioritize iterative feedback between product design and research, working together as a single team to build novel products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:19">[01:47:19]</a>.

### Product Management Philosophy
OpenAI aims to be "PM light" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:21">[01:48:21]</a>, believing that too many PMs can hinder execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:27">[01:48:27]</a>. They prefer PMs who:
*   **High Agency**: Don't wait for permission but see a problem and act on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:56">[01:49:56]</a>.
*   **Comfortable with Ambiguity**: Are able to navigate situations where problems are "ill-formed" and solutions are being figured out as they go <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:48">[01:50:48]</a>. This makes it challenging for more junior PMs who might expect more structured guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:20">[01:50:20]</a>.
*   **Lead Through Influence**: Work effectively with engineers and the highly "self-directed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:12">[01:51:12]</a> research function, building good rapport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:15">[01:51:15]</a>.
*   **Decisive**: Understand when to defer to the team and when to make a clear decision in ambiguous situations to ensure progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:49">[01:51:49]</a>.

## AI's Impact on Work and the Future

### AI in Product Teams
OpenAI staff use AI extensively for tasks like summarizing and writing documents, and even helping to write evals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:52">[01:53:52]</a>. Weil still feels they could integrate AI more deeply into daily workflows, noting that his current day job would still be recognizable to his past self, unlike how it should be in a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:21">[01:54:21]</a>.

A key area of opportunity is "vibe coding" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:50">[01:54:50]</a> (a term coined by Andrej Karpathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:42">[01:55:42]</a>), which involves using AI code assistants (like Cursor, Windsurf, GitHub Copilot) to rapidly generate and iterate on code, often by simply accepting suggestions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:06">[01:56:06]</a>. This is useful for proofs of concept and demos, allowing rapid exploration of ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:55">[01:56:55]</a>.

### Future of Product Teams
Weil envisions future product teams with embedded "researchers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:42">[01:57:42]</a> or "quasi researcher machine learning engineer types" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:39">[01:58:39]</a>. This is driven by the growing importance of "fine-tuned models" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:55">[01:57:55]</a>. While general models are good, fine-tuning a model with specific examples for a particular use case can significantly improve performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:29">[01:59:29]</a>. He believes fine-tuning will become a core workflow for building most products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:46">[01:58:46]</a>.

OpenAI itself uses "ensembles of models" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:01">[01:00:01]</a> internally, utilizing different model sizes, specialized fine-tuned models, and custom prompts for specific tasks to optimize for latency, cost, and accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:14">[01:00:14]</a>. He draws an analogy between an ensemble of models and a company, where individuals (fine-tuned with different skills) are grouped to produce better collective output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:53">[01:02:53]</a>.

### Optimism about AI
Weil is a "big technology optimist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:28">[01:08:28]</a>, believing technology has driven advancements in economics, geopolitics, quality of life, and longevity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:41">[01:08:41]</a>. While acknowledging "temporary dislocations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:04">[01:09:04]</a> and impacts on individuals, he emphasizes the need for society to manage this transition gracefully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:52">[01:09:52]</a>.

He highlights areas like AI tutoring as "the most important thing that AI could do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:21">[01:16:21]</a>, noting its potential for personalized learning and significant improvements in learning speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:30">[01:17:30]</a>. He's surprised that a widespread, free AI tutoring solution isn't yet available given the models are capable enough and accessible on common devices like Android <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.

Regarding creativity, Weil believes AI, like Sora (their video model) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>, will amplify human creativity, allowing users to explore more ideas and achieve better final results, even if they lack traditional artistic skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:08">[01:31:08]</a>. AI will not replace creativity but assist it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:20">[01:31:20]</a>.

### The Accelerating Pace of AI
Weil emphasizes that "the AI models that you're using today is the worst AI model you will ever use for the rest of your life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:59">[01:16:59]</a>. Capabilities are increasing at a massive pace, getting smarter, faster, cheaper, and safer (less hallucination) with each iteration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>. This exponential growth, surpassing Moore's Law, means the future will be "very different than today" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:51">[01:19:51]</a>.

## Personal Insights

### Advice for Kids
For his own three young children (10-year-old and 8-year-old twins) who are "AI native" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:11">[01:05:11]</a>, Weil and his wife focus on teaching them to be curious, independent, self-confident, and how to think, believing these skills will be important regardless of future technological changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:40">[01:05:40]</a>.

### Life Motto
Weil's favorite [[leadership_principles_and_career_success | life motto]] is inspired by a quote from Mark Zuckerberg on an earnings call: "Sometimes it's not any one thing. It's just good work consistently over a long period of time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:28">[01:25:28]</a>. He believes success comes from showing up daily, doing good work, and getting incrementally better, allowing compounded gains over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:45">[01:25:45]</a>.

### Prompting Tips
While Weil hopes the need for complex "prompt engineering" will diminish as models improve, he offers a useful tip for current users: including examples in your prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:54">[01:27:54]</a>. Providing "here's a problem, here's a good answer" examples for the model to learn from can significantly improve its performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:06">[01:28:06]</a>. He also notes that telling the model to act as a specific persona (e.g., "you are the world's greatest marketer") can shift its mindset and lead to better results, similar to how one might frame a request to a human <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:51">[01:28:51]</a>.

Weil's view on interacting with LLMs often uses a human analogy:
*   **Reasoning Models**: When a model needs time to "think," the UI should provide updates or "babble a bunch of things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:31">[01:38:31]</a>, similar to how a human might say "Huh, that's a good question" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:39">[01:38:39]</a> before answering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:08">[01:38:08]</a>.
*   **Ensembles of Models**: Like brainstorming with diverse people, using a "group of models" to attack a problem and then having another model integrate their outputs can lead to better solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>.
*   **Chat Interface**: Chat is an "amazing interface" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:35">[01:41:35]</a> for LLMs because it's a "universal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:49">[01:41:49]</a>, unstructured method of communication that humans use for versatile interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:08">[01:42:08]</a>. It allows for "maximum communication bandwidth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:22">[01:42:22]</a> with the complexity of LLMs, even if other, more prescribed interfaces exist for specific, high-volume tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:19">[01:43:19]</a>.

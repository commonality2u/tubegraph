Naomi Gleit is the Head of Product at [[insight_on_company_culture_and_leadership_at_meta | Meta]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. She is the longest-serving executive at [[insight_on_company_culture_and_leadership_at_meta | Meta]], other than Mark Zuckerberg, having joined what was then called [[insight_on_company_culture_and_leadership_at_meta | Facebook]] as employee number 29 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. Gleit has been with the company for almost 20 years, witnessing its growth from 30 employees to a $1.5 trillion business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Early Career and Joining Facebook

Gleit's journey to [[insight_on_company_culture_and_leadership_at_meta | Facebook]] began while she was a Stanford student, researching the company for her senior thesis, believing it would succeed against competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. She repeatedly "cold called" the [[insight_on_company_culture_and_leadership_at_meta | Facebook]] office at 443 Emerson Avenue in Palo Alto, visiting five to ten times before an opening arose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. Initially, she interviewed for Sean Parker's personal assistant role but didn't get the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. A few months later, a marketing role became available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. Despite a competing offer from LinkedIn, she chose [[insight_on_company_culture_and_leadership_at_meta | Facebook]] due to her interest in social networking and observing its product-market fit among Stanford students and its growing waitlist for other colleges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. Her decision embodied the advice to "get on a rocket ship, don't ask what seat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.

### Transition to Product Management
Without a computer science degree, Gleit, holding a Bachelor of Arts, knew she wanted to build products by working with engineers and coders, identifying product management as her dream function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. She took the same persistent approach to becoming a Product Manager (PM), visiting the second floor where PMs and engineers worked after her marketing shifts on the third floor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. She volunteered for projects, helping with program management and providing product feedback, essentially doing the PM job informally for months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. When she formally applied for a PM role and moved to the second floor, the team gave her a standing ovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>.

## Role as Head of Product

As Head of Product, Naomi Gleit oversees several hundred PMs directly, but feels responsible for the entire PM community at [[insight_on_company_culture_and_leadership_at_meta | Meta]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. Her focus includes PM performance, culture, onboarding, and training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>. She believes PMs are a significant point of leverage for accomplishing company goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>.

## Insights on Mark Zuckerberg's Leadership

Having known Mark Zuckerberg for over 20 years, Gleit states there's a significant gap between public perception and who he truly is, believing the world is now seeing the real Mark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>. She describes him as a "learn-it-all," not a "know-it-all," capable of rapidly upskilling in various areas, from learning Chinese to excelling in Guitar and MMA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>. His transformation in public speaking and confidence has allowed his true self to be seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>.

Gleit also highlights Zuckerberg's qualities as a good friend, citing an example where he volunteered to teach a business class in East Palo Alto with her during a difficult time in her life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>. During this class, Zuckerberg shared four life lessons:
1.  Love yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>
2.  Only then can you truly serve others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>
3.  Focus on what you can control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>
4.  For those things, never give up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>

### The "Small Group"
Mark Zuckerberg manages [[insight_on_company_culture_and_leadership_at_meta | Meta]]'s 86,000 employees through a "small group" of core executives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>. This leadership team comprises individuals working on the company's most important projects, often with long tenure at [[insight_on_company_culture_and_leadership_at_meta | Meta]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>. Gleit characterizes this group as having many "disagreeable givers" â€“ people motivated by the company's mission who are willing to push back and offer honest feedback, even if it's not what the leader wants to hear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:30">[00:21:30]</a>. Zuckerberg actively fosters a culture of direct and honest feedback to maintain an accurate feedback loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:48">[00:22:48]</a>.

The "small group" operates with two weekly meetings:
*   **Strategic Meeting**: Open-ended, longer, and more unstructured for discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:29">[00:23:29]</a>.
*   **Operational Meeting**: Highly structured, going through priority projects with owners providing weekly updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:39">[00:23:39]</a>.

## Lessons from the Growth Team

Gleit was part of [[growth_tactics_at_facebook_and_meta | Facebook]]'s early growth team, which she believes was instrumental in pioneering a data-driven and product-driven approach to growth, a shift from traditional marketing or communications-led efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:09">[00:29:09]</a>.

### Activation Metrics and Retention
The legendary activation metric of "seven friends in 10 days" or "10 friends in 14 days" was indeed real <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:32">[00:26:32]</a>. The key insight for the growth team was realizing that retention and driving net growth were bigger levers than just acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:16">[00:27:16]</a>. They found a strong correlation between friending and user retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:36">[00:27:36]</a>. The importance of this metric was not its exact specificity but its ability to provide extreme clarity and rally the team around a shared goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:20">[00:34:20]</a>.

### Understand, Identify, Execute Framework
Gleit's "Naomi-ism" of "understand, identify, execute" originated from the growth team's decision in 2009 to prioritize data instrumentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:43">[00:29:43]</a>. They instrumented every step of the registration and new user onboarding flows to identify drop-off points and key growth opportunities, such as increasing friending or addressing email confirmation drop-offs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:14">[00:30:14]</a>.

### Product-Driven Solutions
This product-driven approach extended beyond growth. For instance, instead of a traditional Corporate Social Responsibility wing, Gleit's team built a product to raise money from the community for charity, raising billions over the years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:16">[00:31:16]</a>. Similarly, for product translation, instead of professional translators, they built a community-driven platform where users could make in-line translations, leading to support for over 100 languages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>.

### Removing Barriers
The growth team primarily focused on removing barriers, both macro and micro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:31">[00:39:31]</a>.
*   **Macro Barriers**: Expanding access to different user segments (e.g., high school students, work networks, open registration for any email address, access for feature phones via internet.org) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:05">[00:40:05]</a>.
*   **Micro Barriers**: Optimizing flows to reduce friction. An example was allowing users to confirm their account by clicking on any notification, not just a specific confirmation email, thus proving ownership and removing a barrier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:42">[00:41:42]</a>.

A significant outcome was the development of user onboarding, which was not initially needed when [[insight_on_company_culture_and_leadership_at_meta | Facebook]] was solely for college students but became crucial as the user base expanded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:05">[00:35:05]</a>. The onboarding focused on getting a profile picture and finding friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:17">[00:36:17]</a>.

## "Naomi-isms" and Leadership Principles

Gleit relies on a set of principles she calls "Naomi-isms," which she developed by observing best practices on the job and has shared both internally and externally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:15">[00:45:15]</a>.

### PM as a Conductor
She describes a PM as a "conductor" of an orchestra, where the team's functions (legal, policy, comms, data analytics, engineering, design) are like different instruments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:14">[00:46:14]</a>. The PM's role is to ensure everyone plays their part correctly, together, in harmony, and at the right tempo, without being the star of the show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:34">[00:46:34]</a>.

### Extreme Clarity
A critical principle for getting things done is "extreme clarity," meaning everyone has the same understanding of the facts, even if they disagree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:09">[00:49:09]</a>. This prevents misunderstandings and focuses conversations on actual disagreements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:43">[00:49:43]</a>.

#### Tactics for Extreme Clarity:
*   **Canonical Nomenclature**: Establish a shared vocabulary with defined terms to avoid miscommunication (e.g., distinguishing "consistency" from "accuracy") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:09">[00:50:09]</a>.
*   **Visuals in Meetings**: Use visuals (e.g., slides) in meetings and edit them in real-time to document decisions, options, and next steps, ensuring everyone sees and agrees on what was decided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:08">[00:51:08]</a>.
*   **Numbered Lists**: Always use numbered lists instead of bullet points, as numbers allow for clear reference to specific points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:25">[00:52:25]</a>.
*   **Canonical Docs**: For every project, there must be one canonical document that serves as the single source of truth, linking to all other relevant documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:33">[00:53:33]</a>. This document should include:
    *   Discrete areas of work (work streams) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:08">[00:54:08]</a>.
    *   Single-threaded owners for each work stream (or sub-work stream) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:11">[00:54:11]</a>.
    *   The team's process (e.g., canonical meetings, email lists, chat groups) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:49">[00:54:49]</a>.
    *   Canonical decks and visuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:29">[00:55:29]</a>.

### Simplifying Complex Problems
When joining a complex project, Gleit simplifies by creating the canonical document, akin to developing a "school pyramid" curriculum from kindergarten to PhD level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:12">[00:56:12]</a>. This means identifying the most basic building blocks of a problem and gradually adding complexity, ensuring different team members at varying levels of understanding can follow along <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:46">[00:56:46]</a>. This simplification process often reveals the most important issues to address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:38">[00:57:38]</a>.

### Strategy vs. Execution
Gleit believes that 80% of project issues are related to people or process, rather than strategy or execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:21">[00:58:21]</a>. She emphasizes achieving "perfect execution" first, because only then can one truly evaluate if the strategy is right or wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:41">[00:58:41]</a>.

### Running Effective Meetings
Gleit views meetings as high-value, high-cost time that must be productive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:53">[01:06:53]</a>.
*   **Pre-meeting**: Send an agenda with a pre-read 24 hours in advance, ensuring attendees have full context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:05">[01:07:05]</a>.
*   **During the meeting**:
    *   Focus on decision-making, presenting three options with a recommendation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:04">[01:08:04]</a>.
    *   Real-time edit the visual projection to document decisions and next steps clearly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:15">[01:08:15]</a>.
    *   Use a "traffic light" system (red, yellow, green) in a table to evaluate options against criteria (e.g., legal, policy, privacy, user experience, engineering feasibility) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:50">[01:09:50]</a>.
*   **Post-meeting**: Send notes, decisions, and next steps via "reply all" to the calendar invite within 24 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:28">[01:08:28]</a>.

### Developing a Strong First-Party Perspective
Gleit dedicates two to three-hour blocks in her schedule for thinking, sometimes with one or two trusted sparring partners, to develop her own strong "first-party perspective" rather than solely relying on consensus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:52">[01:22:52]</a>.

## Complex Projects: Teen Accounts
One of Gleit's most recent and complex cross-functional projects was the launch of Teen Accounts on Instagram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:54">[01:00:54]</a>. This initiative involved nearly every team and function at [[insight_on_company_culture_and_leadership_at_meta | Meta]], including Instagram, legal, policy, comms, marketing, and product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:14">[01:01:14]</a>. The goal was to put all teens by default into the safest settings on Instagram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:43">[01:01:43]</a>. A significant part of this shift is automatically transitioning tens of millions of public teen accounts to private, unless parents give permission to stay public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:03">[01:03:03]</a>. Gleit suggests that Apple and Google should make age information available to developers to simplify age verification across apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:14">[01:05:14]</a>.

## Personal Practices and Well-being

Gleit highlights four "must-haves" for her to perform effectively: eating, sleeping, alone time, and exercise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:48">[01:12:48]</a>. She prioritizes sleep, utilizing tools like an Eight Sleep mattress, eye masks, and blackout shades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:01">[01:13:01]</a>. As an introvert, alone time is crucial for her to recharge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:18">[01:13:18]</a>.

Exercise is a non-negotiable morning routine for her, providing significant mental health benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:32">[01:13:32]</a>. She set a goal to do five pull-ups, which taught her she "can do hard things," building confidence that extends to other areas of her life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:11">[01:14:11]</a>. She also focuses on protein consumption, recommending Promix protein products and canned seafood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:01">[01:31:01]</a>.

Gleit is an avid surfer, and sees many parallels between surfing and life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:40">[01:34:40]</a>. A key lesson from surfing is to "stand up into the fear" when catching a wave, as hesitating or pulling back can be more counterproductive and unsafe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:36">[01:35:36]</a>.

## Where to Find Her

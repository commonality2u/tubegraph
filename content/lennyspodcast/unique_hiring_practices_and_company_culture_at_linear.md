Linear, the project and issue tracking system co-founded and led by Ki Sarin, operates with a distinctive approach to product development, company culture, and hiring. Ki Sarin, formerly a founding designer at Coinbase and principal designer at [[airbnbs_unique_company_culture_and_growth | Airbnb]], has instilled a philosophy centered on quality, craft, and an empowering team structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## Focus on Craft and Quality

Linear places a significant emphasis on "craft" and "quality" in its product, viewing design as a critical differentiator in any domain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.
Ki Sarin believes that as an industry matures and becomes more crowded, the importance of design increases. Early iterations of new paradigms (like mobile or web) don't need to be exceptionally well-designed because they are first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. However, once a category is established and saturated (e.g., email clients), the bar for design becomes very high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Today, high-level design is essential from the beginning to even capture attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

At Linear, the commitment to quality stems from the belief that collaboration only happens if people genuinely use the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. Friction or "paper cuts" in the user experience can make a product annoying to use, hindering its purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

### Craft in Practice
*   **Hiring for Care:** The commitment to craft starts with [[hiring_and_retaining_top_talent_in_tech | hiring]] individuals who genuinely care about quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.
*   **Iterative Release:** While quality is paramount for general release, Linear is comfortable releasing early versions to internal teams or small, opt-in customer groups, even if they are "janky" or unpolished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. This allows for early feedback and realization of how features should work, before extensive upfront polishing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.
*   **Balancing Perfection and Speed:** The company avoids a "perfection mindset" that can prevent shipping, instead balancing quick iteration with rapid improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.
*   **Ownership and Autonomy:** Designers and engineers are given significant ownership over projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>. This fosters a sense of responsibility and allows them to identify and implement small, impactful improvements (e.g., dynamic "safe zones" in right-click menus) that enhance the user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>.
*   **Limited Formal Reviews:** There are not many formal reviews, encouraging teams to put things into the app for internal testing rather than waiting for perfect designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.

### Design as a Differentiator
While design is never the *sole* reason for a company's success, it acts as an enabler, similar to good technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:37">[00:27:37]</a>. A strong design and brand can attract users and improve their perception of the product, akin to the importance of packaging for physical products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:10">[00:28:10]</a>.
In crowded markets, design helps products stand out because people are visual and seek out high-quality options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:40">[00:29:40]</a>.

### Building a Brand
Linear's brand-building philosophy centers on authenticity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:59">[00:30:59]</a>. A brand is not just a logo or colors but the cumulative effect of a company's actions, words, customer treatment, and product development over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:44">[00:31:44]</a>. The founders, being software builders themselves, leveraged their shared experiences to resonate with their target audience of developers and technical teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:09">[01:24:09]</a>.

## Company Culture & Structure

Linear's culture is built around a lean, high-caliber team and a unique approach to product management.
*   **Lean Team Structure:** Linear aims to build more effectively with fewer, highly skilled people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:47">[00:57:47]</a>. The company has never more than doubled in size in a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:09">[00:58:09]</a>.
*   **Minimal Product Managers:** Linear has only one Product Manager (Head of Product) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:32">[01:00:32]</a>. This singular PM focuses on high-level direction and strategy, rather than day-to-day management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:21">[01:29:21]</a>.
*   **Empowered Engineers and Designers:** Without dedicated PMs, engineers and designers take on responsibilities traditionally held by PMs, including defining scope, communication, and decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>. This requires them to think broadly and be interested in more than just their specific skill set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:28">[00:20:28]</a>.
*   **Flexible Team Assembly:** Instead of durable cross-functional teams, groups assemble around specific projects and disperse upon completion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   **"Magic and Science" Approach:** Linear balances user research ("science") with intuition and taste ("magic") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:34">[00:45:34]</a>. The entire team is encouraged to engage with customers through calls, Slack channels, and observing feedback to build a deep understanding of problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:01">[00:46:01]</a>.
*   **No A/B Tests or Specific Metric Goals:** Linear generally avoids A/B testing and setting specific numerical goals for individual features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:40">[00:43:40]</a>. Success is defined by whether customers feel a problem is solved and enjoy the solution, rather than by metric increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00">[00:45:00]</a>.
*   **"Go Slow to Go Fast" Motto:** This philosophy emphasizes thoughtful consideration before action to avoid rushing and subsequent rework. It means taking time to think about what to do before doing it, ultimately leading to faster and better outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:04">[01:36:04]</a>.

### Internal Activities: The Baking Competition
As a fully remote company, Linear organizes a quarterly baking or cooking competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:31">[01:27:31]</a>. Employees choose a recipe, buy ingredients using a company card, and then cook/bake together on Zoom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:12">[01:26:12]</a>. This informal gathering fosters team bonding, allows for casual conversation, and reinforces the company's value of craft, even in a non-work context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:22">[01:27:22]</a>.

## Unique Hiring Practices

Linear's [[optimizing_hiring_and_team_management_for_tech_startups | hiring]] process is designed to find individuals who fit their unique culture and operational model.

### What Linear Looks For
*   **Broad Perspective and "Taste":** Beyond technical skills, Linear seeks candidates with "taste" or an understanding of *how* things are done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:34">[00:58:34]</a>. This includes [[hiring_and_team_dynamics_in_highgrowth_ai_startups | product sensibility]], the ability to articulate why certain choices are better, and a willingness to challenge past decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>.
*   **"More Than Their Title":** Candidates are expected to take on a broader scope than their traditional role, embodying a "not my job" attitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:16">[01:00:16]</a>. This creates a more adaptable and collaborative team where individuals can easily pick up different tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:08">[01:00:08]</a>.
*   **Product Thinking:** Interviewers, including Ki Sarin, delve into candidates' past projects, asking *why* decisions were made, *if* they agreed with them, and what they would have done differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:47">[01:06:47]</a>. This tests their ability to reason, articulate, and provide rationale for their opinions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:36">[01:07:36]</a>.

### The Paid Work Trial
A core part of Linear's [[effective_hiring_and_firing_strategies | hiring]] process is a paid work trial for all employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:28">[01:02:28]</a>.
*   **Structure:** After standard interview loops, candidates work as mini-contractors on a vague problem statement, similar to a real project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:02">[01:03:02]</a>. They must understand the problem, scope it, build a solution, and present their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:14">[01:03:14]</a>.
*   **Benefits:**
    *   **For Linear:** It allows the company to see how a candidate operates in their environment, approaches problems, thinks, and makes progress quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:50">[01:05:50]</a>.
    *   **For Candidates:** It provides a realistic glimpse into the company culture, code quality, and daily work, helping them understand what they are "signing off for" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:44">[01:03:44]</a>. Candidates gain access to internal tools (Slack, Notion) and interact with team members, getting to know people before committing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:34">[01:05:34]</a>.
*   **Feasibility:** While unique, Linear makes efforts to accommodate candidates' schedules (e.g., weekends, holidays) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>. Most candidates appreciate the transparency and the opportunity to experience the company firsthand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:24">[01:05:24]</a>.

## The Linear Method of Building Products

Linear formalized its product philosophy into "[[the_linear_method_of_building_products_and_opinionated_software | The Linear Method of Building Products]]," which shares their unique thinking on software development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

### Opinionated Software
Linear believes productivity software, especially for companies, should be "opinionated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:40">[00:39:40]</a>.
*   **Avoiding Flexibility Traps:** While flexibility can be good, it often leads to users spending too much time figuring out how to use a tool, rather than focusing on their actual work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:15">[00:40:15]</a>.
*   **Providing Good Defaults:** Linear provides "good defaults" and "good opinions" on how features and workflows should operate, minimizing decision-making for users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:31">[00:40:31]</a>.
*   **Optimized Solutions:** This approach allows Linear to offer what they believe is the most optimized solution for specific use cases, designing for "someone" rather than attempting to design "everything for everyone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:47">[00:40:47]</a>.

### Cycles
The "Cycles" concept, similar to sprints, is an optional feature within Linear's product and a core part of its own working methodology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:35">[00:41:35]</a>.
*   **Purpose:** Cycles help teams focus on a defined set of priorities for a specific time frame (e.g., one or two weeks), countering the overwhelming "infinite list of things to do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:53">[00:41:53]</a>.
*   **Accountability:** If priorities change, the team has a clear initial plan to reference, providing an answer for why certain tasks were deferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:41">[00:42:41]</a>.
*   **Automation:** Cycles run on an automated schedule, reducing manual setup and allowing teams to consistently focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:03">[00:43:03]</a>.

## Focus and Decision Making

Ki Sarin attributes his personal and company focus to a few guiding principles:
*   **Y Combinator Advice:** Focus on three core activities: talk to customers, build the product, and exercise (to avoid burnout) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:50">[00:53:50]</a>.
*   **"Is This Important to Do Now?":** Continuously evaluate whether a task is critical for the current stage or can be done later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:49">[00:54:49]</a>.
*   **Main Quest vs. Side Quest:** Drawing an analogy from RPG games, Ki encourages avoiding "side quests" – ideas or tasks that don't directly advance the main goal of building and improving the product for customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:46">[00:55:46]</a>. This helps the company prioritize and avoid distractions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:07">[00:56:07]</a>.

This disciplined approach to focus, combined with a strong emphasis on craft and a lean, empowered team, underpins Linear's unique operations and success.

In B2B, the primary focus is not merely selling commodities, but rather **solving problems** for customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. This perspective is crucial for both sales and product teams to succeed in the SaaS landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## Building a Sales Team

While some truly self-served products like Canva can defer hiring a sales team until much later in their growth, most B2B businesses will eventually need one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

### When to Hire Your First Salesperson

Founders should be honest about the sales motion required to acquire their first customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. If customers require effort, have security questions, or need onboarding, a self-serve Product-Led Growth (PLG) motion alone will likely fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

Key signs it's time to hire a salesperson:
*   You've closed your first 10-15 "unaffiliated" customers yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.
*   You are spending more than 20% of your time on sales activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.
*   There's a repeatable process for selling the product that can be taught <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>.

### Initial Sales Hires

The biggest mistake founders make is hiring a VP of Sales too early <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>. Instead, focus on hiring individual contributors first:
*   **Hire two sales reps (Account Executives - AEs) immediately, not just one**, to allow for A/B testing and comparison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>.
*   **Look for individuals you would personally buy your product from** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>. These "quirky" individuals may not have traditional sales backgrounds but are passionate and knowledgeable about the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>.
*   **They should have a couple of years of B2B sales experience** and enough maturity to be trusted with leads and customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:17">[00:26:17]</a>.
*   **Interview at least 30 reps** to find the right "magicians" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>.
*   **Ensure their last product was *harder* to sell** than yours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:06">[00:55:06]</a>. This ensures they've developed strong selling skills and won't melt when faced with complexity or competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:15">[00:58:15]</a>.

#### Interviewing Sales Candidates
When interviewing sales candidates, ask them to "sell me this pen" â€” specifically, sell your product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:45">[00:35:45]</a>. Give them time to prepare by watching explainer videos or webinars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:55">[00:35:55]</a>. This reveals if they understand the product and can effectively solve problems, which is the core of B2B sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:28">[00:37:28]</a>.

### Sales Compensation

Founders often worry too much about the top-line On-Target Earnings (OTE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:34">[00:37:34]</a>.
*   **Pay market rate** for sales reps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:34">[00:46:34]</a>.
*   **Typical split is 50% base salary and 50% bonus** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:07">[00:47:07]</a>.
*   **Initially, let reps keep 100% of what they close for the first 1-3 months** as a ramp-up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:10">[00:46:10]</a>.
*   **Target a 3-5x return on OTE**: A sales rep should ideally bring in 3x (for SMB), 4x (mid-market), or 5x (enterprise) what they take home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>. If they hit this, they are accretive to the business, and you *want* them to make a lot of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:25">[00:49:25]</a>.

### Hiring a VP of Sales

Hire a VP of Sales only after you have **two sales reps consistently hitting quota** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>. This role is typically for scaling the team from 3 to 300 reps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>.
*   **Look for a "stretch VP of Sales"**: Someone who was a director or senior director previously and is eager for career growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:30">[01:02:30]</a>. Seasoned VPs might not be willing to do the necessary hands-on work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:41">[01:02:41]</a>.
*   **Your VP of Sales must *want* to do sales** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:19">[00:27:19]</a>. They should be actively involved in deals for 20-30 hours a week, especially when they start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:44">[00:23:44]</a>. If they only want to manage, it's a red flag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:37">[00:23:37]</a>.
*   **Interview question**: Ask "What do you want to do your first 14 days?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:31">[00:30:31]</a> The correct answer should involve meeting customers or joining sales calls, not focusing on process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>.

### Sales Org Evolution

Sales organizations typically scale by "rules of eight" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:06">[01:00:06]</a>:
*   **SDRs (Sales Development Representatives)**: Entry-level positions, often fresh out of school, focused on generating leads through email and calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:51">[01:05:51]</a>. Eight SDRs need one manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:43">[01:00:43]</a>.
*   **AEs (Account Executives)**: More seasoned reps responsible for closing deals passed to them by SDRs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:36">[01:06:36]</a>. Eight AEs need a director <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:47">[01:00:47]</a>.
*   **Scaling Management**: A VP of Sales, once managing eight AEs, will typically look to hire two directors to manage growing teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:55">[01:01:55]</a>. A sales leader's ability to scale depends on their ability to hire better managers underneath them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:17">[01:19:17]</a>.

### Product Involvement in Sales

Product leaders, especially the VP of Product, should be deeply involved in sales, particularly for large deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:28">[01:10:28]</a>.
*   **Being a "mini CEO" in sales meetings**: A knowledgeable product leader can make commitments and offer solutions that a sales rep cannot, helping close complex deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:15">[01:11:15]</a>. They must be utterly fluent in the product and its intricacies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:34">[01:13:34]</a>.
*   [[the_role_of_a_product_manager | Product managers]] and directors can also play this role if they possess deep product knowledge and gravitas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:18">[01:12:18]</a>.

### Handling Sales Feature Requests

The tension between product and sales is a sign of a well-run B2B company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>. To manage this:
*   **Give the Head of Sales a fixed "budget"** (e.g., story points or a percentage of the pie chart) for feature requests each quarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:46">[01:13:46]</a>.
*   **Force sales to prioritize requests** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:49">[01:14:49]</a>. This prevents constant shifts in priorities based on the latest big deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:01">[01:14:01]</a>.
*   **Maintain objective communication**: Product should regularly review the budget and upcoming plans with sales, explaining the impact of changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:05">[01:16:05]</a>.
*   **Push decisions up**: Individual sales or product contributors should raise requests to their managers for resolution, not make commitments themselves, to avoid organizational chaos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:39">[01:18:39]</a>.

### Product Team P&L Responsibility and Revenue Goals

While it's crucial for product teams to be aligned with overall revenue goals, *weaponizing* them with direct P&L responsibilities for experimental features can be detrimental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:17">[01:23:17]</a>.
*   **Avoid customer-hostile tactics**: Pushing teams to monetize aggressively (e.g., forced upsells, unearned price increases) can damage customer relationships and hinder long-term revenue compounding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:56">[01:25:56]</a>.
*   **Focus on churn**: For PLG and self-service models, relentlessly reducing churn is the most important metric, as it enables long-term growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:39">[01:26:39]</a>.
*   **Value of Free/Freemium**: Products that offer free editions or extended free trials tend to be better because they are forced to invest in excellent onboarding and user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:47">[01:37:47]</a>. Founders and product leaders must be the "VP of free" to champion the long-tail free users, as sales and growth teams will naturally prioritize immediate monetization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:16">[01:32:16]</a>.

## General Sales Advice for Founders and Product Leaders

*   **Always ask for the "next step"**: After every customer meeting, secure a tangible next step, whether it's another demo, a meeting with a new stakeholder, or a pilot program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:41">[01:27:41]</a>. Don't end calls without clarity on how to move the deal forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>.
*   **Focus on problem-solving**: The best sales reps identify and solve problems for customers, rather than just pushing a product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. They have the confidence to advise customers when their product isn't the right fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:43">[00:38:43]</a>.
*   **Learn from lost deals**: Companies should spend more time analyzing and discussing deals they lost than those they won <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:31">[01:34:31]</a>.
*   **Be the "Vanguard"**: In challenging times, [[the_role_of_strategy_in_product_leadership | product leaders]] should inject energy into their companies, prioritize customer happiness, and focus on shipping a few *great* things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:10">[01:40:10]</a>. This inspires the entire organization, including marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:21">[01:41:21]</a>.

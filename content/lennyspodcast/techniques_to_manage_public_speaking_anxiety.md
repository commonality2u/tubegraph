Public speaking often evokes significant anxiety for many individuals. Matt Abrahams, a professor at Stanford University's Graduate School of Business and author of *Think Faster and Talk Smarter*, highlights that addressing anxiety and improving [[strategies_for_spontaneous_speaking | spontaneous speaking]] are the two areas people most frequently seek help with regarding communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:10">[01:19:10]</a>. Speaking effectively is described as a "superpower" for career advancement, crucial for interviewing, excelling in meetings, pitching ideas, and leading teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:22">[01:38:22]</a>. The good news is that these skills can be improved with practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:35">[01:50:35]</a>.

## Understanding Public Speaking Anxiety

It's common to feel nervous before big talks or even before podcast episodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:20">[01:55:20]</a>. Many people believe they are the only ones who feel nervous, especially when observing seemingly effortless communicators like executives or TED Talk speakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:40">[01:41:40]</a>. However, this perception often doesn't account for the extensive preparation involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:50">[01:49:50]</a>. Anxiety is considered a normal and innate human condition when communicating in front of others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:27">[02:00:27]</a>. Normalizing anxiety by acknowledging that others experience it can help reduce the pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:27">[02:00:27]</a>. Improving anxiety management is a process, not an on/off switch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:47">[02:48:47]</a>.

## [[practical_advice_for_reducing_nerves_in_public_speaking | Practical Advice for Reducing Nerves in Public Speaking]]

Several [[practical_advice_for_reducing_nerves_in_public_speaking | techniques for managing public speaking anxiety]] are recommended:

*   **Visualization** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>
    *   This technique is particularly useful for desensitization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>. Instead of imagining the audience naked (which is not good advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:23:43">[06:23:43]</a>), visualize yourself in the speaking environment, delivering the presentation, and receiving a positive response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:58:39">[06:58:39]</a>. This acts as a dress rehearsal, making the actual event feel less new and novel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:51:30">[08:51:30]</a>. Athletes often use visualization to prepare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:27">[09:00:27]</a>. Virtual reality tools can also aid in this desensitization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:03">[07:20:03]</a>. It helps create distance from anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:46:25">[10:46:25]</a>.
*   **Strive for Connection Over Perfection (Dare to be Dull)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:55">[00:34:55]</a>
    *   This concept, originating from improvisation, encourages focusing on presence and connection rather than perfection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:17:15">[11:17:15]</a>. The pressure to be perfect taxes cognitive bandwidth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:57:42">[11:57:42]</a>. By daring to be "dull" – simply getting the task done, answering the question, or engaging in small talk – you reduce self-evaluation, freeing up mental resources to genuinely connect and succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:46:02">[12:46:02]</a>. This often leads to better and more insightful communication because you're less nervous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:04:47">[13:04:47]</a>.
*   **Cognitive Reframing (e.g., "I'm Excited")** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:50:11">[13:50:11]</a>
    *   Research by Allison Woods Brooks suggests that the physiological arousal for anxiety (e.g., faster heart rate, shakiness) is similar to that for excitement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:28:46">[14:28:46]</a>. How we label this arousal matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:07:07">[15:07:07]</a>. By telling yourself, "This is exciting, I get to share my point of view," instead of "I'm nervous," it causes you to relax and can lead to being perceived as communicating better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:17:15">[15:17:15]</a>. This [[misconceptions_about_public_speaking | technique]] sounds trivial but can be very effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:56:56">[15:56:56]</a>.
*   **Mantras / Positive Self-Talk** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:13:17">[16:13:17]</a>
    *   Our inner voice often creates negative chatter before communicating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:33:43">[16:33:43]</a>. Changing this talk track can be helpful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:56:07">[16:56:07]</a>. Simple mantras like "I have value to bring" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:09:00">[17:09:00]</a>, "You've got this," "I'm prepared," or "I know my stuff" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:33:14">[17:33:14]</a> can shift mindset. Writing it on a Post-it note or setting a phone reminder can be useful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:39:58">[17:39:58]</a>. Another effective mantra is, "It's not about me, it's about my content" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:38:09">[18:38:09]</a>. Personifying your inner critic (e.g., naming it "Jim") and telling it, "Jim, I got this," can also help rationalize negative self-talk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:07:12">[19:07:12]</a>.
*   **Breathing Techniques** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:55:00">[24:55:00]</a>
    *   Breathing is crucial for managing anxiety symptoms, as it slows heart rate, normalizes voice, and reduces shakiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:14:15">[26:14:15]</a>. Deep belly breathing is important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:31:39">[26:31:39]</a>. The "double inhalation" involves breathing in fully, sneaking in a little extra air, and then taking a long exhale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:40:02">[26:40:02]</a>. The key to relaxation is the exhale, which should be longer than the inhale – ideally twice as long (e.g., three-count inhale, six-count exhale) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:01:21">[27:01:21]</a>. This technique helps physiologically and improves focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:21:05">[27:21:05]</a>.
*   **Tongue Twisters** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:05:07">[29:05:07]</a>
    *   Saying tongue twisters aloud can help you get present-oriented, as you cannot say them correctly without focusing on the moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:09:02">[29:09:02]</a>. This also serves to warm up your voice, which many nervous speakers neglect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:15:08">[29:15:08]</a>.
*   **Swearing (Privately)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:57:33">[30:57:33]</a>
    *   Research suggests that swearing can reduce anxiety by releasing neurochemicals that blunt anxiety-associated neurochemicals like cortisol, providing a dopamine and serotonin hit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:01:00">[31:01:00]</a>. It also has an analgesic effect, reducing pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:39:10">[31:31:39]</a>. This is meant for private use, not on stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:16:03">[31:16:03]</a>.
*   **Treat Presentations as Conversations** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:04:10">[22:04:10]</a>
    *   Many people are more comfortable in conversation than presenting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:05:08">[22:05:08]</a>. You can set up presentations or meetings as conversations, even if it's a conversation with yourself (e.g., "Today I have three questions I'd like to answer. Question number one is..."). This reframes the act of presenting, ratcheting down anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:24:43">[22:24:43]</a>.
*   **Distracting the Audience** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:27:00">[23:27:00]</a>
    *   To get attention off yourself during the initial nervous moments, you can distract the audience. This might involve starting with a video, asking them a question, telling a story, or asking them to read something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:14:02">[24:14:02]</a>. The goal is to shift from presenter to facilitator, allowing you to calm down before easing into your content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:58:04">[23:58:04]</a>. The first minute before speaking and the first minute of speaking are typically the most nervous periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:40:53">[24:40:53]</a>.

## Preparing for [[strategies_for_spontaneous_speaking | Spontaneous Speaking]]

The majority of daily communication involves [[strategies_for_spontaneous_speaking | spontaneous speaking]] rather than prepared talks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:42:47">[34:42:47]</a>. The fundamental principle is that everyone can improve at it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:55:01">[34:55:01]</a>. Counter-intuitively, you must prepare to be spontaneous, much like athletes or jazz musicians practice extensively to perform spontaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:11:32">[35:11:32]</a>. Improvement requires attacking both mindset and approach, as well as the actual messaging through structure and focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:48:38">[35:48:38]</a>.

### Using Structures for Clarity

When speaking spontaneously, people often spew out information in lists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:33:23">[36:33:23]</a>. Our brains are wired for story and logical connection of ideas, not lists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:13:00">[37:13:00]</a>. Using a structure provides a beginning, middle, and end, making communication more digestible and memorable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:22:36">[37:22:36]</a>. It tells you *how* to say something, so you only need to focus on *what* to say <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:56:49">[37:56:49]</a>.

Examples of useful structures:

*   **Problem-Solution-Benefit:** Common in advertising, it identifies a problem, offers a solution, and explains the benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:33:04">[37:33:04]</a>.
*   **PREP (Point, Reason, Example, Point)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:38:00">[38:38:00]</a>:
    1.  **P**oint: Make your main point.
    2.  **R**eason: Give a reason for making that point.
    3.  **E**xample: Provide a specific example.
    4.  **P**oint: Restate or review your main point.
*   **What-So What-Now What** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:02:14">[39:02:14]</a>:
    1.  **What:** Describe your product, service, update, or feedback.
    2.  **So What:** Explain why it's important and relevant to your audience.
    3.  **Now What:** Detail what comes next or what actions should be taken.
        This structure is highly beneficial for product teams, updates, and stand-up meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:27:54">[39:27:54]</a>.

To remember and effectively deploy these structures, use catchy names or mnemonics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:29:43">[40:29:43]</a>. The best way to get familiar with them is to use them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:46:00">[40:46:00]</a>. For example, after listening to a podcast or reading something, take a moment to summarize: "What was it about? Why is it important to me? What can I do with that information?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:50:00">[40:50:00]</a>. Consistent practice, reflection on what worked, and seeking feedback are vital for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:41:40">[41:41:40]</a>.

## Specific Communication Scenarios

### Small Talk

Many people dread small talk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:02:19">[46:02:19]</a>. However, significant things happen in small talk, including forming and fostering relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:11:00">[46:11:00]</a>.

*   **Be Interested, Not Interesting:** The best advice for small talk is to focus on the other person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:44:00">[46:44:00]</a>. Small talk is more like playing hacky sack – setting the other person up for success and getting the ball back to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:55:00">[46:55:00]</a>.
*   **Comparable Levels of Disclosure:** There should be a balance in the depth of disclosure over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:12:00">[47:12:00]</a>. If one person shares something very personal while the other offers only superficial details, it creates discrepancy and feels awkward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:29:00">[47:29:00]</a>. Avoid being too disclosive too quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:57:00">[47:57:00]</a>.
*   **Balance Shifting and Supporting Responses:**
    *   **Supporting Responses:** Ask questions that encourage the other person to continue sharing (e.g., "Did you spend time in San Jose?").
    *   **Shifting Responses:** Redirect the conversation back to yourself (e.g., "Oh, you went to Costa Rica? I went to Hawaii.").
    A good conversation involves more supporting responses than shifting ones, but some shifting is necessary to show reciprocity and avoid appearing unwilling to share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:52:00">[48:52:00]</a>.

### Giving Feedback

Feedback is an opportunity to problem-solve and requires collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:53:00">[52:53:00]</a>. It's about inviting the other person to work together on an issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:07:00">[53:07:00]</a>.

*   **What-So What-Now What (for quick feedback):**
    *   **What:** Describe the specific behavior or situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:07:00">[54:07:00]</a>.
    *   **So What:** Explain the impact or consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:16:00">[54:16:00]</a>.
    *   **Now What:** Suggest a specific action or next step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:22:00">[54:22:00]</a>.
*   **Four I's Structure (more robust):**
    1.  **I**nformation: Set the context and describe the behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:04:00">[55:04:00]</a>.
    2.  **I**mpact: Explain the impact this behavior had on you, the feedback giver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:10:00">[55:10:00]</a>.
    3.  **I**nvitation: Invite the person to discuss or collaborate on a solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:15:00">[55:15:00]</a>.
    4.  **I**mplications: Discuss the broader consequences or benefits of changing the behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:17:00">[55:17:00]</a>.

### Giving Toasts and Tributes

Toasts are a frequent public speaking event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:06:00">[57:06:00]</a>. Avoid toasts that are too long or focus on the speaker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:48:00">[56:48:00]</a>.

*   **WHAT Acronym:**
    1.  **W**hy are we here?: State the purpose of the gathering (if not obvious) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:23:00">[57:23:00]</a>.
    2.  **H**ow are you connected?: Briefly explain your relationship to the person or event being celebrated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:42:00">[57:42:00]</a>.
    3.  **A**necdote(s): Share one or two relevant, accessible, and concise stories or examples that are insightful and avoid overly personal details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:03:00">[58:03:00]</a>. This is where the core content or tribute often goes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:58:00">[59:58:00]</a>.
    4.  **T**hanks/Gratitude: Express thanks and gratitude, signaling closure with a "cheers" or similar phrase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:18:00">[58:18:00]</a>.
*   **Be Brief:** No one complains about a toast that is too brief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:36:00">[59:36:00]</a>.
*   **Be Emotional (Show, Don't Tell):** Genuine emotion connects with people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:52">[01:00:52]</a>. The best way to convey emotion is through anecdotes and stories that *reveal* the emotion, rather than just stating it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:51">[01:01:51]</a>.

### Q&A Sessions

View Q&A as an opportunity to extend, expand, connect, and learn, even in hostile situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:06">[01:03:06]</a>.

*   **Avoid Pet Peeves:**
    *   Don't say "Good question" to every question; it's a filler that delays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:39">[01:03:39]</a>.
    *   Avoid ending answers with "Does that make sense?" Instead, ask "Did I answer your question?" or "Do you have a follow-up question?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:02">[01:04:02]</a>.
*   **ADD Acronym (for answering questions):**
    1.  **A**nswer: Answer the question cleanly and concisely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:08">[01:07:08]</a>.
    2.  **D**etailed Example: Provide a detailed example to reinforce the answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:11">[01:07:11]</a>.
    3.  **D**escribe Relevance: Explain the relevance or significance of the answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:12">[01:07:12]</a>. This connects the dots for the audience, as common sense is not always common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:10">[01:09:10]</a>.

### Apologizing

Take the time to apologize appropriately, focusing on the transgression, not just how someone felt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:34">[01:07:34]</a>.

*   **AAA Acronym (for apologizing):**
    1.  **A**cknowledge: Clearly state what you did, the specific behavior or offense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:18">[01:08:18]</a>.
    2.  **A**ppreciate: Express understanding or appreciation for the difficulty or impact you caused the other person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:35">[01:08:35]</a>.
    3.  **A**mend: State specific actions you will take to remedy the situation or prevent it from happening again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:46">[01:08:46]</a>. This signals understanding and commitment to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:56">[01:08:56]</a>.

## Continuous Improvement

Improving communication is a process that requires initiative, self-compassion, and time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. Resources like Toastmasters, improvisation classes, and university extension courses provide opportunities for practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>. The only way to get better is to *do* communication and watch communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:53">[01:43:53]</a>. It's about getting the repetitions in, reflecting on what worked, and seeking feedback from others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:53">[01:43:53]</a>.

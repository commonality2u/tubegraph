[[The role of product managers | Product management]] is a multifaceted discipline, but at its core, it deeply relies on understanding and empathizing with users. Mahika Kapor, a design engineering PM hybrid at Figma, is renowned for her ability to cultivate a compelling vision and rally teams by leveraging deep user insights and fostering a culture of empathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

## Vision Rooted in User Empathy
A compelling vision is foundational for product success, especially given the messy and chaotic nature of the [[Product management and leadership insights | product development]] cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. This vision cannot be created in a vacuum; it must be fundamentally inseparable from both users and the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.

To craft a compelling vision, it's essential to integrate [[The integration of user research in product development | user research]] insights that help product managers *feel* what a user is experiencing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. This involves:
*   **Cross-pollination of functions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>: Ensuring that research insights, beautiful designs and prototypes, and engineering feasibility are intertwined from the visioning phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.
*   **Direct user engagement** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">[00:23:41]</a>: Continuously talking to users to gather anecdotes and build an intuition about their needs and behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:56">[00:23:56]</a>. This extends to asking *non-users* why they aren't using the product, which can lead to incredibly insightful conversations about perception and marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:38">[00:44:38]</a>.
*   **Operationalizing insights** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:51">[00:47:51]</a>: This includes setting up recurring cadences with sales teams to understand customer pain points, sharing product roadmap updates, and creating artifacts (like loom videos) that sales can use to evangelize new features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:22">[00:48:22]</a>. Unactionable insights can be stored in a backlog system (e.g., Asana via Slack integration) for later review <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:09">[00:50:09]</a>.

### Example: FigJam's Meetings Experience
For FigJam, the vision for the "meetings experience" was driven by an early insight: brainstorms were the most common and successful meeting type in FigJam files <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>. Brainstorms are inherently democratic, allowing ideas to come from anywhere and giving voice to quieter participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>. The vision became: how can we make the generative, democratic nature of a brainstorm the norm for *all* kinds of meetings? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a> This led to features like music and voting that help people get into flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>.

## Building Conviction and Momentum
Deep conviction in an idea is crucial for navigating the messy journey of zero-to-one product development and rallying a team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:05">[00:22:05]</a>. This conviction often stems from strong intuition, built through constant user conversations and an insatiable curiosity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:32">[00:23:32]</a>.

*   **Putting out "A-minus ideas"**: It's more effective to put out an initial idea, even if it's imperfect, because people are more likely to react to *something* than to nothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:15">[00:25:15]</a>. This allows for feedback and refinement, moving towards an "A-plus" solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:57">[00:25:57]</a>.
*   **Strong opinions, weakly held**: While conviction is vital, it must be balanced with the agility to pivot when external signals suggest a different direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:27">[00:26:27]</a>. Explicitly communicating confidence levels ("medium confidence") encourages team members to speak up and offer their own perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:02">[00:28:02]</a>.
*   **Direct, two-way communication**: Feedback should be a constantly flowing, two-way street <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:09">[00:30:09]</a>. Asking for feedback first can incentivize others to share their perspectives, and acting on feedback demonstrates its value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:05">[00:31:05]</a>.

## Driving Hype and Emotional Connection
Getting people excited about a product is not just about data or logic; it's about generating an emotional, visceral response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:43">[00:38:43]</a>. This means:
*   **Internal hype**: Product managers must take responsibility for generating excitement internally, finding opportunities in company-wide forums (like sales kickoffs or hackathons) to demonstrate the product's potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:46">[00:34:46]</a>. This helps people see what the product manager sees in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:29">[00:36:29]</a>.
*   **External hype**: Understanding a product's unique "brand of delight" is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:42">[00:41:42]</a>. For FigJam, which has a "cheeky" and "fun" personality, its first anniversary was celebrated with an "Easter egg hunt" of new features hidden as "birthday presents" for users, making them feel special and driving emotional connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:35">[00:40:35]</a>.

## Cultivating a Culture of Investment
Investing in team culture and internal relationships is crucial because it builds trust and durability, especially when product roadmaps and priorities change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:07">[01:05:07]</a>.
*   **Fostering personal connections**: Activities like "Hot Seat," where team members ask each other questions about their backgrounds, can help build connection and understanding of individual motivations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:48">[00:59:48]</a>. Events like "Figgies" (an Oscars-style awards ceremony) can celebrate the unique quirks and energy people bring to the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:46">[01:02:46]</a>.
*   **Understanding individual motivations**: On a product team, different individuals (engineers, designers, researchers, data scientists) have varied desires for involvement in the product visioning phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:20">[01:30:20]</a>. Some prefer solutions to be handed to them, while others need to contribute to feel passionate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:33">[01:30:33]</a>. Directly asking about their preferred level of involvement and making decisions in the open, even with a leading point of view, caters to individuals and fosters a high-functioning team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:22">[01:31:22]</a>.
*   **Early dogfooding and vulnerability**: Putting a product on staging early and embracing a multi-month dogfooding process allows for crucial internal feedback, which matures the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:10">[01:27:10]</a>. This also makes people invested, as they feel they "shaped that part of the product" when their feedback is implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:29">[01:28:29]</a>. This openness elevates product quality, reinforcing that [[The art and role of product management | product development]] is a team sport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:55">[01:28:55]</a>.

By combining deep user empathy, strategic conviction, effective hype generation, and a strong, inclusive team culture, product managers can drive successful [[The impact of user feedback on product development | product development]] and innovation.

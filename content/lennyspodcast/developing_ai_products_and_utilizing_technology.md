Dares Shaw, co-founder and CTO of HubSpot, shares his unique perspective on developing products, especially in the context of [[AI in Product Development | AI]], emphasizing systematic thinking, simplicity, and continuous iteration. He views [[AI in Product Development | AI]] as a transformative shift comparable to the advent of the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:04">[01:32:04]</a>.

## The Transformative Power of AI

Shaw believes that while early computers provided "compute at scale" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:47">[01:32:47]</a> and the internet offered "distribution at scale" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:54">[01:32:54]</a>, [[AI in Product Development | AI]] delivers "cognition at scale" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:04">[01:33:04]</a>. This capability to amplify the human brain represents an unprecedented leap in technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:06">[01:33:06]</a>. He highlights that [[AI in Product Development | AI]] will lead to a similar surge in great companies being created, just as the internet did <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:42">[01:33:42]</a>.

### From Imperative to Declarative Models

A key [[impact_of_ai_on_product_development | impact of AI on product development]] is the shift from imperative to declarative models in software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:43">[01:34:43]</a>.
*   **Imperative Model**: Users provide step-by-step instructions to the computer to achieve a desired outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:49">[01:34:49]</a>.
*   **Declarative Model**: Users describe the desired outcome, and the software figures out the steps to get there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:58">[01:34:58]</a>. Shaw uses SQL as an analogy, where users specify the data they want rather than coding how to retrieve it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:06">[01:35:06]</a>.

This shift allows for more intuitive interfaces, where users can express their intentions directly, whether through text or voice, eliminating the "impedance mismatch" between a user's mental model and the software's actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:31">[01:35:31]</a>.

## The Chatspot Experience

Shaw's journey with [[AI in Product Development | AI]] is exemplified by his development of Chatspot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:21">[01:31:21]</a>. He previously built a similar chatbot, Growth Bot, six and a half years prior, which "didn't work really well" because the underlying technology for such declarative interfaces wasn't yet mature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:20">[01:36:20]</a>. The advancements in [[impact_of_ai_and_machine_learning_on_product_development | AI and machine learning]] now make such products viable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:31">[01:36:31]</a>. Chatspot demonstrates the potential of [[leveraging_ai_tools_in_product_management | AI tools]] to make software truly intuitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:56">[01:36:56]</a>.

## Learning and Building with AI

Shaw advises individuals and companies to learn about [[AI in Product Development | AI]] by finding an actual problem they care about and trying to solve it using [[tips_for_using_ai_in_product_development | AI tools]] or APIs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:47">[01:37:47]</a>. This hands-on approach provides tangible goals and motivates deeper understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:50">[01:37:50]</a>. He also advocates for "learning in public" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:37">[01:38:37]</a>, sharing insights and receiving feedback from the wider community.

## Principles for Product Development and Technology Utilization

Shaw's broader philosophy, which extends to [[AI in Product Development | AI product development]], includes:

### Fighting Complexity (Entropy)
He posits that every leader and business is fighting the "second law of thermodynamics," which states that within a closed system, entropy (disorder and randomness) increases over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:37">[01:37:37]</a>. In companies, this manifests as increasing complexity – more layers of management, more headcount, slower processes, and decreasing margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:01">[01:39:01]</a>. Complexity, he states, reliably kills companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:30">[01:39:30]</a>.

To combat this, he emphasizes the importance of:
*   **"Fight for Simplicity"**: Simplicity is crucial and requires continuous effort because the natural tendency of systems is towards complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:53">[01:39:53]</a>.
*   **Systematic Constraints**: Implement guardrails and constraints to enforce simplicity, like HubSpot's early rule of "every time you added a feature, you had to take one out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:06">[01:41:06]</a>. This forces teams to consider the long-term cost of complexity, not just implementation and maintenance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:36">[01:42:36]</a>.

### Leaning into Strengths
Shaw advises focusing on what you're exceptional at and avoiding things you're not good at or don't enjoy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:22">[01:17:22]</a>. His decision to never have direct reports at HubSpot, despite being a co-founder and CTO, is a prime example of this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:56">[01:16:56]</a>. This focus allows him to leverage his strengths and avoid the "downside of scale" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:36">[01:18:36]</a>.

### High Conviction, Low Consensus Bets
A "zigging when others are zagging" approach involves making "high conviction, low consensus bets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:47">[00:28:47]</a> – being right about something others think you're wrong about for a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a>. HubSpot's early focus on the SMB market, despite conventional wisdom, is an example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:14">[00:29:14]</a>.

### Data-Informed Decision Making
While valuing data, Shaw emphasizes that "data doesn't make decisions, people do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:18">[01:18:18]</a>. He uses a systematic approach, imagining a "python function" or "Excel spreadsheet" to identify and prioritize factors relevant to a decision, even if precise weights can't be assigned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>.

### "Culture as a Product"
Culture is viewed as a product built for the team, just as a product is built for customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:31">[01:21:31]</a>. This means continuously iterating on culture based on feedback (e.g., using NPS surveys with employees) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:07">[01:22:07]</a>, rather than trying to preserve a fixed state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>.

These principles provide a framework for navigating the complexities of product development, particularly as [[future_of_startups_and_product_development_with_ai | AI reshapes the future of startups and product development]].

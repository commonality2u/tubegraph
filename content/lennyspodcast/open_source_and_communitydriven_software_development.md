Jemo Roush, founder and CEO of Vercel, is a legendary engineer and contributor to [[the_evolution_of_software_programming | open source]] projects, having created popular JavaScript frameworks like Next.js and Socket.io <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:52">[01:51:52]</a>. His company, Vercel, aims to enable the world to build and ship the best products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:44:00">[15:44:00]</a>. Vercel's product, V0, has emerged as one of the most popular [[impact_of_ai_on_software_development_and_deployment | AI website building tools]] globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:48">[01:47:48]</a>.

## V0 and the Spirit of Open Source
V0 was developed to expand the total addressable market of people who can ship real software products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:32:00">[06:32:00]</a>. The foundational tools for V0, such as Next.js (an [[the_evolution_of_software_programming | open-source]] framework based on React), were already part of the internet's training data, which significantly contributed to the models' ability to generate code for these tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:57">[09:55:57]</a>.

### The V0 Community
The V0 community feature, launched in under a month, has seen over 20,000 submissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:17:54">[12:17:54]</a>. This fosters a collaborative environment where users share their creations, allowing others to use them as starting points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:35:48">[13:35:48]</a>. This concept is akin to Figma files, where users can grab a starting point for a design, embodying the "spirit of [[the_evolution_of_software_programming | open source]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:29:00">[12:29:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:42:00">[12:42:00]</a>.

### Evolution of Collaboration: From Social Coding to Social Product Building
V0 is seen as the "next evolution of GitHub" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:50:00">[13:50:00]</a>. While GitHub's initial tagline "social coding" democratized software building, it still required coding knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:04:00">[14:04:00]</a>. V0 aims for "social product building," where everyone can create and share their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:16:00">[14:16:00]</a>. The traditional process of summarizing intent *after* coding (like a Git commit) is inverted by V0, where users start with their intent (e.g., "Please change the color of this button") and the code is generated as an output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:57:00">[14:57:00]</a>.

## Empowering Product Builders
V0 empowers product builders by removing limitations, enabling them to be more "full stack" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:20:00">[18:20:00]</a>.
*   Designers can ship fully developed products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:41:00">[18:41:00]</a>.
*   Product managers can prototype and ship to production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:43:00">[18:43:00]</a>.
*   Backend engineers can bring their end-to-end vision to life by creating front-end interfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:50:00">[18:50:00]</a>.

This empowerment allows product builders to constantly work within the product, tune designs, and experiment with new ideas, transforming conversations with customers into tangible "artifacts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:21:00">[16:21:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:34:00">[16:34:00]</a>. This shift moves people from being removed from the product to actively shaping it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:36:00">[17:36:00]</a>.

## Best Practices and Shared Knowledge
Vercel has [[the_evolution_of_software_programming | open sourced]] a significant portion of V0's underlying technology to promote wider adoption and community contribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:54">[01:53:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:02:00">[10:02:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:47">[10:04:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:53:00">[12:53:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:27:00">[13:27:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:50:00">[13:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:59:00">[13:59:00]</a>.
*   **Vercel Templates:** Users can clone chat demos that adhere to best practices for high-performance UIs, allowing them to build their own [[role_of_ai_in_software_development | AI products]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:09">[01:03:09]</a>.
*   **AI SDK:** Vercel has [[the_evolution_of_software_programming | open sourced]] the AI SDK, which is the foundational "plumbing" of V0. This SDK enables developers to connect any model and generate UI directly from its responses, going beyond just text output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:25">[01:03:25]</a>.

## Cultivating Product Taste and Exposure Hours
Developing "taste" in product building is viewed as a skill that can be cultivated, not an innate trait <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>. A key principle at Vercel is "increasing exposure hours," which involves:
*   **Trying many products:** Experience a wide range of applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>.
*   **Observing user interaction:** Quantify time spent watching people use your products or other products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:37">[01:08:37]</a>.
*   **Embracing feedback:** Regularly seek feedback from users directly within the product, as this provides a constant stream of insights for model refinement and future iterations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:13">[01:02:13]</a>.

By submerging oneself in the "nitty-gritty" of how users interact with interfaces, product builders can become more grounded and develop a strong sense of product quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:51">[01:11:51]</a>.

## The Future: AI as Synonymous with Software
The future will see [[the_future_of_ai_in_software_development | AI become synonymous with software]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>. Vercel itself uses AI to build its products, with marketing, sales, and product management teams now actively creating and shipping using V0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:51">[01:33:51]</a>. This approach enables a profound shift where everyone in the organization can contribute to building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>.

Vercel's vision is a future where "everybody can cook" â€“ if you can dream it, you can ship it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>. This collective effort, driven by community and advanced tooling, aims to make the world better through faster, higher-quality products with fewer bugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>.

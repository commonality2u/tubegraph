Pivoting is a core concept in startup methodology, most famously coined and popularized by Eric Ries, creator of the Lean Startup methodology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:06">[01:04:06]</a>. Ries defines a pivot as a change in strategy without a change in vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>. It's a fundamental element of the tech culture, essential for navigating the inherent uncertainty of startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

## The Reality of Pivoting

The term "pivot" describes what already happens in startups: changing strategy while maintaining fidelity to the overarching vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:19">[01:11:19]</a>. This concept is crucial because it allows founders to reason about necessary strategic shifts that occur frequently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:19">[01:11:19]</a>. Despite its prevalence, there are perennial misunderstandings about what a pivot entails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:43">[00:23:43]</a>.

In practice, a significant amount of initial work (often around 90%) in a product's first version is discarded during a pivot, regardless of its quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a>. This reality underscores the importance of efficient experimentation, such as the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) approach, to minimize wasted effort before a pivot becomes necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a>.

The process of pivoting, and even the founder's understanding of their own vision, evolves through the experience of building the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:21">[01:02:21]</a>. Often, the true vision is "discovered" rather than pre-chosen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:05">[01:10:05]</a>. This makes the journey of building a startup largely a process of self-discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:30">[01:02:30]</a>.

## Benefits of Pivoting

*   **Learning and Adaption**: Pivoting is fundamentally about learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:23">[01:12:23]</a>. It allows a startup to discover what actually works and adapt to market feedback. The "logic of MVP" is about finding the most efficient way to validate a hypothesis, which often reveals the need for a pivot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:45">[00:34:45]</a>.
*   **Avoiding "Zombie Companies"**: A startup failing is not the worst outcome; far worse is being in a "zombie Undead company" that won't die, which founders hate but feel trapped in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Pivoting, or even shutting down, offers a path out of this detrimental state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.
*   **Preventing Misguided Perfection**: Investing deeply in a "high quality wrong value prop" is wasteful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:42">[00:33:42]</a>. Pivoting allows a company to avoid perfecting something that customers don't want <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:25">[00:32:25]</a>.
*   **Faster Iteration**: By embracing the idea that initial efforts may be discarded, companies can move with greater speed. The lessons learned from a failed initial attempt (even a two-year process like Eric Ries's early work on the [[Long-Term Stock Exchange]]) can significantly accelerate future endeavors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:17">[00:47:17]</a>.
*   **Uncovering True Market Needs**: Often, what founders believe customers want (e.g., specific features) is incorrect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:36">[00:30:36]</a>. Pivoting allows a genuine discovery of unarticulated needs, such as the surprising success of IMVU's "teleporting" avatars over walking animations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:01">[00:36:01]</a>.

## When to Pivot

Data from various sources suggests that pivoting is common:
*   Approximately one-fifth of consumer startups [[Examples of successful product-market fit pivots | pivot]] to a completely different product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:32">[01:00:32]</a>.
*   Almost half (40%) of B2B companies pivot to a different product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:36">[01:00:36]</a>.

If a founder is asking themselves whether to pivot, they likely already know the answer: the current approach isn't working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:10">[01:14:10]</a>. A key indicator of a lack of [[product-market fit]] is having time to "naval gaze" or question the path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>.

## Advice for Founders Facing a Pivot

1.  **Admit the Truth**: The first step is to acknowledge that the current approach isn't working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:23">[01:14:23]</a>. Psychological defense mechanisms can make this difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:50">[00:47:50]</a>.
2.  **Fixed Timebox for Action**: Give the team a fixed period (e.g., six weeks) to take decisive action to either make the current thing work or try something new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:34">[01:14:34]</a>. The goal is to see if the "needle can be moved" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:04">[01:15:04]</a>.
3.  **Focus on One Thing**: Dedicate 100% of effort to the one critical thing that needs to be tested or fixed, pausing all other work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:01">[01:15:01]</a>.
4.  **Embrace New Experiments**: If the current paradigm yields diminishing returns, seek a new one where experiments are fruitful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:47">[01:15:47]</a>.
5.  **Self-Reflection on Vision**: Have each team member articulate what they wish the company were doing if they could start over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:15">[01:17:15]</a>. Often, many secretly share the same "new thing" they want to pursue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:37">[01:17:37]</a>.
6.  **Prioritize New Ideas**: If multiple new ideas emerge, try them in order, timeboxing each attempt (e.g., one month per idea) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:59">[01:17:59]</a>.
7.  **Consider Shutting Down**: If the team is exhausted and everyone agrees to "give the money back," it's okay to let the company die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:13">[01:18:13]</a>. The system of venture financing, despite its flaws, forces this declaration when money runs out, which can be a positive feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:17">[01:18:17]</a>.
8.  **Psychological Detachment**: Founders should learn to disidentify their ego from the company's survival. The company can die without the founder "dying," allowing them to take lessons learned into future ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:21">[01:59:21]</a>. This [[Resilience and perseverance in startups | resilience]] is critical.

## Examples of Pivoting

While many companies pivot, they often do not publicly acknowledge it, sometimes even fabricating a consistent narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:23">[01:01:23]</a>. However, there are well-known instances:
*   **Facebook**: Early on, Mark Zuckerberg and Dustin Moskovitz were already exploring other projects even while Facebook was gaining traction, illustrating a potential pivot that didn't fully materialize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:18">[01:11:18]</a>.
*   **IMVU**: Initially, IMVU built a 3D avatar product where characters were anchored in place. An experimental "ugly" feature allowing avatars to "teleport" instantly between spots, intended as a placeholder for full walking animations, was unexpectedly perceived by users as "advanced," leading to a significant shift in design and development focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:01">[00:36:01]</a>. This demonstrated that less can be more and the true definition of quality comes from the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:57">[00:34:57]</a>.
*   **Segment**: Started as a university classroom lecture tool before pivoting to its successful data infrastructure product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:42">[01:08:42]</a>.
*   **Loom**: Began as a marketplace for hiring subject matter experts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:46">[01:08:46]</a>.
*   **Slack**: Famously originated from a gaming company's internal communication tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:52">[01:08:52]</a>.
*   **Box**: Started as a platform for organizing photos and content on Facebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:54">[01:08:54]</a>.
*   **Retool**: Initially conceived as a "Venmo for the UK" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>.

In many cases, there is an underlying "thread of connectivity" or an unusual insight from the initial product that leads to the pivot, even if it seems completely unrelated from the outside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:25">[01:09:25]</a>. This often highlights a valuable internal tool or process that proves more viable than the original product idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:38">[01:09:38]</a>.

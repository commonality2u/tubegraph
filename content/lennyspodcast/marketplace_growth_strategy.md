Marketplaces operate as complex ecosystems, fundamentally different from traditional Software as a Service (SaaS) businesses. Managing a marketplace requires a delicate, "gardener-like" approach, rather than the "construction worker" mentality of building linear products and features for a SaaS business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This is because actions within a marketplace can have long-term, unforeseen consequences, making it crucial to "tread lightly" when altering core incentives or mechanisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

Dan Hockenmeyer, Head of Strategy and Analytics at Fair and formerly of Thumbtack, has extensive experience in [[marketplace_management_and_friction_reduction | marketplace management]] and developing [[growth_strategies_in_tech_companies | growth strategies in tech companies]] for dozens of startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>.

## Understanding Growth Models for Marketplaces

A growth model is an analytical representation of how a business grows, typically built in a spreadsheet, which forces a deep understanding of business mechanics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. The value lies significantly in the process of building it, which forces clarity on how a business truly works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

For a marketplace, the growth model expands upon simpler business types:
*   **SaaS Business Growth Model Components** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>:
    *   **Acquisition Channels**: Paid marketing, sales, or viral referrals, with assumptions around traffic, spend, and conversion rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.
    *   **Retention**: Rates of customer activation and monthly retention curves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.
    *   **Monetization**: Monthly or annual fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.
*   **Transactional Business Additions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>:
    *   Transaction frequency and average order value (AOV) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.
    *   [[affordable_growth_channels | Unit economics]] due to potentially higher costs of goods sold (COGS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.
*   **Marketplace Specific Additions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>:
    *   Supply acquisition and retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.
    *   Modeling the interaction between supply and demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

Growth models become particularly interesting when incorporating non-linear elements like virality, where existing customers refer new ones, or reinvesting contribution margin from paid marketing to acquire more customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. This highlights why payback period is often a better measure for paid marketing performance than LTV to CAC for assessing growth speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.

### Challenges in Building Marketplace Growth Models
Marketplaces introduce significant complexity due to numerous stacked assumptions and the difficulty in understanding the interaction between supply and demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. For example, adding more supply (like pet products on Amazon) might increase Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV), but it's hard to quantify how much of that is incremental or if it genuinely improves customer retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.

To manage this, it's advised to:
1.  **Develop a high-level conceptual model**: A simple representation of how the entire system works to understand key levers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>.
2.  **Create mini-models for individual teams**: Each product team or go-to-market team should have a model articulating how their specific work impacts their North Star metric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>.

### The Importance of Retention
A key learning from building many growth models is that business growth is "exceptionally sensitive to customer retention" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>. Even small percentage gains in retention can be far more valuable than larger changes in other areas, often leading to a reallocation of product and growth resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>.

Retention is challenging because it's the culmination of the entire product experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>. The primary advice is to focus on core product levers rather than just "growth product levers" (like emails or push notifications) to improve retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:34">[00:21:34]</a>.

The biggest wins in retention typically come from **inflecting the early user experience** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>. For example, Uber and Lyft's efforts to guarantee high first-week earnings for drivers are designed to prove the long-term value of the service, smoothing out initial variable experiences to improve future retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:54">[00:22:54]</a>.

## [[marketplace_health_metrics | Marketplace Health Metrics]]

Beyond general business health metrics like GMV (Gross Merchandise Volume) or transactions and [[affordable_growth_channels | unit economics]], specific metrics are crucial for marketplaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:44">[00:28:44]</a>:

1.  **Liquidity**: This measures how reliable the marketplace is for both consumers seeking something and suppliers looking to sell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>. It's often expressed as a dimension the customer cares about, such as wait time for Uber/Lyft or conversion rate/search-to-fill for e-commerce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:45">[00:29:45]</a>. Achieving liquidity is paramount; "until you have a liquid Marketplace, really nothing else matters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:16">[00:30:16]</a>. This is why marketplaces often narrow their scope to a specific geography or category initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:27">[00:30:27]</a>.

2.  **Share of Wallet**: This measures the percentage of a buyer's total spend on a specific category that goes through the marketplace, or for sellers, the percentage of their business done through the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:43">[00:30:43]</a>. A higher share of wallet indicates a deeper customer relationship, improved LTV, and reduced likelihood of multi-tenanting (using competing services) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:12">[00:31:12]</a>.

## Supply vs. Demand Focus

While both supply and demand are crucial, people often "over rotate on Supply and actually are under focused on demand" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:08">[00:34:08]</a>. Supply is critical early on because it *is* the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:16">[00:34:16]</a>. However, "ultimately demand is the only thing that matters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:41">[00:34:41]</a>. If a marketplace successfully aggregates demand, suppliers will always be willing to join <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:52">[00:34:52]</a>.

The goal is to acquire supply only to the extent that it positively impacts demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:45">[00:35:45]</a>. For example, there's a point where adding more Uber drivers no longer meaningfully reduces wait times or improves the customer experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50">[00:35:50]</a>.

To determine which side is constrained, companies should build "dual-sided ROI equations" for acquiring supply and demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:49">[00:36:49]</a>. These equations should fully internalize the marketplace dynamic by including the Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) for both sides of the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:52">[00:36:52]</a>. For instance, the CAC to acquire a rider on Uber needs to include the CAC of acquiring the drivers necessary for that rider's trips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:10">[00:38:10]</a>.

## Expanding Marketplaces

When expanding a marketplace (e.g., into new geographies or verticals), the sheer size of the Total Addressable Market (TAM) matters less beyond a certain point, as most opportunities are large enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:26">[00:43:26]</a>. More relevant factors for prioritization are:
1.  **Adjacency**: How close is the new market or category to the core business model? Instacart expanding into convenience stores makes more sense than traditional retail because convenience stores align with their high-frequency, speed-sensitive model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:44">[00:43:44]</a>.
2.  **Network Effects**: Can the expansion accentuate existing network effects? For example, Uber Eats benefits from using the same drivers as Uber Rides and serving customers who want both rides and meals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:11">[00:44:11]</a>.

A critical lesson in expanding a marketplace is to **not let go-to-market get too far ahead of product** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:54">[00:45:54]</a>. While incentives and go-to-market spend can bootstrap a market, long-term success comes from delivering an "incredible end-to-end customer experience first," which creates retention and organic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:34">[00:45:34]</a>.

## Marketplace + SaaS Integration

The trend of marketplaces adding SaaS components (and vice versa) is common. It's generally easier for a marketplace to add a SaaS product than for a SaaS business to add a marketplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:18">[00:47:18]</a>.
*   **Marketplace to SaaS**: Marketplaces already have relationships with both sides of the market and generate demand, which is a higher-value activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:43">[00:47:43]</a>. The focus should be on solving customer pain points and creating a better, stickier experience, rather than merely extracting more margin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:22">[00:48:22]</a>.
*   **SaaS to Marketplace**: SaaS businesses lack relationships with the demand side, requiring them to acquire a whole new type of demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:51">[00:47:51]</a>. While possible (e.g., OpenTable), it's more challenging.

Before a marketplace considers adding SaaS, it should first ensure it has a "really liquid high performance Marketplace" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:13">[00:49:13]</a> and a clear customer problem that requires a deep set of tools or products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:28">[00:49:28]</a>.

## Horizontal vs. Vertical Marketplaces

Horizontal marketplaces, like eBay, offer a wide range of goods/services. Vertical marketplaces, like GOAT or StockX (sneakers), focus on a specific niche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:05">[00:50:05]</a>.

The idea of "unbundling" horizontal marketplaces into vertical ones is often "overhyped" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:37">[00:50:37]</a>. While vertical marketplaces can offer a better user experience for a niche, they often underestimate the benefits of scale enjoyed by horizontal players, particularly in customer LTV and network effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>.

Unbundling is most successful when the sub-segment is characterized by:
*   **High Frequency or High Dollar Value**: This ensures a high customer LTV, making it defensible against broader competitors (e.g., Airbnb unbundling from Craigslist for high-value, high-frequency rentals) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:05">[00:52:05]</a>.
*   **Self-Contained Network**: The segment's users don't significantly benefit from interacting with the broader network (e.g., "Rig Up" for blue-collar workers vs. LinkedIn for professionals) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:28">[00:52:28]</a>.

## The Future of Marketplaces

Marketplaces are evolving towards charging higher commissions by integrating deeper into the value chain and offering more services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:07">[00:59:07]</a>.
*   **Marketplace 1.0 (Lead Gen)**: Aggregated demand, low commission (e.g., Zillow, Home Advisor) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:16">[00:59:16]</a>.
*   **Managed Marketplaces**: Generate trust and safety (e.g., Airbnb, Etsy), higher commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:25">[00:59:25]</a>.
*   **Heavily Managed Marketplaces**: Perform distinct value chain work (e.g., DoorDash and Instacart owning logistics, Fair underwriting transactions), charging even higher commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:50">[00:59:50]</a>.

Ultimately, some marketplaces may evolve out of the marketplace model entirely, becoming e-commerce businesses that charge 100% commission by owning the supply (e.g., OpenDoor, which buys houses directly) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:28">[01:00:28]</a>. The determining factor for this evolution is the **amount of creativity required in the space**:
*   **Low Creativity (Commoditized Experience)**: Markets where customers desire standardization and consistency (e.g., ride-sharing) are likely to consolidate and move away from the marketplace model, potentially with autonomous vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:20">[01:01:20]</a>.
*   **High Creativity (Diverse Supply)**: Markets where customers value suppliers bringing unique, creative, or diverse offerings (e.g., Etsy, Amazon, Steam, Fair) will likely remain in marketplace mode longer, as large companies struggle to replicate this supplier-driven creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:49">[01:01:49]</a>.

### B2B Marketplaces
B2B marketplaces have been fewer than consumer ones partly because fewer founders understand complex B2B problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:07">[00:55:07]</a>. A key challenge is **low fragmentation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:05">[00:56:05]</a>. The more concentrated either side of the market, the more leverage they have, making them less likely to need the marketplace or pay high commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:11">[00:56:11]</a>. High dollar-per-transaction values also increase the incentive for disintermediation (going around the marketplace) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:27">[00:57:27]</a>. However, B2B marketplaces, like Fair, are seeing increasing success.

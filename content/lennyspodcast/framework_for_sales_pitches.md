A significant challenge in B2B sales is that 40 to 60% of B2B purchase processes conclude with no decision being made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">00:00:00</a>. The majority of these "no decisions" occur not because the old solution is better, but because buyers struggle to make a confident choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">00:00:16</a>. They often delay the purchase to the next year, viewing it as the safe, risk-free option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">00:00:23</a>.

April Dunford, a renowned authority on product positioning and author of "Obviously Awesome," addresses this issue in her new book, "Sales Pitch" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">00:00:41</a>. Building on her 25-year career as a VP of Marketing and advisor to companies like Google and Epic Games, her book provides a framework for pitching and selling products more effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">00:00:54</a>.

## The Problem with Traditional Sales Pitches

Historically, many sales pitches, especially in SaaS, have been primarily "product expositions" – essentially glorified product walkthroughs that focus heavily on features without explaining their value or differentiating the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">00:06:05</a>. This approach often leaves potential customers confused about *why* they should choose one product over another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">00:09:18</a>.

The challenge for buyers is immense; they are often overwhelmed with information from various sources (e.g., G2 Crowd, Gartner) and lack a clear understanding of the market, different approaches to a problem, or ideal purchase criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">00:20:09</a>. This stress stems from the fear of making a bad choice, which could have professional repercussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:16">00:22:16</a>.

## April Dunford's Sales Pitch Framework

Dunford's framework is designed to help companies build a pitch structure that reflects their positioning and focuses on differentiated value, rather than just features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">00:06:43</a>. It involves two main parts: the "Setup" and the "Follow-Through" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">00:13:37</a>.

### The Setup Phase

This initial phase focuses on the market and the company's point of view, setting the stage for the product's value proposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">00:12:42</a>. It should be conversational and act as a discovery process, allowing the salesperson to understand the client's perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">00:18:11</a>.

1.  **Insight:** Start with a unique insight into the market or the core problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">00:13:15</a>. This is often the fundamental reason the product was built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">00:16:21</a>.
    *   **Example (Help Scout):** For Help Scout, a customer service software, the insight is that "digital businesses look at customer service differently; they look at it as a growth driver rather than a cost center" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">00:10:12</a>. If a potential customer disagrees with this fundamental insight, they are likely not the right fit for the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">00:16:50</a>.

2.  **Pros and Cons of Alternatives:** Paint a picture of the entire market by discussing the advantages and disadvantages of other solutions available for the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">00:13:43</a>. This helps the buyer understand where your solution fits without bashing competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">00:21:49</a>.
    *   **Example (Help Scout):** Alternatives include shared inboxes (easy to use, but limited features for growth) and traditional help desk software (has features but is designed for cost reduction, not customer experience) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">00:10:31</a>.

3.  **Perfect World Characteristics:** Conclude the setup by defining what an ideal solution would look like, based on the insights and alternatives discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">00:13:55</a>. This aims to align the customer's worldview with your own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">00:14:10</a>.
    *   **Example (Help Scout):** "Can we agree that in a perfect world for a digital business like yours, we'd want something as easy to use as a help desk but had all the bells and whistles... and was built from the ground up to deliver amazing customer service?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">00:11:08</a>. If the customer agrees, you've essentially already "won the deal" because your product is positioned to be the only one that can deliver that <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:40">00:56:40</a>.

### The Follow-Through Phase

Once the setup is complete and alignment is achieved, the pitch moves to demonstrating how the product delivers on the "perfect world" characteristics.

1.  **Product Introduction & Differentiated Value:** Briefly introduce your product, clearly stating its market category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:21">00:57:21</a>. Then, systematically explain your [[Product Strategy Stack Framework | differentiated value]] – the specific benefits your product offers that no other solution can, linking them directly to your unique capabilities or features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">00:14:49</a>.
    *   **Example (LevelJump):** LevelJump, a sales enablement platform (now acquired by Salesforce), differentiated itself by being built on top of Salesforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">00:41:40</a>. The differentiated value: integrating sales enablement data with sales data, allowing companies to measure how enablement improves "time to first deal" or "time to make quota," ultimately leading to faster revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:01">00:42:01</a>.

2.  **Proof:** Provide evidence that your product delivers on its claimed value. This often comes in the form of customer case studies or independent third-party verification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:30">00:58:30</a>.

3.  **Handling Objections:** Proactively address common "silent objections" that may not have come up during the conversation but might be weighing on the customer's mind (e.g., cost, adoption difficulty, security concerns) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">00:14:58</a>. This demonstrates preparedness and reduces perceived risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:28">00:28:28</a>.

4.  **The Ask:** Clearly state the desired next step in the sales process, whether it's closing the sale, initiating a proof of concept, or defining a project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">00:15:21</a>.

### Why This Framework Works (Understanding the Buyer's Stress)

The core idea behind this framework is to help the buyer feel confident in their decision, effectively "teaching them how to buy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:51">00:27:51</a>. It shifts the dynamic from a salesperson trying to convince a customer to a partnership where the vendor guides the buyer through a complex decision-making process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:17">00:24:17</a>.

[!NOTE] **The Indecision Problem**
Many B2B purchase processes end in "no decision" because buyers are more afraid of "screwing up" (making a bad choice) than "missing out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">00:23:03</a>. Pressuring them with FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) can actually make indecision worse, as it adds more stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:54">00:26:54</a>. Instead, the focus should be on providing tools to make a confident decision and taking perceived risk off the table (e.g., money-back guarantees, strong support) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:43">00:27:43</a>.

In B2B, multiple stakeholders are involved (typically five to seven people), but the "champion" (the person tasked with finding a solution) is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:12">00:31:12</a>. The pitch must resonate with the champion, who then needs to be "armed" to handle objections from other groups (e.g., IT, finance, end-users) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:04">00:32:04</a>. These objections are often operational (cost, migration, security), not value-based, and should be anticipated and addressed proactively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">00:33:00</a>.

## Testing and Implementation

To ensure the framework's effectiveness, testing and collaboration are crucial:

1.  **Cross-functional Collaboration:** Involve product, marketing, and sales teams in defining the [[Product Strategy Stack Framework | differentiated value]] and building the pitch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:40">00:37:40</a>. This shared understanding ensures the sales team can articulate the product's value, not just its features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:51">00:37:51</a>.
2.  **Pilot Program:** Don't just "heave it over the wall" to the sales team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:59">01:01:59</a>. Select your best sales rep, train them on the new pitch, and have them test it with qualified prospects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:07">01:02:07</a>.
3.  **Iterative Refinement:** After each pitch, huddle to discuss what worked and what didn't, making immediate adjustments to the script or slide order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:43">01:02:43</a>.
4.  **Internal Advocacy:** Once the best rep is confident the new pitch is superior (they can "feel it" in how people react and convert opportunities), film them delivering it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:30">01:03:30</a>. Then, have that rep train and "sell" the rest of the sales team on the new approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">01:04:00</a>.
5.  **Marketing's Role:** Marketing usually stewards the positioning and pitch, partnering with sales leadership to ensure adherence and periodic re-certification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">01:07:00</a>. This is part of a broader discussion on [[role_of_product_teams_in_sales | the role of product teams in sales]] and [[building_a_successful_sales_team | building a successful sales team]].

This process can be remarkably fast; positioning work can take about a week, and rolling out a new pitch can be done in as little as two weeks, or typically about a month for most companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:46">01:05:46</a>.

## Category Creation vs. Niche Dominance

While some advocate for creating a new category as the only path to a legendary business, this is not the most common path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:54">00:48:54</a>. Many legendary businesses, like Google (search) and Facebook (social network), did not create their categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:09">00:49:09</a>.

Most successful companies, even those that eventually define a new category, start as a niche play within an existing category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:51">00:49:51</a>. This allows them to gain traction more easily because the market category helps answer "what is this thing all about" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:02">00:50:02</a>. For example, Salesforce initially positioned itself as "CRM for very small businesses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:14">00:50:14</a>.

Once a company becomes the dominant player in its niche, it can then extend the boundaries of the category, a strategy known as the [[delta_4_framework_for_product_success | bowling pin strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:11">00:51:11</a>. This involves:
1.  Defining an underserved segment (the "lead pin") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:53">00:53:53</a>.
2.  Dominating that segment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:12">00:54:12</a>.
3.  Leveraging that beachhead to expand into adjacent segments (the next "pins") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:14">00:54:14</a>.
4.  Eventually challenging the market leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:25">00:54:25</a>.

Many initial category creators fail and are overtaken by fast followers who learn from their mistakes and enter with more funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:57">00:50:57</a>. Therefore, early-stage businesses or those not yet dominating their category should be cautious about attempting category creation from the outset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:07">00:53:07</a>.

## Impact of the Framework

Companies that implement this framework often see immediate, significant improvements in their sales pipeline. Some have reported doubling the number of deals converting from a first sales call to an opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:30">01:09:30</a>. In one case, a company doubled its revenue within two quarters by tightening up its pitch and positioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:47">01:09:47</a>. This demonstrates that improving a "bad" pitch, even slightly, can have a major impact on sales conversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:09">01:10:09</a>.

## Distinction from Other Frameworks

Dunford's framework differs from approaches that start with a "shift in the world" or a "trend," then discuss who will win or lose, and finally position a product as the solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:49">01:10:49</a>.

The main criticisms of the "trend-first" approach are:
*   **Lack of Differentiated Value:** It often assumes "new is inherently valuable" and "old is inherently bad," which isn't always true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:23">01:11:23</a>. Buyers still want to know the specific value they can't get elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:27">01:12:27</a>.
*   **Non-Unique Trends:** Trends are often visible to everyone, including competitors, making it difficult to differentiate starting with a general trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:47">01:12:47</a>.
*   **Misaligned Timeframes:** This approach is more suitable for investor pitches, which focus on long-term market disruption, rather than sales pitches, which need to drive immediate action and focus on value "right now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:50">01:13:50</a>.

Dunford emphasizes that while there are many valid frameworks, the goal is to find what is useful in a specific situation rather than adhering rigidly to a single "rule" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:07">01:15:07</a>.

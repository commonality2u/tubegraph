Bengali Kaba, an influential product leader with experience as an early Growth PM at Facebook, Head of Growth at Instagram, VP of Product at Instacart, and Director of Product Management at YouTube, shares his insights on [[key_skills_and_traits_for_product_managers | product management skills]] and best practices. Kaba is known for his significant impact on various company cultures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. His expertise spans [[product_management_career_growth_framework | career growth]] and [[common_challenges_and_solutions_in_product_management | product growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

## [[product_management_career_growth_framework | Career Growth]] and Impact

Kaba's legendary blog post, "How to Choose Where to Work and What to Work On," stems from his personal struggle to objectively decide his next career move when he felt stuck at Facebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. He developed a framework centered on maximizing **impact** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

Kaba argues that impact is the most crucial factor to optimize for, as compensation and leveling are reflections of the impact driven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. For a [[the_art_and_role_of_product_management | product manager]], impact involves:
*   Driving extreme clarity about product problems and opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.
*   Establishing the right focus and prioritization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.
*   Delivering on that impact by making quick progress and consistently showing results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.

### Impact Framework: Environment x Skills

The core of Kaba's framework is **Impact = Environment x Skills** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.

#### Environment Variables
Kaba identifies six key environmental variables that influence a product manager's impact, which he scores annually:
1.  **Manager:** The most important variable, as a great manager can address many other issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>.
2.  **Resources:** Having appropriate team staffing and budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.
3.  **Scope:** The breadth and focus of one's responsibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>.
4.  **Team:** The skills and composition of the immediate team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.
5.  **Compensation:** Feeling fairly compensated to maintain motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.
6.  **Company Culture:** A supportive and inclusive environment where one can perform their best work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.

Kaba scores each variable from 0 to 2, with 2 indicating significant benefit and near zero indicating a poor state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. This scoring helps identify limitations and areas for influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>.

> "Your manager not all of these variables is created equal right and manager is the most important variable in the environment because a great man manager who is empathetic who is aware of what's going on who is a great communicator has the ability to move the chest pieces around and to like fix some of these for you either immediately or in time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>

#### Developing Skills
Key skills to cultivate for higher impact include:
1.  **Communication:** Considered the most impactful skill, enabling effective storytelling and clarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:18:57]</a>.
2.  **Influence:** The ability to persuade others effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>.
3.  **Leadership:** Guiding and enabling teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>.
4.  **Strategic Thinking:** Developing a clear vision and understanding the broader context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>.
5.  **Execution:** Consistently delivering results and getting things done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a>.

To improve these skills, Kaba recommends:
*   **Voracious Reading:** Staying informed with current thought [[product_management_and_leadership_insights | leadership]] and frameworks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:55">[00:19:55]</a>.
*   **Stable of Mentors:** Instead of one mentor, have three or four to ensure consistent support and diverse perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:18">[00:20:18]</a>. To find mentors, articulate specific challenges and ask trusted contacts if they know someone who could help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>.
*   **Observational Learning:** Actively watch and learn from how others execute, lead teams, and communicate. This involves attending team or [[product_leadership_and_management_techniques | leadership]] meetings to observe how experienced product leaders operate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">[00:21:11]</a>. George Le, Instagram's first Growth PM, demonstrated incredible listening skills, recasting discussions, and crystallizing action items with buy-in and clarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:32">[00:22:32]</a>.

## "Understand Work" Methodology

Kaba champions "Understand Work," a concept from Facebook's "Understand, Identify, Execute" framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:57">[00:25:57]</a>. This contrasts with the "Identify, Justify, Execute" anti-pattern, where teams build based on assumptions without deep understanding, often leading to flat metrics post-launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:49">[00:26:49]</a>.

Understand work is an **intentional affordance** in execution to de-risk projects and gain knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:51">[00:27:51]</a>. It's explicitly planned time for teams to investigate problems and opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:27">[00:28:27]</a>. Examples include:
*   Data scientists pulling funnels and analyzing user connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:49">[00:28:49]</a>.
*   Engineers instrumenting logging for data visibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a>.
*   Product managers dogfooding products in an "adjacent user" state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:21">[00:56:21]</a>.
*   Product managers figuring out partnership strategies before launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:06">[00:37:06]</a>.

Understand work helps clarify root causes, jobs to be done, and use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:16">[00:29:16]</a>. It creates a **velocity multiplier** over time, leading to parallel paths of execution and learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:29">[00:30:29]</a>. By de-risking ideas and gaining clarity, subsequent sprints result in more and better execution, increasing win rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:37">[00:30:37]</a>.

Initially, teams might dedicate a significant portion of time (e.g., 40%) to understand work, shifting to a lower percentage (e.g., 15-20%) as understanding deepens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:53">[00:31:53]</a>. It's crucial to be honest about what is known and what needs further investigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:31">[00:32:31]</a>.

> "If you actually think about it what is a better outcome is a better outcome to just ship more faster now but most of the things are unimpactful right or is it a better outcome to ship fewer things but really work on making sure that you're shipping them in the best way and de risking a lot of other things so that a year later your win rate's higher and your velocity is higher" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:57">[00:34:57]</a>

## Managing Complex Change

To speed up teams and drive [[common_challenges_and_solutions_in_product_management | growth]], Kaba utilizes a framework for managing complex change with five components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:04">[00:42:04]</a>:
1.  **Vision:** A clear direction for the team. Missing vision leads to confusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:43">[00:42:43]</a>.
2.  **Skills:** The capabilities needed to execute the vision. Missing skills leads to anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:51">[00:44:51]</a>.
3.  **Incentives:** Proper motivation for team members. Missing incentives leads to resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:50">[00:42:50]</a>.
4.  **Resources:** Adequate tools, staffing, and budget. Missing resources leads to frustration.
5.  **Action Plan:** A clear roadmap for execution. Missing action plan leads to false starts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:54">[00:42:54]</a>.

As a [[product_management_and_leadership_insights | leader]], Kaba observes the team's struggles (confusion, frustration, resistance) to identify which component is missing and how to intervene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:57">[00:44:57]</a>. While action plans are easier to institute (e.g., PRD frameworks, meeting structures), changing vision and skills takes longer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:25">[00:43:25]</a>. He uses a personal "deck" of frameworks and mental models (e.g., product craft principles) to uplevel teams quickly and establish a shared language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:49">[00:43:49]</a>.

## [[coaching_and_leadership_in_product_management | Coaching and Leadership]] in Product Management

Kaba sees [[product_leadership_and_management_techniques | product management]] as a "team sport," where the PM is the coach, enabling others to maximize their roles rather than being a top-down CEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:01">[00:52:01]</a>.

Key aspects of his [[coaching_and_leadership_in_product_management | coaching and leadership]] approach include:
*   **Bloom's Taxonomy:** This educational framework describes levels of critical thinking (knowledge, comprehension, application, analysis, synthesis, evaluation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:06">[00:48:06]</a>. Kaba uses it to diagnose where individuals or teams are struggling and tailor support to fill knowledge or skill gaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:28">[00:48:28]</a>. For example, a PM might understand a concept but lack the experience to apply it in diverse scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:50">[00:49:50]</a>.
*   **Coaching Tree:** Like in college basketball, product leaders should take pride in building up and growing their team members, fostering a "leadership tree" of successful proteges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:54">[00:52:54]</a>. This reinforces the responsibility to elevate others to greatness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:58">[00:53:58]</a>.
*   **Human Connection:** Coming from an education background, Kaba emphasizes that managing product teams is similar to teaching 7-year-olds: nobody *owes* you anything. Success depends on strong communication, clear vision, and believable influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:40">[00:46:40]</a>. Building relationships by understanding people's stories, passions, and perspectives fosters investment and openness to feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:36">[01:36:36]</a>. To build a world-class, hypergrowth product, inclusivity of diverse voices is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:16">[01:40:16]</a>.

## [[product_leadership_and_management_techniques | Growth Strategies]] and Flywheels

Kaba's approach to [[common_challenges_and_solutions_in_product_management | growth]] involves understanding the value proposition at every point of the user experience, especially in multi-sided marketplaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:48">[00:55:48]</a>.

### Adjacent User Theory
This concept, popularized during Kaba's time at Instagram, highlights the importance of understanding the **next user** who could be using the product but isn't yet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:33">[01:03:33]</a>. As hypergrowth products expand, new user cohorts may have different needs, tech savviness, or understanding of how the product should work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:07">[01:05:07]</a>.

To leverage this theory:
*   Identify current users and their motivations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:44">[01:04:44]</a>.
*   Anticipate who the next user will be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:59">[01:05:59]</a>.
*   "Dogfood" the product as that adjacent user to identify broken experiences or missed opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:04">[01:06:04]</a>. This might involve creating a new account or using different devices.
*   Talk to and observe these adjacent users in their real-time contexts to understand their needs and "jobs to be done" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:49">[01:06:49]</a>.

### Growth Opportunities and Compounding Loops
Most [[common_challenges_and_solutions_in_product_management | growth]] opportunities lie in the **onboarding to habit-building experience** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:02">[01:09:02]</a>. Ensuring users find immediate value (aha moment) and build habits is critical for long-term retention and compounding [[common_challenges_and_solutions_in_product_management | growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:11">[01:09:11]</a>.

Beyond top-of-funnel acquisition, Kaba focuses on building **compounding growth loops** where multiple acquisition channels layer onto each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:05">[01:10:05]</a>.
*   **Instagram Example:** While direct invitations were core, Instagram's exponential [[common_challenges_and_solutions_in_product_management | growth]] was significantly amplified by:
    *   **Celebrity Partnerships:** Teaching celebrities how to use the platform as a brand, which set usage norms and generated media coverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:52">[01:10:52]</a>.
    *   **SEO:** News articles linking to celebrity Instagram accounts and the launch of Instagram Web (which created canonical SEO tables) drove significant search traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:33">[01:11:33]</a>.
    *   **Embeds:** Instagram content embedded on other sites further fueled SEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:04">[01:12:04]</a>.
    *   **Connections Pivot:** A crucial shift in 2017 to prioritize connecting new users with their real-life friends over celebrities. This ensured users felt validated when they posted, doubling retention over a year and a half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:21">[01:18:21]</a>.

### Key Learnings from Product Development
*   **Instagram Account Access:** Addressing "account churn" (users unable to log back in) by simplifying the login experience (e.g., Omni-box for email/phone/handle, saving credentials) significantly increased monthly active users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>. This also unexpectedly boosted content creation from users accessing multiple accounts, leading to the development of dedicated multiple accounts features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:16">[01:23:16]</a>.
*   **Instacart Reordering:** Recognizing that 90% of grocery orders are the same after five uses, making reordering easy (which was previously difficult) was a major [[common_challenges_and_solutions_in_product_management | growth]] win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:57">[01:00:57]</a>.
*   **Facebook Friend Recommendations in India:** Direct "understand work" in India revealed that Western-centric profile information (school, job title) was irrelevant for local users. Names were common (e.g., "Amit Kumar"), so users relied on photos to identify friends. This highlighted the need for culturally contextualized solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:07">[01:26:07]</a>.

## Lessons Learned and Fail Corner

Kaba acknowledges that his time as VP of Product at Instacart was not his "best time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:38">[01:29:38]</a>. He went into Instacart with a strong vision for the product but was not in tune with the company's operational DNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:46">[01:29:46]</a>. Instacart needed more tactical, "in the weeds" execution, whereas Kaba was focused on building systems, people, and processes for long-term institutionalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:22">[01:30:22]</a>.

The lesson learned was to conduct thorough "understand work" before taking a job, not just with current employees but also with former employees, who can offer a "raw and different" perspective on the company's true nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:16">[01:31:16]</a>.

> "I think that like I think I I think they needed more tactical and I was like kind of more I want say in the clouds but more thinking about like where do we want to go with the experience that we need to build versus like let me get deep in like the funnel data" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:51">[01:30:51]</a>

## Interviewing Insights

When interviewing senior product candidates, Kaba asks them to stack rank five critical skills for the job from strongest (1) to weakest (5) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:02">[01:33:02]</a>. This provides deeper insight into their self-awareness and contextualizes their strengths and weaknesses against the role's needs, beyond a generic strengths/weaknesses discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:41">[01:33:41]</a>.

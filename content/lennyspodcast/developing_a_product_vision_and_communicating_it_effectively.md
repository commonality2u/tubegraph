Developing a product vision is crucial for any product manager, regardless of their seniority, as it provides direction and aligns teams towards a shared future state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. Without a clear vision, a product team is like a pilot who doesn't know the destination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. Ab Atod, Director of Product Management at YouTube, emphasizes that a compelling vision paints an image of the destination, unlike a mission which defines the purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

## Elements of a Good Vision

A strong vision should possess four key elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>:
1.  **Lofty** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>: It should be something that excites and slightly scares you, making you eager to work towards it every morning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
2.  **Realistic and Attainable** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>: While lofty, it shouldn't feel so "pie in the sky" that it's out of reach for most people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.
3.  **Devoid of Current Limitations** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>: The vision should be imagined in a vacuum from today's technical or resource constraints, as these may change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.
4.  **Grounded in a Clear Problem** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>: It must address a potent problem that people are genuinely excited to solve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

### Vision vs. Mission
The distinction between vision and mission is critical for [[difference_between_mission_and_vision_in_product_development | product development]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.
*   **Vision**: Describes what the world will *look like* when you achieve your goals; it's a future image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. For example, Uber's vision was "a world where you get to this continuous trip so that you do not need parking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. Microsoft's vision was "a computer on every desk and in every home" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>.
*   **Mission**: Defines the *purpose* or "why" your team or company exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>. For example, Uber's mission was "reliable transport sanitation everywhere and for everyone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. TED's mission is "to spread ideas" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.

## How to Develop a Vision: The Empathize Phase

The process of developing a vision starts with deep empathy for the customer and the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:16">[00:29:16]</a>. This "empathize" phase is about understanding the "understand work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:39">[00:30:39]</a>.

### Tactical Steps for Empathizing
*   **Dogfooding and Catfooding**: Regularly use your own product (dogfooding) and your competitors' products (catfooding) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:26">[00:31:26]</a>. Pay attention to what works well and what doesn't, building intuition from exposure to good products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:18">[00:32:18]</a>.
*   **"Top 10 Things You Should Know" Document**: Maintain a living document of the top 10 most potent problems your product faces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>. These problems can be qualitative, quantitative, or even related to tech debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:18">[00:33:18]</a>. This document should be revised quarterly and shared with all team members, ensuring everyone knows the core problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:13">[00:33:13]</a>.
*   **Involving Stakeholders**: For a more strategic lens, invite stakeholders from marketing, operations, support, and even data science to contribute their "top 10 problems" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:50">[00:38:50]</a>. This broadens the perspective and helps get buy-in early <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:39">[00:39:39]</a>.
*   **Strategy Sessions**: Ab recommends a three-day strategy session structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:02">[00:41:02]</a>:
    1.  **Insights Day**: Focuses on deep understanding of problems, including app tear-downs and stakeholder input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:27">[00:41:27]</a>. The output is a consolidated list of 10 core problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:08">[00:40:08]</a>.
    2.  **Strategy Day**: Determines which problems to focus on and in what order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:51">[00:41:51]</a>.
    3.  **Big Rocks Day**: Identifies the key initiatives to tackle the chosen problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:02">[00:40:02]</a>.

## How to Create and Communicate a Vision Effectively

Once the problem space is understood, the next step is to create a compelling vision and then evangelize it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:06">[00:29:06]</a>. [[importance_of_storytelling_for_product_managers | Storytelling]] is a powerful skill for product managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>.

### Methods for Crafting and Presenting the Vision
1.  **"Once Upon a Time" Mad Libs Framework**: This simple narrative structure helps outline the problem, intervention, and desired future state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>.
    *   "Once Upon a Time, [the current state/problem] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>."
    *   "And because of that, [consequences] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>."
    *   "Then one day, [the major change/solution] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>."
    *   "And as a result, [the new world/impact] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>."
2.  **"Working Backwards" - Writing a News Article**: Imagine the vision has come to pass and write a news article about it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>. Start with a "sexy headline" and subtitle, then expand to the full article <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>. This forces [[communication_and_prioritization_techniques_for_product_managers | clarity]] and helps socialize the idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:57">[00:23:57]</a>. Ab used this at Uber to envision a world where the Uber app could replace transit cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>.
3.  **Visualizing the Vision**: A picture tells a thousand words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>.
    *   **Sketches/Mocks**: Even simple hand-drawn sketches can bring the future to life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>. Ab used this at Uber to visualize topping up Uber balances with cash at a Bodega <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>.
    *   **App Store Mockups**: Create mockups of what the product's App Store screenshots would look like if the vision were realized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:31">[00:25:31]</a>. This focuses the team on the key user benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:46">[00:25:46]</a>.
    *   **Sizzle Reels**: For more advanced teams, a video showing the vision in action can be powerful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:03">[00:50:03]</a>.

## Evangelizing the Vision

Evangelizing the vision is as crucial as developing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:37">[00:43:37]</a>. Ab suggests a "three concentric circles" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:43">[00:52:43]</a>:

1.  **Core Team**: Ensure your immediate team (PMs, engineers, designers) deeply understands and believes in the vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:54">[00:43:54]</a>. Hold multiple sessions, encourage questions, and make the vision a living, comment-open document <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:51">[00:44:51]</a>.
2.  **Stakeholders**: Share the vision with adjacent teams and managers who play a part in its success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:08">[00:46:08]</a>. Listen to their feedback and concerns, even if it brings "friction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:46">[00:45:46]</a>.
3.  **Leadership**: Present the vision to the highest possible leadership, allowing them to amplify the message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:44">[00:46:44]</a>. Don't be afraid to go big; let leadership pull you back if needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:13">[00:47:13]</a>.

A good vision is Evergreen, lasting at least 3-5 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:22">[00:50:22]</a>. It's not something that needs to be created from scratch every year. Instead, teams can add more fidelity to parts of the overarching vision over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>. This consistent vision helps attract talent and aligns the entire company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:42">[00:48:42]</a>.

## The Craft of Product Management: Clarity and Conviction

Ab defines the craft of product management as **Clarity** and **Conviction** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:01">[00:57:01]</a>.

### Clarity
Clarity is about removing all noise and pollution to reveal the core problem or opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:32">[00:58:32]</a>. It's about providing transparency and simplicity of understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:28">[00:58:28]</a>. Tactical ways to achieve clarity include:
*   **"Insights Strategy Big Rocks" Framework**: This narrative structure clarifies why you're doing something (insights), how you're going to do it (strategy), and what you're going to deliver (big rocks) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:44">[00:58:44]</a>.
*   **Concise Documentation**: Encourage two-page documents summarizing insights, strategy/approach, and big rocks, rather than lengthy PRDs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:16">[00:59:16]</a>. "Big rocks" should be no more than three to five key, memorable initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:48">[00:59:48]</a>.
*   **Prioritization**: Force yourself and your team to focus. If you can't pick one "big rock" over others, you lack clarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:21">[01:06:21]</a>.

### Conviction
Conviction is a strong feeling about what the world should be, even if it's not 100% certain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:15">[01:05:15]</a>. It's about trusting your [[improving_product_management_skills | product sense]] and making a decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:01">[01:06:01]</a>.
*   **Embrace Discomfort**: If you're uncomfortable picking a lane, that discomfort signals where more research or certainty is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:36">[01:06:36]</a>.
*   **Be a Decider**: A PM must be the "informed captain" who takes input but ultimately makes the decision, rather than seeking consensus for everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:55">[01:20:55]</a>. This fosters accountability and firm conviction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:22">[01:21:22]</a>.

## Impact of Company Culture on Product Development and Vision

Company culture significantly influences how products are built and how visions are pursued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:36">[01:08:36]</a>.

*   **Uber**: Initially fostered a "monolithic" culture of "principal confrontation" and "toe-stepping" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:20">[01:11:20]</a>, giving employees autonomy to challenge norms with data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:55">[01:09:55]</a>. This enabled bold product innovations like cash payments despite initial leadership resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:42">[01:11:42]</a>. However, a lack of intentional cultural evolution can lead to negative public perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:38">[01:10:38]</a>.
*   **Netflix**: Developed a "no rules rules" framework based on "freedom and responsibility" and "highly aligned, loosely coupled" principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:31">[01:12:31]</a>. This culture intentionally evolves through structured debates, allowing significant product changes like the introduction of advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:56">[01:14:56]</a>.
*   **Google**: Characterized by a looser, macro-culture that allows for diverse "micro-cultures" within different product areas (e.g., Search, Assistant, YouTube) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:48">[01:15:48]</a>. This flexibility enables different product development approaches suited to various business needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:41">[01:16:41]</a>.

## Building Trust and Impact in Product Management

Beyond formal frameworks, fostering a strong team culture and human connection is essential for [[building_trust_and_driving_impact_in_product_management | building trust and driving impact]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>.

*   **"Loved, Not Just Liked"**: Ab believes in being "loved" rather than just "liked" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. Love is defined as "the choice to extend yourself for the spiritual growth of oneself or another" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. This means having hard conversations, providing raw feedback, and genuinely caring about the person behind the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
*   **Vulnerability as Strength**: Acknowledging that everyone is human and "fantastically flawed" builds a more connected team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:43">[01:21:43]</a>.
*   **Know Your Team**: Invest time in understanding your engineering manager's birthday, work anniversary, career aspirations, and personal interests to build a deeper bond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:35">[01:24:35]</a>.
*   **Internal Peer Review**: Encourage team members to review each other's documents, like PRDs, before sharing them externally. This fosters mutual support and results in better products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:13">[01:23:13]</a>.

## Tips for Aspiring Product Managers

For those looking to get into product management or [[improving_product_management_skills | improve product management skills]]:
*   **Start Now**: Begin practicing product management skills before formally becoming a PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:08">[01:30:08]</a>.
*   **Immerse Yourself**: Regularly use your favorite apps, identify their top 10 problems, and mentally design how you would fix them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:11">[01:30:11]</a>. This constant training builds your [[improving_product_management_skills | product sense]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:20">[01:30:20]</a>.
*   **"Opportunity Meets Preparation"**: Success in product management is about being prepared when opportunities arise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:27">[01:30:27]</a>.

## Recent Innovations at YouTube

Ab highlights exciting developments at YouTube focused on empowering creators:
*   **AI Inspiration**: A feature that uses AI to generate content ideas for creators based on what their community of subscribers and viewers are watching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:15">[01:27:15]</a>. An early version allows creators to type a word and receive ideas, videos, topics, and keywords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:08">[01:28:08]</a>.
*   **Thumbnail Test and Compare**: A tool that allows creators to upload two or three thumbnail options for their videos, and the system will A/B test them to determine which performs best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:20">[01:28:20]</a>. This saves creators significant time and effort in optimizing their content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:01">[01:29:01]</a>.

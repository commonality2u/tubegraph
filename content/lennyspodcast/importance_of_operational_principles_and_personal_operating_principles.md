Claire Hughes Johnson, former Chief Operating Officer (COO) at [[operational_principles_at_stripe | Stripe]] for seven years, emphasizes that effective company building and management begin with a strong foundation of both personal and organizational principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:59">[02:09:59]</a>. Her book, *Scaling People*, delves into these core concepts, offering frameworks, templates, and tactical advice for leaders and founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:51">[01:39:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:07">[02:02:07]</a>.

## Personal Operating Principles

Johnson asserts that management truly starts with self-awareness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:36">[02:34:36]</a>. Developing personal operating principles helps individuals understand their motivations, strengths, and blind spots, leading to more effective [[leadership_principles_and_skills | leadership]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:55">[02:37:55]</a>.

### Claire Hughes Johnson's Four Personal Operating Principles

1.  **Build Self-Awareness to Build Mutual Awareness**: This is considered the most fundamental principle for success in company building and management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:55">[02:57:55]</a>. It involves actively seeking feedback and understanding one's own tendencies to expose them to others, fostering more effective interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:18">[02:28:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:50">[02:31:50]</a>.
    *   **Crystallizing Personal Values**: An exercise involves selecting top values (e.g., family, ambition, impact, competition, education, integrity) and understanding the formative experiences that shaped them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:17">[02:59:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. This process of self-discovery, often done in dialogue with others, helps define one's core operating principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:10">[03:08:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:10">[03:10:10]</a>. Work style assessments (Myers-Briggs, DISC, Enneagram) can provide data to understand if one is more introverted/extroverted or task/people-oriented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:32">[03:11:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:59">[03:20:59]</a>.

2.  **Say the Thing You Think You Cannot Say**: This principle encourages direct and open communication, even when uncomfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:25">[03:24:25]</a>. Johnson notes that one's greatest strength is often something instinctual, like breathing, and for her, it's the ability to deliver "brutal" feedback in an optimistic, non-threatening, and observational manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:31">[03:31:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:58">[03:39:58]</a>.
    *   **Tactical Advice**:
        *   **Ask Questions**: Frame observations as questions (e.g., "Is there something we're not talking about?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>.
        *   **Own the Observation**: Use "I feel like..." or "My experience of you was..." to express personal perception rather than judgment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>.
        *   **Be an Explorer, Not a Lecturer**: Especially for managers, the job is to enable people to be their best by exploring patterns and forming hypotheses, rather than simply giving instructions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>.

3.  **Distinguish Between [[leadership_principles_and_skills | Leadership]] and Management**: Early in her career, Johnson didn't differentiate these roles well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>. Reid Hoffman, interviewed for Johnson's book, exemplifies a leader who openly acknowledges not being a great manager, valuing open feedback to achieve goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>.

4.  **Come Back to the Operating System**: In chaotic, high-growth environments, an operating system provides stability and a common rhythm for work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>. This includes rituals like quarterly goals or planning, which offer a predictable approach to problem-solving and decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>. For managers, a consistent operating system helps in [[leadership_principles_and_skills | scaling]] oneself across different functions and projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>.

## Company Operational Principles

Johnson emphasizes that putting operational structures and cultural frameworks in place is as critical as achieving product-market fit or finding first customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:19">[01:52:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>. Many companies with good products fail because they don't build the company properly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>.

Johnson uses a "building a house" metaphor to describe [[creating_effective_organizational_structures_and_operational_systems | effective organizational structures]]:
*   **Foundation**: Founding documents (mission, long-term goals, operating principles).
*   **Posts and Beams**: Supporting structures (e.g., planning, goals, reviews).
*   **Mechanicals**: Operating cadence (rhythm of work, events).

### 1. Founding Documents

These are the core tenets that define a company's purpose and how it operates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:49">[04:47:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>.
*   **Mission**: A clear, concise statement of what the company aims to accomplish (e.g., [[operational_principles_at_stripe | Stripe]]'s mission to "increase the GDP of the internet") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Goals**: Provide more detail on the company's existence and aspirations beyond the mission statement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>. For [[operational_principles_at_stripe | Stripe]], one long-term goal is to "advance the state of the art in developer tools," which guides investments in API, documentation, and user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:00">[05:49:00]</a>.
*   **Company Operating Principles/Values**: These articulate how the company works and what it believes in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a>. Publishing these can help candidates evaluate if the company is a good mutual match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>.

**Sign to Invest More**: When new hires ask many questions about what's important or how things are done, it's time to document these foundational aspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>.

### 2. The Operating System

This refers to the formal structures and processes for how the company functions.
*   **Goals/OKRs**: Establish a structure for setting milestones, whether numerical or binary, that measure progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>.
*   **Quarterly Business Reviews (QBRs)**: A cadence for reviewing parts of the business, using templates and dashboards to track progress and strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:00">[05:09:00]</a>.
*   **Planning Processes**: Essential for mapping out the next year or two, even if they feel burdensome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>. These provide a framework for setting goals and measuring progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>.

### 3. Operating Cadence (The Rhythm of Work)

The frequency and timing of operational activities are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>.
*   Younger, fast-moving companies may resist traditional, slow cadences (e.g., yearly reviews) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>. [[operational_principles_at_stripe | Stripe]] experimented with six-month processes instead of annual ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:00">[06:08:00]</a>.
*   The cadence should be predictable for teams, allowing them to set goals and make progress effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>.
*   **Signs a Cadence is Off**:
    *   **Too Fast**: Not enough progress is made between review periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>.
    *   **Too Slow**: Review content feels stale or already discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:23:00">[06:23:00]</a>. Metrics reviews becoming de facto strategy reviews is a sign that strategy is not being discussed often enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:00">[06:35:00]</a>.
    *   Overhead from prepping for frequent checks can slow velocity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:29:00">[06:29:00]</a>. Using live dashboards instead of special presentations encourages good discipline and avoids wasted time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>.

### General Principles for Operational Systems

*   **Consistency over Perfection**: There is no perfect organizational structure or operating approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a>. It's better to implement a few things consistently and refine them annually than to constantly introduce new, unproven methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>.
*   **Embrace Chaos**: All companies, even successful ones like [[operational_principles_at_stripe | Stripe]], experience internal chaos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>. Stable, consistent ways of doing things create a perception of being "well-run" even amidst internal challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>.

## Practical Applications of Principles

### Effective Meetings
*   **Explicit Objectives**: Clearly state the purpose of the meeting (e.g., decision-making, information sharing) and who needs to be present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:32">[01:16:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>. Make the implicit explicit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:45">[01:16:45]</a>.

### Decision Making
*   **Clarity and Process**: Explicitly state that a decision needs to be made, who the decision-maker is, and the criteria for the decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:52">[01:17:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:03">[01:18:03]</a>.
*   **Empowerment**: If unsure, assume you are the decision-maker to avoid slowing down the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:41">[01:18:41]</a>.
*   **Evaluate Decision Type**: Use frameworks like Bezos's Type 1/Type 2 decisions (high impact/irreversible vs. reversible) to guide the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>. Pick a model (e.g., RACI) and stick to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:11">[01:18:11]</a>.

### Communication Practices
*   **Strategic Communication**: Companies often underinvest in clear, consistent internal communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:12">[01:14:12]</a>.
*   **Multi-Channel Approach**: Leaders must be the "repeater in chief," using various channels (intranet, newsletters, videos, all-hands) to ensure messages reach diverse audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:32">[01:14:32]</a>.
*   **Off-sites**: Pulling people out of their daily routines for off-sites creates space for different thinking, imprints memory, and fosters group cohesion and ownership of plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:55">[01:12:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:21">[01:13:21]</a>.

## The Role of the COO

A Chief Operating Officer can provide crucial leverage in a high-growth environment by taking on functions like operations and go-to-market, bringing experience, and helping to build and scale the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:44">[01:06:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>. However, hiring a COO is not a magical solution for underlying cultural or relationship issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:04">[01:10:04]</a>. A successful COO-CEO relationship needs "just the right amount of tension" to ensure forward momentum, mutual trust, and collective benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:55">[01:08:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:53">[01:09:53]</a>.

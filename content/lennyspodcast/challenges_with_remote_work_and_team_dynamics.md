The topic of remote work and its impact on team dynamics and productivity has become "a super sensitive topic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a> within the industry. While a complete return to fully co-located teams is unlikely for large companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>, the shift to remote work has introduced significant challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>.

## Impact on Velocity and Innovation

A primary concern with remote employees is the negative effect on both team velocity and innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>. Many companies are currently struggling with these aspects, observing that "things go slower and they don't really do that level of innovation that they used to do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>. This represents a significant macro factor impacting how companies build products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>.

The challenges associated with remote work are occurring simultaneously with other broader trends, such as:
*   Over-hiring during the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.
*   Increased cost of funds in the financial world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.
*   The predicted impact of generative AI on various roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.
*   Team sizes getting "out of hand," particularly outside Silicon Valley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>.

This convergence of factors contributes to "chaos and a lot of fear" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a> within the product, design, and engineering communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

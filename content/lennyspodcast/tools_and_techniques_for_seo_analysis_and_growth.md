Many businesses often [[understanding_seo_resource_allocation | under-resource SEO]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> while over-resourcing ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. For companies like Zillow or eBay, spending tens of millions on ads but only fifty thousand on [[understanding_seo_resource_allocation | SEO]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a> doesn't make sense, especially when the traffic potential is comparable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Ethan Smith, CEO of Graphite, highlights the importance of [[key_elements_of_an_effective_seo_strategy | effective SEO strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a> for building and growing products, calling it one of the most powerful and least understood growth levers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.

## When to Invest in SEO

Determining [[when_and_how_to_invest_in_seo_as_a_company | when to invest in SEO]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a> hinges on two primary factors:
1.  **Addressable Market Size**: Is the addressable market large? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:31">[01:00:31]</a> For most categories, it is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:35">[01:00:35]</a>.
2.  **Existing Authority/Traction**: Do you have existing traction and authority? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:39">[01:00:39]</a> Starting from zero with no traction is generally too soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:42">[01:00:42]</a>, as Google prefers to rank credible domains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:52">[01:00:52]</a>.

Key indicators for existing authority include:
*   **Non-SEO Traffic**: Aim for at least 1,000 visits per day from channels other than search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:10">[01:11:10]</a>. Google wants to see that a site is not "just an SEO site" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:53">[01:11:53]</a>.
*   **Referring Domains**: Have at least 1,000 referring domains linking to your site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:29">[01:11:29]</a>. The more you have, the easier and faster it is to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:44">[01:11:44]</a>.

### Assessing the Addressable Market
To assess market size, analyze competitors using tools like Similarweb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:15">[01:11:15]</a>. Look at total traffic and traffic by channel for both product competitors (e.g., Walmart for Wish.com) and audience competitors (e.g., Investopedia for Robinhood) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:51">[01:16:51]</a>. This provides a sense of potential traffic volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.

> "The more traffic you have that's not from SEO, that means that you're credible. The more referring domains you have, that means you're more credible, more authority, the more shares you have, more authority, so the more of these signals, the more you're a known brand in Google's eyes and the more authority you have and the better you can rank." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:07">[01:15:07]</a>

## Types of SEO and Strategic Approach

There are three main types of SEO:
1.  **Programmatic SEO**: Pages automatically generated from a database, like product pages on eBay or address pages on Zillow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:48">[01:18:48]</a>. This also includes user-generated content (UGC) sites like Glassdoor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:07">[01:19:07]</a>. It's cost-effective per page once the system is built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:03">[01:21:03]</a>.
2.  **Editorial SEO**: Manually written content such as articles, guides, or listicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:27">[01:19:27]</a>. This type is increasingly driving more traffic than programmatic SEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:42">[01:19:42]</a>. Examples include MasterClass, BetterUp, NerdWallet, and HubSpot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:26">[01:21:26]</a>.
3.  **Technical SEO**: The underlying infrastructure, including internal link architecture, tags, redirects, and page speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:54">[01:19:54]</a>. While important for foundational health, it's not typically how growth occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:59">[01:19:59]</a>.

Editorial SEO is often the best approach for most companies if an addressable market exists, while programmatic SEO is situational <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:52">[01:20:52]</a>.

## SEO Analysis Techniques

A high-impact [[key_elements_of_an_effective_seo_strategy | SEO strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:45">[02:24:45]</a> follows this workflow:
1.  **Define Addressable Market**: Identify topics and keywords to target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:49">[02:24:49]</a>.
2.  **Determine Page Type**: Based on keywords, figure out what type of page is needed (e.g., article for "how to poach an egg," address page for Zillow) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:58">[02:24:58]</a>. This is done by analyzing top-ranking results for target keywords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:58">[02:25:58]</a>.
3.  **Product Requirements**: Define what needs to be on the page (e.g., map, phone number for a business listing) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:42">[02:26:42]</a>. These should be based on user intent and what makes a page useful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:50">[02:27:50]</a>.
4.  **Content Strategy**: Identify subtopics and themes for comprehensive content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:22">[02:24:22]</a>.
5.  **Infrastructure**: Ensure Google can find all pages via effective internal linking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:30">[02:24:30]</a>.

### Thinking in Topics, Not Just Keywords
Google's algorithm has evolved to understand semantics and target topics rather than individual keywords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:40">[03:32:40]</a>. A single page can rank for 200 to 2,000 different keywords within a topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:50">[03:32:50]</a>. This has several implications:
*   **Search Volume**: The effective search volume for a topic is much higher (e.g., 10x) than for a single keyword within it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:42">[03:33:42]</a>.
*   **Efficiency**: Avoid writing multiple articles for slight keyword variations (e.g., "best cameras" vs. "best digital cameras") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:47">[03:34:47]</a>.
*   **Intent Fulfillment**: A page must fulfill the intent of all associated keywords within its topic to rank well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:06">[03:34:06]</a>.

To cluster keywords into topics, observe if the same search results appear for different keyword queries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:01">[03:26:01]</a>. If results overlap significantly, they belong to the same topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:22">[03:26:22]</a>.

### Leveraging Internal Links
Internal linking is often an underappreciated lever for [[evaluating_seo_opportunities_for_businesses | SEO growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>. Pages with more internal links tend to get more traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>. Google crawls sites via links, and if pages lack sufficient internal links (ideally at least 10), Google struggles to find and credit them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>.

> "If you don't have good link spread, fixing it has significant opportunity, typically 25% plus opportunity, even like 100% opportunities sometimes if your links are really under-optimized." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>

Most sites exhibit a "power curve" for internal links, where a small percentage of pages receive the vast majority of links, leaving many pages with zero or one link <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>. The goal is to create a flat link graph, minimizing the number of "hops" from crawl points (e.g., homepage, popular pages) to any given page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>.

## Key Tools for SEO Analysis and Growth

*   **Google Search Console**: Free and provides real traffic information, SERP tracking for keywords, and insights into pages you rank for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.
*   **Clearscope**: Best tool for content analysis and scoring, helping identify content gaps and ensure comprehensiveness of subtopics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.
*   **Ahrefs or Semrush**: Keyword research tools that help discover competitors' pages, keywords, and traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.
*   **Similarweb**: Useful for assessing total traffic and traffic by channel for competitor sites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:15">[01:11:15]</a>.
*   **Screaming Frog**: A niche but powerful crawling tool for auditing sites, discovering URLs, finding error codes, and analyzing internal link coverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.

## Operationalizing SEO

### Hiring for SEO
The type of hire depends on the [[key_elements_of_an_effective_seo_strategy | SEO strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a> and company stage:
*   **Programmatic SEO**: Requires a specialized "growth person with technical ability" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>, ideally someone who has successfully done it before at lesser-known companies (as it's harder and less competitive to hire from) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>. Their role involves analyzing competitor sites, defining product requirements for automatic page generation, clustering keywords, and working with engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>.
*   **Editorial SEO**: A "young and hungry" individual can learn to be an [[key_elements_of_an_effective_seo_strategy | SEO]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a> manager, especially if they are strong in content strategy and have an understanding of the domain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>. Their role involves selecting prioritized topics, creating detailed outlines with subtopics, managing content publishing, and analyzing results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>. The actual writing is typically done by domain experts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>.

### Timelines and Early Indicators
SEO is often a long-term investment, typically showing significant results in six to nine months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. However, this timeline varies:
*   **Faster Results**: Companies with higher existing authority and traction (like Netflix) can see changes within days or weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.
*   **Slower Results**: New companies starting from scratch might take a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.

Early leading indicators of success include:
*   Ranking at least number 20 for target keywords within the first few weeks after launching content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>.
*   Seeing steady progress in search ranking (e.g., from position 15 to 12, then to 8) for less popular keywords, indicating Google is testing your pages and engagement is good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>.

### Addressing the "Getting Things Done" Challenge
A common problem in SEO is that recommendations often don't get launched due to resource constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>. To counter this:
*   **Product-Led SEO**: Integrate [[key_elements_of_an_effective_seo_strategy | SEO]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a> within the product organization, as many [[key_elements_of_an_effective_seo_strategy | SEO]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a> changes are product changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>.
*   **Executive Buy-in**: Secure support from leadership by clearly demonstrating the opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>.
*   **Demystify SEO**: Make [[key_elements_of_an_effective_seo_strategy | SEO]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a> less mysterious by providing data-driven hypotheses and showing progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>.

## [[seo_transformations_with_the_rise_of_ai | AI's Role in SEO]]

While there's a proliferation of startups using [[ai_tools_for_entrepreneurs | GPT-3]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a> for content generation, Ethan generally doesn't recommend it, with some exceptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>.

### Cautions with AI-Generated Content
*   **Factual Accuracy**: [[ai_tools_for_entrepreneurs | AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a> models like [[ai_tools_for_entrepreneurs | GPT-3]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a> generate sentences similar to existing ones, but they lack underlying wisdom and can produce factually incorrect information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>. This is especially problematic for sensitive topics like finance or health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>.

### Effective Uses of AI in the SEO Workflow
[[shifts_in_seo_strategies_in_the_age_of_ai | AI is highly useful]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a> for:
*   **Topic Selection**: Helping decide what to write about by clustering keywords, analyzing search volume, and determining topical authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>.
*   **Content Outlining**: Extracting structured data and identifying subtopic themes for comprehensive articles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>.
*   **Data Analysis**: Sorting and prioritizing keywords, identifying performance patterns, and extracting insights from large datasets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>.

The ideal approach involves [[ai_tools_for_entrepreneurs | AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a> providing structured information and insights, which a human domain expert then uses to write high-quality, factual content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>.

## Getting Started with SEO

For a startup looking to explore [[evaluating_seo_opportunities_for_businesses | SEO opportunities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>, the first steps are:
1.  **Assess Addressable Market Size**: Identify product and audience competitors and use tools like Similarweb to gauge their traffic and determine if the market is large enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>.
2.  **Evaluate Authority**: Check current non-SEO traffic and the number of referring domains to understand your site's existing authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>.
3.  **Compare Opportunities**: Analyze how [[evaluating_seo_opportunities_for_businesses | SEO]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a> compares to other growth channels (e.g., paid ads, social) in terms of cost, opportunity, and scope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>.

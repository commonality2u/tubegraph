Nancy Duarte, a best-selling author, speaker, and CEO of Duarte Incorporated, emphasizes that [[the_impact_of_empathy_in_product_management | empathy is central to effective communication]] and [[importance_of_storytelling_in_business_communication | storytelling]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. Her company has helped craft over 250,000 presentations for influential leaders and brands globally, including Apple, Google, the World Bank, and Al Gore's "An Inconvenient Truth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>.

## The Foundational Role of Empathy

Duarte states that empathy is the core of her methodology for creating powerful presentations and compelling stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>. Everything her company does is "empathy first" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>.

### Why Empathy is Crucial
Duarte's emphasis on empathy stems partly from her personal experience of being raised by a clinically narcissistic mother, who lacked empathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>. This void led her to constantly seek and integrate empathy into all her models and books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.

It is critical to think about "who am I speaking with" in any communication scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>. Many individuals may work for leaders or bosses who lack empathy, reinforcing the need for an "other-centric" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.

### The Audience as the Hero
A core principle in Duarte's approach is making the audience the hero of the story, not the presenter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>.

> "The audience gets to make a choice if they accept or reject your idea so the balance of power is with them and not you." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>

The presenter's role is to act as a mentor who comes alongside the audience to help them overcome internal conflicts and provide "magical tools" for their "outer journey" (physical actions) and "inner tool" (resolve) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>. For example, Obi-Wan Kenobi provided Luke Skywalker with a lightsaber for his physical journey and the Force for his inner resolve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>.

To achieve this, presenters must empathetically consider how challenging their proposed actions will be for the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>. Changing one's mindset to consider "who am I talking to" and "how am I going to help them get unstuck" is foundational <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>.

In practice, Duarte Incorporated conducts "listening tours" (surveys and interviews) before major internal presentations to understand audience perspectives and compare them to the desired outcomes, performing a "gap analysis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>. This feedback loop helps ensure the message resonates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>.

## Storytelling as an Empathy Tool

Duarte emphasizes infusing presentations with [[how_to_construct_effective_and_memorable_stories | story structures]] to connect with the audience on a deeper level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>.

### The "What Is, What Could Be, New Bliss" Framework
This framework leverages contrast to create a sense of longing for a future state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>.
1.  **What Is:** State the current reality or problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>.
2.  **What Could Be:** Introduce an alternate future or solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>.
3.  **New Bliss:** Paint a poetic or pragmatic picture of the world with the idea adopted, serving as a "happy ending" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>.

This [[importance_of_storytelling_for_product_managers | structure creates longing]] by showing the audience a desirable future they hadn't wanted before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>. The "messy middle" of the story, with its conflicts and problems, ultimately resolves, building tension and then releasing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>. This framework can be applied to diverse contexts, from a major presentation to a brief conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>.

## Practical Applications of Empathy in Communication

### Everyday Influence
The "what is, what could be, new bliss" framework works in "any moment of influence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>. Duarte cites an example of using this framework to persuade her husband to do chores: she describes the current state (e.g., her busy schedule, the dog's needs), the ideal alternative (doggy daycare), and the "new bliss" (a less stressed spouse who feels loved by acts of service) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>.

### Understanding Communication Styles
To enhance empathy, Duarte's company encourages employees to understand each other's "love language" to better appreciate colleagues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>. This awareness is "baked into our marriage, our company, just how it rolls" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>.

## Visualizing Empathy

Another key tip is to ask, "Can they see what I'm saying?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>. This means using [[visual_storytelling_techniques | visual tools]] to help the audience understand and align with the message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>.

*   **Diagrams and Models:** Especially in tech, illustrating how systems work or how a product's components interact can achieve alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.
*   **Drawing on the Spot:** In meetings, drawing on a napkin or whiteboard allows for co-creation and ensures everyone shares the same understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>. This is particularly useful when conveying complex ideas or a leader's "Mind's Eye" vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>.
*   **Minimalist Slides:** Sometimes, removing visuals allows the audience to focus entirely on the speaker's words and body language, leading to a "powerful moment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>.

## Empathy in Product Management

[[the_role_of_empathy_and_user_feedback_in_product_management | Empathy is crucial throughout the product management process]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>.

*   **"Walk in the Shoes of the Customer":** Airbnb's development of the Superhost program exemplifies [[understanding_customer_emotions_in_product_design | empathy in product design]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>. The team literally mapped out a customer's day, hiring an illustrator to depict each scene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>. This "day in the life" storytelling method helped them realize they needed a mobile-first strategy, and these keyframes became central to their company strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>.
*   **Infusing Passion and Meaning:** Product managers often fail to explain the "why" behind their product choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>. By adding meaning and wrapping it in a story, they can secure product adoption or rejection, influencing outcomes at various stages of the product cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>. This is critical for [[role_of_storytelling_in_sales | product pitches]] and reveals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.

## Leading Change Through Empathy

The book *Illuminate*, co-authored by Nancy Duarte and Patty Sanchez, explores how presentations fit into larger movements, which follow a five-act structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:29">[01:01:29]</a>. This framework, crucial for [[the_role_of_change_and_transformation_in_storytelling | leading change]], includes:

1.  **Dream:** Verbalize the future destination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>.
2.  **Leap:** The audience commits to the journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>.
3.  **Fight & Climb:** The "messy middle" where challenges are overcome through persistent effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>.
4.  **Arrive:** The realization of the desired future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>.

Leaders act as "torchbearers," seeing only a few feet ahead but illuminating enough to dissipate fear and motivate followers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>. Throughout these phases, leaders must use speeches, stories, ceremonies, and symbols to provide the "emotional fuel" needed for people to persevere and see the idea realized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>.

Many successful companies focus on [[Business Sustainability and Profitability | profitability]] and long-term viability rather than aggressive growth and venture capital funding. This alternative path, often referred to as bootstrapping, prioritizes making money from the outset and maintaining financial independence.

## The 37signals Model

37signals, co-founded and led by Jason Fried, exemplifies a successful business that operates distinctly from the typical venture-backed startup model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

Key characteristics of 37signals:
*   **Independence:** They have no investors, no board, no plans to go public, and no desire to sell their business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:12">[01:03:12]</a>.
*   **Consistent Profitability:** The company has been profitable for 24 consecutive years, generating tens of millions of dollars in profit annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>. This profit directly benefits founders and employees due to the absence of investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:51">[01:20:51]</a>.
*   **Customer Base:** They serve over 100,000 customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:59">[01:10:59]</a>.
*   **Lean Operations:** With only about 75 employees, they maintain a relatively small team compared to competitors with similar customer numbers but significantly larger headcounts (e.g., Asana (1600), ClickUp (1000), Slack (2500)) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:06">[01:10:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:54">[01:17:54]</a>.

## Bootstrapping vs. Venture Capital

While the "go big or go home" mantra of raising significant capital is common in the tech industry, it rarely leads to success for most businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>.

### The Advantage of Bootstrapping
[[entrepreneurship_lessons_and_strategies | Entrepreneurship lessons and strategies]] often emphasize the importance of bootstrapping, especially for software businesses. This approach forces founders to develop the fundamental skill of making money early on, rather than relying on external funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:50">[01:17:50]</a>.
*   **Money-Making Practice:** Bootstrapping provides continuous practice in generating revenue, leading to improved financial acumen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.
*   **Cost Control:** Founders are compelled to keep costs incredibly low, avoiding unnecessary expenses like large offices, extensive branding, or excessive hiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:06">[01:13:06]</a>.
*   **Wider Success Opportunities:** Unlike venture-backed companies that must achieve massive scale (unicorn status) to satisfy investors, bootstrapped businesses have more room to find a viable niche and build a successful enterprise without being an outlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>.
*   **Independence:** Remaining independent allows a company to evolve as desired without being beholden to external timeframes or expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:37">[01:05:37]</a>.

### When Venture Capital Makes Sense
Venture capital can be necessary for businesses that inherently require significant upfront capital expenditures, such as building cars, opening restaurants (requiring ovens, staff, rent), or hardware companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:25:00">[07:25:00]</a>. Companies like Airbnb and Uber also needed substantial funding to scale rapidly and establish broad market presence, which involves physical products and widespread geographical reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>.

### The Peril of Too Much Money
For software businesses, which naturally have high margins (potentially 80-90% due to low physical costs), venture funding can ironically lead to less profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>.
*   **Sloppiness:** Abundant capital can encourage inefficiency and "slop" in operations, as there's no immediate pressure to be profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:59">[01:16:59]</a>.
*   **Spending Habits:** Venture money is intended to be spent, primarily on hiring more people and [[marketing_strategies_and_growth | marketing strategies and growth]], rather than being saved or invested for interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:28">[01:17:28]</a>. This can lead to a company becoming skilled at spending, not making, money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:01">[01:19:01]</a>.
*   **Loss of Scrappiness:** Large sums of money can diminish the "scrappiness" and ingenuity often found in resource-constrained environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:38">[01:20:38]</a>.

## Defining Success

For 37signals, success is deeply personal and defined by internal satisfaction, not external metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>.
*   **"Would I want to do this again?"** This simple question guides decisions, focusing on whether the work is enjoyable and worthwhile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>.
*   **Collective Profitability:** The primary financial metric is overall company profitability, not individual product P&Ls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. The goal is simply to make more money than they spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.
*   **No Fixed Targets:** They do not use financial goals, OKRs, KPIs, or specific revenue or growth targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>.
*   **"Small is a great destination itself."** This philosophy emphasizes that significant scale isn't a prerequisite for success or impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>. The focus is on the "Fortune five million" small businesses rather than the "Fortune 500" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>.

## Work Philosophy and Product Development

37signals employs a unique [[engineering_productivity_and_strategy_evaluation | product development]] and [[quality_improvement_leading_to_business_impact | quality improvement]] methodology, detailed in their "Shape Up" framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>.

### Shape Up Principles
*   **Six-Week Cycles:** Projects are organized into six-week cycles. This is an "appetite" for time, not an estimate; teams must deliver within this budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>.
*   **Small, Dedicated Teams:** Each feature is built by a maximum of two peopleâ€”one programmer and one designer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>.
*   **Shaping the Work:** Work is "shaped" (defined broadly) upfront, and then teams are given latitude to figure out how to achieve it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>.
*   **No Long-Running Projects:** The fixed appetite prevents projects from dragging on indefinitely, which can be demoralizing for teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>.
*   **Cool-Down Periods:** After each six-week cycle, there's a two-week "cool-down" period where team members can work on personal projects, fix bugs, or tidy up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>. This contrasts with continuous "sprints" that can lead to exhaustion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>.

### Rejecting War Metaphors in Business
37signals advocates for a shift away from aggressive, combative language often used in business, such as "conquering markets" or "destroying competition" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:55">[01:09:55]</a>. This focus on "creation" rather than "destruction" influences how employees perceive their work, fostering pride and excitement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:14">[01:11:14]</a>.

## Decision-Making: Gut, Instinct, and Simplicity

[[defining_effective_business_metrics | Defining effective business metrics]] at 37signals heavily relies on intuition and feeling over strict data analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:56">[01:43:56]</a>.
*   **Trusting Intuition:** Decisions are largely "judgment calls" based on accumulated experience, rather than purely rational data points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>. This approach extends to all levels, with leaders asking "how do you feel?" about products and designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>.
*   **Hiring for Instinct:** When hiring, especially for design roles, emphasis is placed on a candidate's "taste" and ability to "riff on the spot" with ideas, demonstrating strong gut instincts beyond prepared answers or academic knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>. This aligns with the [[importance_of_design_in_business_growth | importance of design in business growth]].
*   **Embracing the Unknown:** Long-term planning is viewed as a "fantasy" because it involves making decisions about an uncertain future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>. The company prefers to "make it up as we go," adapting every six weeks based on current realities and feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:31">[01:03:31]</a>.

## The "Stay Up" Mentality

Jason Fried coined the term "stay up" to counteract the prevalent focus on "startups" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>.
*   **Staying is Harder than Starting:** While starting a business can be relatively easy, maintaining it, especially through plateaus, competition, and growth, is the true challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Endurance:** A successful "stay up" endures economic cycles and continues to operate profitably, even if profits fluctuate year-to-year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>.

## The "Once" Initiative: A New Direction

37signals is venturing into a new product line called "Once," which challenges the dominant Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:21">[01:23:21]</a>.
*   **Non-SaaS Products:** "Once" products are one-time purchase software, downloaded and installed by the customer on their own servers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:32">[01:24:32]</a>.
*   **Subscription Fatigue:** This initiative anticipates a potential market shift away from recurring subscriptions, offering an alternative for users who prefer to own their software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:56">[01:23:56]</a>.
*   **Targeting Commodities:** They aim to provide high-quality, essential, and simple "generics" of common business software (e.g., chat tools) that currently charge "luxury prices" despite being commodities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:50">[01:25:50]</a>.
*   **Open Codebase (for customers):** Users will receive the code, allowing them to examine, modify, and tweak the software for their specific needs (though not resell it) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:57">[01:28:57]</a>.
*   **First Product: Campfire:** The first "Once" product will be a relaunch of their old group chat tool, Campfire, as a direct competitor to Slack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:40">[01:26:40]</a>. It will be available for under $1000, aiming to be a "no-brainer" purchase for businesses seeking cost-effective alternatives or backup systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:13">[01:33:13]</a>.

## Core Business Strategy
The strategy for [[Business Sustainability and Profitability | business sustainability and profitability]] at 37signals can be summarized as: "Keep making great [products], keep your costs in check, charge appropriate prices for your work, share as much as you can, and let the chips fall where they may" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:11">[02:22:11]</a>. This approach values enjoyment and pride in the work, rather than solely focusing on external accolades or exit strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. A guiding principle is that "no one ever went broke making a profit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:59">[02:29:59]</a>.

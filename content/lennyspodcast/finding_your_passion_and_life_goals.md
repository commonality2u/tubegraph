Graham Weaver, a professor at Stanford Graduate School of Business, often finds that the most common question students ask him is, "What should I do with my life?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a> This indicates a deep-seated human need to find purpose and direction beyond traditional career paths.

## The "What Should I Do With My Life?" Question

Despite teaching a course technically named "Managing Growing Enterprises," Graham Weaver's students frequently seek advice on personal life direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>. Approximately half of all student meetings revolve around this core question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:00">[06:10:00]</a>. Weaver observes that students often present various career options, but their "heart and their soul and their energy" often lies with a specific path they are talking themselves out of due to fears or societal pressures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:00">[07:00:00]</a>. His goal is to help them recognize their true desires and overcome the "limiting beliefs" that prevent them from pursuing what they genuinely want <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:19:00">[07:19:00]</a>.

An example is a student from Brazil who initially considered returning to consulting but, through reflection, realized he wanted to start a non-profit organization in his home country to improve access to education for underprivileged children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18:00">[08:18:00]</a>. Weaver helped him dismantle the fears and limiting beliefs, leading him to pursue that dream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:28:00">[08:28:00]</a>.

## The Genie Framework: Uncovering Your True Desire

Weaver employs a "Genie Framework" to help individuals identify their deepest aspirations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:08:00">[09:08:00]</a>. This exercise, adapted from motivational speaker Brian Tracy, involves imagining a scenario where a Genie grants one wish:
> "Whatever you throw yourself into with your whole life in your career it's going to turn out great. It's going to work out great. It's probably going to take longer than you think, it's going to be harder than you think, but you're going to be really happy you did and it's going to work out Beyond Your Wildest imagination. If that were true and you had that Genie blessing you with that wish, what would you wish for?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:00">[09:55:00]</a>

The answer reveals a goal close to one's heart, something they would pursue "absent the fear of failure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:25:00">[10:25:00]</a>. This "genie goal" is what one should spend their life pursuing, even if it requires gaining experience or addressing financial obligations first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:34:00">[10:34:00]</a>. The focus is on the journey, as the outcome may evolve differently than initially imagined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:31:00">[11:31:00]</a>. Examples of genie goals include starting a private equity firm, building an amusement park, or launching a non-profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:51:00">[11:51:00]</a>.

Weaver's own "side gig" of teaching at Stanford, alongside his full-time role as founder and CEO of Alpine Investors (a top-performing private equity firm), reflects his own pursuit of what excites him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>. He emphasizes that choosing a path that aligns with one's internal scorecard, rather than solely external metrics like money or status, leads to greater energy, dedication, and ultimately, a higher chance of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:04:00">[24:04:00]</a>.

## Breaking Free from Autopilot Mode

Many people operate in an "autopilot mode," going through daily routines unconsciously without realizing why they do what they do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>. This leads to days that are not intentional and lack alignment with what's truly important in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. The majority of our thoughts (95-98%) are subconscious, programmed by media, friends, parents, and societal pressures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:04:00">[15:04:00]</a>.

To break free, Weaver suggests:
*   **Creating space:** Step out of the "fog of war" of daily life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:32:00">[15:32:00]</a>.
*   **Asking deep [[questions_for_personal_and_career_reflection | questions]]:** Identify intentions for various life areas (career, relationships, health, spirituality, etc.) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:51:00">[15:51:00]</a>.
*   **Aligning actions:** Have your calendar reflect your intentions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:54:00">[15:54:00]</a>.

Key [[questions_for_personal_and_career_reflection | questions for personal and career reflection]] include:
*   "Within reason, what would you do if you knew you wouldn't fail?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:15:00">[16:15:00]</a>
*   "If you didn't have to make money, what would you do?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:35:00">[16:35:00]</a> (This reveals what you enjoy).
*   "What's play for you that is work for other people?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:45:00">[16:45:00]</a> (E.g., for Lenny, hosting a podcast).
*   "What's the thing you really want to do but you're just too embarrassed to say it?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:02:00">[17:02:00]</a> (Weaver's answer was wanting to be a motivational speaker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:07:00">[17:07:00]</a>).
*   "Who are some people that you admire and want to be more like, and what do they do?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:20:00">[17:20:00]</a>
*   "What are some things you want to learn and how do you want to grow over the next 5-10 years?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:30:00">[17:30:00]</a>

## Overcoming Limiting Beliefs

Limiting beliefs are most powerful and dangerous when they remain subconscious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:15:00">[18:15:00]</a>. To overcome them:
1.  **Write them down:** Putting beliefs on paper strips them of their power and scariness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:15:00">[19:15:00]</a>.
2.  **Translate into "to-do" items:** A scary subconscious fear, like "How would I fund this charity?", becomes a concrete problem to solve with your conscious mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:39:00">[19:39:00]</a>. This transforms it into an obstacle to be overcome, no different from the millions of others you've overcome in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:25:00">[20:25:25]</a>.

## The Nature of the Journey: Hardship and Time

Pursuing your true passion often requires sustained effort and time. Weaver emphasizes that most worthwhile endeavors take much longer and are harder than expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.

### "Everything You Want Is on the Other Side of Worse First"
Changes, even positive ones, often involve an initial phase of discomfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:35:00">[31:35:00]</a>. For example, getting in shape involves soreness and diet changes, and changing careers means learning new skills and leaving comfort zones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:45:00">[31:45:00]</a>. The "first move is negative" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:18:00">[32:18:00]</a>. Optimizing only for immediate comfort (tomorrow being a great day) leads to stagnation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:32:00">[32:32:00]</a>. Instead, consider what your five-year future self would want you to do now, even if it means short-term pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:57:00">[32:57:00]</a>.

### "Life is Suffering, So Choose Something Worth Suffering For"
Weaver believes life inherently involves struggle. Choosing a path you care about means you will "suffer" for something meaningful, rather than for a job or life that doesn't align with your values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:49:00">[30:49:00]</a>. There is no truly "easy" path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:10:00">[31:10:10]</a>.

Weaver's own journey with Alpine Investors exemplifies this. It took 14 years before he felt confident the firm would stay in business, and 18 years to achieve significant external success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:34:00">[28:34:00]</a>. The key differentiator for success, he argues, is the individual's willingness to "stay at it for a long period of time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:27:00">[29:27:00]</a>, dispelling the myth of overnight success often portrayed in media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:43:00">[29:43:00]</a>.

## [[practical_exercises_for_selfdiscovery_and_accountability | Practical Exercises for Self-Discovery and Accountability]]

### The Nine Lives Exercise
This exercise helps make the process of identifying a career goal less intimidating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:11:00">[43:11:00]</a>.
1.  **List nine exciting lives:**
    *   Life 1 is your current life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:39:00">[43:39:00]</a>.
    *   Subsequent lives start from today, and you must genuinely be excited about each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:07:00">[44:07:00]</a>.
    *   Examples include being a founder, author, professor, actor, or social media content creator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:16:00">[44:16:00]</a>.
2.  **Integrate:** Identify the life that gives you the most energy and "pull that life a little bit into your current life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:59:00">[44:59:00]</a>. Even doing it as a side hustle can provide tremendous energy and potentially reveal a full-time path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:27:00">[45:27:00]</a>.
3.  **Long-term perspective:** Realize that you can often experience aspects of all nine lives over a long enough lifespan, just not all at once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:55:00">[45:55:00]</a>.

### The Power of Accountability (Coaches and Friends)
To avoid the "not now" trap (which often becomes "not ever"), accountability is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:01:00">[48:01:00]</a>. It's never the "right time" to make a significant change; there will always be fear and a feeling of not being ready <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:07:00">[48:07:00]</a>.

*   **Executive Coaches:** Like a personal trainer for your life, a coach helps you create space to ask big questions about your career, relationships, and health, and then holds you accountable to your intentions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:41:00">[37:41:00]</a>. The act of reporting on goals alone can be incredibly powerful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:32:00">[38:32:00]</a>.
*   **Accountability Partners:** If a coach isn't feasible, find a like-minded friend to meet with regularly. Discussing dreams and hopes with someone else can activate different parts of your brain, leading to deeper insights than just thinking or writing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:18:00">[39:18:00]</a>.

### Daily Goal Setting
A simple yet powerful [[practical_exercises_for_selfdiscovery_and_accountability | practical exercise for self-discovery and accountability]] is to write down your goal and three actions you'll take towards it *every single morning* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:15:00">[41:15:00]</a>. This locks your subconscious mind onto your goals and how you want to show up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:36:00">[41:36:00]</a>. Doing this for three months can lead to more progress than three years without it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:23:00">[42:23:00]</a>.

## The Internal Game: [[understanding_personal_and_career_fulfillment | True Fulfillment]]

Weaver believes that while life presents external obstacles, the "true Game of Life is an internal one" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:40:00">[49:40:00]</a>. Beyond basic needs, the vast majority of life is internal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:40:00">[50:40:00]</a>. We often write a "story" about what we need to be happy, worthy, or respected, but this is "just a story" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:01:00">[51:01:00]</a>.
His realization came in 2015, after 14 years of building his firm, when he achieved significant financial success. Despite the external achievement, "nothing internally changed at all" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:08:00">[53:08:00]</a>. He still had the same problems and self-perceptions, leading him to understand that external achievements do not inherently bring joy or a feeling of being "enough" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:41:00">[53:41:00]</a>. This realization, initially disorienting, ultimately became liberating, allowing him to focus on his own internal scorecard and what truly matters to him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:28:00">[51:28:00]</a>.

## When to Quit

The ultimate failure is quitting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:56">[00:59:56]</a>. However, it's appropriate to quit when:
*   You can no longer see the vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:41">[01:00:41]</a>.
*   You no longer believe in the vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:44">[01:00:44]</a>.
*   You're no longer excited about the vision (though this can be tricky during difficult phases) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:51">[01:00:51]</a>.

Even during "dark days," look for "small glimmer[s] of a bright spot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:43">[01:01:43]</a> and "scale your bright spots" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:36">[01:01:36]</a>. By focusing on what's working and doing more of it, those small successes can eventually build into the core of your strategy and business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:52">[01:01:52]</a>.

## Final Advice: Get Clear on What You Want

You only get one life, one shot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:31">[01:02:31]</a>. The most important step is to take the time to figure out what a "wonderful, amazing, incredible life looks like" for you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:38">[01:02:38]</a>. Get as clear as possible on this vision for your life, career, relationships, friends, body, spirituality, and finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:53">[01:02:53]</a>. Knowing what you want is the "first magic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:05">[01:03:05]</a>, as 90% of people never even reach this stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:07">[01:03:07]</a>. The clearer and more invested you are in that vision, the more likely you are to make it come true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:15">[01:03:15]</a>. This process is like understanding where your Google directions could take you if you turned off autopilot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:28">[01:03:28]</a>.

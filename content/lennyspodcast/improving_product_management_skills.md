Product management expert Ian McAllister, author of the seminal post "What separates a top one percent PM from a top 10% PM," shares insights on developing crucial skills for product managers at all career stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>. McAllister has managed over 100 product managers and has experience at Amazon, Airbnb, and Uber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:41">[00:41:41]</a>.

## Core Attributes of a Top Product Manager
McAllister initially identified several key attributes, later adding more based on further reflection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:04">[00:42:04]</a>. These attributes are not exclusive to top performers, as no single PM excels at all of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>.

Key attributes include:
*   **Think Big** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:04">[00:42:04]</a>
*   **Communicate** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:04">[00:42:04]</a>
*   **Simplify** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:04">[00:42:04]</a>
*   **Prioritize** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:04">[00:42:04]</a>
*   **Forecast and Measure** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:04">[00:42:04]</a>
*   **Execute** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:04">[00:42:04]</a>
*   **Understand Technical Trade-offs** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:04">[00:42:04]</a>
*   **Understand Good Design** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:04">[00:42:04]</a>
*   **Write Effective Copy** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:04">[00:42:04]</a>

Later additions to this list:
*   **Earn Trust with Others** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:04">[00:42:04]</a>
*   **Digging for Data** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:04">[00:42:04]</a>
*   **Pushing Back Effectively** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:04">[00:42:04]</a>
*   **Adapting to Change** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:04">[00:42:04]</a>
*   **Driven by Impact Not Promotion** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:04">[00:42:04]</a>

## [[tips_for_new_and_senior_product_managers | Tips for New Product Managers]]
For new product managers, the most crucial [[Product Manager Skill Development | skills]] to master are:
1.  **Communicate** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>
2.  **Prioritize** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>
3.  **Execute** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>

These three are core building blocks, important regardless of career stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>. Other [[skills_for_modern_product_managers | skills]], like understanding technical trade-offs or good design, become more critical as one gains seniority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>.

### Tactical Advice for New PMs
*   **Communicate**: Always answer first, then explain, or sometimes "answer and then shut up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>. Learn to use numbers to answer questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>. Continuously grade yourself after communications (meetings, emails) and seek feedback from your manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:58">[00:22:58]</a>.
*   **Prioritize**: An innate ability to prioritize can generate 5x the impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>. This involves prioritizing themes, projects, sequencing, and even time management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45">[00:17:45]</a>.
*   **Execute**: Mold what you want to build into a simple, compact package with the highest impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>. Take ownership in helping your team (designers, data scientists, engineers) improve and be well-resourced, as this directly impacts execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>.

For new PMs, it's beneficial to choose projects that are likely to have significant impact, even if they aren't responsible for setting the strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:22">[00:28:22]</a>. Working on "offense" (driving dollars or customers) is often more visible to executives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:44">[00:28:44]</a>.

## [[tips_for_new_and_senior_product_managers | Tips for Senior Product Managers]]
For senior product managers, the focus shifts to:
1.  **Communicate** (stakes are higher) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:18">[00:23:18]</a>
2.  **Think Big** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:25">[00:23:25]</a>
3.  **Earn Trust** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>
4.  **Driven by Impact, Not Promotion** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:44">[00:25:44]</a>

### Tactical Advice for Senior PMs
*   **Think Big**: Act like a General Manager (GM) for your product, taking a wider view of success beyond just product or tech. Identify constraints or barriers to your product's success and work to remove them, even if outside your direct reporting line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:51">[00:30:51]</a>.
*   **Earn Trust**: Trust is the currency of a product leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:11">[00:24:11]</a>. It's built by consistently setting and meeting expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>. Practices that build trust include telling the truth, launching what you promised, owning mistakes, and understanding others' goals to forge alliances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:58">[00:33:58]</a>. Losing trust happens by being evasive, not shipping what was promised, or repeating mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:13">[00:25:13]</a>.
*   **Driven by Impact**: Focus daily on having the biggest impact for the business. This approach naturally leads to growth and promotion, rather than making promotion the direct goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:57">[00:25:57]</a>. For senior PMs, this expectation shifts from a "nice to have" to a primary evaluation criterion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:43">[00:27:43]</a>.

## The Amazon Way: Working Backwards
Ian McAllister spent 12 years at Amazon, where he found the structured thinking environment highly effective for [[Product Manager Skill Development | product skill development]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:12">[00:38:12]</a>.

### Common Mistake in Implementing Working Backwards
The most frequent error teams make when trying to adopt the "working backwards" philosophy is starting with a solution and then retrofitting a problem to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:43">[00:47:43]</a>. True working backwards means obsessing about the problem first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:15">[00:47:15]</a>. If discussions immediately jump to combining technologies or assets without first identifying a clear customer problem, it's a sign that the team is not genuinely working backwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:51">[00:57:51]</a>.

### How to Implement the Spirit of Working Backwards
The "working backwards" concept emphasizes starting with what you're trying to accomplish for the business or customer, specifically by identifying the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:27">[00:50:27]</a>. The internal press release and FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) are mechanisms Amazon uses to enforce this discipline, but they are not the only way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:40">[00:50:40]</a>.

*   **Focus on the Problem**: The core of working backwards is starting with a compelling customer problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:52">[00:49:52]</a>.
*   **The "Fact" Document**: The FAQ section in Amazon's working backwards process is critical. It evaluates if there's a legitimate plan to succeed, considering internal components, finances, and technical hurdles. It helps build trust that the team has been thoughtful enough to deserve resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:25">[00:56:25]</a>.
*   **Review Process**: At Amazon, "working backwards reviews" with leadership often served as a gate for approving new initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:29">[00:55:29]</a>. These reviews educate stakeholders, ground discussions in the customer problem, and ensure a viable plan exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:49">[00:55:49]</a>.
*   **Adapt to Your Organization**: While a press release/FAQ template can be used if appropriate, acknowledge your organization's culture (e.g., slide culture) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:19">[00:52:19]</a>. Product leaders have more leverage to implement new processes with their teams than with senior leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:48">[00:52:48]</a>.
*   **Scale**: The process is most beneficial for new products or significant features, but may have too much overhead for smaller changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:35">[00:54:35]</a>.

## Lessons from Amazon Leaders
McAllister learned valuable [[career_development_for_product_owners_and_managers | leadership lessons]] from Jeff Bezos and Jeff Wilkie at Amazon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:56">[00:39:56]</a>.

### Jeff Bezos
*   **Encouragement**: Bezos was encouraging and taught through specific lessons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:45">[00:41:45]</a>. For example, if a press release lacked a problem paragraph, he'd suggest "maybe if you don't have a problem paragraph there's not really a problem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:04">[00:42:04]</a>.
*   **Investment Criteria**: Bezos's criteria for investing in something new are:
    1.  Is it a big idea? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:10">[00:56:10]</a>
    2.  Is it something Amazon should be doing? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:12">[00:56:12]</a>
    3.  Is there a legitimate plan to succeed? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:25">[00:56:25]</a>

### Jeff Wilkie
*   **Consummate Operator**: Wilkie instilled an operational mindset and rigor, emphasizing continuous improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:52">[00:42:52]</a>.
*   **Weekly Business Reviews (WBRs)**: Wilkie's leadership of WBRs, focusing on metrics and variances, built a muscle for leaders to know their business intimately and be prepared to answer probing questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:22">[00:43:22]</a>. This cascading effect led to robust insights throughout the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:02">[00:44:02]</a>.
*   **Tough Love and Respect**: Wilkie employed "tough love" that, while direct, built respect and encouraged accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:06">[00:45:06]</a>.
*   **Teaching the "Why"**: Wilkie excelled at explaining the mental model behind decisions, not just giving prescriptive advice. This helps people learn lessons and understand the rationale, fostering greater commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:01">[00:46:01]</a>.

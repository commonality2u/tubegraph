It provides a structured plan for personal and professional growth within the product field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:20">[00:56:20]</a>.

## Origin of the Framework

This framework originated at TripAdvisor when the company recently went public and sought to rapidly scale its product team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:04">[00:55:04]</a>. Facing challenges in hiring experienced [[Role of Product Managers in Organizations | product managers]] quickly, a [[Product Management Skill Development Framework | product rotational program]] was created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:36">[00:55:36]</a>. This program aimed to onboard individuals directly from business school or undergraduate studies into their first product roles, regardless of prior experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:40">[00:55:40]</a>. Participants would undergo two years of rotations across various [[Role of Product Managers in Organizations | product management]] areas, such as zero-to-one teams, growth teams, or infrastructure teams, to emerge as senior and effective [[Role of Product Managers in Organizations | product managers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:51">[00:55:51]</a>. The competency framework was essential for defining what [[Role of Product Managers in Organizations | product management]] entails and outlining the [[Key Skills for Product Managers | skills]] needed for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:13">[00:56:13]</a>.

## Structure of the Framework

The framework comprises 12 [[Key Skills for Product Managers | competencies]] categorized into four main areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:28">[00:56:28]</a>. These [[Key Skills for Product Managers | competencies]] are equally important for both Associate Product Managers (APMs) and Chief Product Officers (CPOs), though the specific application changes with seniority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:32">[00:56:32]</a>.

## Application and Importance for Product Managers

This framework serves as a critical tool for [[Traits of Successful Product Managers | product managers]] to understand and advance their careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:53">[00:54:53]</a>.

### Self-Evaluation and Growth
[[Role of Product Managers in Organizations | Product managers]] can rate themselves on each of the 12 [[Key Skills for Product Managers | competencies]] (e.g., needs focus, on track, outperforming) to quickly gauge their strengths and areas for development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:59">[01:02:59]</a>. This self-assessment can then be compared with a manager's evaluation, stimulating deep and constructive conversations about performance and growth opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:11">[01:03:11]</a>.

### Exponential Feedback
The framework supports "exponential feedback," which refers to feedback that offers compounding returns on a person's growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:27">[01:03:27]</a>. Instead of focusing on superficial symptoms or tactical issues, this approach encourages feedback that addresses underlying behaviors and root causes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:47">[01:03:47]</a>. By categorizing feedback according to these [[Key Skills for Product Managers | competencies]], individuals can gain a clearer understanding of how to grow and self-diagnose their performance more effectively, leading to continuous improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:53">[01:03:53]</a>.

### Adapting to Seniority
While the 12 [[Key Skills for Product Managers | competencies]] remain constant across career levels, their specific application evolves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:32">[00:56:32]</a>. For example, an APM focuses on product execution in their daily individual contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:44">[00:57:44]</a>, while a CPO considers product execution in terms of creating systems that enable teams to define specifications, deliver products efficiently, execute flawlessly, and maintain high quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:48">[00:57:48]</a>. Seniority in product leadership is about increasing one's "dynamic range" â€“ the ability to both focus on high-level strategy and zoom into specific tactical details when necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:54">[01:07:54]</a>.

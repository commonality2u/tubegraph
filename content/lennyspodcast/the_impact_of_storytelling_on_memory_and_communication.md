[[the_importance_of_storytelling_in_business | Storytelling]] is a significant buzzword in business, with many aspiring to be storytellers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, truly being a storyteller means separating oneself from the "herd," a risk some are hesitant to take <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The alternative, however, is to remain forgettable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Why Storytelling Resonates and is Remembered
Our minds are not designed to remember pie charts, facts, statistics, or platitudes not attached to imagery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. If communication doesn't use story, it will be forgotten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. People often forget keynote speeches or presentations shortly after hearing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:24">[00:25:24]</a>. In contrast, people will watch a movie a hundred times because it's a story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>. Our minds are wired to enjoy stories repeatedly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>.

## Key Elements of Effective Storytelling
Matthew Dicks, author of "Storyworthy," emphasizes that storytelling is a "tactical, practical, and entertaining" skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. He attributes his success to being both a teacher and a storyteller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

### The Five-Second Moment of Transformation
Every good story centers around a singular "5-second moment" of transformation or realization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. This moment can be about changing from one type of person to another, or from thinking one way to a new way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. The purpose of a story is to bring this moment to clarity so the audience can experience that "flip" along with the storyteller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.

*   **Example (Teacher's Story):** A teacher's realization that a student, Eileen, had gained confidence enough to quip back at him, marked a 5-second moment of realization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. The rest of the story provides context for this singular insight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
*   **Example (Star Wars):** The first *Star Wars* film is a story about a boy who once had no religion, and then, after certain events, found religion, culminating in Luke Skywalker using the Force instead of technology to defeat the enemy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. This resonates because we understand finding belief in something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

Knowing this moment of change also helps the storyteller understand how the story will end and, roughly, how it will start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. Stories are essentially about two opposing moments in time: a beginning and an end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>. Starting at the end ensures the story has something important to convey, unlike merely reporting chronological events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.

### Three-Point Checklist for a Good Story
1.  **Change:** A change or transformation must occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. This lends importance and allows for universal connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>. Even if the content is unrelated, the emotional appeal of change connects people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>.
2.  **The Dinner Test:** The story should resemble what you would tell someone at dinner, slightly elevated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>. Avoid "performance art" elements like unattributed dialogue or starting with a sound effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>. It should feel natural <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>.
3.  **Personal Story:** The story must be *your* story, not someone else's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>. Telling another's story lacks vulnerability and means less to the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:49">[00:18:49]</a>. Stories about others can be centered on how their experience informed or changed your own life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>.

### Adding Stakes
Stakes are what the audience should be worried about, wanting for you, or wondering about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:34">[00:23:34]</a>. If an audience isn't wondering, they're not listening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a>.

Ways to add stakes:
*   **Elephant:** Plant a big, worrying thing at the beginning that immediately signals something is at stake (e.g., a big spaceship shooting at a small one) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:24">[00:25:24]</a>.
*   **Backpack:** Tell the audience your plan before you execute it, so they carry your hopes and dreams with them (e.g., in "Ocean's 11") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:22">[00:26:22]</a>.
*   **Breadcrumbs:** Offer small hints or incomplete ideas that build anticipation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>.
*   **Hourglasses:** When a pivotal moment approaches, slow time down by adding details to keep the audience on the edge of their seat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:21">[00:27:21]</a>.
*   **Crystal Balls:** Predict a future, often a terrible but realistic one, to make the audience worry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:48">[00:27:48]</a>.

Stakes should build throughout a story, rather than being front-loaded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:49">[00:31:49]</a>. Most stakes should occur within the first half, with the second half being the "rollercoaster to the end" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:04">[00:32:04]</a>.

### Surprise
Surprise is a delightful moment where the audience didn't see something coming, but then it feels inevitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:33">[00:28:33]</a>. Good endings are both inevitable and surprising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:16">[00:29:16]</a>. This requires placing enough information earlier in the story for inevitability, but cleverly hiding it for surprise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:22">[00:29:22]</a>.

### Humor
Daring to be funny is a "brilliant and beautiful and simple way to differentiate yourself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:51">[00:51:51]</a>. It requires taking a risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:29">[00:50:29]</a>.

Two strategies for humor:
1.  **Nostalgia:** Speaking nostalgically about the past is often funny because it highlights how things have changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:27">[00:53:27]</a>. For example, comparing job searching in 1983 (newspapers, landlines) to today (global online access) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:21">[00:54:21]</a>. This also demonstrates expertise and understanding of a field's history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:33">[00:56:33]</a>.
2.  **One of These Things is Not Like the Other:** Present three items where two are expected and one is unexpected, making the unexpected one funny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:54">[00:56:54]</a>.

## Applying Storytelling in Business Communication
Most business communication is "round, white, and flavorless" because people are afraid to stand out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:48">[00:34:48]</a>. However, separating from the herd makes you memorable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:11">[00:35:11]</a>.

### Making it Personal and Relatable
*   **Personal Interest Inventory:** Develop a list of personal details (e.g., married, hobbies, family life) that can be strategically slipped into conversation to connect with people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:50">[00:44:50]</a>. For example, being married suggests decency and commitment, resonating with a large market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:34">[00:45:34]</a>. While niche interests (like marathon running) have a smaller market, the intensity of connection with those who share them is enormous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:08">[00:46:08]</a>.
*   **Human Connection:** People prefer to hear human beings connect with them, rather than corporate spokespeople presenting information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:31">[00:44:31]</a>. Even a 30-second personal anecdote can significantly impact how an audience connects with a narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:35">[00:43:35]</a>.

### Connecting Stories to Business Themes
Instead of trying to solve a problem with a story on demand, it's better to build a "vault of stories" that can be deployed into business contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:48">[00:41:48]</a>.

When seeking a story to convey a business message, focus on matching by *theme*, *meaning*, or *message*, rather than just content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:25">[01:03:25]</a>.
*   **Example (Biotech Company):** A scientist trying to explain specialized tubes didn't present data, but told a story about his family's diverse apple preferences at the grocery store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:43">[00:59:43]</a>. The theme was about people getting exactly what they need, regardless of specific content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:37">[01:03:37]</a>. This created a memorable, positive connection for the audience, leading to more leads than his colleagues combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:44">[01:04:44]</a>.

### Homework for Life
"Homework for Life" is a daily practice of reflecting on the day and identifying one moment worth telling as a story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:02">[01:07:02]</a>. These moments are recorded, usually in a spreadsheet, with a date and a brief description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:49">[01:07:49]</a>. This practice develops a "lens for storytelling," allowing individuals to see and remember moments they previously would have forgotten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:34">[01:08:34]</a>.

*   **Benefits:**
    *   **Recovering Time:** It slows down the perception of time passing by making each day accountable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:17">[01:09:17]</a>.
    *   **Seeing Patterns:** Helps individuals see patterns in their lives they wouldn't otherwise notice, leading to deeper self-understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:08">[01:12:08]</a>.
    *   **Recovering Memories:** The process often triggers forgotten memories from the past, which can also be recorded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:47">[01:10:47]</a>.
    *   **Endless Stories:** Leads to an endless supply of stories, as discovered by thousands who practice it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:17">[01:11:17]</a>.

### Overcoming Public Speaking Nerves
*   **Pre-Talk vs. During-Talk Nerves:** 98% of nervousness occurs *before* speaking; once speaking begins, most nerves fall away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:01">[01:20:01]</a>. Recognizing this can be a relief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:16">[01:20:16]</a>.
*   **Shared Experience:** Most people, even very famous ones, experience nervousness, so you're not alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:55">[01:21:55]</a>.
*   **Preparation:**
    *   **Record and Listen:** Record your talk and listen to it passively while doing other activities (e.g., chores) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:23">[01:22:23]</a>. This helps the material "seep into your soul" and become part of you, similar to how we remember favorite movies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:35">[01:22:35]</a>.
    *   **Focus on Transitions:** Most people forget transitions, not the content of sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:15">[01:23:15]</a>. Practice the flow between scenes or topics to ensure smooth delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:02">[01:24:02]</a>.
    *   **Avoid Memorization:** Memorizing leads to more suffering; instead, aim to remember the talk without memorizing it word-for-word <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:31">[01:24:31]</a>.

### The Power of Saying Yes
Saying "yes" to opportunities, even those that seem crazy or undesirable, can lead to extraordinary experiences and growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:51">[01:26:51]</a>. Saying "no" without stepping through the door is presumptuous and arrogant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:54">[01:26:54]</a>. A "yes" can always become a "no" after exploration, but the initial "yes" opens up possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:39">[01:27:39]</a>. The things that frighten us are often the things that are best for us <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:05">[01:29:05]</a>.

### Starting a Story Effectively
To capture attention immediately and signal that you are telling a story, begin with two things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:01">[01:39:01]</a>:
1.  **Location:** Establish where the story is happening. This activates the audience's imagination, imbuing the scene with a thousand adjectives instantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:21">[01:38:21]</a>.
2.  **Action:** Something needs to be happening right away. This indicates the story is moving forward and grabs attention, similar to action-packed movie openings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:01">[01:39:01]</a>.

For marginalized groups, starting with location and action can help create space and command attention, as it signals that "the movie's on" and people should listen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:05">[01:40:05]</a>.

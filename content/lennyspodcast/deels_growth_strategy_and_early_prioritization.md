Deel, a payroll, HR, and compliance platform for global teams, has achieved remarkable growth, becoming one of the fastest-growing SaaS businesses in history. From less than a million dollars in ARR in July 2020, Deel reached $300 million in ARR within three years, while remaining EBITDA positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>. This success is attributed to a strategic approach to [[marketing_strategies_and_growth | marketing strategies and growth]] and early prioritization, led by Head of Growth, Melton Berkowitz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>.

## Foundational Growth Principles

In the early days, Deel focused on building a solid foundation before scaling. The core principle is to address basic infrastructure and user experience first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

Key foundational steps:
*   **Website Presence**: Ensure a fast, search-engine-discoverable website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. A slow website (e.g., loading in four-plus seconds) can hinder even the best paid ad campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>.
*   **Clear Messaging**: The website's copy should clearly explain "what you do" and solve a problem, avoiding generic B2B statements that could apply to any business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>. Rapid A/B testing of value propositions was crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.
*   **Accessibility**: Initially, Deel's website was hard-coded, hindering rapid iteration. Moving to an editable platform allowed for continuous A/B testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>.

> "Go back to the basics, build the skeleton before you put on the makeup." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>

## Leveraging "Cheap" Growth Channels

Deel prioritized low-cost growth channels by focusing on where people actively seek solutions to problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:00">[07:00:00]</a>.

### Community Engagement
Deel actively engaged with existing communities where potential users were asking questions. This approach isn't about direct advertising, but about adding value by providing helpful answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>.

*   **Reddit**: Deel set up keyword tracking for terms related to HR and international hiring on Reddit. Team members would then offer advice and solutions, establishing Deel as a helpful resource <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:00">[09:01:00]</a>. This strategy was implemented from Melton's first day and still continues, though its percentage contribution to the funnel has decreased as other channels scaled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:07:00">[12:07:00]</a>.
*   **Quora and Twitter**: Similar to Reddit, these platforms were used to answer specific questions from the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:45:00">[07:45:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:00:00">[13:00:00]</a>.
*   **Closed Communities**: Engaging with communities like Y Combinator's network or other private Slack/Discord groups can be effective, though access is harder to gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:06:00">[15:06:00]</a>.

> "People don't want to be sold to, they want their problems solved." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a>
> "You can't just go into a community and be like, 'Hey everyone, check out what I've got.' You need to add value to people and add value to the community." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:16:00">[10:16:00]</a>

### Search Engine Optimization (SEO)
SEO was a significant driver of Deel's growth, especially for B2B products solving active problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:53:00">[25:53:00]</a>.

*   **Focus on Intent**: Instead of just stuffing keywords, Deel's SEO strategy emphasizes understanding user intent. The goal is for a user's Google search to be *over* after reading Deel's content, meaning their question is fully answered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:55:00">[16:55:00]</a>.
*   **"Traffic Light System" Framework**:
    *   Identify up to 700 relevant keywords (closely or distantly related).
    *   Rank keywords by highest to lowest search volume.
    *   Assess the *intent* of the searcher for each keyword:
        *   **Green Light**: High intent, person likely wants the solution.
        *   **Yellow Light**: Medium intent, maybe looking to buy soon, maybe not.
        *   **Red Light**: Low intent, not looking to buy the solution.
    *   Prioritize content creation for Green Light keywords first, then Yellow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:48:00">[18:48:00]</a>.
*   **Content Creation Process**:
    *   Understand search intent by observing what Google currently surfaces for a query (e.g., "eor" often returns "enhanced oil recovery" instead of "employer of record") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:15:00">[20:15:00]</a>.
    *   Address follow-up questions (often found in Google's "people also ask" section) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:01:00">[21:01:00]</a>.
    *   Ensure content is simple (e.g., 4th-grade reading level) and uses keywords appropriately (like an address for Google to send traffic) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:20:00">[21:20:00]</a>. Tools like Clearscope are used to score content quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:37:00">[21:37:00]</a>.
*   **Content Team Structure**:
    *   A director leads the team.
    *   An operations person manages freelancers, briefs, fact-checking, and publishing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:18:00">[22:18:00]</a>.
    *   Writers specialize in different product lines to build expertise.
    *   A team focuses on new content mediums (video, education) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:47:00">[22:47:00]</a>.
    *   The team is currently about eight full-time people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:06:00">[23:06:00]</a>.
*   **Consistency and Quality**: Deel publishes about five net new articles and five updated articles per week, often in multiple languages, to ensure accuracy, especially with changing regulations and tax laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:37:00">[24:37:00]</a>. SEO requires continuous, time-consuming effort; cutting corners on quality will lead to failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:23:00">[23:23:00]</a>.

## Strategic Investment in Paid Ads

Once the basic website and content foundation was solid, Deel expanded into paid advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>.

*   **Beyond Major Platforms**: After covering the "big four-five" ad platforms (e.g., Google, Facebook), Deel diversified into long-tail platforms like review sites, smaller niche websites, newsletter ads, and podcast ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:34:00">[29:34:00]</a>. These individual channels may not contribute a significant chunk, but together they can make up about 30% of lead flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:48:00">[29:48:00]</a>.
*   **Combating Creative Fatigue**: Deel's paid team updates ads monthly to combat "creative fatigue" – where users become tired of seeing the same ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:39:00">[40:39:00]</a>. Messaging also evolves with the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:55:00">[40:55:00]</a>.
*   **Measuring True Impact**: Rather than just lead volume, Deel tracks paid ad success based on how many leads convert to actual clients and the revenue generated from those clients over time (e.g., one year out). This is achieved via a dashboard set up with the data team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:12:00">[41:12:00]</a>.

## Caution on Early Awareness Campaigns

For B2B businesses, early awareness campaigns are generally discouraged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:37:00">[32:37:00]</a>.
*   They are time-consuming, expensive, and have an uncertain return on investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:50:00">[32:50:00]</a>.
*   B2B products are built to solve active problems, so it's better to first tap into the "bottom of the funnel" – people actively seeking a solution and ready to convert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:08:00">[33:08:00]</a>.
*   Awareness campaigns make more sense later, once the market is familiar with the product or interface, as seen with Notion's billboard ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:02:00">[34:02:00]</a>.

## Strategic Partnerships

Partnerships are valuable, but choosing the right partners is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:16:00">[35:16:00]</a>.
*   It's not just about shared audience, but whether the partner is a *trusted resource* for the solution being offered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:29:00">[35:29:00]</a>.
*   For Deel, Venture Capital partners were highly effective, as portfolio companies often seek their VC's recommendations for tools like payroll and HR platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:35:00">[35:35:00]</a>.

## The Importance of a Great Product

All [[productled_growth_strategy | product-led growth strategy]] and acquisition channels are ineffective without a product that delivers value and meets expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:29:00">[42:29:00]</a>.
*   Deel's product was "top-notch" from day one, built by a large engineering and product team relative to sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:40:00">[42:40:00]</a>. This contrasts with early-stage companies that might have more sales people than engineers, indicating a potentially weaker product core <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:47:00">[43:47:00]</a>.
*   In the B2B world, poor products lead to churn and negative word-of-mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:22:00">[43:22:00]</a>.

## COVID-19's Impact on Deel's Growth

While Deel was founded before the pandemic, COVID-19 accelerated the world's adoption of remote work, which aligned with Deel's vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:41:00">[44:41:00]</a>. This global shift validated the idea that people could work effectively regardless of location, leading to increased demand for global hiring solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:00:00">[46:00:00]</a>. Deel emphasized that it is a *global work* platform, not just remote work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:28:00">[45:28:00]</a>.

## [[hiring_and_developing_a_growth_team | Hiring and Developing a Growth Team]]

Deel's approach to [[hiring_and_developing_a_growth_team | hiring and developing a growth team]] focuses on specific traits and a lean structure.

### Essential Skills for Early Growth Teams
*   **Revenue Commitment**: New hires should be willing to commit to closed-won revenue KPIs, not just lead numbers. This shows a commitment to the business's bottom line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:32:00">[47:32:00]</a>. Past experience with revenue goals and strategic thinking at different budget levels are good indicators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:44:00">[49:44:00]</a>.
*   **"Little Hands" Mentality**: Inspired by a French term, this means everyone, regardless of seniority, must be willing to do the "nitty-gritty" or "Dirty Work." This contrasts with hiring senior individuals from large companies who are accustomed to abundant resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:36:00">[48:36:00]</a>.
*   **Self-Awareness and Humbleness**: Melton assesses sincerity and self-awareness in candidates by asking what their siblings (or parents) would say about them, looking for genuine, less-than-perfect answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:28">[01:07:28]</a>.

### Early Growth Team Structure
Deel prioritized hiring one leader for each part of the organization and then letting them grow their teams based on proven needs.
*   **First Hire**: A product marketing person to set messaging between product and go-to-market teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:45:00">[51:45:00]</a>.
*   **Second Hire**: A talented copywriter to lead creative efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:02:00">[52:02:00]</a>.
*   **Third Hire**: A data analyst, an early hire decision that Melton stands by, to ensure spending was tracked and understood (no dollar spent without knowing its return) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:10:00">[52:10:00]</a>.
*   A content person (an early Deel employee) was already in place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:35:00">[52:35:00]</a>.

### Evolving Team Structure: Functional vs. Regional
Deel's current growth team structure balances functional expertise with regional needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:48:00">[52:48:00]</a>:
*   **Functional Teams**: Subject matter experts (e.g., product marketing, content, community, paid ads, brand) who can be based anywhere globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:54:00">[52:54:00]</a>.
*   **Regional Teams**: Marketing managers for different key regions who work with the functional teams to execute strategies, ensuring local expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:17:00">[53:17:00]</a>.
*   This hybrid model is preferred over regional teams having their own full-stack teams (e.g., dedicated paid ads in every region) because it allows technical roles to learn and level up faster by staying together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:39:00">[53:39:00]</a>.

## Building a Strong Culture

Deel's culture, while intense, is a key differentiator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:39:00">[57:39:00]</a>. It's defined by expectations from team members and benefits given by the company.

### Core Values (Crystallized about a year in) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:08:00">[58:08:00]</a>
*   **Deal Speed**: Act with urgency to solve customer problems quickly and build products rapidly. This ensures customers receive answers within 24 hours and new products are built in a fraction of the time competitors might take <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:28:00">[55:28:00]</a>.
*   **Default Optimism**: Maintain a positive outlook, focusing on "how can this be done?" rather than "why it won't work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:07:00">[56:07:00]</a>.
*   **Customer Care**: A deep understanding that the product impacts human livelihoods (payroll, hiring legality), emphasizing the personal aspect of their service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:35:00">[56:35:00]</a>.

### Company Benefits
*   **Flexibility**: Employees have the freedom to choose when and where they work, as long as they deliver results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:23:00">[57:23:00]</a>. This remote-first approach, driven partly by the pandemic, fostered authenticity and camaraderie early on, with team members meeting pets and partners before in-person interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:42">[01:04:42]</a>.

## Conclusion

Deel's journey exemplifies that [[challenges and strategies in startup growth | startup growth]] and [[growth hacking and sustainable growth strategies | sustainable growth strategies]] can be "relatively straightforward" when focusing on first principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:32">[01:05:32]</a>. It requires discipline in identifying where potential customers are asking questions, providing genuine value, and ensuring a robust product. This disciplined approach, combined with a unique culture of urgency and optimism, has propelled Deel to unprecedented heights.

Hiring the right salespeople in B2B is crucial, as selling in this sector is about [[solving problems | solving problems]], not just pushing commodities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Salespeople need to understand the product deeply and solve customer issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:31">[00:37:31]</a>.

## When to Hire Your First Salespeople

Honesty about needing a sales motion for your product is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>.
*   If your first 10-15 customers require a sales-type motion (e.g., deployment effort, security questions, competition, onboarding), you likely need a sales team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.
*   Founders should ideally close the first 10 customers themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>, acting as "A+ middlers" who are good at product and market discussions even if they struggle with opening or closing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.
*   Hire your first salesperson when more than 20% of the founder's time is booked with customers, indicating a need for leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>. Founders should allocate 20% of their time to sales and 20% to recruiting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>.
*   A repeatable sales process, even if simple, should be established by the founder before hiring a VP of Sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>.

### Avoiding Common Mistakes
[!WARNING] Avoid hiring a VP of Sales too early. Doing so before you have at least two sales reps consistently hitting quota has a "100% chance of failure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:09">[00:25:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>. They cannot simultaneously find product-market fit, act as the first reps, and scale the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:02">[00:21:02]</a>.

## Who to Hire: First Salespeople

*   **Hire Two, Not One**: Always hire two sales reps initially to create an A/B test for human performance and strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>.
*   **The "Would You Buy From Them?" Test**: The single most important criterion for early sales hires is if you, as the founder, would buy your own product from them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>.
    *   These individuals are often "quirky pirates and romantics" who possess extra IQ points and have a genuine love for your product, even if it's still feature-poor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>.
    *   They typically have a few years of B2B sales experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:14">[00:26:14]</a> and sufficient maturity to be trusted with leads and customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:21">[00:26:21]</a>.
    *   Avoid hiring solely based on big company logos on resumes; these reps may talk the talk but lack the deep product understanding your startup needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>.
*   **Product Gurus**: Early sales teams must be product gurus and experts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:08">[00:21:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:34">[00:21:34]</a>. They must be able to answer complex questions about the product, unlike sales reps at larger companies who rely on sales engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>.
*   **Preference for "Harder to Sell" Backgrounds**:
    *   Hire someone whose previous product was *harder* to sell than yours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:06">[00:55:06]</a>. These individuals will find your product easier to sell and perform exceptionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:30">[00:55:30]</a>.
    *   Indicators of a "harder to sell" product include being more technical, being in a more competitive market, or involving a more complicated business process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:04">[00:57:04]</a>.
    *   Hiring from a company that was "number four in a space" where the products were hard to differentiate is often a good sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:29">[00:57:29]</a>.

### Sales Roles Defined
*   **SDR (Sales Development Representative)**: Generally an entry-level position focused on outbound activities (emailing, dialing) and screening inbound leads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:45">[01:05:45]</a>. They pass leads to Account Executives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:12">[01:06:12]</a>.
*   **AE (Account Executive)**: More seasoned sales professionals responsible for closing deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:36">[01:06:36]</a>. Early AEs might do some SDR-like work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:38">[01:08:38]</a>.
*   **Director of Sales**: A managerial role above Account Executives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:46">[01:00:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:43">[01:08:43]</a>.
*   **VP of Sales**: Leads the overall sales organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:01">[01:07:01]</a>.

## Hiring a VP of Sales
*   **Timing**: Hire a VP of Sales only after you have at least two sales reps consistently hitting quota <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>. Their role is to scale the team from a few reps to hundreds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>.
*   **Carry a Bag**: In today's environment, a VP of Sales *must* actively participate in sales, whether by carrying a quota, a partial quota, or joining calls to backfill reps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:51">[00:26:51]</a>. They should be in deals 20-30 hours a week when they start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:44">[00:23:44]</a>.
    *   Avoid VPs of Sales who primarily want to be managers and have no desire to sell the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:30">[00:27:30]</a>. This indicates potential burnout or lack of genuine interest in the craft of selling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>.
*   **"Stretch" Hire**: Your first head of sales should typically be a "stretch" VP of Sales (e.g., someone promoted from a Director or Senior Director role) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:50">[01:02:50]</a>. Experienced VPs from larger companies may not be willing to do the hands-on work required in a startup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:41">[01:02:41]</a>.
*   **Ability to Hire Managers**: A sales leader can scale indefinitely if they can hire better managers underneath them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:19">[01:19:19]</a>. If they can only promote junior people, the organization will eventually crack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:41">[01:03:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:05">[01:04:05]</a>.

## The Interview Process
*   **The "Sell Me This App" Test**: Require candidates to sell your product as part of the interview process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:46">[00:35:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:47">[00:43:47]</a>.
    *   Give them time to prepare, watch explainer videos, and understand the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:55">[00:35:55]</a>.
    *   Many candidates won't bother to do this basic research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:55">[00:36:55]</a>. The ones who do, even if they make mistakes, demonstrate confidence in understanding the core problem and solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:19">[00:37:19]</a>.
*   **First 14 Days Question**: For VPs of sales or product, ask "What do you want to do your first 14 days?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:31">[00:30:31]</a>. The correct answer involves meeting customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:39">[00:30:39]</a>, not focusing solely on internal processes, Salesforce setup, or territory planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:38">[00:31:38]</a>.
    *   A focus on "process, process, process" indicates a lack of desire to engage directly with the work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:59">[00:31:59]</a>.
*   **Reference Checks**: Always conduct reference checks, a practice that has unfortunately declined in recent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>.
*   **Candidate Due Diligence**: As a founder, it's your responsibility to ensure the candidate understands the role and is set up for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:22">[00:42:22]</a>. Be honest about challenges to prevent early departures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:50">[00:42:50]</a>.

## Compensation and Quota
*   **Market Pay**: Pay market rate for sales roles, even if it feels high as a founder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:34">[00:46:34]</a>. A typical structure is 50% base salary and 50% bonus (On-Target Earnings - OTE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:07">[00:47:07]</a>.
*   **Return on Investment**: A sales rep should ultimately bring in 3-5x what they take home in total compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:50">[00:47:50]</a>.
    *   3x for small businesses, 4x for mid-market, 5x for enterprise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:06">[00:48:06]</a>.
    *   If they hit this, they are accretive to the business, and you should want them to make a lot of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:54">[00:48:54]</a>.
*   **Early Ramp**: In the very early days, consider letting reps keep 100% of what they close for the first few months (e.g., one quarter max) to help them put points on the board and "eat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:59">[00:49:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:51">[00:53:51]</a>.
    *   Don't over-tweak comp plans; focus on whether the rep brings in more than they take home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:56">[00:50:56]</a>.
*   **Don't Fear High Earnings**: Don't be sad if your salesperson makes more than the founders initially; this means they are generating significant revenue for the company, increasing its overall value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:21">[00:53:21]</a>.

## Sales Team Evolution
*   **Rules of Eight**: For sales organizations, a common heuristic is the "rules of eight" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:06">[01:00:06]</a>.
    *   Eight SDRs need one manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:43">[01:00:43]</a>.
    *   Eight AEs need a Director above them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:48">[01:00:48]</a>.
    *   Eight Directors can have a VP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:53">[01:00:53]</a>.
*   **Management Progression**: Once a VP of Sales has about eight direct reports (AEs), they will start looking to hire two Directors to manage the teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:35">[01:01:35]</a>.
*   **Individual Contributor (IC) Track**: While common in product and engineering, there isn't a strong "senior AE" or "super IC" track in sales, meaning career progression often leads to management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:07">[01:09:07]</a>. This can be a challenge as not all great individual sales performers make great managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:41">[01:09:41]</a>.

## Product and Sales Collaboration
*   **Product Leader Involvement in Sales**: Heads of product should be deeply involved in sales, especially in large deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:28">[01:10:28]</a>. Their deep product knowledge and ability to make commitments can be crucial for closing complex deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:34">[01:12:34]</a>.
*   **Handling Feature Requests from Sales**:
    *   Allocate a specific budget (e.g., 10% of story points) to the head of sales each quarter for feature requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:44">[01:14:44]</a>. This forces sales to prioritize and load balance requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:23">[01:15:23]</a>.
    *   Product leaders should objectively communicate the costs of mid-quarter changes to the roadmap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:56">[01:15:56]</a>.
    *   Regular weekly meetings between product and sales leadership (VP of sales and VP of product) should review these requests and budgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:05">[01:16:05]</a>.
    *   Stress between product and sales is healthy, indicating engagement in deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>, but it needs a structured process to prevent it from becoming debilitating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:16">[01:18:16]</a>.
*   **Product Team P&L Responsibility**: While it's good for product teams to be aligned with revenue goals, be cautious about "weaponizing" them with direct revenue targets, especially for experimental features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:55">[01:23:55]</a>. This can lead to customer-hostile tactics (e.g., dark patterns) and damage long-term customer relationships and compounding revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:21">[01:25:21]</a>.

## General Sales Advice for Founders
*   **Always Ask for Next Steps**: At the end of every customer meeting, learn to ask, "What's the next step?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:44">[01:27:44]</a>. This doesn't have to be a direct ask for money but could be arranging another demo for different stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:13">[01:28:13]</a>. This moves the deal forward step-by-step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:32">[01:28:32]</a>.
*   **Resource for Learning Sales**:
    *   SaaStr University (saastr.university) offers a free course on sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:41">[01:29:41]</a>.
    *   The book "From Impossible to Inevitable" by Aaron Ross (co-written with SaaStr content) is also recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:56">[01:29:56]</a>.
    *   Community platforms like Pavilion provide networking and resources for sales professionals and founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:43">[01:30:43]</a>.
*   **Free Trials and Annual Contracts**:
    *   Be cautious with short trial lengths (e.g., 14 days), which were historically driven by sales teams' desire to close deals faster, not customer benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:21">[01:31:21]</a>.
    *   Consider infinite or very long free trials (like Slack or Canva initially) as they allow customers to convert when ready <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:56">[01:31:56]</a>.
    *   Avoid forcing annual contracts, especially for SMBs, as customers prefer to pay monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:51">[01:32:51]</a>. Prioritize customer preference to avoid negative impact on retention and overall customer experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:06">[01:33:06]</a>.
*   **Learn from Lost Deals**: Focus more on understanding why deals were lost than celebrating won deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:21">[01:34:21]</a>.
*   **Earn Price Increases**: If you raise prices, ensure you've added significant value to your product to justify it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:33">[01:35:33]</a>.
*   **"VP of Free"**: Founders and product leaders must act as the "VP of free," championing the free user base and long tail of users who may not convert immediately but are vital advocates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:15">[01:36:15]</a>.
    *   Products offering a free edition tend to be better overall, as they force investment in strong onboarding and user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:47">[01:37:47]</a>.

## Key Takeaway
Make 2024 the "year of the customer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. Product teams should step up, be the voice of the customer, and focus on building three "great" things this year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:13">[01:41:13]</a>. Shipping great products inspires the entire team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:24">[01:41:24]</a>.

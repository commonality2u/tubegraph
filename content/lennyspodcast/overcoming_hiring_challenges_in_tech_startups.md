Michael Tru, Co-founder and CEO of Any Sphere, the company behind Cursor, shares insights into [[hiring_and_firing_in_startup_teams | hiring]] and building a successful team in the fast-paced tech industry. While many startups are cautioned against [[hiring_and_firing_in_startup_teams | hiring]] too fast, Tru reveals that Cursor initially [[hiring_and_firing_in_startup_teams | hired]] too slow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:33">[00:30:33]</a>. The company prioritized building a world-class group of engineers and researchers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:26">[00:52:26]</a>, which was incredibly important for both personal reasons and the company's strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:26">[00:52:26]</a>.

## Initial Missteps and Lessons Learned

Initially, Cursor biased too much towards hiring candidates who fit the archetype of a "well-known school, very young, had done the things that were like high credential" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:27">[00:54:27]</a>. A key learning was the importance of finding fantastic people, including later-career individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:51">[00:54:51]</a>. The company spent time on the "wrong profile" to begin with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:55">[00:54:55]</a>.

## Desired Traits in Hires

When [[hiring_and_firing_in_startup_teams | hiring]], Cursor looks for individuals with a specific mix of attributes:
*   **Intellectual Curiosity and Experimentation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:42">[00:52:42]</a>: Essential for building new things in a constantly evolving space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:43">[00:52:43]</a>.
*   **Intellectual Honesty and Micro-pessimism/Bluntness** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:46">[00:52:46]</a>: Important for maintaining a level head amidst industry noise and company growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:57">[00:52:57]</a>.
*   **Level-headedness** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:07">[01:00:07]</a>: People less focused on external validation and more focused on building something truly great and delivering high-quality work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:55">[00:59:55]</a>.

## Evolving the Interview Process

The interview loop at Cursor has evolved significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:12">[00:55:12]</a>. A core part of their process is a two-day, on-site work test project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:29">[00:55:29]</a>.

### The Two-Day Work Test
This approach, which was initially thought not to scale, has surprising staying power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:58">[00:55:58]</a>.
*   **Real Work Product**: It allows candidates to go end-to-end on a real, mini-project, often within Cursor's actual codebase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:06">[00:56:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:46">[00:57:46]</a>.
*   **Efficiency**: The time spent in traditional half-day or one-day on-sites can be spread out over these two days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:23">[00:56:23]</a>.
*   **Cultural Fit**: It helps determine if the team genuinely wants to be around the person, as they spend two days together, including meals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:37">[00:56:37]</a>.
*   **Candidate Excitement**: Especially in the early stages when the product wasn't widely known, this process allowed candidates to meet the team and get convinced to join <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:55">[00:56:55]</a>.

This test is not about using the candidate's IP for actual product shipping but provides a realistic work simulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:42">[00:57:42]</a>.

## Company Structure and Future Hiring

Cursor, currently around 60 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:10">[00:58:10]</a>, maintains a very high percentage of engineers, researchers, and designers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:43">[00:58:43]</a>. This lean, product-led approach has allowed them to delay extensive operational and sales/marketing efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:01">[00:59:01]</a>.

To [[challenges_and_strategies_in_startup_growth | overcome startup failures and challenges]] and maintain focus in a rapidly changing AI landscape, Cursor relies on [[hiring_and_firing_in_startup_teams | hiring]] people with the right attitude and disposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:36">[00:59:36]</a>. This strategy has allowed them to operate with less process on the engineering front, as excellent hires embody the desired behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:44">[01:00:44]</a>.

Cursor is always seeking excellent engineers, designers, and researchers, as well as talent across all business functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:04">[01:06:04]</a>. They encourage interested individuals to reach out, even if they don't see a specific role listed, as the company is always learning and may identify new needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:22">[01:05:22]</a>.

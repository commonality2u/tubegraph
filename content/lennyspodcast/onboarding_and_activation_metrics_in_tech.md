Naomi Gleit, Head of Product at Meta and employee number 29 at Facebook (now Meta), shares insights from her nearly 20 years at the company, particularly focusing on the early growth team's strategies for [[improving_user_activation_and_onboarding_experiences | user activation and onboarding experiences]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. She witnessed Facebook scale from 30 employees to a trillion-dollar business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## The Facebook Growth Team's Approach

Facebook's growth team is considered legendary in the tech industry for pioneering core growth levers and techniques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>. A key insight was the shift from viewing growth primarily as a marketing or communications responsibility to a product-driven one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:11">[00:29:11]</a>. The team believed the product itself was the biggest lever to drive growth, necessitating product and engineering efforts to optimize flows like registration, invites, and new user onboarding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:28">[00:29:28]</a>.

### Key Activation Metric

The widely cited activation metric of "7 friends in 10 days" was indeed a real target for the Facebook growth team, as was "10 friends in 14 days" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:32">[00:26:32]</a>. These metrics were different points on a retention curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:39">[00:26:39]</a>.

The core insight behind these metrics was that retention, rather than just acquisition, was the biggest lever for net growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:16">[00:27:16]</a>. This understanding came from "growth accounting," which tracked net growth daily by considering new user registrations, stale users (those who hadn't logged in for 30 days), and resurrected users (those who returned after 30 days) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:49">[00:26:49]</a>.

The team found that friending highly correlated with user retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:36">[00:27:36]</a>. The specific numbers (e.g., 7 friends) were chosen because they represented points where a user's likelihood of being retained increased, indicating they had experienced Facebook's value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:47">[00:27:47]</a>. The emphasis was on users experiencing this "Magic Moment" quickly after registration to prevent churn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:05">[00:28:05]</a>.

Ultimately, the exact number of friends or days was less important than having a clear, rallying goal that everyone could focus on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:20">[00:34:20]</a>.

## Evolution of Onboarding

In its earliest days as a college-only site, Facebook didn't require a new user onboarding experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:13">[00:35:13]</a>. Users were often automatically connected to others on campus and understood the product intuitively, learning through osmosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:22">[00:35:22]</a>.

However, as Facebook expanded to teens, work networks, and eventually to open registration for anyone with an email address in 2006, the need for a guided onboarding became apparent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:42">[00:35:42]</a>.

The initial new user experience included steps like:
1.  **Upload a profile picture**: Essential for others to find and recognize users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:17">[00:36:17]</a>.
2.  **Find friends**: This step, leveraging features like contact importing and "people you may know," became a primary driver of the activation metric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:25">[00:36:25]</a>.

The fundamental principle across iterations (desktop, mobile app, photos, videos) has remained the same: educating people on how to connect with friends on Facebook, regardless of the product's evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:54">[00:37:54]</a>.

## Removing Barriers to Growth

The growth team's projects often focused on removing barriers, both macro and micro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:29">[00:39:29]</a>.

### Macro Barriers
These were larger obstacles to adoption:
*   **Audience restrictions**: Initially, only college students, then high school students, then work networks, then anyone with an email address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:05">[00:40:05]</a>. The decision not to bifurcate the graph (e.g., create "Facebook High") was a key moment, maintaining a single community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:41">[00:39:41]</a>.
*   **Device access**: Building a rich Facebook experience for users on feature phones or low-end devices without smartphone access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:15">[00:40:15]</a>.
*   **Internet access/cost**: Initiatives like Internet.org aimed to remove barriers to internet access or affording a data plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:27">[00:40:27]</a>.
*   **Language barriers**: Instead of professional translators, Facebook built a product that allowed the community to make in-line translations, with a system to rank the best translations. This approach led to supporting over a hundred languages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>.

### Micro Barriers
These involved optimizing product flows to remove friction:
*   **Email confirmation**: In 2009, 20% of registered users weren't confirming their emails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:01">[00:41:01]</a>. The solution allowed users to receive notifications even as unconfirmed accounts. If they clicked on *any* notification, it counted as an account confirmation, as it proved email ownership. This removed the micro barrier of having to specifically find and click the confirmation email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:11">[00:41:11]</a>.

### Data-Driven Product Optimization
The "understand, identify, execute" framework was crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:43">[00:29:43]</a>. In January 2009, the growth team paused all other roadmap items to focus *only* on data instrumentation, ensuring they had the necessary data to make informed decisions and "know" rather than "guess" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:14">[00:30:14]</a>. This meant instrumenting every step of the registration and new user onboarding flows to identify drop-off points and key opportunities for growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:20">[00:30:20]</a>. This data-driven, product-driven approach was the "special sauce" of the growth team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:51">[00:30:51]</a> and later expanded to other areas like social impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>.

This pioneering approach to [[indicators_and_metrics_for_productmarket_fit_progression | measuring developer productivity]] and driving growth through product optimization, especially with a strong product-market fit, influenced the entire company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:05">[00:40:05]</a>.

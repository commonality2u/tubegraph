Ravi Mehta, a co-founder and CEO of Outpace and an instructor for Reforge's product leadership and product strategy programs, offers a unique perspective on [[Strategies for setting and deploying effective product strategies | product strategy]] and goal setting. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:17">[01:17:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>

## The Product Strategy Stack: Goals at the Bottom

Mehta introduces the "product strategy stack" to clarify the relationship between different strategic elements, aiming to define a clear framework for decision-making and value creation for the business. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:04">[02:04:04]</a>

The stack is composed of five key pieces, from top to bottom:
1.  **Company Mission:** The qualitative, inspirational change the company aims to bring to the world. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:08">[02:08:08]</a>
2.  **Company Strategy:** The rigorous, logical plan to achieve the company's mission. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>
3.  **Product Strategy:** The link between what the company wants to achieve and the daily activities of the product team. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:14">[02:11:14]</a>
4.  **Product Roadmap:** Informs product goals based on the product strategy. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>
5.  **Product Goals:** The ultimate measurable targets, informed by the roadmap. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>

Mehta's approach places goals *after* the roadmap, which is a contrarian view. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a> He likens it to taking a road trip: you first decide your destination (strategy), then map out the journey (roadmap), and only then define how you'll measure progress (goals), like driving 250 miles to reach Vegas. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:03">[02:43:03]</a> The purpose of goals, in this view, is to help reach the strategic destination, not just to hit an arbitrary number. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:48">[02:43:48]</a> If achieving a goal moves away from the strategic destination, it warrants a re-evaluation of the goal or the strategy. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:55">[02:43:55]</a>

## Challenges and Learnings in Goalsetting with OKRs

Many companies struggle with implementing OKRs (Objectives and Key Results). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:41">[02:47:41]</a> A common challenge is the emphasis on "outcomes over outputs," which, while ultimately the goal, can lead to issues if not properly understood and applied. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:07">[02:48:07]</a>

### The Frontier of Understanding

Mehta proposes considering the "Frontier of Understanding" when setting goals. This concept acknowledges that teams often face different types of risk that dictate what kind of goal is appropriate. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:46">[02:48:46]</a>

There are four types of risk, which should inform the focus of your goals:

1.  **Understanding Risk:** Occurs when the team doesn't fully grasp the levers that influence a particular metric. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:27">[02:49:27]</a>
    *   **Goal:** Increase understanding, not necessarily move the metric. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:34">[02:49:34]</a> For example, if you don't know why people are continuing to use a product, a retention goal might be less effective than a goal to understand user behavior. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:05">[02:49:05]</a>
2.  **Dependency Risk:** The team understands the levers but may lack the necessary tools or resources to make progress. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:43">[02:50:43]</a>
3.  **Execution Risk:** The team has all the resources and a strong hypothesis, but the challenge lies in effectively executing experiments or plans. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:51">[02:50:51]</a>
    *   **Goal:** Focus on execution, e.g., "hit 20 experiments this quarter," to ensure efficient action. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:51">[02:50:51]</a>
4.  **Strategic Risk:** The team has a hypothesis and executes well, but the hypothesis itself might turn out to be incorrect. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:02">[02:51:02]</a>
    *   **Goal:** Test the strategic hypothesis to validate or pivot. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:02">[02:51:02]</a>

By identifying the current "Frontier of Understanding," teams can set goals that are realistic and productive for their current stage of knowledge and capability. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:46">[02:48:46]</a>

### Aligning Goals with Leadership Expectations

While leadership often desires outcome-driven goals, a product manager can frame their quarterly goals to prioritize understanding and learning. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:55">[02:51:55]</a>

If a team misses a goal, clearly conveying the learning gained and proposing a clearer path forward for the next quarter can build confidence with leadership. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:47">[02:52:47]</a> The goal should be to be in the quadrant where you "hit your goals and know why." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:12">[02:54:12]</a> If goals are missed, it's crucial to at least be making progress on understanding *why* they were missed. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:23">[02:54:23]</a>

This framework helps ensure that goals are not just arbitrary targets, but rather stepping stones in a larger strategic journey, driven by continuous learning and adaptation. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:57">[02:52:57]</a>

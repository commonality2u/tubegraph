Elizabeth Stone, the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) at Netflix, holds a unique professional background as a trained economist with a PhD in economics. As far as can be determined, she is the first economist to be named CTO at a Fortune 500 company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>, a fact she acknowledges as "unusual" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. This distinctive foundation has significantly shaped her approach to leadership and problem-solving in the tech industry.

## Economics as a "Flavor of Data Science"

Stone believes that economics is a valuable "flavor of data science" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. She notes that when she initially transitioned from economics to tech, the concept of data science was not as prevalent as it is today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. She now feels more strongly that economics offers a set of technical skills and a distinct framework for problem-solving that is complimentary to other forms of [[the_role_of_data_analytics_in_business_impact | data science]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. This perspective allows her to approach challenges with a unique lens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

## Practical Applications of Economics

Her economics background has provided concrete advantages throughout her career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>:

*   **Understanding Incentives and Unintended Consequences**: Stone highlights the ability to understand incentives and anticipate unintended consequences as a key benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. This applies to both internal leadership, such as clarifying priorities and motivating a company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>, and external business strategies, like understanding consumer behavior and competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. This perspective helps in anticipating outcomes, even if they deviate from purely rational expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.
*   **Simplifying Complex Problems**: Economics teaches a way to simplify problems, making them feel "tractable" or manageable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. This structured thinking is invaluable in a business context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.
*   **Translating Technical to Non-Technical**: Her training provided a strong foundation in translating complex quantitative work into understandable language for diverse audiences, such as judges and juries in economic cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. This skill has been a "relative advantage" in her career, enabling her to bridge gaps between technical and non-technical teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.

## Recommendation for Tech Companies

Elizabeth Stone strongly recommends that tech companies hire more economists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. She believes economics offers a generally valuable and useful perspective for a wide range of challenges, especially in a business context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. The increasing recognition of economists' value in tech has grown significantly since she made her career switch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. Her varied career path, which included a [[role_and_impact_of_coo_within_highgrowth_companies | COO role at Nuna]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a> and VP of Data and Insights at Netflix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>, demonstrates the broad applicability of her economic training to diverse business and technical leadership positions.

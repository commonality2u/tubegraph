Toasts and tributes are common public speaking events, often happening spontaneously in various settings, including weddings, anniversaries, retirements, and work celebrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:53">[00:56:53]</a>. Learning to deliver them effectively can be a valuable [[improving_public_speaking_skills | communication skill]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:13">[00:57:13]</a>.

## The WHAT Acronym for Toasts

Matt Abrahams, a professor at Stanford University's Graduate School of Business, suggests using the "WHAT" acronym to structure toasts and tributes, providing a clear beginning, middle, and end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:15">[00:57:15]</a>:

*   **W: Why are we here?** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:23">[00:57:23]</a>
    *   Clearly state the purpose of the gathering or celebration. For instance, at a work event, you might say, "I'm here to celebrate the release of this product that that team put out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:34">[00:57:34]</a>.
*   **H: How are you connected?** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:42">[00:57:42]</a>
    *   Briefly explain your relationship to the event or person being honored. For example, at a wedding, you could state, "I've known the groom for 25 years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:49">[00:57:49]</a>. At work, this might be less necessary if your position is well-known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:55">[00:57:55]</a>.
*   **A: Anecdote** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a>
    *   Tell a relevant, accessible, and concise story or quick example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:03">[00:58:03]</a>. This is where the main content and emotion of the tribute often lie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:50">[00:58:50]</a>.
*   **T: Thanks/Gratitude** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:16">[00:58:16]</a>
    *   Express gratitude and offer a concluding signal, such as "cheers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:24">[00:58:24]</a>.

## Key Principles for Effective Toasts

*   **Be Brief** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:32">[00:59:32]</a>: Nobody has ever complained about a toast being too short <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:37">[00:59:37]</a>.
*   **Show, Don't Tell Emotion** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:19">[01:01:19]</a>: While emotion is important for connecting with people, ensure it's genuine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:52">[01:00:52]</a>. Instead of stating "I am so sad," tell a story that conveys that sadness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:57">[01:01:57]</a>. Emotion conveyed through anecdotes makes the toast more human <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:31">[01:01:31]</a>.
*   **Test and Iterate** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:12">[01:00:12]</a>: Apply principles of minimally viable communication, similar to [[improving_developer_experience | Agile development]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:07">[01:00:07]</a>. Get feedback from others on your draft toast to determine if it's too long or if more stories are needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:28">[01:00:28]</a>. We are not always the best judges of our own communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:36">[01:00:36]</a>.
*   **Practice and Reflection**: The only way to improve communication, whether spontaneous or planned, is through repetition, reflection, and feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:42">[00:41:42]</a>.

For further development of [[techniques_for_enhancing_public_speaking_skills | communication skills]], resources like Toastmasters or continuing education classes at universities can provide valuable practice and feedback opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:32">[00:42:32]</a>.

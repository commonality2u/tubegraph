Leadership thrives on a blend of personal integrity and a genuine desire to understand, fostering environments where teams can openly collaborate and achieve optimal outcomes. Amy Vora, Chief Product Officer at Fair and former Facebook executive, emphasizes the pivotal roles of authenticity and curiosity in her career success and leadership philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>.

## Embracing Authenticity

Amy Vora's approach to leadership is rooted in a commitment to authenticity, a stark contrast to the "superwoman" archetype she once perceived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. She advocates for being "pretty messy and imperfect at times yet still be very successful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>.

### Redefining Success
Vora found that her most successful career moves weren't based on a rigid plan or "spreadsheet math" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:33:00">[08:33:00]</a>. Instead, they stemmed from an [[importance_of_introspection_and_selfawareness_in_interviews | emotional response]] to potential roles, asking herself: "When I walk through the doors, do I feel like I'm lucky to be there?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>. This led her to places where she felt "at home," characterized by a high degree of trust with colleagues, allowing her to take risks and perform her best work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:35:00">[09:35:00]</a>.

### Navigating Feedback and Self-Perception
Early in her career, Amy received feedback implying that despite her intelligence, she needed to be "more likable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This led her to "shrink" herself, becoming less opinionated and aggressive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>. However, she later realized the necessity of expressing her opinions and taking ownership as a leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>.

Her key learning from this experience, especially for women in tech who often receive personal feedback on style rather than content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:00">[05:29:00]</a>, is to:
> "Expand your tool sets... You're not going to make yourself smaller, you're not going to be any less of who you are, but you are going to build new tools so that you you know new keys to unlock new different kinds of doors and that is only going to make you bigger and more powerful and more expansive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>.

This perspective aligns with the idea of continuously adding "more lenses, more keys, more tools" rather than reducing one's authentic self <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>.

## Cultivating Curiosity

A defining trait of Amy Vora's leadership is her profound curiosity, even in the face of disagreement. BOS, Meta's CTO, described her reaction to profound disagreements as "fascinating, you have to tell me more why you think that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. This isn't just a phrase; it stems from a genuine desire to understand and learn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>.

### Prioritizing Outcome Over Being "Right"
Amy admits that she used to "really enjoy being right" and that her identity was built on "being the person who was right and being the person who knew everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>, but this did not serve her well in the working world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. A key shift was realizing that "it's more important to get to the outcome than to be right" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>.

By embracing curiosity, she recognized that:
*   Other people possess valuable information she lacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.
*   Allowing ego to "overtake desire to get to the best outcome" is a "silly trade-off" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>.
*   Curiosity creates a "positive feedback loop" leading to better outcomes and mutual satisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>.

### Managing Visceral Reactions
When faced with a strong disagreement that triggers a "visceral reaction," Amy suggests taking a pause. This allows the body and mind to calm, enabling a response that is "more about opening than about closing stuff" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>. The belief that most disagreements stem from different information, rather than ill intent, allows for a more productive [[effective_listening_and_communication_as_a_leader | dialogue]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>.

### Curiosity as a Foundation for Learning
Curiosity ensures that every meeting becomes an opportunity for discovery: "If you assume that every person there knows something that you don't know then it's it's not like just wait to get to the right answer it's like discover the thing that they know that you don't know" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>.

## The Interplay of Authenticity and Curiosity in Leadership Principles

### Metaphors and Imagery
Amy Vora is known for her use of metaphors and imagery to communicate complex ideas and [[effective_listening_and_communication_as_a_leader | rally teams]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>. These include:
*   **"Putting on the coat of the job"**: An [[importance_of_introspection_and_selfawareness_in_interviews | emotional check]] to gauge fit and feeling "at home" in a potential role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:08:00">[09:08:00]</a>.
*   **"Dinosaur brain"**: Used to describe the limited capacity of executives in product reviews, emphasizing the need for clear recommendations from teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>. This encourages team members to take ownership and lead the recommendation, knowing the executive is curious about their well-reasoned proposals.
*   **"Hill climb"**: Illustrates the difference between a local optimum (current success) and a global optimum (a higher, distant goal) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>. It acknowledges the difficult "slog" through the "valley" but reminds the team of the ultimate "summit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>. This authenticity about challenges, combined with a curious exploration of future potential, prepares teams for growth.
*   **"Face-to-face communication" (for WhatsApp)**: The core product metaphor for WhatsApp, aiming to create a feeling of effortless, intimate interaction, like sitting around a kitchen table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>. This deep curiosity about user experience drives the design and empowers teams to build consistently.

A tactical piece of advice for creating such metaphors is to "think about what you want your users to feel when you're using the product and when else have they felt that same feeling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>.

### Execution Over Strategy
Amy Vora firmly believes that "execution eats strategy for breakfast" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>. While strategy is "glamorous" and fun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>, customers ultimately care about the product in their hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>. She argues that perfect strategy with poor execution yields no learning, whereas "pretty good strategy" with "perfect execution" allows for continuous learning and iteration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>. An authentic leader embraces the "nuts and bolts" of execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>, and a curious leader uses execution to test and refine strategy through customer feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>.

### Empowering Teams and Setting Goals
Vora advocates for decoupling goals to avoid "toddler soccer" where everyone chases the same metric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>. Instead, each team should have different goals that ladder into a larger framework, covering the entire customer journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>. This requires authentic [[importance_of_trust_and_collaboration_in_team_environments | trust and collaboration]], acknowledging that teams will naturally have different incentives and information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>. Disagreement is seen as "healthy tension and knowledge" rather than a sign of something "going wrong" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. A curious leader fosters an environment where this tension is openly discussed to find the best solutions.

### The Challenges of Senior Leadership
As leaders become more senior, the problems they face are "fundamentally unsolvable" by simple means, forcing them to choose the "least bad" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>. This requires authenticity about the limitations of decision-making and a continuous curiosity to improve systems and understand evolving market and customer needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. Normalizing these "hard truths" helps leaders avoid feeling like failures and instead view challenges as inherent to the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>.

In essence, [[leadership_principles_and_career_success | leadership success]] for Vora stems from continuously building one's toolkit, embracing authenticity in how one operates, and maintaining an insatiable curiosity about people, problems, and outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>.

SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is a critical channel for product growth, though often [[effective_seo_resource_allocation | under-resourced]] compared to advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. There are three main types of SEO strategies: programmatic, editorial, and technical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:45">[00:18:45]</a>. Understanding the differences between programmatic and editorial SEO is crucial for [[identifying_growth_opportunities_via_seo | identifying growth opportunities]] and allocating resources effectively.

## What is Programmatic SEO?

Programmatic SEO involves the automatic generation of web pages from a database of information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>. These pages are typically:
*   **Category Pages** A grid or list of items, such as product categories on an e-commerce site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>.
*   **Item Pages** A single item, such as a product page, an address (like on Zillow), or a video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>.
*   **User-Generated Content (UGC) Pages** Pages generated from user contributions, like Q&A sections on Quora or forums <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:34">[01:00:34]</a>.

**Examples**:
*   **eBay**: Product pages are automatically generated from their database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a>.
*   **Zillow**: Home address pages are generated from their database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>.
*   **Glassdoor**: UGC, like company reviews and salary data, is programmatically generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>.

### Advantages and Challenges
*   **Cost Efficiency**: A significant advantage of programmatic SEO is that companies do not incur a cost for each individual page created, as they are generated automatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>.
*   **Scope**: Having a large volume of user-generated content (UGC), addresses, or SKUs (stock-keeping units) significantly lowers the "scope" of work, making it easier to compete via programmatic SEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>.
*   **Hiring**: Finding individuals who excel at programmatic SEO is challenging due to its specialized nature, involving nuances around indexation logic and scalable systems for handling UGC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:50">[00:45:50]</a>. A programmatic SEO specialist often acts as a growth person with strong technical ability, working with engineers to build taxonomies and update sites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:43">[00:47:43]</a>. Their day-to-day involves analyzing competitors' sites, identifying successful patterns, developing product requirements, and clustering keywords into topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:42">[00:49:42]</a>.
*   **Evolution**: Google's algorithm has evolved from keyword-based ranking to topic-based understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>. This means having unique pages for every minor keyword variation (as was common before) no longer works well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:53">[00:30:53]</a>. Instead, pages should target topics that cover multiple keywords, reducing the need for millions of distinct, low-utility pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:07">[00:31:07]</a>.

## What is Editorial SEO?

Editorial SEO involves human-written content, such as articles, guides, or listicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>. This type of content focuses on providing comprehensive and useful information to users.

**Examples**:
*   **Masterclass**: Creates content related to their classes, such as articles about cooking techniques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>.
*   **BetterUp**: Develops articles around career coaching topics, like "how to give difficult feedback" or "how to create a five-year plan" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:42">[00:21:42]</a>.
*   **NerdWallet**: Offers guides on financial information and credit cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:57">[00:21:57]</a>.
*   **HubSpot**: Publishes extensive content on productivity and business topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:09">[00:22:09]</a>.
*   **Dotdash**: A conglomerate of publishers (like Investopedia) consistently performs well in editorial SEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:16">[00:22:16]</a>.

### Advantages and Challenges
*   **Growing Importance**: Editorial SEO is increasingly driving more traffic than programmatic SEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>.
*   **Cost**: Each piece of editorial content has a cost associated with its creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>.
*   **Team and Workflow**: An editorial SEO strategy typically involves an SEO manager who defines [[seo_and_content_marketing_insights | topics]] and outlines, and writers (ideally domain experts) who create the content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:05">[00:56:05]</a>. The SEO manager oversees publishing through a CMS (e.g., Contentful, Webflow) and analyzes results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:37">[00:31:37]</a>.
*   **Hiring**: While an understanding of SEO is beneficial, individuals with a strong background in content strategy can learn editorial SEO, as it doesn't require the deep, specialized expertise needed for programmatic SEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:59">[00:56:59]</a>.
*   **Operation at Scale**: Initially, a company might publish 10-30 articles per month to test the waters and gain early [[seo_strategies_for_successful_companies | leading indicators]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:01">[00:58:01]</a>. Once positive signals emerge (e.g., ranking within the top 20 for target keywords), the volume can scale to 100+ articles per month based on ROI calculations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:50">[00:58:50]</a>.
*   **[[impact_of_ai_on_seo | Impact of AI]]**: While AI tools like GPT-3 can generate grammatically correct sentences, they often lack factual accuracy or underlying wisdom, making them generally unsuitable for critical content (e.g., health or finance) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>. However, AI is highly effective for supporting editorial SEO by:
    *   Helping to decide which [[seo_and_content_marketing_insights | topics]] to write about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:53">[01:27:53]</a>.
    *   Clustering keywords into topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:57">[01:27:57]</a>.
    *   Determining [[importance_of_internal_links_and_topical_authority_in_seo | topical Authority]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:01">[01:28:01]</a>.
    *   Identifying sub-topic themes for comprehensive outlines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:06">[01:28:06]</a>.
    This allows human domain experts to focus on writing high-quality content based on AI-generated structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:10">[01:28:10]</a>.

## Choosing the Right Strategy

The choice between programmatic and editorial SEO (or a combination) depends on the product category and the addressable market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:27]</a>.
*   **Programmatic SEO** is best suited for products with a large volume of structured data that can be automated into pages, such as e-commerce, real estate, or user-generated content platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:44">[00:20:44]</a>.
*   **Editorial SEO** is always an opportunity if there's an addressable market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>. It is ideal for companies that can provide valuable information, guides, or advice related to their offering.

> [!NOTE] [[productled_approach_to_seo | Product-led SEO]] is crucial for both strategies. Embedding SEO changes directly into product development and securing executive buy-in are key to overcoming resource constraints and getting initiatives launched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:06">[01:07:06]</a>.

## The Role of Technical SEO

Technical SEO focuses on the underlying infrastructure of a website, including:
*   Internal link architecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>
*   Tags
*   Redirects
*   Page speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>

While fundamental, technical SEO primarily supports growth rather than directly driving it. Its main purpose is to help Google find and crawl all pages effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:07">[00:32:07]</a>, ensuring that the programmatic and editorial content can be discovered and ranked. [[importance_of_internal_links_and_topical_authority_in_seo | Internal links]], in particular, are a frequently under-optimized lever, with proper linking across a site leading to significant traffic increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:41">[01:17:41]</a>.

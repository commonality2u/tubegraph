Shas Doshi, in a live podcast recording, reflected on three key questions he wished he had asked himself sooner in his career as a product leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. These questions highlight the crucial, often overlooked, role of strategy in effective product leadership, addressing common frustrations like excessive busyness and decision-making pitfalls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Battling Busyness and Ineffective Planning

Product leaders often feel overwhelmed by busyness and stress, largely due to an ever-growing scope of work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. While common productivity tips and tools can help, they eventually become insufficient when the scope of responsibility is so large that no amount of efficiency can contain it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.

A prime example of this inefficiency is annual planning, which for many senior leaders can consume two to three months with spreadsheets, meetings, and stakeholder management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. Despite the extensive effort, these plans often become irrelevant within weeks due to unforeseen customer escalations or changing priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. The common adage, "plans are useless but planning is everything," often serves as an excuse for this unproductive cycle, without providing clear meaning or benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>.

## The Power of a Real Product Strategy

Doshi discovered that a genuine, well-aligned [[product_strategy_and_vision_development | product strategy]] can drastically reduce the burden of annual planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>. While at Stripe, he realized that having a clear, pre-aligned [[developing_a_product_strategy | product strategy]] for a major product allowed him to complete his planning in just three days, in contrast to the typical four to six weeks many peers spent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>.

A well-defined strategy helps:
*   Eliminate many prioritization problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>.
*   Streamline planning processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>.
*   Provide a rigorous framework for evaluating and addressing customer escalations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>.

By focusing upfront on a clear, shared strategy, product leaders can avoid spending excessive time on less impactful activities like debating precise resource allocations that are unlikely to hold true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>.

## Developing "Good Taste" in Strategy

Beyond operational efficiency, Shas Doshi emphasized the concept of "good taste" as fundamental to [[becoming_more_strategic_in_product_management | strategic product management]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:53">[00:25:53]</a>. This isn't just about aesthetics or user experience; it's about the ability to identify what is truly good and valuable without needing to see immediate results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:41">[00:31:41]</a>.

### The Folly of Execution Without Strategy
Early in his career at Google, Doshi observed an environment where "strategy is for MBAs" and "execution is everything" was a prevailing mantra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:36">[00:26:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:46">[00:26:46]</a>. He initially adopted this belief, dismissing the need for strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a>.

However, his experience at Twitter (circa 2014) revealed the critical importance of strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:44">[00:27:44]</a>. Despite having incredible assets like its product, network effects, brand, and talent, Twitter struggled because it lacked a "real compelling cohesive [[product_strategy_and_vision_development | product strategy]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:26">[00:28:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:42">[00:28:42]</a>. This experience, further solidified at Stripe, taught him the greater value and importance of having a clear strategy, especially for growing early-stage products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:10">[00:29:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>.

### Strategic Decision-Making
Doshi argued that many product decisions are made without sufficient thought regarding customer motivation, differentiation, or distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>. The belief that a decision is a "two-way door" (easily reversible) often leads to commitments that are difficult to undo and accumulate "feature debt" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:31">[00:20:31]</a>. For PM leaders, what appears to be a two-way door at a CEO's level is often a one-way door, leading to more work for features that should not have been built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:30">[00:23:30]</a>.

> "Thinking is cheap, so you should do more thinking, not less." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:39">[00:37:39]</a>

Developing good taste means being able to evaluate ideas based on their merit, independent of catchy metaphors, alliterations (like "fail fast"), or authority bias (e.g., "Bezos said it") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:49">[00:34:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:04">[00:35:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:51">[00:35:51]</a>. This requires shedding preconceived patterns and becoming a more critical thinker, moving beyond superficial impressions to truly understand an idea's core <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:41">[00:36:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:24">[00:37:24]</a>.

## Reducing Frustration Through Strategic Alignment

The [[the_role_of_a_product_manager | product manager's job]], particularly at the leadership level, can be lonely and frustrating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:51">[00:38:51]</a>. Doshi identified that much of this frustration stems from operating in misalignment with one's "superpowers" and core identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:19">[00:39:19]</a>.

Product work can be seen at three levels:
1.  **Impact Level:** Focusing on the strategic outcomes.
2.  **Execution Level:** Managing the day-to-day building.
3.  **Optics Level:** Dealing with communication and perception. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:58">[00:39:58]</a>

When product leaders are forced to spend most of their time at a level that is not their natural "happy place" (e.g., spending excessive time on optics when their strength is impact), it leads to frustration, despite having the skills and willpower to do the work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:16">[00:40:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:10">[00:41:10]</a>. To avoid this, Doshi suggests identifying one's superpowers and aligning career decisions with them, rather than conforming to traditional career paths or external expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:40">[00:42:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:51">[00:42:51]</a>. This allows for more fulfilling and effective work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:09">[00:43:09]</a>.

Ultimately, a strong [[product_strategy_and_vision_development | product strategy]] not only guides product development but also enables product leaders to operate more effectively, reduce stress, and derive greater satisfaction from their crucial [[role_of_product_managers_in_organizations | role in organizations]].

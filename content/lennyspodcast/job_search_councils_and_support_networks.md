Job search councils provide a vital support system for individuals navigating the complexities of finding new employment, particularly in challenging economic climates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:07">[03:07:07]</a>. Pioneered by Phil Terry, author of "Never Search Alone," these councils apply a "product lens" to the job search, emphasizing focus, strategy, and community support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:34">[02:37:34]</a>.

## Origin and Philosophy
The concept of job search councils originated over 60 years ago with Phil Terry's mother, who started a support group for teachers in 1960 in the San Fernando Valley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:02">[05:02:02]</a>. This group met for 50 years, providing mutual support and career development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>. Terry adapted this model during the dot-com bubble burst when he was helping hundreds of people with their job searches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22:00">[06:22:00]</a>.

The core philosophy is "never search alone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>. The job search process can be insecure and anxious for anyone, regardless of their seniority or experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>. Doing it alone magnifies these feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. By bringing anxious people together to be open, vulnerable, and [[the_importance_of_asking_for_help_in_career_development | ask for help]], the fear and anxiety can transform into hope, motivation, accountability, and confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>.

## Structure and Operation of Job Search Councils
A job search council is typically a support group of six to eight job seekers who commit to supporting each other through the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>. While originating from the product community, it is beneficial for anyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>. Over 2,000 such councils have been launched, all completely free and volunteer-driven, with over 20,000 hours of volunteer work invested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:18:00">[09:18:00]</a>. Phil Terry funds the initiative with double his book sales to ensure accessibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:00">[09:56:00]</a>.

### Joining a Council
To join, individuals apply via phil.org <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:32:00">[10:32:00]</a>. Applicants are categorized as "slow seekers" (employed but looking) or "fast seekers" (out of work), and placed into different groups based on their urgency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:01:00">[11:01:00]</a>. Individuals willing to volunteer as moderators get matched faster and receive additional training and support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:15:00">[11:15:00]</a>.

### Council Process
After matching, members go through a live orientation program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:33:00">[11:33:00]</a>. They receive a free, 100-page workbook with templates and guides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:49:00">[11:49:00]</a>. Meetings are typically remote and start with a "meeting zero" for members to share personal stories, build trust, and foster vulnerability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:09:00">[12:09:00]</a>. Fast seekers meet twice a week, while slow seekers meet every two weeks, continuing until a job is secured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:24:00">[12:24:00]</a>.

## Impact and Benefits
The impact of job search councils is profound, helping individuals maintain emotional balance, overcome loneliness, and navigate the job market effectively.

*   **Emotional Balance:** Managing emotional balance is crucial during a job search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:07:00">[14:07:07]</a>. Councils help flip anxiety and fear into hope, motivation, accountability, and confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>.
*   **Combating Loneliness:** In a world with increasing loneliness, these councils provide a sense of "real community" beyond message boards, offering genuine connection and support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:59:00">[17:59:00]</a>.
*   **Private Safety Net:** The councils aim to build a private safety net for those affected by "creative destruction"—the economic concept where new products and methods disrupt old ones, leading to job displacement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:48:00">[18:48:00]</a>. This addresses the negative unintended consequences of capitalism's dynamism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:26:00">[19:26:00]</a>.
*   **Improved Job Search Duration:** Data shows that the average job search within a council is about three months, which is at the low end of the national average of three to six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:36:00">[22:36:00]</a>.
*   **Testimonials:** Participants have reported that councils help them "bounce ideas," provide accountability, and help them "keep going" when emotional energy is low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:43:00">[13:43:00]</a>.

## Key Strategies and Tactics
Job search councils employ specific [[job_search_strategies_and_candidate_market_fit | job search strategies and candidate market fit]] and "playing to win" tactics, drawing parallels with product development.

### [[job_search_strategies_and_candidate_market_fit | Candidate Market Fit]]
[[job_search_strategies_and_candidate_market_fit | Candidate Market Fit]] is a crucial concept, especially in a down market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:49:00">[20:49:00]</a>. It emphasizes that job search is a marketplace with supply and demand, meaning a candidate's fit can shift based on market conditions, which is not a personal statement about the individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:48:00">[21:48:00]</a>.

1.  **Manukan Two-Pager:** The first radical step is to define "what you want" and "what you don't want" in a job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:07:00">[22:07:00]</a>. Most people "spray and pray" when laid off instead of taking this focused approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:13:00">[22:13:00]</a>. This is a draft, not a final decision, iterated with the council <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:29:00">[24:29:00]</a>.
2.  **Listening Tour:** After drafting the Manukan Two-Pager, individuals conduct a listening tour to understand market demand for their "product" (skills and experience) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:52:00">[24:52:00]</a>. This involves:
    *   **Reverse Exit Interviews:** Talking to former colleagues about strengths and fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:29:00">[27:29:00]</a>.
    *   **Broader Network:** Asking trusted friends and connections, "If you were in my shoes, how would you approach this?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:23:00">[25:23:00]</a>.
    *   **Recruiters:** Seeking advice from recruiters about their fit, building relationships over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:01:00">[28:01:00]</a>.
    The listening tour also creates a network of "listening posts"—people invested in your success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:31:00">[26:31:00]</a>.
3.  **Narrow, Clear Focus:** The goal is to develop a simple, narrow, and focused [[job_search_strategies_and_candidate_market_fit | Candidate Market Fit]] statement with three to four attributes (e.g., role, industry, company stage, culture) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:35:00">[33:35:00]</a>. This acts as a "spear, not a net," allowing others to be expansive from a narrow description, rather than reductive from a broad one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:02:00">[32:02:02]</a>.
    *   **Example:** A designer focused on companies needing to build or reboot a design team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:04:00">[34:04:00]</a>.
    *   **Adaptability:** The [[job_search_strategies_and_candidate_market_fit | Candidate Market Fit]] must be flexible and adaptive to changing market conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:00:00">[35:00:00]</a>.
    *   **Reality Check:** The market may indicate a need to adjust expectations, such as taking an Individual Contributor (IC) role instead of a VP role to gain experience in a new industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:05:00">[39:05:00]</a>. This can be hard but is often necessary for long-term [[career_development_and_progression_strategies | career progression]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:51:00">[41:51:00]</a>.

### Playing to Win: Job Mission with OKRs
Phil Terry encourages candidates to "play to win" in interviews and negotiations by taking charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:42:00">[49:42:00]</a>.

1.  **Create a Job Mission with OKRs:** Privately draft a job mission with Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) for the role being interviewed for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:55:00">[50:55:00]</a>. This helps develop interview questions and demonstrates initiative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:30:00">[51:31:00]</a>.
2.  **Share with Hiring Manager:** Present the draft job mission with OKRs to the hiring manager during a call or in-person meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:52:00">[51:52:00]</a>. This impresses hiring managers, as it shows candidates are already thinking about accountability and outcomes, often better than the company has <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:56:00">[52:56:00]</a>. It also clarifies the role, helping to prevent "job A turning into job B" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:23:00">[53:23:00]</a>.
3.  **Negotiate for Success:** When receiving an offer, engage in a "four legs of negotiation" conversation with the hiring manager, focusing on resources needed for success *before* discussing salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:45:00">[54:45:00]</a>. This includes:
    *   Budget for tech debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:30:00">[54:30:00]</a>.
    *   Team training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:51:00">[55:51:00]</a>.
    *   Hiring additional team members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:28:00">[56:28:00]</a>.
    *   Mentorship and professional development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:18:00">[56:18:00]</a>.
    This shows investment in succeeding, which benefits the company and often leads to better overall compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:12">[01:00:12]</a>. While salary negotiation can be intimidating, asking for more money results in getting it 87% of the time, though this figure can be lower in down markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:20">[01:00:20]</a>.

## The [[the_importance_of_asking_for_help_in_career_development | Importance of Asking for Help]]
[[the_importance_of_asking_for_help_in_career_development | Asking for help]] is a cornerstone of the job search council methodology and is crucial for [[career_development_and_advice | career development and advice]]. Phil Terry shares his personal experience of asking for help in high school when struggling with alcoholism, which was "transformative" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:07">[01:13:07]</a>.

### Counterintuitive Rules of Asking for Help
1.  **Sign of Confidence:** [[the_importance_of_asking_for_help_in_career_development | Asking for help]] is not a sign of weakness, but a sign of confidence that both requires and strengthens it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:04">[01:15:04]</a>.
2.  **Giving Activity:** When done well, asking for help is a giving activity because people feel valued and honored to provide their expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>.
3.  **Leads to Independence:** It makes you more independent, not less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:35">[01:16:35]</a>.
4.  **Improves Reputation:** It improves your reputation rather than hurting it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:40">[01:16:40]</a>. Leaders like Warren Buffett and Ken Chenault (former CEO of American Express) are examples of successful individuals who consistently [[the_importance_of_asking_for_help_in_career_development | ask for help]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:03">[01:18:03]</a>.

### How to Ask for Help Effectively
*   **Do Your Homework:** Don't ask someone to do the work for you; seek advice, support, and perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:42">[01:13:42]</a>.
*   **Be Thoughtful and Open:** Understand the relationship and build trust before being vulnerable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:07">[01:27:07]</a>.
*   **Be Honest:** Clearly state what you are asking for; don't hide your intentions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:58">[01:27:58]</a>.
*   **Use Specific Calls:**
    *   **Defining Reality:** Ask, "How do you see things?" to gain perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:50">[01:19:50]</a>.
    *   **First 90 Days Call:** When starting a new job, talk to people in similar roles about their experiences and mistakes to avoid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:25">[01:21:25]</a>.
    *   **Career Evolution Call:** To progress (e.g., from Director to VP), talk to those in the desired role for guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:33">[01:21:33]</a>.

## Overcoming Challenges in the Job Search
Anxiety and insecurity are universal in the job search due to the inherent instability of capitalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:49">[01:29:49]</a>. Councils help combat this by reminding individuals they are "not alone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:55">[01:29:55]</a>.

*   **Stay Active:** Do not become passive. Continuously network, update your [[job_search_strategies_and_candidate_market_fit | Candidate Market Fit]], and send monthly update notes to your network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:11">[01:44:11]</a>.
*   **"I" in Village:** While there's no "I" in team, there is an "I" in village, meaning individuals must be independent, accountable, and responsible for their search, even while seeking support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:07">[01:45:07]</a>.
*   **Combat Inner Critic:** Use exercises like the "Gratitude House" to remember all the people who have supported you, fostering confidence and reducing imposter syndrome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:33">[01:06:33]</a>. Debriefing interviews with others helps parse what truly happened versus self-criticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:22">[01:07:22]</a>.
*   **Address Ageism:** In a rapidly evolving tech landscape, remaining close to the "technology frontier" is essential to avoid getting stuck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:31">[01:42:31]</a>. This may involve taking a step back in seniority (e.g., from EVP to IC) to gain relevant experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:35">[01:42:35]</a>.

## Additional Resources and Initiatives
Phil Terry is involved in various initiatives that support [[career development and planning | career development and planning]] and learning:

*   **Product Councils:** Paid programs for senior product leaders (VPs, CPOs) and associate councils for ICs and new managers, focusing on mutual support and learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:53">[01:32:53]</a>.
*   **Reading Odyssey:** A partnership with Harvard and Cambridge for lifelong learning through reading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:16">[01:34:16]</a>.
*   **World Business Reading Group:** A pro bono program for high school students focused on business literacy through reading and guided by senior executives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:31">[01:34:31]</a>.
*   **Slow Art Day:** An initiative in over 1,500 museums worldwide that teaches people to slow down and look at art, fostering visual literacy, empathy, and design thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:16">[01:37:16]</a>.
*   **Mentorship:** Terry emphasizes the importance of developing "dead or distant mentors" (e.g., studying historical figures like Steve Jobs or Warren Buffett) to deeply inform decisions and actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:26">[01:35:26]</a>.

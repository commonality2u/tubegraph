Anuka Gupta, Chief Product Officer at Rubrik and lecturer on product management at Stanford University's Graduate School of Business, emphasizes the importance of [[Maximizing human potential | managing energy]] over merely [[Effective Time Management for Product Managers | managing time]] for sustained success and well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

## The Core Principle: Energy Over Time

Gupta highlights that true productivity and resilience, especially during difficult times, stem from the amount of emotional and mental energy one can bring to solving a problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. Her approach centers on [[Creating a structured and productive work schedule | architecting her day and time to maximize her energy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. This allows her to bring her full self to work and navigate challenging situations, fostering an "abundant mindset" rather than operating from a place of scarcity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

## Tactical Tips for Managing Energy

Gupta shares several [[Tactics for improving focus and productivity | practical tactics]] for optimizing energy levels throughout the day:

*   **Prioritize meals** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>: Skipping lunch, even for a protein bar, can significantly decrease energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.
*   **Schedule demanding tasks strategically** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>: Understand your personal energy fluctuations. For instance, Gupta avoids scheduling difficult meetings or strategy writing between 5:00 PM and 6:00 PM, recognizing it as her lowest energy period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. This self-awareness ensures that critical work is done when energy levels are at their peak, making tasks less difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

By effectively managing her energy levels and scheduling her time around these, Gupta is better able to approach all situations with an abundant mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

### Connecting to Mindset

This strategy directly ties into Gupta's broader philosophy of bringing a positive mindset to work, even in challenging circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:38">[01:01:38]</a>. Whether dealing with difficult personalities or hard feedback, maintaining an abundant mindset allows for learning and growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:59">[00:39:59]</a>. As she puts it, "If you are approaching every situation as much as possible with a positive mindset, you can do more than you could ever possibly hope to achieve" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:46">[01:01:46]</a>.

To cultivate this mindset, Gupta recommends:
*   **Journaling**: Writing down thoughts, especially negative ones, helps to explore feelings, identify triggers, and understand the "why" behind strong emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:19">[01:02:19]</a>. This process externalizes abstract ruminations, allowing for a clearer assessment of what is irrational versus what requires action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:56">[01:02:56]</a>.
*   **Self-reflection**: Consistently asking what can be learned from a situation, even a frustrating one, can shift perspective and foster gratitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:21">[00:39:21]</a>. This introspective practice is akin to doing cognitive behavioral therapy on oneself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:10">[01:04:10]</a>.

By focusing on energy management and cultivating a positive, learning-oriented mindset, individuals can enhance their effectiveness and resilience in both professional and personal spheres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.

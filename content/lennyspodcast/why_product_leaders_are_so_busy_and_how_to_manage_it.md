Product leaders often find themselves overwhelmingly busy, leading to stress, dissatisfaction, and a feeling that there's always work left undone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. This constant state of busyness can manifest as physical ailments and dissatisfaction, even when performing well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

## The Problem: Growing Scope and Ineffective Strategies

Many [[tips_for_new_and_senior_product_managers | tips for new and senior product managers]] related to [[effective_time_management_for_product_managers | managing your time]] or improving efficiency—such as maintaining a to-do list, using frameworks like LNO, or managing calendars—are commonly known but often fall short for senior product professionals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

The fundamental issue is that as a product professional's [[career_development_for_product_owners_and_managers | career development]] progresses, their scope naturally grows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. Eventually, this scope becomes so immense that no amount of efficiency, prioritization, or tool usage can prevent a feeling of being constantly overwhelmed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

### Annual Planning: A Major Time Sink

A significant contributor to this busyness is annual planning, which often consumes two to three months for high-level managers and [[role_of_product_leaders | product leaders]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. This process involves numerous spreadsheets, meetings, managing dependencies, setting priorities, and engaging with stakeholders, leaving little time for other crucial responsibilities like supporting teams or making critical product decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.

Despite the extensive effort, these plans often become irrelevant within weeks due to customer escalations or unforeseen changes, requiring constant revisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>. The common adage "plans are useless but planning is everything" is frequently invoked, but it often lacks practical meaning in addressing the time drain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>.

### Poor Product Decisions Lead to More Work

Another critical reason for constant busyness stems from making suboptimal product decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>. Product teams often prioritize features based on superficial factors like an engineer's availability, rather than clearly thinking through customer motivation, differentiation, or distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>.

Many decisions are hastily made under the guise of being "two-way doors"—easy to reverse—a concept often misapplied from high-level leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>. In reality, for a [[role_of_product_managers | product manager]], most seemingly "two-way doors" are effectively one-way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>. Committing to a feature, even a small one, can lead to weeks of development and launch, followed by pressure to show results at quarterly business reviews (QBRs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:33">[00:20:33]</a>. When adoption is low, it leads to justifying the feature with favorable anecdotes and, inevitably, a demand for more "bells and whistles" to meet "table stakes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a>. This cycle results in signing up for more work on features that perhaps should not have been built, accumulating "debt" and increasing busyness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>.

## Strategies for Managing Busyness and Frustration

### 1. Develop a Real Product Strategy

Instead of relying solely on efficiency hacks, focus on having a *real* product strategy that everyone is aligned with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>. A robust strategy can dramatically reduce the time spent on annual planning—from weeks to mere days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>. This alignment simplifies prioritization, makes resource allocation clearer, and provides a rigorous framework to handle customer escalations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>.

### 2. Pause and Think Before Deciding

Resist the urge to make quick decisions, especially when something is presented as a "two-way door." Most decisions, particularly for individual contributors or mid-level leaders, have long-term consequences that are hard to undo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>. Taking a few minutes, days, or even weeks to deeply consider customer motivation, differentiation, and distribution before committing to a feature can save immense time and effort down the line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:52">[00:23:52]</a>. Thinking is cheap; building and unbuilding is expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:37">[00:31:37]</a>.

### 3. Cultivate "Good Taste" Beyond Aesthetics

"Good taste" in product management extends beyond beautiful design or user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:30">[00:29:30]</a>. It's about discerning what is truly valuable and good *before* results are apparent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:41">[00:31:41]</a>. This involves:
*   **Challenging deeply held beliefs:** Questioning assumptions, even those from respected sources or successful companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:36">[00:26:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:05">[00:30:05]</a>.
*   **Separating ideas from catchy metaphors or authority bias:** Don't be swayed by alliterations (e.g., "fail fast" vs. "fail quickly") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:04">[00:35:04]</a> or because a prominent figure said it (e.g., Bezos's "two-way door" concept) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:49">[00:34:49]</a>.
*   **Rigorous critical thinking:** Evaluate ideas independent of social proof or complicated, poorly understood charts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:11">[00:36:11]</a>. This helps shed ingrained patterns and make more sound judgments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:31">[00:36:31]</a>.

### 4. Align Work with Your Superpowers to Reduce Frustration

The [[challenges_and_opportunities_of_being_a_product_manager | challenges and opportunities of being a product manager]] can be [[challenges_and_strategies_in_product_management | frustrating]] when constantly working against your innate strengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:20">[00:38:20]</a>. Product work occurs at three levels:
*   **Impact:** Focusing on strategic outcomes.
*   **Execution:** Managing day-to-day tasks and delivery.
*   **Optics:** Managing perceptions, stakeholders, and external communication.

Identifying your preferred level of operation—your "superpower"—is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:10">[00:40:10]</a>. As [[role_of_product_leaders | product leaders]] climb the corporate ladder, they often spend more time on "Optics" work, which can be draining if it's not their happy place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:50">[00:40:50]</a>. To avoid this [[common_challenges_faced_by_product_teams_and_how_to_overcome_them | common challenges faced by product teams and how to overcome them]], make career decisions that align with your natural strengths and interests, rather than purely external expectations or "LinkedIn envy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:43">[00:42:43]</a>. This ensures greater job satisfaction, higher quality work, and reduced frustration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:07">[00:43:07]</a>.

### 5. Cultivate Deeper Listening Skills

Finally, constantly ask yourself: "Am I really listening?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:42">[00:43:42]</a> True, world-class listening goes beyond simply hearing, recapping, and maintaining eye contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:48">[00:43:48]</a>. There is a deeper level of listening that is essential for effective leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:03">[00:44:03]</a>. For those seeking to develop this skill, insights from figures like Rick Rubin, Dee Hock, and Peter Drucker are valuable resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:27">[00:44:27]</a>.

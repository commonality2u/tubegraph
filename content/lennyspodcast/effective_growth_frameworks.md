Elena Verna, an expert in B2B growth, highlights several [[growth_frameworks_and_strategies|growth frameworks]] that provide a structured approach to thinking about and achieving growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:02">[02:02:02]</a>. A framework is not a solution itself, but rather a pattern that exists across many companies, serving as a starting point for ideation and a shortcut to potential solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:35">[01:15:35]</a>.

## Recommended Growth Frameworks

### 1. Growth Loops
Thinking in terms of [[growth_loops|growth Loops]] is crucial for creating a sustainable growth engine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:11">[01:16:11]</a>. This framework emphasizes an action-reaction cycle that generates another action, forming a self-contained flywheel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:19">[01:16:19]</a>. Resources from Reforge, Brian Balfour, Casey Winters, and Andrew Chen are highly recommended for understanding [[growth_loops|Growth Loops]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:27">[01:16:27]</a>.

### 2. Race Car Framework
Developed by Lenny Rachitsky and Dan Hockenheim, the Race Car framework helps in organizing different growth initiatives, distinguishing between long-term and short-term efforts, and understanding their potential impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:33">[01:16:33]</a>. It categorizes initiatives into:
*   **Engines (Loops)**: Components that continuously spin and generate growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:03">[01:17:03]</a>.
*   **Fuel**: Necessary inputs, such as paid marketing dollars, that power the engine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:06">[01:17:06]</a>.
*   **Turbo Boosts**: Temporary accelerators, like large user conferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:11">[01:17:11]</a>.
*   **Lubrications and Optimizations**: Essential maintenance, like oil for an engine, to ensure correct performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:20">[01:17:20]</a>.

### 3. Adjacent User Theory
Originating from Rahul Vohra's work, Adjacent User Theory is powerful for considering [[growth_frameworks_and_strategies|growth evolution]] and expanding a product's reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:34">[01:17:34]</a>. This involves identifying and bringing in users who are outside of the product's ideal customer profile (ICP) or core user base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:48">[01:17:48]</a>. By optimizing their experiences, a growth team can significantly add value to the product without necessarily expanding the core product-market fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:56">[01:17:56]</a>.

These frameworks serve as fundamental mental models for strategizing and executing growth, offering a structured approach to tackling growth challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:17">[01:18:17]</a>.

The current [[the_impact_of_ai_on_business_and_technology | AI models]] are the "worst AI model you will ever use for the rest of your life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This highlights the unprecedented and accelerating pace of [[the_impact_of_ai_on_business_and_technology | AI]] development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Every two months, computers can perform tasks they were previously unable to do, necessitating a complete re-evaluation of current practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## The Rapid Evolution of AI Technology

Unlike traditional technology, where improvements are incremental, [[the_impact_of_ai_on_business_and_technology | AI]] is advancing at an exponential rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>. The general mindset is that a better model will emerge in two months, blowing away current limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. This constant improvement means that products built on the edge of current model capabilities will "sing" within a few months as models improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:05">[00:32:05]</a>. This rapid change is leading to intense competition, ultimately benefiting consumers, developers, and businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:14">[00:34:14]</a>.

## Opportunities for Startups in the AI Ecosystem

OpenAI, despite its ambition, recognizes that it cannot address every use case for [[the_impact_of_ai_on_musthave_skills_and_startup_strategies | AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:42">[00:25:42]</a>. The company is heavily focused on building a robust API, which currently serves 3 million developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:28">[00:25:28]</a>. This strategy acknowledges that there are far more smart people outside its walls than inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>.

Immense opportunities exist in every industry and vertical to build [[ais_impact_on_product_development_and_startups | AI-based products]] that improve the state-of-the-art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:04">[00:26:04]</a>. Many use cases will involve industry-specific, use-case-specific, or company-specific data that is not publicly available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:56">[00:25:56]</a>. This makes fine-tuning models with proprietary data crucial for optimal performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:05">[00:58:05]</a>.

## How AI is Changing Product Development

### The Importance of Evals

A core skill for product builders in the [[ai_in_product_management_and_implications_for_startups | AI era]] is "writing evals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:08">[02:14:08]</a>. Evals (evaluations) are like quizzes or tests for a model, gauging its knowledge or capability in specific areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:57">[01:59:57]</a>. They serve as benchmarks to understand how smart or capable a model is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:04">[02:02:04]</a>.

The performance percentage of a model (e.g., 60%, 95%, 99.5% accuracy) dictates how a product must be built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:21">[02:20:21]</a>. Evals are not static; they are part of a continuous learning process to fine-tune models for specific use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:12">[02:12:12]</a>. For example, during the development of OpenAI's deep research product, evals were designed simultaneously to measure and improve the model's ability to answer complex queries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:09">[02:44:09]</a>.

AI's potential is "capped" by how good humans are at creating these evals, as models need specific data and fine-tuning to excel in particular domains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:52">[02:38:52]</a>.

### The Role of Research and Product Teams

OpenAI has evolved from a pure research company to a product company, requiring deep collaboration between research and product teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:07">[00:46:07]</a>. The best products emerge from iterative feedback, where product and design teams work directly with research to understand problems, build evals, gather data, and fine-tune models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:19">[00:47:19]</a>.

The future of [[integration_of_ai_in_business_and_product_development | product teams]] will likely include "quasi researcher" or machine learning engineer types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:39">[00:58:39]</a>. Fine-tuning models will become a core part of the workflow for building most products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:46">[00:58:46]</a>. This often involves breaking down complex problems into more specific tasks and using ensembles of specialized, fine-tuned models of different sizes and custom prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:01">[01:00:01]</a>.

### Agile Development and "Model Maximalism"

Given the rapid technological changes, traditional long-term roadmaps are often useless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:12">[00:27:12]</a>. Planning remains helpful for alignment and managing dependencies, but the expectation is to be "super agile" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:30">[00:27:30]</a>.

A key philosophy is "iterative deployment," where products are shipped early and often, even without knowing the full capabilities of the models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:44">[00:30:44]</a>. This allows for co-evolution with society, learning about the models' strengths and weaknesses in public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>. This is coupled with "model maximalism": an understanding that models are not perfect, but building extensive scaffolding around current limitations is often unnecessary because a better model will likely emerge soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:46">[00:31:46]</a>.

### Vibe Coding and Prototyping

"Vibe coding," a term coined by Andrej Karpathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:44">[00:55:44]</a>, describes leveraging [[the_impact_of_ai_on_business_and_technology | AI]] tools like Cursor, Windswept, and GitHub Copilot to rapidly generate and refine code. Instead of meticulously typing, developers can accept AI suggestions, treating errors as prompts for further AI assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:20">[00:56:20]</a>. This approach is highly effective for proofs of concept and demos, allowing product teams to quickly explore ideas by creating prototypes instead of just Figma designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:57">[00:54:57]</a>.

## Skills for the AI Era and Future Outlook

While predicting the future is difficult, certain skills will remain critical. Encouraging curiosity, independence, and self-confidence in children will equip them for any future configuration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:40">[01:05:40]</a>.

AI is poised to bring significant societal advancements. Personalized tutoring, for example, could offer multiple standard deviation improvements in learning speed and is accessible through free tools like ChatGPT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:05">[01:07:05]</a>. This could profoundly impact education globally, especially for those without access to traditional schooling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:52">[01:07:52]</a>.

!> Optimistic Outlook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:28">[01:08:28]</a>
Technology has historically driven economic, geopolitical, quality-of-life, and longevity advancements. While there may be temporary dislocations and impacts on individuals, the long-term outlook for [[the_impact_of_ai_on_business_and_technology | AI's impact]] is overwhelmingly positive. AI can also serve as a powerful reskilling tool, enabling people to learn new skills rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:35">[01:09:35]</a>.

In creative fields, [[the_impact_of_ai_on_business_and_technology | AI]] will amplify human ingenuity. Tools like Sora allow users to generate complex visuals, democratizing artistic creation and enabling more extensive creative exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:30">[01:12:30]</a>. Instead of replacing creators, AI will help them explore more options and achieve better final results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:20">[01:13:20]</a>.

The increasing pace of model development, combined with decreasing costs and improved safety, suggests a future profoundly different from today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:42">[01:15:42]</a>. Just as Moore's law described a doubling of transistors every 18 months, [[the_impact_of_ai_on_business_and_technology | AI]] capabilities are seeing 10x improvements annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:41">[01:16:41]</a>. This means that "the [[the_impact_of_ai_on_business_and_technology | AI]] models that you're using today is the worst [[the_impact_of_ai_on_business_and_technology | AI]] model you will ever use for the rest of your life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:59">[01:16:59]</a>.

Jessica Lax, VP of Analytics and Data Science at DoorDash, emphasizes that analytics should be a business impact-driving function, not merely a service function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. The goal of an analytics team is not just to answer "why" but also "what do we do now that we know this?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. This requires a deep level of [[collaborative_dynamics_between_product_and_sales_teams | collaboration]] and integration with other business units.

## Organizational Structure: Centralized vs. Embedded

Jessica Lax holds a "contrarian perspective" on data team structure, strongly advocating for a centralized model over embedded analytics within business units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. While some argue for embedded models to foster ownership and allow business leaders more control over roadmaps, Lax believes a centralized "Center of Excellence" is superior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

At DoorDash, the analytics team operates with a centralized reporting structure, but its members are divided into "pods" that align perfectly with product, engineering, operations, and marketing teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. This means data scientists are "de facto embedded" with their partner teams, fostering a sense of shared purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. Crucially, the analytics team shares the same goals as its partner teams, aligning incentives and ensuring focus on the most important work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.

### Benefits of a Centralized Data Organization
A centralized model for data teams offers several advantages:
*   **Consistent and High Talent Bar** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>: Ensures uniform evaluation criteria for technical and soft skills, leading to higher quality hires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.
*   **Growth Opportunities** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>: Prevents siloing by allowing team members to explore diverse problem areas and access various promotion or management roles within the broader analytics organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.
*   **Consistency of Methodologies and Metrics** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>: Prevents different teams from defining the same metrics differently, ensuring everyone uses consistent data and methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. It also allows for collaborative improvement of methodologies and prevents redundant work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>. This consistency helps the team scale by identifying common problems across the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.
*   **Strong Team Culture and Brand** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>: Fosters a unique culture of learning and sharing, where team members can support each other and peer-review work. This helps attract and retain top talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>.

## Fostering Proactivity and Strategic Partnerships

DoorDash's analytics team is expected to be proactive, identify opportunities, and bring insights to the table rather than just fulfilling requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. They serve as "thought partners" with their counterparts in product, engineering, and operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.

### Carving Out Time for Exploratory Work
It is critical to intentionally carve out time for exploratory work and deep dives, as ad-hoc requests can easily consume all available time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>.
*   **Goal Setting** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>: Set team goals specifically around finding insights through self-directed work to ensure accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>.
*   **Hackathons** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:49">[00:16:49]</a>: Dedicated hackathons allow the team to focus on interesting problems and uncover significant opportunities. For example, a hackathon deep dive into referral acquisition uncovered widespread fraudulent behavior, leading to better fraud checks and referral caps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>.

### Managing Requests and Communicating Trade-offs
Data professionals often struggle with pushing back on immediate, smaller requests to prioritize more impactful, long-term work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:06">[00:37:06]</a>.
*   **Shared Goals** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:09">[00:37:09]</a>: Having the same goals as business partners makes it easier to discuss priorities, asking, "What are the most important things we are going to work on this week or this month in order for both of us to hit our goals?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:32">[00:21:32]</a>.
*   **Communicate Trade-offs** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>: Instead of just saying "no," explain what other planned work would need to be dropped to accommodate a new request <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:26">[00:22:26]</a>. This helps partners understand the impact of their requests.
*   **Build Goodwill** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>: Occasionally fulfilling a quick, minor request can build goodwill, which is valuable for future collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">[00:23:54]</a>.
*   **Prove Value** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>: Consistently delivering significant opportunities through strategic work reinforces the value of long-term investments of time.

## [[Importance of trust and collaboration in team environments | Extreme Ownership]] and Customer Focus

A core cultural trait at DoorDash is "extreme ownership" over outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:20">[00:41:20]</a>. This means team members are encouraged to go beyond their defined roles to solve problems.
*   **Beyond the Job Description** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:50">[00:41:50]</a>: Data scientists, for example, are expected to "figure out what's happening" even if it means picking up the phone and calling customers directly to gather qualitative insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:40">[00:42:40]</a>. This adaptability and willingness to step outside traditional boundaries is encouraged and celebrated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:51">[00:43:51]</a>.
*   **WeDash Program** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:31">[00:38:31]</a>: All DoorDash employees, including the analytics team, participate in the "WeDash" program four times a year. This involves going out and delivering orders or performing customer support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:41">[00:38:41]</a>. This program builds empathy with customers, Dashers, and merchants, provides direct product feedback, and helps identify bugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:09">[00:39:09]</a>.

## Defining and Aligning Metrics

Jessica Lax emphasizes the importance of defining the right metrics to align incentives and drive desired outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>.
*   **Short-Term Proxy for Long-Term Output** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:51">[00:44:51]</a>: Instead of focusing on long-term, hard-to-move metrics like retention, identify and goal on short-term "inputs" or "proxy metrics" that are known to drive that long-term outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:17">[00:45:17]</a>. Experimentation then validates if these inputs indeed move the desired output.
*   **Keep Metrics Simple** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:33">[00:45:33]</a>: Avoid overly complex, composite metrics with coefficients that no one truly understands. Simple, intuitive metrics, even if not "perfect," are more effective for driving real outcomes because people can grasp them and discuss them across the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:07">[00:46:07]</a>.
*   **Common Currency for Trade-offs** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:40">[00:46:40]</a>: Quantify the impact of different initiatives or levers in terms of a common business currency (e.g., Gross Order Value or volume for DoorDash) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:49">[00:46:49]</a>. This allows teams to make informed trade-offs between different investments, like lowering prices versus improving delivery times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:07">[00:47:07]</a>. This is particularly crucial in multi-sided marketplaces with many interdependent variables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:20">[00:50:20]</a>.
*   **Focus on Edge Cases and Fail States** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:09">[00:56:09]</a>: While averages are important, it's crucial to identify and set concrete goals around eliminating rare but severely negative "fail states" or "disaster deliveries" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:42">[00:56:42]</a>. Even if infrequent, these can lead to significant churn and high costs. Sometimes, the data itself might not fully capture these issues (e.g., login errors mean users aren't in the system to begin with) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:26">[00:59:26]</a>.

## Hiring for Collaboration and Impact

Beyond technical skills, Jessica Lax looks for specific traits when hiring for her team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a>.
*   **Curiosity and Self-Motivation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:51">[00:24:51]</a>: The ability to pull on threads, dig deeper when something seems "off," and proactively investigate without being told <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:03">[00:25:03]</a>. This can be tested by presenting a case with subtle inconsistencies to see if candidates notice or how they react when pointed out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:44">[00:25:44]</a>.
*   **Handling Ambiguity and Making Decisions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:40">[00:27:40]</a>: During business case interviews, observe how candidates handle incomplete information, respond to being corrected, and if they can still make a decision even when unsure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:20">[00:28:20]</a>.
*   **Diverse Backgrounds** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:03">[01:06:03]</a>: Lax, with her own non-traditional background in finance and operations, values bringing people onto the analytics team who have acquired skills on the job from partner teams (e.g., engineering, operations, marketing, finance) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:43">[01:06:43]</a>. This creates a [[importance_of_trust_and_collaboration_in_team_environments | unique environment]] where different expertise leads to mutual learning and a broader perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:09">[01:07:09]</a>. Diversity in prior company stage (startups vs. large organizations) is also valued for insights into both hustle and scalability challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:04">[01:08:04]</a>.

## Leveraging AI for Efficiency

DoorDash is exploring AI to make the analytics team more productive and empower non-technical users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:07">[01:03:07]</a>. They are building tools, such as "Ask Data AI" (a chatbot for their internal Slack channel "Ask Data"), that allow users to get help with SQL queries or adjust existing queries for different business contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:05">[01:04:05]</a>. This reduces the burden on the analytics team and enables more self-service data exploration across the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:36">[01:04:36]</a>.

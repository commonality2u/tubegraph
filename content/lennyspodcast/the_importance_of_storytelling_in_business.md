In the business world, the word "storytelling" is a significant buzzword, with many aspiring to be storytellers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, truly embracing the role of a storyteller means distinguishing oneself from the norm, a risk many are hesitant to take, fearing being "picked off" like a lone animal from a herd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The alternative, however, is to remain part of the "herd," which inevitably leads to being forgotten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

Our minds are not designed to remember abstract facts, statistics, or platitudes unless they are attached to imagery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. The ultimate risk of not telling stories in business is being forgotten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. As Matthew Dicks, author of *Storyworthy*, highlights, "Most communication in business is round, white, and flavorless," often intentionally so, as people fear standing out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## Core Principles of Effective Storytelling

Matthew Dicks, a 59-time Moth StorySlam winner and nine-time GrandSlam champ, teaches [[storytelling_as_a_critical_skill_for_product_managers | storytelling]] and public speaking to individuals and teams at companies like Slack, Amazon, Lego, and Salesforce through his company Speak Up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>. He emphasizes several key principles for effective storytelling:

### The "Five-Second Moment"

Every good story is rooted in a singular, transformative "5-second moment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. This moment can be one of:
*   **Transformation:** Where a person changes from one kind of person to a new one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.
*   **Realization:** Where someone used to think one thing, and now thinks a new thing after events unfold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

These changes are often an accumulation of events, feelings, and thoughts that culminate in a single "flip" moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. The purpose of a story is to bring this moment to maximum clarity for the audience, allowing them to experience the transformation or realization alongside the storyteller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. This singular moment informs how the story will end and, by extension, how it will begin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. This focus on change gives stories universal appeal, enabling connection even if the content itself isn't directly relevant to the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>.

### The "Dinner Test"

A good story should be a slightly elevated version of what one would tell at a dinner party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>. It should avoid "performance art" elements like unattributed dialogue or starting with a sound effect, as these are not natural ways people speak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>. The goal is to speak in a very natural way, free of verbal detritus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>.

### Personal Connection

Stories should always be *your* story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>. Telling a story on behalf of someone else makes it feel like fiction, as the audience cannot connect with someone not present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>. [[telling_personal_and_transformative_stories | Storytelling]] requires vulnerability, sharing a part of one's heart and mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>. Even when telling stories about others, the narrative should be centered on how their experience informed or changed *your* own life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>.

For business professionals, this means strategically weaving in personal details to connect with the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:50">[00:44:50]</a>. A "personal interest inventory" can help identify relatable aspects of one's life (e.g., being married, hobbies) that resonate with diverse audiences, creating intense connections even if the total addressable market for that specific detail is small <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:06">[00:45:06]</a>. The goal is to be a memorable individual, full of color and edge, rather than being "round, white, and flavorless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:46">[00:46:46]</a>.

### Stakes

Stakes are what the audience should be worried about, wondering about, or hoping for the storyteller, company, or product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:34">[00:23:34]</a>. Assuming the audience wants to listen is a misconception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>. Stakes keep the audience constantly wondering what comes next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:14">[00:24:14]</a>.

Techniques to build stakes:
*   **Elephant:** Plant a big, worrying thing at the beginning to immediately signal stakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:24">[00:25:24]</a>.
*   **Backpack:** Tell the audience your plan so they carry your hopes and dreams with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:22">[00:26:22]</a>.
*   **Breadcrumbs:** Offer hints of what's going on without revealing the full idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>.
*   **Hourglass:** Slow down time at moments of high tension to keep the audience on the edge of their seat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:19">[00:27:19]</a>.
*   **Crystal Ball:** Predict a future (even a terrible or false one) to make the audience worry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:48">[00:27:48]</a>.
*   **Continuous Stakes:** Don't front-load all stakes; continue to introduce new stakes throughout the story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:49">[00:31:49]</a>.

### Surprise

Surprise is a "beautiful, delightful, amazing moment" where the audience didn't see something coming, but once it happens, it feels inevitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:11">[00:29:11]</a>. This requires placing enough information earlier in the story for the surprise to land inevitably, yet cleverly hiding it so it's not anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:32">[00:29:32]</a>.

### Humor

[[the_importance_of_communication_in_product_management | Daring to be funny]] is a powerful way to differentiate oneself in business, where many are unwilling to take the risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:16">[00:50:16]</a>.
*   **Nostalgia:** The past can be inherently funny, especially when presenting a new product or service by contrasting it with outdated methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:27">[00:53:27]</a>.
*   **"One of These Things is Not Like the Other":** Present three things, two expected and one unexpected, with the unexpected one being the source of humor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:54">[00:56:54]</a>.

## Practical Applications in Business

Storytelling translates directly into business success:

*   **Leadership Communication:** A factory owner, Boris, used a personal story about his son striking out in a baseball game to teach his sales team to move past failure quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:21">[00:38:21]</a>. This personal anecdote was more effective than a direct command, as it made Boris relatable and provided a tangible vision for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:47">[00:40:47]</a>.
*   **Product/Company Narratives:** The director of corporate communications at Slack used a personal anecdote (two glasses of wine, feeling lonely during the pandemic) at the beginning of a presentation about Slack's narrative against Microsoft Teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:42">[00:42:42]</a>. This 30-second personal detail transformed the audience's connection, making her an actual human being rather than a "corporate monolith" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:40">[00:43:40]</a>.
*   **Sales and Marketing:** A biotech scientist telling a story about buying different types of apples for his family, rather than presenting data, generated more leads at a conference than his four colleagues combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:49">[00:59:49]</a>. The story helped customers connect emotionally and remember the company in a positive way, even associating it with everyday experiences like grocery shopping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:29">[01:01:29]</a>. This is an example of "speaking with adjacency," matching story content by theme, meaning, or message rather than direct content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:25">[01:03:25]</a>.

### Homework for Life

Matthew Dicks recommends a practice called "Homework for Life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>. This involves looking back on each day and identifying one moment worth telling as a story, then recording it in an Excel spreadsheet (date and a brief description) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:35">[01:07:35]</a>. This practice helps:
*   **Develop a storytelling lens:** Training the mind to recognize potential stories in everyday life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:34">[01:08:34]</a>.
*   **Combat forgettability:** Prevents days from being lost and unremembered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:17">[01:09:17]</a>.
*   **Recover memories:** Triggers forgotten stories from the past, as new observations connect to old experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:41">[01:10:41]</a>.
*   **Identify patterns:** Helps one see recurring themes or behaviors in their life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:08">[01:12:08]</a>.
*   **Therapeutic benefits:** Slows down time, provides a sense of self-reflection, and helps process experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:37">[01:11:37]</a>.

Ideally, moments should be recorded throughout the day rather than just at night to capture details before they are forgotten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:03">[01:18:03]</a>.

### Overcoming Public Speaking Nerves

Public speaking nerves are common, but 98% of nervousness occurs *before* speaking; once the talk begins, the nerves often dissipate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:01">[01:20:01]</a>. To prepare and reduce nerves:
*   **Accept initial nervousness:** Understand it's normal, and almost everyone experiences it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:01">[01:21:01]</a>.
*   **Record and listen:** Record your talk and listen to it passively (e.g., while doing chores) to let it "seep into your soul" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:23">[01:22:23]</a>.
*   **Focus on transitions:** Most people forget transitions, not the content itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:15">[01:23:15]</a>. Practice the flow between sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:02">[01:24:02]</a>.
*   **Avoid memorization:** Memorizing can lead to suffering if a word is forgotten; instead, aim to remember the structure and key points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:31">[01:24:31]</a>.

### The Power of "Yes"

Saying "yes" to opportunities, even those that seem crazy or undesirable, can lead to extraordinary outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:29">[01:25:29]</a>. Refusing an opportunity often stems from presumptuousness or fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:54">[01:26:54]</a>. A "yes" can always become a "no" later, but stepping through the door and exploring new paths can reveal unforeseen benefits and connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:38">[01:27:38]</a>. The things that scare us are often the things that are best for us <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:05">[01:29:05]</a>.

### Starting a Story Effectively

To immediately engage an audience, start every story with two elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:17">[01:38:17]</a>:
*   **Location:** Clearly state where the story is taking place, as location activates imagination and imbues the scene with details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:23">[01:38:23]</a>.
*   **Action:** Immediately describe something happening. This signals to the audience that a story is beginning and captures their attention, much like a movie beginning with an action scene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:01">[01:39:01]</a>. This technique can also help marginalized groups gain space and attention, as it signals a shift to a storytelling mode where listeners tend to quiet down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:44">[01:39:44]</a>.

By applying these [[the_role_of_storytelling_and_movements_in_startup_success | storytelling]] principles, individuals and companies can become more memorable, connect deeply with their audiences, and achieve their business objectives more effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:48">[01:01:48]</a>.

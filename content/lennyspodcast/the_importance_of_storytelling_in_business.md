In the business world, the term [[the_importance_of_storytelling_in_presentations | storytelling]] has become a significant buzzword, with many professionals aspiring to be [[the_importance_of_storytelling_in_presentations | storytellers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, truly embracing the role of a Storyteller requires separating oneself from the "herd," a risk many are hesitant to take, fearing they might be "picked off" by competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. The alternative, however, is being forgettable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

As Matthew Dicks, author of *Storyworthy*, explains, our minds are not designed to remember pie charts, facts, statistics, or platitudes that are not attached to imagery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. If businesses don't speak in story, they risk being 100% forgotten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Dicks, a 59-time Moth Story Slam winner and nine-time Grand Slam champion, applies his extensive experience in [[public_speaking_tips_for_storytellers | storytelling]] and teaching to advise individuals and companies like Slack, Amazon, Lego, and Salesforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

## Core Principles of Effective Storytelling

### The 5-Second Moment: Transformation or Realization

Every effective story is rooted in a singular "5-second moment" of transformation or realization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
*   **Transformation** occurs when a person changes from one kind of person to another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.
*   **Realization** is when someone used to think one thing, and then, after certain events, they think a new thing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

These changes are often an accumulation of events, feelings, and thoughts that culminate in a single "flip" moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. The purpose of a story is to bring this moment to maximum clarity for the audience, allowing them to experience the transformation or realization alongside the storyteller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.

For instance, Dicks shares a story about a student named Eileen who initially lacked confidence in math <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. The 5-second moment was when Eileen, having grown in confidence, jokingly quipped back at him, indicating she trusted him and felt comfortable enough to be herself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. This moment revealed her newfound confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

This principle applies broadly, even to movies like *Star Wars*, which is essentially a story about Luke Skywalker's transformation from relying on technology to embracing the Force, a religion he initially didn't believe in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

Knowing this pivotal moment of change also helps the [[techniques_for_better_storytelling | storyteller]] understand how the story will end, which in turn informs how it should begin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. Stories essentially operate between two opposing moments in time: a beginning and an end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. Starting from the known end ensures the story conveys something of importance, rather than just chronologically reporting events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.

### What Makes a Good Story: A Checklist

Dicks outlines a three-point checklist for a good story:
1.  **A Change Happens**: As discussed, a core element is a moment of transformation or realization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. This element creates universal appeal, allowing audiences to connect to the story's emotional core even if the specific content isn't directly related to their lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>.
2.  **The "Dinner Test"**: A story told formally should be similar to one told over dinner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>. This means avoiding "performance art" elements like unattributed dialogue or starting with a sound effect, which feel unnatural in regular conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>. It should be a slightly elevated, natural conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>.
3.  **It's Your Story**: Stories must be about the storyteller in some way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>. Telling someone else's story feels like fiction to the audience and prevents the storyteller from expressing vulnerability, which is a key part of connecting with the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:27">[00:18:27]</a>. If a story is about someone else, find a way to center it on how that experience impacted *you* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>.

> "If you're telling a story about someone else essentially you might as well be tell fiction because that person's not in the room and to the audience they don't really exist unless they're you know if they can't see them that person is just another human being who supposedly lives somewhere in the world or once lived in the world and because of that you are almost unable to express any vulnerability in your story" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>

This principle extends to vacation stories: only tell them if they contain a 5-second moment of fundamental change for you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a>, and focus only on that moment, omitting irrelevant details like the location unless paramount to the story's core <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:18">[00:21:18]</a>. The shortest version of every story is often the best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>.

### The Role of Stakes and Surprise

**Stakes** are what the audience should be worried about or wondering about; if the audience isn't constantly wondering what will happen next, they're no longer listening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:34">[00:23:34]</a>. Four ways to keep people listening:
1.  **Stakes**:
    *   **Elephant**: Introduce a big, immediate problem or situation at the beginning to grab attention and establish stakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:24">[00:25:24]</a>.
    *   **Backpack**: Share your plan or hopes before executing it, so the audience carries your hopes and fears with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:22">[00:26:22]</a>.
    *   **Breadcrumbs**: Drop hints or partial information along the way to build anticipation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>.
    *   **Hourglass**: When the audience is on the edge of their seat, slow time down and add details to prolong the suspense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:21">[00:27:21]</a>.
    *   **Crystal Ball**: Predict a possible (even if not accurate) terrible future to make the audience worried <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:48">[00:27:48]</a>.
    These techniques help build stakes throughout the story, rather than front-loading them all at once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:45">[00:31:45]</a>.
2.  **Surprise**: A delightful moment where the audience didn't see something coming, yet upon reflection, it feels inevitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:31">[00:31:31]</a>. The best surprises are those that are both inevitable and completely surprising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:16">[00:29:16]</a>.
3.  **Suspense**: Keeping an audience in suspense, often leading to a surprise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:05">[00:50:05]</a>.
4.  **Humor**: Daring to be funny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:15">[00:50:15]</a>. Humor is a simple yet brilliant way to differentiate yourself, though it requires taking a risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:48">[00:51:48]</a>.
    *   **Nostalgia**: Evoke shared past experiences, which are often inherently funny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:27">[00:53:27]</a>. This is especially useful in business when introducing new products or services by contrasting them with older methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:56">[00:53:56]</a>.
    *   **"One of These Things is Not Like the Other"**: Present three elements, two expected and one unexpected, to create a humorous contrast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:54">[00:56:54]</a>.

## Storytelling in Business: Practical Applications

In business, communication is often "round, white, and flavorless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:48">[00:34:48]</a>. People often prioritize fitting in over standing out, leading to forgettable presentations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:53">[00:34:53]</a>.

[[product_management_and_storytelling | Effective storytelling in business]] offers significant benefits:
*   **Memorability**: Stories make you memorable, unlike data-heavy presentations that are quickly forgotten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:31">[00:36:31]</a>. Our minds are not designed to remember abstract facts, statistics, or platitudes not attached to imagery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>.
*   **Connection**: Sharing personal stories, even brief anecdotes, humanizes the speaker and creates connection with the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:50">[00:43:50]</a>.

### Examples of Business Storytelling
*   **Boris and the Baseball Game**: A factory owner, Boris, used a story about his son striking out in a Little League game to teach his sales team about overcoming failure and moving on quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:21">[00:38:21]</a>. This personal anecdote was more effective than a direct lecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>.
*   **Masha and Slack's Narrative**: The director of corporate communications at Slack, Masha, crafted a competitive narrative against Microsoft Teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:13">[00:42:13]</a>. Initially hesitant to include a personal anecdote about feeling lonely during the pandemic while developing the narrative, she found that a 30-second inclusion of this personal story made the audience connect deeply with her, humanizing her beyond a "corporate monolith" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:10">[00:43:10]</a>.

To make stories personal, Dicks suggests creating a "personal interest inventory" – a list of relatable aspects of your life (e.g., being married, having children, hobbies) that can be strategically woven into conversations or presentations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:50">[00:44:50]</a>. This allows you to be an individual "full of color and full of edge and full of flavor," rather than being forgettable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:48">[00:46:48]</a>.

### Adjacency: Connecting Unrelated Content
When seeking a story to solve a problem, instead of matching content to content, match **theme, meaning, or message** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:25">[01:03:25]</a>.
*   A biotech scientist selling specialized tubes used a story about the challenges of buying different types of apples for his family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:49">[00:59:49]</a>. He connected the idea that his family deserved specific apples to the company's belief that customers deserve specific tubes, even if more expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:30">[01:00:30]</a>. This approach, without presenting any data, generated more leads than all other scientists combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:44">[01:00:44]</a>. This creates a "snap" moment for the audience when they realize the underlying connection between seemingly unrelated topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:10">[01:04:10]</a>.

This demonstrates the [[role_of_storytelling_and_drawing_in_product_management | role of storytelling]] in business, even when addressing specific product features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:45">[01:02:45]</a>.

## Building a Story Bank: Homework for Life

Dicks' most important teaching is "Homework for Life," a practice he developed to avoid running out of stories for the stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:54">[01:06:54]</a>. The process involves:
*   Every day before bed, reflecting on the day to find one moment worth telling as a story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:35">[01:07:35]</a>.
*   Recording these moments in an Excel spreadsheet (or Google Sheets) with the date and a brief description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:49">[01:07:49]</a>.

Benefits of Homework for Life:
*   **Endless Stories**: It reveals that life is filled with more stories than one can ever tell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:07">[01:08:07]</a>. Over time, practitioners develop a "lens for storytelling," seeing moments they previously overlooked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:34">[01:08:34]</a>.
*   **Recovering Time**: It helps to "recover time" and "slow time down," as each day has something worth remembering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:17">[01:09:17]</a>.
*   **Seeing Patterns**: It allows individuals to observe patterns in their lives they wouldn't otherwise notice, leading to deeper self-understanding and new story ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:08">[01:12:08]</a>.
*   **Therapeutic Elements**: It can be therapeutic by helping people hold onto their days and process experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:37">[01:10:37]</a>.

## Overcoming Public Speaking Nerves

For those who fear public speaking, Dicks offers these insights:
*   **Pre-Talk Nervousness**: 98% of nervousness occurs *before* speaking; once you begin, most nerves dissipate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:01">[01:20:01]</a>.
*   **Shared Experience**: Everyone gets nervous, even famous performers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:55">[01:21:55]</a>.
*   **Preparation is Key**:
    *   **Record and Listen Passively**: Record your talk and listen to it repeatedly while doing other tasks (e.g., grocery shopping, chores) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:23">[01:22:23]</a>. This allows the material to "seep into your soul" and become part of you, making it easier to recall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:35">[01:22:35]</a>.
    *   **Focus on Transitions**: Most people forget transitions, not the main points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:12">[01:23:12]</a>. Actively practice moving between sections.
    *   **Avoid Memorizing**: Memorizing can lead to greater suffering if you forget a line. Instead, aim to know the content without rote memorization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:31">[01:24:31]</a>.

## The Power of "Yes"

Saying "yes" to opportunities, even those that seem crazy or undesirable, is crucial for personal growth and generating compelling stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:49">[01:26:49]</a>. Not saying yes implies a presumptuous belief that you already know what's beyond an unexplored door <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:54">[01:26:54]</a>.

While saying yes can lead to great stories, the primary purpose is to explore and experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>. A "yes" can always be followed by a "no" if the experience isn't right, but many people fail to step through the door out of fear or prejudice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:38">[01:27:38]</a>. The things that frighten us are often the things that are best for us <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:15">[01:29:15]</a>. This philosophy aligns with the idea that "the cave you fear contains the treasure you seek" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:47">[01:29:47]</a>.

## Tactical Advice for Starting a Story

To immediately engage an audience, start every story with two elements:
1.  **Location**: Where you are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:01">[01:39:01]</a>. Location activates imagination, allowing the audience to quickly visualize the setting and implicitly add context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:23">[01:38:23]</a>.
2.  **Action**: Something actively happening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:01">[01:39:01]</a>. This immediately signals that a story is beginning and indicates that something is moving forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:08">[01:39:08]</a>.

This opening technique silences the room and gives the storyteller the opportunity to speak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:30">[01:40:30]</a>. It's like the "movies on" signal, encouraging the audience to pay attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:34">[01:40:34]</a>.

> "I'm in a place doing a thing it's a signal to people that I am now telling a story and when you can signal to people I'm now telling a story they will get quiet for you and they will afford you the opportunity to speak" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:05">[01:40:05]</a>

This simple approach can immediately make a storyteller 50% better than they were before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:51">[01:40:51]</a>. Ultimately, whether in business or personal life, the goal of a [[how_storytelling_creates_memorable_communication | storyteller]] is to be entertaining, as people will not listen otherwise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:39">[01:40:39]</a>. The [[product_management_and_storytelling | role of storytelling]] is about making strategic, tactical decisions before speaking to engage the audience and hold their attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:12">[01:17:12]</a>.

The [[the_importance_of_optimism_and_joy_in_business | importance of optimism]] and positive mental attitude, as Dicks learned in fourth grade, can also be a key to success, shaping one's mindset and approach to life and communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:25">[01:36:25]</a>.

NuBank, a fintech company, has achieved remarkable success, growing larger than Coinbase, Robinhood, Affirm, Sofi, and Lemonade combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. An astounding 80% to 90% of NuBank's growth comes through word-of-mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>, and the company has more customers than Bank of America, despite operating in only three Latin American countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. This success is attributed to an obsession with [[creating_a_remarkable_product | building products]] that customers love fanatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. Jag Duggal, Chief Product Officer at NuBank, shares insights into how they foster such a dedicated user base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:03">[01:02:03]</a>.

## Core Principles for Building Fanatical Customer Love

NuBank's approach to [[building_customercentric_products_through_design | building customer-centric products]] is rooted in several fundamental principles:

### Tapping into a Deep Pain Point
NuBank identified a significant pain point in Brazil, where large incumbent banks were highly profitable but also widely disliked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. This deep-seated dissatisfaction provided fertile ground for a new approach to banking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.

### Customer-Centric Culture
NuBank's culture is deeply ingrained in its employees, with 80% to 90% able to recite the company's five values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. The first and most peculiar value is: "We want our customers to love us fanatically" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. This intent guides decision-making, often biasing towards the customer's long-term love over short-term financial or operational convenience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.

NuBank's Five Core Values:
1.  We want our customers to love us fanatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.
2.  We are hungry and we challenge the status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.
3.  We build strong and diverse teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.
4.  We pursue smart efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.
5.  We think and act like owners, not renters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. This means doing what's right, even without being told, and taking extreme ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.

## Product Development Process

Once the foundational pain point and customer-obsessed culture are in place, the focus shifts to the tradecraft of product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.

### Customer Discovery & Innovation
NuBank emphasizes customer discovery before [[building_minimum_lovable_products | building]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. This discovery isn't just about asking customers what they want, but about observing their behavior and innovating on their behalf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. The goal is to uncover pain points customers might not even notice themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.

Key tactics include:
*   **Amazon's Mock Press Release Technique:** Before a single engineer is assigned, teams write a press release explaining why the intended customer should care. If it can't be articulated crisply, more work is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>.
*   **Product and Design Reviews:** These regular reviews consistently ask, "Why is this great for the customer? Why is this fundamentally different for the customer? How does this redefine the category?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>. The aim is to break trade-off constraints, offering quality, simplicity, and favorable pricing simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.

### Measurement and Iteration
After a product is built and launched (Alpha, Beta, or later stage), robust measurement is critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>.

*   **Sean Ellis Score:** NuBank is a "fanatical follower" of Sean Ellis's methodology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>. This involves asking customers, "How disappointed would you be if this product went away?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>.
    *   Sean Ellis suggests that if less than 40% of customers would be "very disappointed," the product hasn't achieved product-market fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>.
    *   NuBank adjusts this threshold to 50% for Brazilian customers due to cultural politeness and optimism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>.
    *   Projects are rarely scaled until they hit this compelling Sean Ellis score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>.
    *   This score helps identify segments of customers who truly love the product, allowing teams to understand *why* and then expand those features or experiences to a wider audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>.
*   **Net Promoter Score (NPS):** The company is "addicted" to its NPS, striving for world-beating scores (often 70s, 80s, even 90s, with a 94-95 recorded in Mexico) across the company and product verticals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>. Dips in NPS are treated as alarms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>.
*   **Churn:** Crucially, NuBank also monitors churn to ensure that customers acquired through word-of-mouth are retained, preventing a "leaky bucket" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>.

### Operationalizing the "Love" Bar
The principle of customers loving the product fanatically is operationalized by setting a high bar:
*   "Good enough isn't good enough; is it great enough?" is a common question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:49">[00:20:49]</a>.
*   The Sean Ellis score acts as a gate: if it's not met, the product isn't scaled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>. The focus is on fixing problems at a small scale rather than over-scaling a product that isn't working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:43">[00:29:43]</a>.

### Role of Product Managers: Pushing Back
A key part of [[building_a_successful_product_management_team | successful product management]] at NuBank is the [[role_of_product_managers_in_owning_the_why | product manager's job]] to push back against pressure to scale a product prematurely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:29">[00:30:29]</a>.

*   **Ownership Mindset:** PMs are expected to act as owners, not renters. This means telling senior leaders the "bad news" early if a product isn't working or won't succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:30">[00:31:30]</a>.
*   **Clarity and Data:** Effective pushback involves bringing clarity, data, and a high bar. Senior leaders, often strong-willed, respect those who articulate challenges and trade-offs clearly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:40">[00:32:40]</a>.
*   **Long-term Accountability:** Ultimately, the PM is responsible for the product's success. It's better to "bite the bullet" early and pivot when it's easier, rather than untangling a "big mess" later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:51">[00:33:51]</a>.

### User Research Tips
*   **Anecdotes Trump Data:** While data is important, the value of a customer's words and compelling anecdotes should never be overlooked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:30">[00:35:30]</a>.
*   **Clearly Articulate Hypotheses:** Before research, teams must develop a crisp hypothesis. Without it, data and anecdotes can be hard to interpret <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:06">[00:36:06]</a>.
*   **Don't Fall in Love with Your Hypothesis:** Avoid becoming a "lawyer" for your idea; instead, act as a "judge" to determine if the hypothesis is truly validated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:41">[00:36:41]</a>.
*   **Observe More Than Ask Directly:** When doing research, observe customer behavior and ask indirect questions to uncover true pain points, rather than leading them to affirm your solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:08">[00:37:08]</a>. NuBank encourages product managers to personally call 10 customers directly to get unfiltered feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:28">[00:26:28]</a>.

## Strategies for Product Success

Jag Duggal emphasizes the importance of strategy, counter to the Silicon Valley dogma that "strategy is easy and execution is everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:11">[00:44:11]</a>.

### Clarity Over Being Right
Quoting Kevin Systrom, early Instagram co-founder: "We may not be right, but at least we are clear" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:18">[00:45:18]</a>. Even if a strategy isn't perfectly right, clarity allows for faster course correction when things go off track <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:24">[00:45:24]</a>.

### Strategy vs. Aspiration
Drawing from Richard Rumelt's work (Good Strategy Bad Strategy, The Crux), strategy is *not* an ambitious goal, aspiration, or financial outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:07">[00:46:07]</a>. Instead, it's a coherent plan for applying strengths in a leveraged way against a core problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:15">[00:46:15]</a>.

*   **NuBank's Specific Strategy:** In 2014, NuBank's strategy was to serve millennial, middle-class, urban Brazilians who hated credit card fees and struggled to get credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:57">[00:46:57]</a>. Their solution was a no-fee credit card, made possible by a branchless and digital cost structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:12">[00:47:12]</a>. This was a coherent, specific problem for a specific customer, with a specific solution and advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:27">[00:47:27]</a>.

### Concentrated Bets
Startups need to make concentrated bets, not hedge. Diversification preserves wealth, but concentration builds it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:39">[00:48:39]</a>. A clear strategy allows for focus and a rapid read on whether these high-stakes, concentrated bets are working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:50">[00:48:50]</a>.

### Practice and Courage
To develop a strategic muscle, PMs should:
*   Take strategy seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:25">[00:49:25]</a>.
*   Utilize frameworks like "Play to Win" (Christopher Lockhead) or "Where to Play, How to Win" (Roger Martin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:34">[00:49:34]</a>.
*   Practice making hard choices and concentrating bets, even when hedging feels appealing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:27">[00:50:27]</a>. This requires courage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:42">[00:51:42]</a>.

### "Fundamentally Different" vs. "Incrementally Better"
NuBank's mantra, even on its coffee mugs, is: "We're not trying to be incrementally better, we are trying to be fundamentally different" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:12">[00:50:12]</a>. Only "fundamentally different" products inspire customers to tell their friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:31">[00:52:31]</a>. This pursuit of fundamental difference applies even when entering existing markets, aiming to reinvent the category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:38">[00:56:38]</a>.

## Product Line Expansion at NuBank

NuBank is historically successful at launching new business lines, evolving from a Brazilian credit card monoliner to a full-solution Latin American bank with roughly a dozen to 20 core product lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:40">[00:57:40]</a>.

*   **Phase 1:** Brazilian credit card monoliner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:05">[00:58:05]</a>.
*   **Phase 2:** Full-solution Latin American bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:16">[00:58:16]</a>. This involved launching a bank account, lending, investments, insurance, and small business products, and expanding into Mexico and Colombia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:28">[00:58:28]</a>.
*   **Phase 3:** Moving beyond financial services, with an e-commerce marketplace within the app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:22">[00:59:22]</a>.

The company's decision-making on product sequencing is not based on a "predestined master plan" but on robust debate, constant re-examination, and a culture of candor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:16">[01:01:16]</a>. The key remains using the Sean Ellis score as a gate, ensuring products hit the "love" threshold before aggressive scaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:27">[01:02:27]</a>.

## The Future of Fintech and AI-Native Products

NuBank envisions a future where banking is "fundamentally different" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:44">[00:59:44]</a>.

*   **Holistic Banking:** Providing a full solution across the "five or six financial seasons" of someone's life: spending, saving, investing, borrowing, protecting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:30">[01:04:30]</a>.
*   **Global Bank on a Single Codebase:** Aiming to build the first global bank on a unified codebase, combining Google's principle of global readiness with the local regulatory complexities of fintech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:15">[01:05:15]</a>.
*   **Social Mechanics & Self-Driving Automation:** Leveraging social technologies (like simplified joint accounts for financial goals) and automation to make managing financial lives exponentially easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:36">[01:06:36]</a>.
*   **AI-Native Products:** Beyond appending AI to existing products, NuBank is exploring what "AI native" financial services look like <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:39">[01:10:39]</a>. The metaphor is a "personal banker" for everyone, democratizing access to sophisticated financial guidance that currently only 10 million wealthy individuals have <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:06">[01:00:06]</a>. The goal is to solve the problem of "harshly unoptimized financial lives" for all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:49">[01:07:49]</a>.
*   **LatAm Innovation:** NuBank believes the company that reinvents banking globally can and should emerge from cities like São Paulo, Mexico City, or Bogotá <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:09">[01:09:09]</a>.

## Lessons from Failure: Persistence and Clarity

Jag Duggal shares a seminal career failure during his time at Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:54">[01:12:54]</a>. After dropping out of grad school to join Google's venture into disrupting terrestrial radio and TV advertising in 2006, the project ultimately failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:31">[01:13:31]</a>. The core hypothesis—that online advertising methodologies (like auctions) could directly translate to broadcast media—proved difficult due to market differences (brand vs. direct response), technical challenges (reach/frequency), and market structure (fragmented online vs. concentrated media owners) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:22">[01:14:22]</a>.

This failure led to a strategic pivot at Google: instead of chasing TV, they had TV come to Google via YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:25">[01:16:25]</a>. Although Jag and his team were "collateral damage" and faced layoffs, he later leveraged his learning about brand advertising to lead Google's display advertising business, which became its second largest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:50">[01:18:50]</a>.

The lesson: "Just because I'm losing doesn't mean I've lost" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:41">[01:17:41]</a>. Bloody-minded persistence, combined with being clear-eyed about the odds of success, is an underrated quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:04">[01:20:04]</a>.

## Key Takeaways

*   **Perseverance and Clarity:** Be clear about what you're trying to achieve and how much you're willing to fight for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:43">[01:20:43]</a>.
*   **Openness to Feedback:** Be open and transparent to market feedback, knowing what parts of your plan to let go and what to hold onto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:55">[01:20:55]</a>.
*   **Disruptive Vector:** As an insurgent, you cannot fight on the incumbent's ground. You must find a disruptive vector—something "fundamentally different"—to break through the noise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:34">[01:21:34]</a>. "Incrementally better" is not enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:04">[01:22:04]</a>.
*   **Life Motto:** This principle extends to life: build the life you want, don't just check someone else's boxes. Be willing to tolerate failure and pursue what is "fundamentally different" for yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:56">[01:27:56]</a>.

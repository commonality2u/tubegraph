The [[understanding_the_jobs_to_be_done_framework | Jobs to Be Done (JTBD)]] framework aims to understand why customers "hire" a product to make progress in their lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. While the core concept of focusing on customer progress is shared, there are distinct approaches to implementing JTBD, each with different emphases and methodologies.

## Core Misconceptions

A fundamental misconception about [[understanding_the_jobs_to_be_done_framework | Jobs to Be Done]] is viewing it as simply "pain and gain," as opposed to "context and outcome" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:39">[00:54:39]</a>. The context surrounding a customer's situation is crucial, as it makes seemingly "irrational" decisions rational <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:14">[00:55:14]</a>. Focusing solely on outcomes without the context is another common mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:47">[00:54:47]</a>.

Another critical error is for teams to hypothesize what jobs exist from within a conference room, rather than engaging with customers directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:27">[00:45:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:54">[00:54:54]</a>. Businesses often believe they know what customers are buying, but this is frequently not the case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:07">[00:42:07]</a>.

## Key Approaches

### Bob Moesta's Approach
Bob Moesta, co-creator of the [[understanding_the_jobs_to_be_done_framework | Jobs to Be Done framework]], emphasizes understanding the "demands side" of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. His approach is rooted in the premise that people "hire" products to make progress in their lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

Key tenets of Moesta's approach:
*   **Focus on struggling moments**: All innovation and demand start with a "struggling moment," not with a product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:45">[00:44:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:16">[00:58:16]</a>.
*   **Causation over correlation**: The core of the method is understanding the causation of what pushes people to choose a new product or solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.
*   **Forces of Progress Model**: Moesta identifies four forces that influence a customer's decision to "hire" a new product:
    *   **Push (F1)**: The push or context that makes a customer consider leaving an old solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.
    *   **Pull (F2)**: The pull towards a new outcome or state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.
    *   **Anxiety (F3)**: The anxiety associated with adopting a new product or solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.
    *   **Habit of the Present (F4)**: The inertia or habit of sticking with the current solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.
    *   For adoption to occur, F1 and F2 must be greater than F3 and F4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. Reducing friction (F3/F4) can increase adoption without changing the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>.
*   **Qualitative & Organic**: Moesta's method is highly qualitative and organic, combining process, practice, and skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:45">[00:44:45]</a>.
*   **Interviewing Technique**: Emphasizes "criminal and intelligence interrogation" techniques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a> that feel like therapy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:55">[00:38:55]</a>. The goal is to uncover the customer's *story* of why they made a purchase, rather than what they *say* they want <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:44">[00:36:44]</a>. He advises against using a discussion guide to allow for deeper exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:24">[00:30:24]</a>.
*   **Target Audience**: Focuses on people who have *already tried* to make progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:09">[00:28:09]</a>, or those who have churned from a product, as their stories reveal struggling moments and reasons for change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:17">[00:35:17]</a>. "Bitching ain't switching" â€“ complaining does not mean they will change behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:04">[00:37:04]</a>.
*   **Sample Size**: Finds that patterns start to repeat after 7 or 8 interviews, typically doing 10-12 interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:17">[00:29:17]</a>.
*   **Energy Sources**: Identifies three types of energy driving action: functional (time, effort, knowledge), emotional (frustration, desire to feel better), and social (how others perceive them) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:32">[00:34:32]</a>.
*   **Book Recommendation**: *Demands Side Sales* for understanding how to apply his approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:48">[00:50:48]</a>.

### Clay Christensen's Approach
Clay Christensen collaborated with Bob Moesta to develop the [[understanding_the_jobs_to_be_done_framework | Jobs to Be Done]] concept into a formal theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:50">[00:48:50]</a>.
*   **Theoretical & Strategic**: Christensen's focus is more on developing a "thinking framework" and a "philosophy" for strategic decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:17">[00:49:17]</a>.
*   **Shared Data Set**: His approach is derived from the same underlying data and experiences as Moesta's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:04">[00:50:04]</a>.

### Tony Ulwick's (Outcome-Driven Innovation) Approach
Tony Ulwick's approach (referred to as "Olick" or "Olwick" in the transcript) is distinct from Christensen and Moesta's.
*   **Supply-Side Driven**: Ulwick's method is described as "very supply side driven," focusing on "functions" and "what our product can do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:38">[00:49:38]</a>.
*   **Systematic & Prescriptive**: It involves a "very systematic approach that's hundreds of steps and very very prescriptive in nature" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:31">[00:44:31]</a>.
*   **Different Data Set**: This approach is derived from a different data set of experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:09">[00:50:09]</a>.
*   **Applicability**: While valuable, it is suggested to be more suited for companies with high risk, regulation, or complicated systems, and requires a "very disciplined organization to follow it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:27">[00:50:27]</a>.
*   **Product-centric Job Definition**: A key difference is that Ulwick's method tends to define jobs in terms of product capabilities, whereas Moesta emphasizes that "only people have jobs, products don't have jobs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:45">[00:49:45]</a>.

In essence, while all approaches aim to understand customer needs for progress, Moesta and Christensen emphasize understanding the *customer's journey and context* (demand-side), whereas Ulwick's approach is more structured and focuses on *product capabilities and measurable outcomes* (supply-side).

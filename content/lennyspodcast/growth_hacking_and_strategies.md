[[Growth frameworks and strategies | Growth]] is a critical aspect for startups, involving understanding product-market fit and implementing sustainable [[growth_frameworks_and_strategies | strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:43">[01:47:43]</a>. Shawn Ellis, who coined the term "growth hacking," is a key figure in this field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:10">[01:08:10]</a>.

## Defining Growth Hacking
Shawn Ellis originally defined "growth hacking" as scrutinizing every action's impact on business [[growth_frameworks_and_strategies | growth]], focusing on acquiring customers efficiently for a product they'll continue to use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:14">[01:14:14]</a>. It was not intended to mean a collection of one-off hacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:58">[00:59:58]</a>, but rather a focus on what drives sustainable [[growth_frameworks_and_strategies | growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:19">[01:16:19]</a>. The term aimed to open conversations about different approaches to [[growth_frameworks_and_strategies | growth]] compared to traditional marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:09">[01:17:09]</a>.

## Product-Market Fit (PMF)
For Shawn Ellis, the first crucial step in [[developing_growth_models_for_startups | developing growth models for startups]] is to determine if a product has product-market fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:50">[01:49:50]</a>. He developed the "Shawn Ellis Test" to help understand if a product is considered a "must-have" by users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:10">[03:36:10]</a>.

### The Shawn Ellis Test
The test asks users: "How would you feel if you could no longer use this product?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:10">[03:36:10]</a>. Response options include "very disappointed," "somewhat disappointed," or "not disappointed/not applicable, I've already stopped using the product" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>. The goal is to identify users who would be "very disappointed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>, indicating a powerful connection to the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>.

*   **When to Administer**: It's recommended to survey a random sample of people who have used the product at least twice, especially within the last week or two, to ensure they've activated and experienced the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:25">[02:22:25]</a>.
*   **The 40% Threshold**: A common benchmark is 40% or more of users saying they'd be "very disappointed," which is considered a leading indicator of product-market fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:39:00">[06:39:00]</a>. This threshold emerged from observing patterns across many startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:49:00">[07:49:00]</a>.
    *   **Nuance of the Threshold**: The 40% is not a rigid rule, as cultural differences (e.g., Brazilians being more optimistic, Hungarians more pessimistic) might influence scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>. The main purpose is to provide a target for the team, signaling when to aggressively pursue [[growth_frameworks_and_strategies | growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:01">[01:18:01]</a>.
    *   **Sample Size**: A minimum of 30 responses is generally considered a good sample size for reliable data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>.
*   **Qualitative Insights**: The true power of the test lies in digging into the qualitative feedback from "very disappointed" users to understand:
    *   Who they are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>
    *   How they use the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>
    *   What problems the product solves for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>
    *   The primary benefit they receive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>
    *   Why that benefit is important to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>
    This deep understanding informs product roadmap, onboarding, messaging, and acquisition strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.
*   **Case Study: Lookout**: Initial test score was 7% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:20:00">[09:20:00]</a>. By focusing on the "very disappointed" users, it was found they valued the antivirus functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:27:00">[10:27:00]</a>. Repositioning the product around antivirus and streamlining onboarding to emphasize this feature led to a 40% score in two weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:51:00">[11:51:00]</a>.
*   **Addressing Low Scores**: If the score is low (e.g., 10-15%), it's crucial to focus on the "very disappointed" users.
    *   **Ignore "Somewhat Disappointed"**: Avoid tweaking the product based on feedback from "somewhat disappointed" users, as this can dilute the experience for "must-have" users, making the product "good for everyone but not great for anyone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:10">[01:42:10]</a>.
    *   **Superhuman's Approach**: A notable exception is Superhuman's strategy: identify the core benefit for "must-have" users, then ask "somewhat disappointed" users what they'd need in the product to make it a "must-have" *while staying true to that core benefit* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:25">[01:42:25]</a>.
*   **Limitations**: The test may not be suitable for "one-off" products (e.g., a movie or a workshop) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>. High scores can sometimes be influenced by user investment (e.g., time spent building a website on a platform like Webs.com or setting up an event on Eventbrite) rather than pure utility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>. This highlights the interplay between "switching costs and utility" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>.

## Core Growth Strategy Phases
Once product-market fit is validated (e.g., 40% score on the Shawn Ellis Test), the focus shifts to scaling [[growth_frameworks_and_strategies | growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:47">[01:48:47]</a>. Shawn Ellis prioritizes stages in a specific order:

1.  **Activation/Onboarding**: This is the most critical first step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:03">[00:51:03]</a>. The goal is to get as many of the right users to experience the "must-have" value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:47">[00:48:47]</a>.
    *   **Importance**: Users are at the highest risk of churning during onboarding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:01">[00:54:01]</a>.
    *   **Strategies**:
        *   Deeply understand the problem preventing users from effectively using the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:51">[00:57:51]</a>.
        *   Reduce friction and collapse the "time to value" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:29">[00:54:29]</a>.
        *   Set the right expectations upfront with clear messaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:57">[01:11:57]</a>.
        *   Remind users of the benefits they will receive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>.
        *   Continuously test and iterate on the onboarding flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:59">[01:00:59]</a>.
    *   **Case Study: LogMeIn**: Initially, only 5% of sign-ups performed a remote control session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:56">[00:54:56]</a>. A complete freeze on product development allowed the team to focus solely on improving sign-up to usage rate, increasing it by 1,000% (to 50%) in three months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:50">[00:55:50]</a>. This led to a dramatic increase in profitable customer acquisition and word-of-mouth [[growth_frameworks_and_strategies | growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>.
2.  **Engagement and Referral**: Once activation is optimized, focus on keeping users engaged and encouraging them to refer others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:35">[00:51:35]</a>.
    *   **Referral Programs**: These are effective accelerators when strong word-of-mouth already exists, but they cannot fix a product nobody wants to talk about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>.
    *   **Case Study: Dropbox**: The legendary Dropbox referral program (which Shawn Ellis helped develop) leveraged an already passionate user base with incentives on both sides (referrer and referred) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:49">[01:14:49]</a>.
    *   **Freemium Models**: For [[effective_growth_frameworks | freemium]] to be effective, the free product must be so good that it naturally generates word-of-mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:14">[01:16:14]</a>. The premium version then needs to be sufficiently differentiated to encourage upgrades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:26">[01:16:26]</a>.
    *   **Engagement**: Consider the natural usage cycle of the product (e.g., Airbnb vs. a daily tool) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:06">[01:17:06]</a>. Using frameworks like Nir Eyal's "Hooked" model can help improve engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:35">[01:17:35]</a>.
3.  **Monetization/Revenue Model**: Ensure the revenue model is optimized and efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:39">[00:51:39]</a>. If conversion, retention, and monetization aren't efficient, customer acquisition becomes very difficult and unsustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>.
4.  **Customer Acquisition (Top of Funnel)**: This is the final stage to obsess over, once the previous steps are working well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:41">[00:51:41]</a>.
    *   **Pre-Assessment**: Before engaging with a company, Shawn Ellis considers 2-3 viable customer acquisition angles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:56">[00:51:56]</a>.
    *   **Demand Generation vs. Demand Harvesting**: [[Marketplace growth strategies | Growth strategies]] can include generating demand (e.g., physical signs for Bounce luggage storage) or harvesting existing demand (e.g., SEO/Paid Search for "luggage storage Paris") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:59">[01:05:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:51">[01:06:51]</a>.
    *   **Learning from Users**: A powerful tactic is to ask customers "How did you find this product?" and "How do you typically find products like this?" to uncover potential acquisition channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:19">[01:10:19]</a>.

## Key Principles and Mindsets for Growth

*   **Northstar Metric**: Establish a metric that reflects the "units of value" being delivered to customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:02">[00:50:02]</a>.
    *   It should be something that can consistently increase over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:37">[01:20:37]</a>.
    *   It should correlate to revenue growth but not *be* revenue, as revenue is a byproduct of delivering value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:46">[01:20:46]</a>.
    *   Examples: "Nights booked" for Airbnb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:41">[01:22:41]</a>, "Weekly rides" for Uber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>, "Daily active users" for Facebook (a shift that made the product more addictive) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:51">[01:17:51]</a>.
*   **Qualitative & Quantitative Research**: Shawn Ellis emphasizes blending both to run better experiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:13">[01:12:13]</a>. Relying solely on analytics or traditional customer research can lead to [[ineffective_growth_tactics | ineffective growth tactics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:15">[01:11:15]</a>.
*   **Asking the Right Questions**: A fundamental principle is that "a problem well stated is a problem half-solved" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:41">[00:57:41]</a>. Asking obvious, yet often overlooked, questions can unlock solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:14">[01:33:14]</a>. For example, asking users *why* they didn't download software after signing up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:41">[00:58:41]</a>.
*   **ICE Prioritization Framework**: Shawn Ellis invented the ICE framework (Impact, Confidence, Effort) for prioritizing growth experiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>.
    *   **Purpose**: To enable high-velocity testing by providing a systematic way to compare ideas sourced from across the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:33">[01:28:33]</a>.
    *   **Comparison to RICE**: He views "Reach" in RICE (Intercom's version) as already factored into "Impact" in ICE, preferring the simpler model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:32">[01:27:32]</a>.
*   **[[Challenges and Strategies in EarlyStage Startup Growth | Challenges and Strategies in EarlyStage Startup Growth]]**: Growth strategies have evolved. In the past, being data-driven on customer acquisition was often enough to win. Today, with most online marketers being data-driven, competition is fierce, requiring hyper-efficiency across conversion, retention, and monetization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:04">[01:25:04]</a>. This necessitates cross-functional collaboration between marketing, product, sales, and customer success, which is often difficult for later-stage companies to implement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:18">[01:26:18]</a>.
*   **Impact of AI**: AI is expected to greatly impact [[growth_frameworks_and_strategies | growth]], particularly in modeling potential experiment outcomes, identifying opportunities, and automating analysis, which can help overcome the bottleneck of analyzing high-velocity experiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:51">[01:29:51]</a>. It can also help reduce ego-driven decisions by providing dispassionate recommendations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:05">[01:32:05]</a>.
*   **Focus on Reputation and Learning**: Prioritizing reputation and continuous learning over short-term earnings has proven highly beneficial for long-term success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:21">[01:38:21]</a>.

### Common Misconceptions in Growth Strategies
A [[common_misconceptions_in_growth_strategies | common misconception]] is that simply driving more traffic to a product will fix growth issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:35">[00:53:35]</a>. However, without efficient conversion, retention, and monetization, customer acquisition will struggle to be scalable or profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>. Another [[common_misconceptions_in_growth_strategies | misconception]] is that adding a referral program will magically fix a product no one is talking about; a referral program is an accelerator, not a fix for lack of inherent word-of-mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:55">[01:14:55]</a>.

Shawn Ellis advises focusing on building strong product foundations and optimizing the user experience from activation onward. This sets the stage for sustainable [[growth_frameworks_and_strategies | growth]] rather than relying on short-term [[ineffective_growth_tactics | ineffective growth tactics]] or pure acquisition efforts.

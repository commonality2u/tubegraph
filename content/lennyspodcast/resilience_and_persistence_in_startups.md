Dalton Caldwell, a managing director and group partner at Y Combinator (YC), emphasizes the critical role of [[lessons_from_failures_and_the_importance_of_persistence | resilience]] and persistence for [[entrepreneurial_journey_and_startup_founding | startup]] success, drawing from his over ten years of experience with 21 YC batches and numerous successful companies like Instacart, Retool, Brex, DoorDash, and Webflow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:02">[01:00:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:07">[01:05:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>.

## The "Don't Die" Mantra

One of Caldwell's core mantras for [[entrepreneurial_journey_and_startup_founding | founders]] is "just don't die" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This seemingly simple advice is profound in its impact, reminding [[entrepreneurial_journey_and_startup_founding | founders]] to adhere to fundamentals like selling and making money to avoid running out of capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. He compares it to coaching in sports, where even elite athletes benefit from being reminded of the basics to stay in the right mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.

> "One of my mantras is just just don't die, just keep your [[entrepreneurial_journey_and_startup_founding | startup]] going, just keep going. And I say that over and over again and and honestly that is often what people tell me is the most impactful thing I said it's not that I said some Ninja 5D chess move that they never would have thought it before it's just the constant affirmation that continuing to keep going and doing high quality reps is the game." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>

## The Inevitable Struggle

Caldwell asserts that 100% of successful companies experience a "near-death experience" where [[entrepreneurial_journey_and_startup_founding | founders]] seriously consider giving up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>. He shares the example of Airbnb, whose [[entrepreneurial_journey_and_startup_founding | founders]] "should have given up like three or four times" before YC, as their venture "objectively wasn't working" and they were "ruining their lives" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

A striking illustration of this is the Winter 2017 YC batch. Two companies, Vond (a VR headset company) and Cashew (a P2P payment app), were considered the "worst" performers, with their [[entrepreneurial_journey_and_startup_founding | founders]] feeling "ashamed" and "despondent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. However, through persistence and strategic [[earlystage_startup_challenges_and_solutions | pivots]], Vond became Brex and Cashew became Retool, both decacorns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. This highlights that [[entrepreneurial_journey_and_startup_founding | startups]] that appear to be struggling the most can become the most successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>.

## Knowing When to Persevere vs. Give Up

While persistence is vital, Caldwell acknowledges that there are times when giving up might be the right decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. His advice is nuanced:
*   **Keep Going if:**
    *   You are still having fun and enjoy what you're doing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.
    *   You enjoy spending time with your [[entrepreneurial_journey_and_startup_founding | co-founders]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.
    *   You love your customers and your product, even if it's struggling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.
    *   You still have many "grow ideas" that haven't been tried yet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>.
*   **Consider Giving Up if:**
    *   The experience is profoundly affecting you negatively, including relationships or [[mental_health_impact_on_startup_Founders | mental health]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.
    *   You don't want to work with your [[entrepreneurial_journey_and_startup_founding | co-founder]] anymore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.
    *   You could care less about the customers, product, or team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:19">[01:09:19]</a>.
    *   You are "out of ideas" for growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>.
    *   Your heart knows you're done, even if it feels like failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>.

He reassures [[entrepreneurial_journey_and_startup_founding | founders]] that "no one will remember that you shut down your company probably in 10 years or 20 years" as long as they maintain integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.

> "It's much more common that they still have some money left... and they're just like, yeah, I'm done. I'm out of ideas. I don't want to do this anymore. And again, fair enough... that is the most common cause of death is something that sounds like like that story." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:30">[00:38:30]</a>

## The Role of Belief and Conviction

A common [[attributes_of_successful_founders_and_startups | pattern among successful founders]] is an intense internal belief in their ability to make their venture work, even when objective data suggests otherwise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>. This "irrational... intention to keep going" is a powerful force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. This conviction isn't necessarily present from day one; it often builds over time as the product finds success and customers provide positive feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:32">[00:51:32]</a>. For example, Patrick Collison of Stripe wasn't sure the company would work until a year or two in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:16">[00:51:16]</a>.

> "The thing that I would argue folks that build really big companies have in common is they just really want it and they really believe in themselves and they really believe they can make it work." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>

## Lessons from Failure

Caldwell admits to making "lots of bad investments" and having [[entrepreneurial_journey_and_startup_founding | startups]] that "didn't work out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:42">[01:09:42]</a>. His key takeaway is that failure shouldn't dominate one's thoughts; instead, energy should be channeled into continued effort and optimism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:15">[01:10:15]</a>. Maintaining optimism and drive is crucial for a long career in the [[entrepreneurial_journey_and_startup_founding | startup]] world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:37">[01:10:37]</a>.

> "You just can't let it get to you too much and you got to keep going and that if you keep going no one really remembers those as much and it doesn't really define you and it shouldn't." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:01">[01:10:01]</a>

Ultimately, success in the [[entrepreneurial_journey_and_startup_founding | startup]] world is often a testament to the [[lessons_from_failures_and_the_importance_of_persistence | founders]]' unwavering resolve to keep pushing forward, even when all hope seems lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.

Effective **SEO** and content marketing are crucial for growth, especially for B2B businesses, by solving customer problems rather than directly selling products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. For businesses solving an active problem, [[SEO as a growth strategy | SEO]] is a good idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:29">[00:26:29]</a>.

## Impact at Deel

At Deel, approximately 50% of current growth originates from non-paid channels, which include partnerships and [[SEO as a growth strategy | SEO]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>. In the early stages, this percentage was even higher, accounting for 80% to 90% of growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>.

## Common Mistakes in SEO

A significant mistake in [[SEO as a growth strategy | SEO]] is simply "shoving keywords" into content without considering user intent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>. If users are not actively searching for a particular question on Google, writing content for that topic will not lead to discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. People also fail when they try to cut corners in [[Tools and techniques for effective SEO | SEO]], as it requires continuous time and effort to create high-quality resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:30">[00:23:30]</a>.

## Effective Strategies for SEO and Content

To succeed with [[SEO as a growth strategy | SEO]], the primary goal should be to ensure the user's "Google search is over" after reading your content, meaning their question is fully answered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>. This means writing valuable content that people genuinely want to read <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>.

Key strategies include:
*   **Answering questions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>: Providing value by answering questions people are asking on search engines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.
*   **Understanding search intent** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>: Investigate what people are truly looking for when they type a keyword. Check what Google is currently servicing for that keyword <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>.
*   **Addressing follow-up questions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:08">[00:21:08]</a>: Utilize the "people also ask" or related questions section at the bottom of Google search results to identify subsequent questions users might have <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>.
*   **Simplicity and clarity**: Ensure content is written in simple language, ideally at a fifth-grade reading level, so it's easily understandable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>.
*   **Regular updates**: Content, especially concerning regulations or taxes, needs continuous fact-checking and updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>.

One notable example of effective content was a blog post about the PPP program during COVID-19, which the IRS eventually linked to as a definitive resource <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:10">[00:39:10]</a>.

## Operational Framework for Content

Deel uses a "traffic light system" for its content team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>:
1.  **Keyword Research**: Identify up to 700 keywords, both closely and distantly related to the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>.
2.  **Volume Ranking**: Rank these keywords from highest to lowest search volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>.
3.  **Intent Analysis**: For each keyword, determine the user's intent:
    *   **Green Light**: High intent; the user is looking for a solution that aligns with the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>.
    *   **Yellow Light**: Medium intent; could be a potential customer, but not immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>.
    *   **Red Light**: Low intent; the user is likely not looking to buy (e.g., a university student researching a topic) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>.
4.  **Prioritization**: Focus on green-light keywords first, then yellows, always starting with the highest volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>. Red keywords are often not pursued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>.

## Tools for SEO

Various [[Tools and techniques for effective SEO | SEO tools]] can help ensure content is simple and includes the right keywords in the right places <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>. Deel utilizes Clearscope, which provides a score (e.g., A+ or C-) and recommends language sophistication adjustments (e.g., from university level to fourth-grade reading level) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:38">[00:21:38]</a>.

## Content Team Structure

Deel's content team, led by a Director of Content, consists of approximately eight full-time employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>. The team structure includes:
*   **Operations**: One person manages all operational aspects, including working with freelancers, sending briefs, fact-checking, publishing, and tracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:18">[00:22:18]</a>.
*   **Content Areas**: Different individuals focus on specific product lines or areas of expertise to ensure proper writing quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:34">[00:22:34]</a>.
*   **New Mediums**: A dedicated team focuses on exploring new content mediums beyond written articles, such as video and educational content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:49">[00:22:49]</a>.

The content team produces approximately five new articles and five article updates per week across multiple languages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:02">[00:25:02]</a>.

## Suitability of SEO

[[SEO as a growth strategy | SEO]] is not suitable for every business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:48">[00:25:48]</a>. It is highly effective for B2B companies that solve an active problem, as people will search for solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:27">[00:26:27]</a>. However, for direct-to-consumer products like lipstick, [[SEO as a growth strategy | SEO]] investment may be less impactful, as consumers often find these products through social media or influencers rather than search engines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">[00:26:05]</a>. Even if someone searches for "best lipstick," a company's website is unlikely to rank highly compared to objective third-party review sites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:15">[00:26:15]</a>.

## Early Prioritization for Growth

Before focusing on paid ads, businesses should "build the skeleton" by ensuring fundamental elements are in place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>:
1.  **Website Presence**: Have a functional website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.
2.  **Website Performance**: Ensure the website is fast and search engines recognize its existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. For example, a successful paid ads program cannot run on a website loading in four-plus seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:33">[00:30:33]</a>.
3.  **Findability**: Determine if people can find the website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.
4.  **Content for Findability**: If not, create content to help people discover it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

Only after addressing these foundational elements should a company consider investing in paid advertisements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. Deel's initial website was hard-coded, so the first step was to move it to an accessible platform for easier editing and A/B testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:57">[00:28:57]</a>. They also rigorously A/B tested value propositions to clarify their messaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:10">[00:29:10]</a>.

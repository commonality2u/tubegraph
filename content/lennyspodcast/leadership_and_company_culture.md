Effective [[leadership_and_management_development | leadership]] is crucial for [[Company Culture and Decision Making | company culture and decision making]], particularly in fast-growing technology companies. Brian Chesky, CEO and co-founder of Airbnb, shares insights on his approach to leadership, company structure, and the vital role of founders in maintaining a strong, cohesive culture.

## The Founder's Role and Vision

Founders should not apologize for how they want to run their company, as finding a midpoint between their vision and employee desires often leads to misery for all involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Clarity is what everyone truly wants, enabling them to "row in the same direction really quickly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

Chesky believes the CEO of a product or tech company should essentially serve as the chief product officer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>. Delegating product vision, especially for product or engineering-led founders, can mean delegating away their core strength and what is hardest to replace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>. His own experience at Airbnb showed that the less involved he was in a project, the more "spin" there was, goals became less clear, teams had less advocacy, and progress slowed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>.

### Micromanagement vs. Being in the Details

There is a distinction between micromanagement — telling people exactly what to do — and being in the details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. Being in the details is what every responsible company's board does to its CEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. Leaders must understand the details to know if people are performing well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. Great leaders empower, but they also need to be involved to ensure quality and progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Reforming Company Structure and Processes

By late 2019, Airbnb faced issues of slow product development, rising costs, increasing internal politics, bureaucracy, and a sense of complacency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:32">[00:20:32]</a>. The company had become fragmented into multiple divisions, each pursuing its own agenda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>.

The COVID-19 pandemic, which caused Airbnb to lose 80% of its business in eight weeks, acted as a "near-death business experience," providing clarity and a catalyst for change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:20">[00:24:20]</a>. This led to a significant overhaul in how Airbnb operated, moving from a reactive to a proactive leadership model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:10">[00:23:10]</a>.

Key changes implemented by Brian Chesky include:
*   **Reduced Project Scope** All ongoing work had to be documented, and only about 20% of existing projects were continued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>. The focus shifted from one team doing many things to multiple teams collaborating on fewer, more impactful initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>.
*   **Fewer Management Layers** Layers of management were removed to create a flatter structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:52">[00:25:52]</a>.
*   **Functional Model** The company reverted to a functional model, akin to a startup, with distinct departments like design, engineering, product, marketing, communications, sales, and operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:52">[00:25:52]</a>. This means no more separate guest and host teams, as most initiatives involve connecting both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:07">[00:42:07]</a>.
*   **Seniority and Expertise** Airbnb now has fewer, more senior employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">[00:26:05]</a>. Every executive is expected to be an expert in their functional domain, managing the work first and the people second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:30">[00:26:30]</a>.
*   **Centralized Decision-Making** Decision-making was pulled up, with the top 30-40 people in the company having a "one shared consciousness" and continuous conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:14">[00:27:14]</a>.
*   **Product Roadmaps** Metrics became subordinate to a rolling two-year product roadmap, updated every month, with product releases occurring twice a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:21">[00:27:21]</a>.
*   **Product Marketing Integration** A new product marketing function was created, combining inbound product development with outbound marketing responsibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. Product managers are now responsible for understanding the customer, distribution, and telling the product story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:32">[00:37:32]</a>.
*   **Program Management** Program management functions were offloaded from product managers to dedicated program managers, a high-status job at Airbnb due to its role in high-profile launches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.
*   **CEO Product Reviews** Chesky implemented a CEO review schedule, personally reviewing all product and marketing work on a regular cadence (weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, etc.) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:31">[00:28:31]</a>. These reviews ensure accountability and prevent cross-team conflicts, allowing for quick identification and resolution of bottlenecks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:05">[00:29:05]</a>.
*   **In-house Creative Agency** Airbnb built an in-house creative agency to handle not just ads but also product creative, ensuring a unified brand voice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:21">[00:30:21]</a>. UX writing was combined with marketing writing to maintain a single voice across all customer touchpoints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:41">[00:30:41]</a>.

This transformation was part of a larger bet that [[scaling_a_company_culture_while_maintaining_user_trust | building the best possible product]] and effectively communicating its value would drive growth, rather than relying solely on traditional paid growth channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>. This approach encourages a cohesive product vision, where each release is like a chapter in an ongoing story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:20">[01:18:20]</a>.

## Setting Ambitious Goals and Inspiring Potential

A key aspect of Chesky's [[leadership_and_management_development | leadership style]] is the "add a zero" mindset, encouraging teams to imagine solutions that are 10 times bigger or better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:35">[00:46:35]</a>. This forces teams to think differently about problems and break them down into "first principles" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>.

A leader's role is to set the pace for the team by making faster, more decisive actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:40">[00:47:40]</a>. This "bias for action" avoids delays and maximizes productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:56">[00:47:56]</a>. Furthermore, a leader's job is to "see potential in people that they never saw in themselves," fostering a growth mindset where demanding better performance is seen as an act of belief in their capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:01">[00:49:01]</a>. This creates [[cultural_elements_fostering_team_ownership_and_impact | cultural elements fostering team ownership and impact]] by linking performance to individual and collective potential rather than fixed limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:19">[00:49:19]</a>.

## Avoiding Burnout and Continuous Growth

While a hands-on approach might initially lead to more work, Brian Chesky found that once the company "turned the corner," there was actually more time available due to fewer conflicts, less turnover, and everyone rowing in the same direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:13">[00:51:13]</a>. The [[creating_and_maintaining_team_culture_and_passion | company culture]] became one where desired actions happened even without direct presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:35">[00:51:35]</a>.

To avoid burnout and maintain balance, Chesky emphasizes:
*   **Scheduled Breaks** Taking every other weekend off completely, with the alternative weekend involving intense work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:19">[00:53:19]</a>.
*   **Physical Health** Consistent exercise (daily cardio, regular weight training) and a healthy diet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:35">[00:53:35]</a>.
*   **Adequate Sleep** Prioritizing a good amount of sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:58">[00:53:58]</a>.
*   **Strong Relationships** Actively nurturing healthy relationships with friends and family, including regular group chats and trips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:02">[00:54:02]</a>. He emphasizes that healthy relationships are the secret to happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:30">[00:54:30]</a>.
*   **Strategic Time Management** Avoiding "fake work" (tasks that feel productive but don't advance goals) and proactively scheduling time for meaningful work and relationships, rather than simply reacting to incoming requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:36">[00:57:36]</a>.

Chesky maintains a "beginner's mindset," constantly seeking to learn and grow, viewing the world with curiosity and fresh eyes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:19">[00:59:19]</a>. He encourages [[leadership_and_management_development | leaders]] to be "shameless about reaching out for help," recognizing that asking for assistance is often an honor for the person being asked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:51">[01:00:51]</a>. This continuous hunger for improvement and the desire to always be evolving, learning, and growing defines his approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:06">[01:02:06]</a>.

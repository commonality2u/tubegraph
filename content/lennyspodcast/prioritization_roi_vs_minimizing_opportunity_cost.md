## Prioritization: ROI vs. Minimizing Opportunity Cost

In high-leverage roles, the approach to prioritization should shift from maximizing Return on Investment (ROI) to minimizing Opportunity Cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:02">[01:14:02]</a>. This concept was observed by Shreyas Doshi during his time at Stripe, particularly from Patrick Collison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:45">[01:14:45]</a>.

### The Sub-optimal ROI Mindset
A common approach to [[Communication and prioritization techniques for product managers | prioritization]] is to focus on work that simply provides a positive Return on Investment (ROI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:05">[01:14:05]</a>. In high-leverage roles, such as product management or founding a company, there are hundreds of tasks that will yield a positive ROI, meaning the value created is greater than the value of the time invested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:40">[01:14:40]</a>.

The problem with an ROI mindset in these roles is that the formula for ROI places the "time taken" in the denominator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:11">[01:15:11]</a>. To achieve a high ROI, individuals or teams often try to decrease this denominator, leading them to prioritize tasks that take less time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:40">[01:15:40]</a>. This often results in focusing on "low-hanging fruit" or "quick wins" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:04">[01:16:04]</a>. While there's nothing inherently wrong with quick wins, over-reliance on them can lead to missing out on significant upside and opportunities that could have been gained by focusing on more impactful, albeit more time-consuming, endeavors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:17">[01:16:17]</a>.

### The Optimal Opportunity Cost Mindset
Instead of asking, "Is this a good use of my time?", the focus should shift to, "Is this the best use of my time?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:10">[01:17:10]</a>.

Opportunity cost is defined as the value of the optimal option minus the value of the chosen option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:42">[01:16:42]</a>. The goal is to minimize this cost, which means striving to work on the most optimal things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:57">[01:16:57]</a>. This subtle yet profound shift in thinking encourages picking tasks and initiatives that might not be quick wins but have the potential to [[Business Sustainability and Profitability | meaningfully change the trajectory of the business]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:06">[01:19:06]</a>.

Shifting to an opportunity cost mindset applies equally to individual work and team [[Communication and prioritization techniques for product managers | prioritization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:32">[01:17:32]</a>.

### Practical Application of Opportunity Cost
Quantifying opportunity cost with a spreadsheet column is not recommended as it's often a "lost cause" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:24">[01:21:24]</a>. Instead, leaders should empower and give teams the freedom and permission to explore and pursue opportunities that minimize opportunity cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:31">[01:21:31]</a>.

A useful tactic is to provide rough guidance on time allocation during planning. Inspired by Google's classic 70/20/10 model for search, ads, and other big bets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:17">[01:22:17]</a>:
*   **60%** for **incrementals**: Features that improve user lives daily and are typically high ROI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:12">[01:23:12]</a>.
*   **30%** for **big new initiatives**: This allocation forces teams to focus on one or two significant projects rather than many small ones <a class="yt="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:36">[01:23:36]</a>. This is where [[Innovating and Avoiding Process Overdependence | innovation]] and pursuing "big scary projects" that address growing customer needs comes into play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:29">[01:20:29]</a>.
*   **10%** for **stability and infrastructure**: Essential foundational work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:49">[01:23:49]</a>.

This type of guidance creates the necessary space for teams to pursue impactful, less obvious opportunities, leading to better overall outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:05">[01:24:05]</a>.

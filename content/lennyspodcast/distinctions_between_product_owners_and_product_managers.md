The roles of [[the_role_of_a_product_manager | product manager]] and product owner, while often conflated, emerged from distinct origins and carry different responsibilities, particularly within large organizations and agile frameworks. Melissa Perry, an influential figure in the product management community and author of "Escaping the Build Trap," sheds light on these distinctions and their implications for product development. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>

## Origins of the Product Owner Role

The [[role_of_the_product_owner_in_agile_processes | product owner]] role did not emerge from product management as it is known today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:09">[00:23:09]</a>. Instead, it was developed as a way to help developers prioritize their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:50">[00:28:50]</a>.

The concept of "agile" began in 2001 with the Agile Manifesto, written by a group of software developers (not [[the_role_of_a_product_manager | product managers]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:05">[01:12:05]</a>. This movement aimed to improve software development processes and build better products through development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:05">[01:13:05]</a>.

Scrum, a framework often used by agile teams, was codified by Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:42">[01:13:42]</a>. The Scrum Guide outlines roles such as developers, scrum masters, and product owners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:03">[01:14:03]</a>.

### Product Owner in Scrum

According to the first Scrum Guide, the [[role_of_the_product_owner_in_agile_processes | product owner]] is "responsible for maximizing the value of work done" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:11">[01:16:11]</a>. The development team is responsible for performing the work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:13">[01:16:13]</a>.

Key responsibilities typically associated with a product owner in Scrum include:
*   Defining what goes into the backlog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:26">[01:14:26]</a>.
*   Writing user stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:28">[01:14:28]</a>.
*   Prioritizing work for developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:34">[01:14:34]</a>.
*   Managing the backlog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:49">[01:18:49]</a>.
*   Working with retrospectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:52">[01:18:52]</a>.
*   Maximizing the value of the team's work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:22">[01:20:22]</a>.

However, the early Scrum Guide did not describe how items entered the backlog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:07">[01:18:07]</a>. This led to the [[role_of_the_product_owner_in_agile_processes | product owner]] often acting as an "order-taker," listening to requirements and simply translating them into features without deep customer understanding or market research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:52">[01:17:52]</a>. It's a role where developers can say, "You told me to build that," removing their accountability for the outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:30">[02:28:30]</a>.

The 2013 version of the Scrum Guide removed a crucial line that stated the [[the_role_of_a_product_manager | product manager]] "may be the product owner," further separating the roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:09">[01:17:09]</a>.

## Product Owners vs. Product Managers

### Traditional Product Management
[[Role of Product Managers in Organizations | Product managers]] in Silicon Valley companies like Google and Amazon originated from a business role in software-native companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:05">[01:11:05]</a>. They perform end-to-end product management, including:
*   Market research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:24">[01:12:24]</a>.
*   Talking to customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:26">[01:12:26]</a>.
*   Working with developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:27">[01:12:27]</a>.
*   Iterating on products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:28">[01:12:28]</a>.

### The Divergence: Product Owner as a Tactical Role
When large, non-tech companies began their agile transformations, they often introduced the [[role_of_the_product_owner_in_agile_processes | product owner]] role without fully understanding product management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:54">[01:13:54]</a>. Many new product owners came from backgrounds like business analysts, project managers, or even developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:54">[01:19:54]</a>. They were trained in short, two-day classes focusing on backlog management, stand-ups, and sprint prioritization, but not on:
*   Experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:55">[01:19:55]</a>.
*   Market research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:58">[01:19:58]</a>.
*   Data analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>.
*   Other core [[attributes_of_successful_product_managers | product management skills]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:03">[01:20:03]</a>.

This led to a widespread misconception where product owners became "order-takers," focused on maintaining a full backlog for developers rather than determining if they were building the right product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:22">[01:22:22]</a>.

### SAFe's Impact on the Split
The Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) emerged to help organizations scale Scrum and other agile processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:36">[02:26:36]</a>. While useful for tying multiple teams together at scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:28">[02:27:28]</a>, SAFe formalizes a distinct split between [[the_role_of_a_product_manager | product managers]] and [[role_of_the_product_owner_in_agile_processes | product owners]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:21">[02:30:21]</a>.

In SAFe:
*   The [[role_of_the_product_owner_in_agile_processes | product owner]] is part of the agile team, working closely with scrum masters and developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:25">[02:30:25]</a>. Their role is often deeply tactical, ensuring developers have a full backlog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:07">[02:42:07]</a>.
*   The [[the_role_of_a_product_manager | product manager]] is placed at a higher level, sitting with system architects and release train engineers, responsible for strategic direction and vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:34">[02:30:34]</a>.

This structure often means [[the_role_of_a_product_manager | product managers]] feed requirements to product owners, who then translate them into user stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:50">[02:50:50]</a>. This setup can lead to product owners working on a very narrow level, sometimes even "finding work to do so people wouldn't get fired" if no clear priorities exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:07">[03:07:07]</a>.

## Challenges and Realities of Working as a Product Manager

### Criticisms of SAFe and Rigid Processes
Many organizations adopt SAFe because it offers a "plug and play" operating model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>, appealing to executives who need a structured approach at scale, especially in companies that didn't grow up building software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:02">[03:40:02]</a>.

However, critics argue that SAFe and rigid agile processes can be "Overkill" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>. Common [[challenges_in_product_management | challenges and realities of working as a product manager]] in such environments include:
*   **Lack of Discovery**: Teams commit to quarterly plans without sufficient customer research or hypothesis testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>.
*   **Meeting Overload**: Too many prescribed meetings can prevent actual work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:16">[02:26:16]</a>.
*   **Developer Dependency**: Developers can become reliant on the [[role_of_the_product_owner_in_agile_processes | product owner]] to tell them what to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>.
*   **Focus on Process over Outcomes**: Conversations shift from serving customers and achieving market goals to adherence to stand-ups and release planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>.
*   **Disconnect from Value**: Processes fail to connect the value being delivered back to business goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>.
*   **Limited Career Paths**: In many organizations, product owners lack a clear career path to more strategic [[the_role_of_a_product_manager | product manager]] roles, often being seen as separate "business lines" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>.

Melissa Perry states, "Every single person I have talked to who likes safe found success with safe, they ended up ripping it up and making it into something else" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>, implying that true success comes from adapting, not strict adherence. Capital One, an early adopter of SAFe, eventually abandoned all agile and scrum roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.

## How to Bridge the Gap and Succeed

### For Companies and Leaders
To succeed in digital transformations and build great products, companies need a comprehensive "product operating model" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:00">[04:38:00]</a>, which goes beyond just development processes. This includes:
*   **Product Strategy**: A clear, well-defined product strategy that ties back to business goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>.
*   **Organizational Design**: Structuring teams around products with good coverage of skilled [[the_role_of_a_product_manager | product managers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>.
*   **Product Operations**: Ensuring the infrastructure supports teams with data access and customer interaction capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>.
*   **Culture and Incentives**: Rewarding value delivery rather than just shipping volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>.
*   **Skilled Leadership**: Bringing in experienced product leaders (e.g., Chief Product Officers) who understand how to run technology organizations and can integrate software strategy with overall company strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>.
*   **Continuous Learning**: Providing opportunities for people to learn and practice new skills, potentially by interspersing experienced PMs among less experienced ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>.

### For Product Owners Seeking Product Management Roles
If you are a [[role_of_the_product_owner_in_agile_processes | product owner]] who wants to become a [[the_role_of_a_product_manager | product manager]], focus on demonstrating product management skills:
*   **Take Ownership**: Proactively seek opportunities to engage in customer research, even if it's considered your [[the_role_of_a_product_manager | product manager]]'s job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>.
*   **Focus on Value and Outcomes**: Shift your mindset from task completion to the value delivered. Ask leaders: "What do we hope will happen when we release this? What metrics are we going to change?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>
*   **Challenge the Status Quo**: If you believe the team is working on the wrong things, gather data and present your case to management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>.
*   **Push for Career Paths**: Ask leaders about your career trajectory and how you can develop into a more strategic role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>.
*   **Rethink Your Resume**: Instead of focusing on process-oriented functions (e.g., "prioritized backlog," "wrote user stories"), describe your contributions from a value perspective:
    *   "Led the work around the login API to enhance security and meet regulatory requirements." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>
    *   "Interviewed users and collaborated with legal and compliance teams to translate requirements into solutions." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>
    *   "Launched a feature that resulted in X% increase in Y metric, improving customer engagement/satisfaction." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>
    *   Consider listing your title as "Product Owner/Product Manager" on your resume to indicate your broader capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:29:00">[06:29:00]</a>.

### Certifications (CSPO)

Certifications like Certified Scrum Product Owner (CSPO) are often obtained through short, two-day classes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:00">[06:37:00]</a>. While they might be required for promotion in some large enterprises or help secure roles in organizations adopting Scrum/SAFe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:00">[07:29:00]</a>, they generally do not prepare individuals for the full scope of [[the_role_of_a_product_manager | product management]] responsibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>. Tech companies typically value experience over certifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:28:00">[07:28:00]</a>.

> "If you look at [agile methodologies] with small agile, what we're really saying there is we want to be able to move quickly and deliver great value to customers. If you embrace those principles, you're going to do well." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:27">[01:17:27]</a>

Ultimately, product owners should aspire to become product managers, as the latter role is fundamental to building successful products regardless of whether Scrum is used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>. The absence of product owners in leading tech companies like Google, Amazon, and Netflix underscores that the role is not a prerequisite for scaling product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:12:00">[06:12:00]</a>.

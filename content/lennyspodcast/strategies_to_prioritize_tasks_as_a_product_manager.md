### The LNO Framework: Prioritizing Your Time

Product managers, especially new ones in high-performance environments, often feel overwhelmed by endless to-do lists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:59">[00:39:59]</a>. The LNO framework helps by categorizing tasks based on their leverage:

*   **L-tasks (Leverage tasks)**: These tasks yield 10x or 100x return for the effort invested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:42">[00:41:42]</a>. Examples include working on a Product Requirements Document (PRD) for a feature that will meaningfully impact revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:16">[00:43:16]</a>, or aligning two teams where that alignment creates significant impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:42">[00:50:42]</a>.
*   **N-tasks (Neutral tasks)**: These tasks provide a return roughly equal to the effort put in (e.g., 1x effort for 1.1x return) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:02">[00:42:02]</a>.
*   **O-tasks (Overhead tasks)**: These tasks give back much less impact than the effort put in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:14">[00:42:14]</a>. An example is perfecting an expense report <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:47">[00:43:47]</a>.

A common pitfall for ambitious or perfectionist individuals is treating all task types the same way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:22">[00:42:22]</a>. The key is to:
*   **Focus heavily on L-tasks**: Tackle them when you are most productive and energetic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:55">[00:42:55]</a>. Allow your "inner perfectionist" to shine on these tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:08">[00:43:08]</a>.
*   **Minimize time on N- and O-tasks**: These are where you cut corners, not adding unnecessary detail or effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:35">[00:43:35]</a>.
*   **Context matters**: The same activity (e.g., filing a bug report, taking notes) can be an L, N, or O task depending on the situation and its importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:05">[00:45:05]</a>.

PMs implicitly know their L-tasks because those are the ones bothering them the most, often due to procrastination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:24">[00:48:24]</a>. This procrastination often stems from a fear of tackling something difficult or ambiguous, or a doubt about one's ability to succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:09">[00:50:09]</a>.

**Tactics for tackling L-tasks**:
1.  **Placebo Productivity**: Intentionally complete N and O tasks in the days leading up to an L-task to trick yourself into feeling ready for the main, high-leverage work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:32">[00:51:32]</a>.
2.  **Change of Location**: Working from a different physical space (e.g., coffee shop, co-working space) can force focus and shift mindset for L-tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:11">[00:52:11]</a>.

### Beyond ROI: Minimizing Opportunity Cost

In high-leverage roles like product management or founding a company, hundreds of tasks offer a positive Return on Investment (ROI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:38">[01:14:38]</a>. However, focusing solely on ROI can be suboptimal and even harmful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:07">[01:15:07]</a>.

*   **The ROI Problem**: ROI calculation (value created - cost of time / cost of time) often encourages reducing the denominator (time taken) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:20">[01:15:20]</a>. This leads to prioritizing "low-hanging fruit" and "quick wins" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:04">[01:16:04]</a>, filling up the plate with small tasks that might miss larger, more impactful opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:17">[01:16:17]</a>.
*   **Minimizing Opportunity Cost**: Opportunity cost is the value of the optimal option minus the value of the chosen option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:42">[01:16:42]</a>. Shifting to this mindset means asking, "Is this the *best* use of my time?" rather than just "Is this a *good* use of my time?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:10">[01:17:10]</a>. This subtle but profound shift pushes individuals and teams to pick things they would have never considered with an ROI-only mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:17">[01:17:17]</a>.

**Implementing Opportunity Cost Thinking**:
*   Leaders should provide the freedom and permission for teams to explore and attack big opportunities, even if they are ambiguous and require more initial work to flesh out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:36">[01:21:36]</a>.
*   **Time Allocation Guidance**: Leaders can clarify rough allocation percentages for different types of activities during planning. For instance, emulating Google's classic 70/20/10 rule:
    *   **60%** for incrementals (features improving daily user lives â€“ typically high ROI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:12">[01:23:12]</a>
    *   **30%** for big new initiatives (which minimize opportunity cost) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:37">[01:23:37]</a>
    *   **10%** for stability and infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:49">[01:23:49]</a>

### Understanding the Three Levels of Product Work: Impact, Execution, and Optics

Conflicts within product teams and organizations often arise from a mismatch in the "level" of work people are focused on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:54">[00:53:54]</a>. The three levels are:

1.  **Impact**: Focusing on the ultimate outcome, such as impact on customers, brand, or revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:38">[00:56:38]</a>. CEOs and founders often operate at this level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:45">[00:56:45]</a>.
2.  **Execution**: Focusing on what it takes to get things done, hitting milestones, and daily tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:20">[00:56:20]</a>. PMs often get fixated here <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:13">[00:56:13]</a>.
3.  **Optics**: Creating awareness, excitement, and opportunities for feedback about the impact and execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:39">[00:58:39]</a>. Internal optics are crucial for energy, awareness, and feedback, leading to greater impact and better execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:16">[00:59:16]</a>.

The challenge arises when these levels are out of balance or misaligned within an organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:38">[00:59:38]</a>. For example, if an organization implicitly signals that strong optics are enough for reward, it can lead to a culture where optics become the goal, rather than supporting impact and execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:03">[01:00:03]</a>.

The goal is not to declare one level "right" and others "wrong," but to use this framework to [[common_challenges_and_solutions_in_product_management | communicate]] and align as a team on what is most important given the current context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:20">[01:01:20]</a>. For early-stage teams, optimizing for execution might be paramount to convert insights into a product quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:07">[01:02:07]</a>. For a platform team experiencing availability issues, a temporary focus on optics (better communication, status updates) might be needed alongside addressing technical debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>.

### Addressing Execution Problems: Beyond the Surface

Many perceived "execution problems" in high-performing, well-intentioned organizations are often deeper issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:13">[01:04:13]</a>. They can be:

1.  **[[advice_for_improving_strategic_thinking_in_product_managers | Strategy]] Problems**: Misalignment between teams often stems from unclear or conflicting strategies, or a lack of understanding of the overall organizational direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:40">[01:07:40]</a>. Without a clear strategy, teams might craft misaligned OKRs and lack a sense of priority or how to adapt when reality changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:01">[01:08:01]</a>.
2.  **Culture Problems**: An organizational culture that prioritizes individual team OKRs over company-wide collaboration can lead to misalignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:03">[01:09:03]</a>. If a team fears negative performance reviews for helping another team at the expense of their own OKRs, setting up more meetings won't solve the underlying cultural issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:37">[01:09:37]</a>.
3.  **Interpersonal Problems**: Sometimes, misalignment simply arises from two key individuals not getting along <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:55">[01:09:55]</a>. A leader's role is to spot this and coach them through their differences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:12">[01:10:12]</a>.

**Identifying true execution problems**: While the above are deeper issues, some problems are genuinely execution-related:
*   **Infrastructure issues**: Outdated or unsustainable infrastructure that causes slow performance or outages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:03">[01:11:03]</a>.
*   **Skills gaps**: Teams lacking specific technical or functional skills required for their tasks (e.g., engineers unskilled in certain tech, a 0-to-1 PM managing a mature initiative) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:30">[01:11:30]</a>.

A tell-tale sign that an "execution problem" is actually a deeper issue is when band-aid solutions are repeatedly applied but fail to resolve the problem long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:26">[01:12:26]</a>. Organizations often have surprisingly short memories, applying new "band-aids" without addressing the root cause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:45">[01:12:45]</a>.

### The Power of Pre-mortems

Pre-mortems are a proactive ritual for identifying potential failures before they happen, much like a "post-mortem" (or after-action review) but conducted in advance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:44">[02:27:44]</a>.

**How it works**:
1.  **The Prompt**: Gather the team working on an important project or initiative early on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:45">[02:28:45]</a>. The leader starts by asking everyone to imagine the project has miserably failed six months from now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:30">[02:29:30]</a>.
2.  **Brainstorming Failure**: The team then works backward, discussing "what went wrong" and "what could have contributed to this utter failure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:48">[02:29:48]</a>.
3.  **Benefits**:
    *   **Psychological Safety**: This hypothetical scenario gives team members license to voice concerns they might otherwise hesitate to bring up due to a desire to be positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:26">[02:30:26]</a>.
    *   **Shared Vocabulary**: Using terms like "tigers," "paper tigers," and "elephants" (concepts borrowed and adapted from other methodologies) creates a common language for discussing threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:50">[02:31:50]</a>.
        *   **Tiger**: A threat that "will actually kill us" (problematic and harmful) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:12">[02:32:12]</a>.
        *   **Paper Tiger**: A seeming threat that others might worry about, but you are not concerned about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:26">[02:32:26]</a>.
        *   **Elephant**: The "elephant in the room" that nobody is talking about, which might not kill the project but represents an unaddressed reality (e.g., assuming user adoption without a clear plan) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:39">[02:32:39]</a>.
4.  **Execution**:
    *   Include people from every function involved (e.g., engineering, design, sales, marketing, support, PR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:22">[02:34:22]</a>. For large launches, consider separate pre-mortems for engineering and go-to-market aspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:28">[02:34:28]</a>.
    *   Alternate between speaking and quiet time for individual reflection and entry of concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:43">[02:35:43]</a>.
    *   Ask participants to pick the "scariest tiger" mentioned by someone else to identify collective top concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:13">[02:36:13]</a>.
    *   The leader is responsible for prioritizing the identified threats and creating a post-pre-mortem action plan to address them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:34">[02:36:34]</a>.

Pre-mortems help identify issues that would likely have resulted in problematic situations or public backlash later, saving significant time and effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:18">[02:37:18]</a>. They provide an inexpensive way to surface hidden problems and lead to more rigorous thinking.

### High Agency: A Core Trait for Product Managers

High agency, a term coined by Eric Weinstein, describes the ability to find a way to achieve what you want without waiting for perfect conditions or blaming circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:24">[02:25:24]</a>. High-agency individuals either push through adverse conditions or manage to reverse them to achieve their goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:42">[02:25:42]</a>.

This trait is particularly crucial for product managers due to the constant "adverse conditions" they face: limited resources, legacy infrastructure, staffing issues, customer problems, and more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:04">[02:26:04]</a>.

**Key components of high agency in PMs**:
1.  **Strong Ownership**: Taking full responsibility for outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:42">[02:27:42]</a>.
2.  **Creative Execution**: Finding innovative ways to overcome challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:52">[02:27:52]</a>.
3.  **Resilience**: Persisting in the face of difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:04">[02:28:04]</a>.

High agency often differentiates [[top_attributes_of_a_successful_product_manager | successful product managers]] who exceed expectations from those who might have great potential on paper but struggle to deliver impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:52">[02:26:52]</a>.

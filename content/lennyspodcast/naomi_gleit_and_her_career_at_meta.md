Naomi Gleit serves as the Head of Product at Meta and is the longest-serving executive at the company, second only to Mark Zuckerberg himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. She joined Facebook as employee number 29 in 2005 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>, when the company had only 30 employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. Having been with Meta (formerly Facebook) for almost 20 years, she has witnessed its remarkable growth from a small startup to a $1.5 trillion business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## Early Career and [[Navigating career transitions and promotions | Growth]] at Facebook

Gleit's journey to becoming employee number 29 was unconventional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. While at Stanford, she wrote her senior thesis on why Facebook would succeed against its competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. Driven by her conviction, she repeatedly "cold called" and walked into Facebook's Palo Alto office, located above a Chinese restaurant, even though there were no immediate openings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. She persevered, doing so five to ten more times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. Her persistence eventually led to an interview for Sean Parker's personal assistant role, which she did not get <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. A few months later, a marketing role opened up, and despite having a competing offer from LinkedIn, she chose Facebook due to her interest in social networking and observing the product-market fit among Stanford students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. This decision exemplified the advice: "when you are getting on a rocket ship, don't ask what seat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.

After joining as a marketing employee, Gleit's dream was to become a Product Manager (PM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. Despite not having a technical background, she took the same persistent approach to transition into product management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. She would visit the second floor, where PMs and engineers worked, after hours and volunteer for projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. By the time she formally applied for a PM role, she had been doing the job informally for months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. Upon receiving the PM position and moving her desk to the second floor, she was met with a standing ovation from the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.

## Role as Head of Product at Meta

As the Head of Product, Gleit oversees hundreds of PMs directly, but feels responsible for the entire PM community of thousands at Meta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>. Her focus includes PM performance, culture, onboarding, and training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>. She views PMs as a "huge point of leverage" for accomplishing company goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>.

### Insights from the Legendary Growth Team

Gleit was part of Facebook's early and legendary growth team, which pioneered many core growth techniques in tech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:57">[00:25:57]</a>.

*   **Activation Metric**: The well-known "seven friends in 10 days" or "10 friends in 14 days" metric was indeed real <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:32">[00:26:32]</a>. This metric wasn't about a precise number, but rather a rallying point for the team to focus on engagement and retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:20">[00:34:20]</a>.
*   **Shift to Retention**: Initially, the growth team focused heavily on acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:51">[00:26:51]</a>. However, through "growth accounting" (new users - stale users + resurrected users), they discovered that churn and resurrection lines were larger than new user acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:51">[00:26:51]</a>. This revelation shifted their focus to retention and engagement, recognizing that product experience was the biggest lever for growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:16">[00:27:16]</a>.
*   **[[Magic loop concept for career growth | Understand, Identify, Execute]] Framework**: In 2009, the growth team paused all other roadmap items to focus solely on data instrumentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:14">[00:30:14]</a>. This allowed them to understand drop-offs in flows (e.g., registration, onboarding) and identify key opportunities for growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:20">[00:30:20]</a>. The principle: "Why guess when you can know" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:01">[00:30:01]</a>.
*   **Product-Driven Growth**: The team pioneered applying a data-driven, product-driven approach to growth, an area historically managed by marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:08">[00:29:08]</a>. This extended to areas like social impact, where instead of a traditional CSR wing, they built a product to raise money from the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:12">[00:31:12]</a>, and site translations, by building an in-line translation tool for users to contribute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:07">[00:33:07]</a>.
*   **Removing Barriers**: The growth team focused on removing both macro and micro barriers to adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:31">[00:39:31]</a>. Macro barriers included expanding access beyond college students to high school students, work networks, and eventually anyone with an email address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:05">[00:40:05]</a>. This also included efforts like internet.org to provide internet access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:27">[00:40:27]</a>. Micro barriers involved optimizing flows, such as allowing account confirmation through any notification click, not just the specific email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:22">[00:41:22]</a>.

## Leadership Philosophy: "Naomi-isms"

Gleit relies on her "Naomi-isms," principles she's learned and repeats, to guide her work and teach others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:15">[00:45:15]</a>.

*   **PM as a Conductor**: A PM's role is to act as a conductor for their team, ensuring all functions (legal, policy, engineering, design, etc.) play their part in harmony and at the right tempo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:14">[00:46:14]</a>. The PM is not the star of the show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:10">[00:47:10]</a>.
*   **[[Authenticity and success in the tech industry | Extreme Clarity]]**: This means everyone has the same understanding of the facts, even if they disagree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:15">[00:49:15]</a>. It prevents misunderstandings from wasting time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:50">[00:49:50]</a>.
    *   **Canonical Nomenclature**: Using a shared vocabulary, defining terms clearly to avoid confusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:11">[00:50:11]</a> (e.g., distinguishing "consistency" from "accuracy") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:37">[00:50:37]</a>.
    *   **Visuals and Real-time Editing**: Using visuals in meetings and editing them in real-time to document decisions and next steps, ensuring everyone is aligned before leaving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:17">[00:51:17]</a>.
    *   **Numbered Lists**: Preferring numbered lists over bullet points for easy reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:25">[00:52:25]</a>.
*   **Canonical Everything**: Every project needs one "canonical doc" that serves as the single source of truth, linking to all other relevant documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:45">[00:53:45]</a>.
    *   This document should include discrete work streams, single-threaded owners for each (DRIs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:08">[00:54:08]</a>, and the established processes (canonical meetings, email lists, chat groups) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:49">[00:54:49]</a>.
    *   She believes in frameworks with visual representations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:33">[00:55:33]</a>.
*   **Simplification**: When tackling complex problems, Gleit often "simplifies" by establishing a "kindergarten level" understanding of the project's basic building blocks, then gradually adding complexity ("school pyramid" approach) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:25">[00:56:25]</a>. This process often reveals the most critical issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:41">[00:57:41]</a>.
*   **Focus on People/Process**: She believes 80% of project issues are related to people or process, rather than strategy or execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:21">[00:58:21]</a>. She prioritizes perfect execution because only then can one accurately evaluate whether the strategy was right or wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:41">[00:58:41]</a>.

## Working with Mark Zuckerberg

Naomi Gleit has known Mark Zuckerberg for over 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>.
*   **Zuck's Transformation**: Gleit notes that the public is now seeing the Mark she's known for two decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>. She describes him as a "learn-it-all, not a know-it-all" who rapidly upskills in various areas, from learning Chinese to MMA and [[Impact of speaking as a meta skill | public speaking]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>.
*   **[[Metas corporate culture and management | A Good Friend]]**: Beyond his public persona, Gleit emphasizes Zuckerberg as a "really good friend" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>. She recounts a period in 2014 when she was going through a hard time, and Mark invited her to volunteer with him, teaching middle school students in East Palo Alto how to build a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>.
*   **Mark's Four Life Lessons**: During their class, Mark shared four life lessons he wrote on a chalkboard:
    1.  Love yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>
    2.  Only then can you truly serve others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>
    3.  Focus on what you can control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>
    4.  For those things, never give up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>
*   **The "Small Group"**: Mark manages Meta's 86,000+ employees through a "small group" of core executives who work on the most important projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>. This group is characterized by long-tenured members motivated by mission rather than career advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>.
    *   **Disagreeable Givers**: Gleit describes them as "disagreeable givers" – people who are motivated by what's best for the company but are willing to push back and provide direct, honest feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:32">[00:21:32]</a>. Mark cultivates a culture of accurate feedback loops to avoid becoming isolated from reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>.
    *   **Meeting Structure**: The small group holds one weekly strategic meeting (open-ended discussion) and one weekly operational meeting (highly structured, tactical updates on priority projects) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:27">[00:23:27]</a>.

## Recent Projects: Teen Accounts

Gleit recently led the launch of Teen Accounts on Instagram, a highly complex and cross-functional project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:56">[01:00:56]</a>. This initiative sets the safest default settings for all teens under 16 on Instagram, requiring parental permission to change them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:43">[01:01:43]</a>. A significant feature is the automatic transition of millions of public teen accounts to private unless parents approve otherwise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:03">[01:03:03]</a>. The project's North Star was always empowering parents, as "parents know best" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:15">[01:04:15]</a>. Gleit suggests that Apple and Google making user age available to developers would be an elegant solution for age verification across all apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:01">[01:05:01]</a>.

## Personal Habits and Reflections

Naomi Gleit shares several personal practices that contribute to her success and well-being:

*   **Running Meetings**:
    *   Send a pre-read agenda 24 hours in advance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:05">[01:07:05]</a>.
    *   Meetings should ideally be for decisions, with three options and a recommendation presented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:04">[01:08:04]</a>.
    *   Use a "traffic light" system (red, yellow, green) in a table to evaluate options against criteria, providing a clear visual overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:50">[01:09:50]</a>.
    *   Real-time edit the projected visual to document decisions and next steps during the meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:17">[01:08:17]</a>.
    *   Send meeting notes (reply-all to the calendar invite) within 24 hours post-meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:30">[01:08:30]</a>.
*   **"My Four Must-Haves"**: She identifies four non-negotiable needs to perform well: eat, sleep, alone time (as an introvert), and exercise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:48">[01:12:48]</a>.
*   **Exercise**: She considers exercise a "non-negotiable" part of her morning routine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:32">[01:13:32]</a>. Her personal goal of doing five pull-ups, which less than 1% of women can do, taught her she "can do hard things" and built confidence applicable to other areas of her life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:11">[01:14:11]</a>. She emphasizes the mental health benefits of exercise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:39">[01:14:39]</a>.
*   **Sleep**: Recently prioritizing sleep hygiene (blackout shades, eye masks, 8 Sleep bed) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:01">[01:13:01]</a>.
*   **Developing a First-Party Perspective**: To form her own informed opinions on projects, she schedules dedicated two-to-three-hour blocks for thinking, sometimes with one or two trusted sparring partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:05">[01:23:05]</a>.
*   **Surfing**: Gleit is an avid surfer, finding parallels between surfing and life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:40">[01:34:40]</a>. Her key lesson from surfing is to "stand up into the fear," committing fully to the wave even when scared, as hesitation can be more dangerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:12">[01:35:12]</a>.
*   **Life Motto**: "Pressure is privilege" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:12">[01:33:12]</a> – this reminds her to be grateful for challenging opportunities.

Building an indistractable workplace is crucial for fostering productivity and employee well-being in an increasingly connected world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:22">[01:00:22]</a>. While individual practices are important, the organizational environment plays a significant role in enabling or hindering focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:56">[00:56:56]</a>.

## Distraction as a Symptom of Dysfunction
Distraction within an organization is often a symptom of underlying dysfunction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:41">[01:01:41]</a>. If employees feel unable to discuss problems related to constant emails, notifications, or interruptions, then the inability to address these issues is the real problem, not just the technology itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:38">[01:01:38]</a>. Solving this requires a shift in [[company_culture_and_decision_making | organizational culture]] to address distraction like any other business challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:06">[01:02:06]</a>.

## Three Traits of Indistractable Companies
Indistractable companies share three key traits that enable employees to maintain focus and productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:04">[01:01:04]</a>:

### Psychological Safety
The first trait is providing employees with psychological safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:08">[01:01:08]</a>. This concept, researched by Amy Edmonson at Harvard Business School, means that employees must feel safe to raise concerns without fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:10">[01:01:10]</a>. For instance, an employee should be able to state that they cannot do their best work if constantly expected to reply to every email or notification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:28">[01:01:28]</a>. This open dialogue is crucial for identifying and solving problems related to distraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:58">[01:01:58]</a>.

### Forum for Discussion
Second, employees need a forum to discuss these distraction-related problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:10">[01:02:10]</a>. For example, Slack, despite its potential for distraction (being cited as the second most distracting workplace technology after email) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:29">[01:02:29]</a>, created specific channels for employees to voice their "beefs" with the company, such as "beef tweets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:08">[01:03:08]</a>. Management didn't necessarily fix every problem, but they acknowledged employee voices, often using emojis like a green checkmark for fixed issues or eye emojis for acknowledged ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:17">[01:03:17]</a>. Similarly, the Boston Consulting Group transitioned from being a highly distractable company to a top workplace by implementing meetings where employees discuss "predictable time off" (PTO) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:44">[01:03:44]</a>.

### Management Exemplification
The third and most important trait is that management must exemplify what it means to be indistractable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:04">[01:04:04]</a>. [[Leadership and company culture | Culture flows downhill]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:12">[01:04:12]</a>, so employees observe and adopt the behaviors of their leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:15">[01:04:15]</a>. At Slack headquarters, for instance, a prominent sign in the canteen read, "Work hard and go home" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:22">[01:04:22]</a>. This message reinforced that employees were expected to work efficiently without distraction, rather than working excessive hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:47">[01:04:47]</a>. If employees used Slack on nights and weekends, they were reprimanded, as it wasn't part of the [[creating_and_maintaining_team_culture_and_passion | company culture]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:51">[01:04:51]</a>. This deliberate approach helps in [[building_a_strong_company_culture_in_a_fastgrowing_company | building a strong company culture]] around focus.

## Practical Advice for Employees: Schedule Syncing
Even if a company isn't fully indistractable, individual employees can take proactive steps to manage their time and attention, especially with their managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:51">[01:05:51]</a>. This is known as "schedule syncing" or "managing your manager" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:02">[01:06:02]</a>.

Instead of saying "no" to a manager's requests (which can be risky) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:47">[01:06:47]</a>, employees should proactively schedule a brief 10-minute meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:11">[01:06:11]</a>. During this meeting, they can present their time-box calendar for their working hours, showing allocated time for email, meetings, and major projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:16">[01:06:16]</a>. Alongside this, they can present a list of tasks the manager has requested that are proving difficult to fit into the current schedule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:27">[01:06:27]</a>.

The goal is to ask the manager to help prioritize these tasks, as prioritization is a core part of a manager's job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:01">[01:07:01]</a>. By demonstrating how time is currently being spent, managers can easily identify tasks that can be swapped out or deprioritized, leading to more efficient work and a better understanding of time allocation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:15">[01:07:15]</a>. This approach builds trust and helps in [[cultural_elements_fostering_team_ownership_and_impact | fostering team ownership and impact]] by clearly defining responsibilities and time commitments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:38">[01:07:38]</a>. This also relates to the idea that knowledge work output depends on inputs: time and attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:18">[01:09:18]</a>.

## Overcoming the "Addiction" Myth in the Workplace
A common misconception that hinders focus in the workplace is the idea that people are "addicted" to technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:13">[01:13:13]</a>. While pathological addiction affects a small percentage of the population (3-5%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:08">[01:13:08]</a>, overusing the term for everyday distractions is misleading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:13">[01:13:13]</a>. Calling a distraction an "addiction" is problematic because it removes personal responsibility, suggesting an inability to control behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:51">[01:13:51]</a>.

Instead, for the vast majority of adults, technology overuse is a personal responsibility issue that can be overcome with the right tools and mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:27">[01:14:27]</a>. This perspective encourages agency and proactive behavior to manage distractions.

## Social Antibodies and Cultural Change
Societal change can also influence workplace culture. Just as "social antibodies" emerged to make smoking socially unacceptable in most indoor spaces (e.g., politely asking someone to smoke outside) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:09">[00:57:09]</a>, similar norms can develop around technology use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:06">[00:58:06]</a>.

People can adopt an "indistractable" identity, setting new manners and expectations for interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:41">[01:11:41]</a>. For instance, someone might politely ask companions to put away phones during a meal to ensure full presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:19">[01:17:19]</a>. In a workplace setting, this could mean establishing "no phone zones" during meetings to ensure focused discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:28">[01:17:28]</a>. This deliberate adoption of new behaviors, supported by new technologies designed to counteract previous distractions (e.g., productivity apps), helps in [[scaling_a_company_culture_while_maintaining_user_trust | scaling a company culture]] that values focus and intent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:41">[00:59:41]</a>. It promotes [[cultivating_an_entrepreneurial_culture_within_organizations | cultivating an entrepreneurial culture within organizations]] that is adaptable and self-correcting.

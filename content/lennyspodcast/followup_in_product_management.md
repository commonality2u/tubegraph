One of the three common threads identified across the best product managers (PMs) is their ability to follow up on results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>. While many individuals will specify a metric they care about for a product, "really, really good PMs remember to follow up" on whether that metric moved or what happened after a feature was launched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:19:00">[08:19:00]</a>.

It is considered "rare" for PMs to proactively report back on results without being prompted by their leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:00">[08:31:00]</a>. Despite its high value, this activity is "not hard to do," especially if metric tracking is already in place or if there is assistance in pulling the information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:43:00">[08:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:00">[08:48:00]</a>.

## How to Follow Up

To ensure follow-up, a practical tip is to set reminders in a calendar. After a product launch, schedule reminders to check dashboards or metrics after a few weeks, a month, and then again after six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:50:00">[21:50:00]</a>. The information should then be shared with anyone who might benefit from it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:15:00">[22:15:00]</a>.

## Benefits of Consistent Follow-Up

Following up on results offers several significant benefits for product managers:

*   **Increased Visibility and Trust**
    *   It helps managers perceive the PM as reliable and "on top of everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:25:00">[22:25:00]</a>.
    *   It builds trust by ensuring that no threads are forgotten, allowing managers to feel confident that the PM will report on experiment outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:34:00">[23:34:00]</a>.
    *   Being proactive in sharing progress prevents reliance on a manager noticing good work, especially since great managers are "few and far between" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:53:00">[22:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:04:00">[23:04:00]</a>.

*   **Continuous Learning and [[Improving product management skills | Skill Development]]**
    *   Following up on outcomes provides a critical opportunity to learn why something happened or didn't happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:56:00">[23:56:00]</a>.
    *   The more a PM follows up and learns, the better they become with each product shipped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:02:00">[24:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:06:00">[24:06:00]</a>.
    *   This continuous learning through shipping is why it takes years to build expertise in product management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:12:00">[24:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:39:00">[24:39:00]</a>.

*   **Driving [[Effective product management strategies | Impact]]**
    *   Following up directly contributes to creating impact, which is a key trait of a great PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:48:00">[10:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:13:00">[27:13:00]</a>.
    *   The ability to follow through and ensure results are measured and understood is what ultimately makes a product and the PM successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:27:00">[09:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:00">[09:30:00]</a>.

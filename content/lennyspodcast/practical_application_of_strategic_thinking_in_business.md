Strategic thinking is essential for businesses to thrive, yet many struggle with its practical application. This is a topic explored by Roger Martin, a renowned strategy advisor and author of "Playing to Win."

## Why Strategy is Challenging
Many people are "bad at strategy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> for several reasons:
*   **Intellectual Difficulty** Strategy is an integrative activity, requiring answers to many questions that must fit together and reinforce one another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:00">[07:10:00]</a>. It's about designing a coherent diet for health rather than just choosing lunch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a>.
*   **Emotional Intimidation** It involves making difficult choices to do some things and not others, leading to accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:56:00">[07:56:00]</a>.
*   **Inadequate Training** What's currently taught in business schools "generally sucks," being overly theoretical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:34:00">[08:34:00]</a>. The resource-based view of the firm, a popular academic theory, is considered "silly" and rarely used in the real world because it doesn't provide guidance on which resources to invest in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:49:00">[09:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:15:00">[11:15:00]</a>. Furthermore, many strategy consulting firms do less actual strategy work, focusing instead on areas like post-merger integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:00">[09:06:00]</a>. Consequently, people aren't adequately prepared educationally or within companies to develop strong strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:21:00">[09:21:00]</a>.

## The Strategy Choice Cascade
Roger Martin's framework for [[developing_a_product_strategy | developing a product strategy]] is called the "Strategy Choice Cascade" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>. It consists of five interconnected questions that, when answered cohesively, form an integrated set of choices that compels desired customer action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:59">[01:46:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>.

The five questions are:
1.  **What is Your Winning Aspiration?** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>
    *   This sets the context for choices and clarifies what you are trying to accomplish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>.
    *   An aspiration should be framed around solving customer needs or issues, rather than just market expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>.
2.  **Where Will You Play?** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>
    *   Define the specific playing field (e.g., target customers, product types, distribution channels, vertical stages in the value chain) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>.
    *   For example, Four Seasons chose to focus solely on hotel management, opting out of real estate development and ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>.
3.  **How Will You Win?** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>
    *   To win, a company must be either differentiated (creating superior customer value) or the lowest cost provider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.
    *   "Playing to play" (just being in the game) means customers can "flip a coin" between your product and a competitor's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.
    *   If you're not differentiated or lowest cost, you cannot protect yourself and are at the mercy of competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.
    *   Both low cost and differentiation are legitimate strategies, though achieving dominant scale is often crucial for cost leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>.
4.  **What Capabilities Must You Have?** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>
    *   These are the unique strengths that enable the company to win in the chosen playing field. They should be hard for competitors to replicate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>.
    *   For example, Westlaw's extensive, lawyer-curated legal search database is a capability built over a century that competitors cannot easily match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>.
5.  **What Enabling Management Systems are Required?** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>
    *   These are the systems and processes that ensure the capabilities are built and maintained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.
    *   For Four Seasons, this involved a different approach to recruiting, onboarding, and career development to achieve a low staff turnover rate (10% vs. 80% industry average), allowing them to train staff to deliver customized luxury service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>.

These capabilities and management systems form the company's "moat," making it difficult for others to copy and thus protecting its [[importance_of_understanding_systems_in_strategic_thinking | competitive advantage]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a>. A nuanced and multifaceted set of capabilities and systems discourages competitors from choosing the same "where to play" and "how to win," leading to more sustainable success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:57">[01:00:57]</a>.

## Real-World Examples of Applied Strategy
*   **Procter & Gamble (P&G)**: P&G trains its brand managers, who are often deep within the organization, to make critical strategic choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>. This focus on distributed strategic thinking is why 10% of S&P 500 CEOs are ex-P&G employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>.
*   **Southwest Airlines**: By focusing on a low-cost model (single aircraft type, point-to-point routes, flexible union labor, direct booking), Southwest became the only airline to consistently earn its cost of capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>. Competitors couldn't match their prices without fundamentally restructuring their own businesses, demonstrating the power of "counterposing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:52">[01:02:52]</a>.
*   **Olay (P&G)**: Olay's successful repositioning in the mass market, offering prestige-level skincare at a lower price point, was protected by the "fault line" created by Estee Lauder's channel conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. Clinique (an Estee Lauder brand) could have crushed Olay but doing so would have cannibalized Estee Lauder's lucrative prestige department store business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>.

## Navigating Change: The "Customer Tide"
Even powerful companies cannot indefinitely hold back the "customer tide" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:51">[01:09:51]</a>. If customers want to shop or consume in a certain way, companies must adapt, even if it threatens their current business model. Examples include:
*   Walmart's initial reluctance to embrace e-commerce, giving Amazon a massive scale advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>.
*   Traditional automakers' slow adoption of electric vehicles, giving Tesla a significant head start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>.
*   Google's dilemma with AI-powered search (direct answers) versus its ad-supported "Blue Links" model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>.
*   Vanguard's eventual adoption of ETFs despite the founder's initial preference for mutual funds, as customers demanded ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.
*   Microsoft's decline in "share of minutes spent staring at a smart screen" due to its focus on PC operating systems while missing the smartphone and tablet revolutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:16">[01:11:16]</a>.

Companies must scramble and sometimes suffer economic downturns, but ultimately, they cannot stop where customers want to go <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>.

## [[Becoming more strategic in product management | Becoming More Strategic]]: The "Betterment" Approach
For individuals feeling overwhelmed by strategy, the "betterment" approach offers a practical first step, emphasizing continuous improvement over perfection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>.
*   **Identify a Painful Gap**: Focus on the single most painful gap between current outcomes and desired outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>.
*   **Make Different Choices**: Use the Strategy Choice Cascade questions (winning aspiration, where to play, how to win, capabilities, management systems) to identify different choices that could close this gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>.
*   **Iterate**: Once one gap is addressed, move on to the next. Consistent, iterative betterment leads to significant long-term improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>.

## Practice Makes a Strategist
There is no such thing as a "great natural strategist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:13">[01:19:13]</a>. Great strategists, like former P&G CEO A.G. Lafley, are individuals who have practiced strategy for decades and gained extensive experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:54">[01:19:54]</a>. Anyone willing to practice making different choices to solve problems will become a better strategist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:30">[01:20:30]</a>. The worst thing to do is to wait to tackle strategy, prioritizing operational concerns over strategic ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:08">[01:21:08]</a>.

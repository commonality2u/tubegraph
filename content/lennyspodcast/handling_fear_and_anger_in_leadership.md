Matt Mashari, an executive coach who has worked with notable figures such as the CEOs of OpenAI, Coinbase, and Reddit, highlights the critical role of managing fear and anger in effective [[leadership_principles_and_skills | leadership]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. He emphasizes that while these emotions are common, understanding and addressing them is crucial for a leader's success and well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

## Overcoming Fear

Fear is identified as the biggest struggle for most successful founders and leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. It can grip the mind, preventing individuals from taking difficult but necessary actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

> "When they feel it, it grips their mind and it prevents them from seeing [the situation clearly] from doing the thing that is difficult but necessary." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>

Mashari's core philosophy is that fear gives "bad advice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. When someone is in fear, their brain makes exaggerated predictions, distorting reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.

### The "Bet" Method to Challenge Fear
To help leaders recognize and overcome fear, Mashari often proposes a "bet" where they predict an outcome driven by fear, and he predicts the opposite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. This is initially tried on a lower-stakes scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. Mashari states he has never lost this bet, demonstrating that fear often misleads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. Once a leader experiences this, a simple reminder of "I perceive you to be in fear" is often enough to shift their perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.

### Practical Application: Transparency with Investors
A common scenario where fear impacts leadership is when a CEO faces a business problem and fears telling their board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. The knee-jerk reaction is often to hide the problem, fearing a loss of trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. However, Mashari advises the opposite: be transparent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. In every instance where this advice was followed, board members expressed appreciation for the honesty and transparency, leading to increased [[importance_of_trust_and_vulnerability_in_leadership | trust]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>.

### General Advice for [[handling_limiting_beliefs_and_fears | Handling Limiting Beliefs and Fears]]
If you feel fear (especially "danger to our egos," not physical danger), the general advice is to do the opposite of what your brain is telling you to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. However, it's crucial to check with someone else who is not in fear, as they will be able to see clearly when you cannot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>.

## Managing Anger

Anger is described as a "cover" for underlying pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>. Instead of feeling the pain, the brain externalizes it as anger, which can harm relationships, especially with those closest to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>.

### Acknowledging Anger
Mashari learned from his wife how to effectively communicate when someone is acting out of anger without causing defensiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. The phrase "I perceive you to be in anger" was found to be most effective because it is an "I statement" and contains no judgment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. This allows the person to recognize their state and "wake up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

### Action When Angry
When anger arises, the immediate action should be to stop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>. Acting while angry is like "breaking glass" and destroying relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>. The deeper solution is to allow oneself to feel the underlying pain, even though it "sucks" and "hurts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>.

## Best Practices for Difficult Conversations (General)

Matt Mashari draws on his own experiences and learned frameworks to provide tactical advice for difficult conversations, often where fear or anger might surface.

### Separate Decision from Implementation
Wee Dang, CEO of Clipboard Health, taught Mashari to separate the *decision* from the *implementation* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:29">[00:24:29]</a>. The decision should prioritize the primary stakeholder (e.g., the customer in a company) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:36">[00:24:36]</a>. The implementation then addresses the concerns of those who might be hurt, seeking to help them get what they really want <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:09">[00:25:09]</a>.

### Preparing for the Conversation
Before delivering difficult news, it's crucial to prepare the person by stating, "This is going to be a difficult conversation. I want you to take a few seconds and prepare yourself, you are not going to enjoy this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>. This brief preparation can prevent the amygdala from being triggered as hard by surprise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:17">[00:30:17]</a>.

### Allowing Emotional Release and Making People Feel Heard
After delivering the news, allow the person to express their emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:07">[00:31:07]</a>. This involves:
1.  **Asking about feelings:** "My guess is you're feeling a lot of anger right now, fear, sadness. Is that true? And if so, would you be willing to share with me what you're feeling and what you're thinking?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:09">[00:31:09]</a>
2.  **Actively listening and reflecting:** Repeat back what you understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:43">[00:32:43]</a>. For deeper connection, reflect back what you *imagine* are the thoughts in their head, even if they are stronger than what was expressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:20">[00:33:20]</a>. This often reveals that their thoughts are "bigger than their words" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:07">[00:34:07]</a>.
3.  **Acting on feedback (or explaining why not):** Once they feel heard, either accept the feedback and state what you will do, or explain why you cannot accept it, sharing your own perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:13">[00:34:13]</a>.

This approach is vital, especially in situations like layoffs, to maintain a humane process and prevent severe negative reactions from those being let go <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:06">[00:47:06]</a>.

### Practical Application: Layoffs and [[managing_different_types_of_problematic_behavior_at_work | Managing Problematic Behavior]]
The most significant marker between a botched layoff and a successful one is whether the person hears the news from their manager in a one-on-one setting, rather than via email or group chat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:11">[00:47:11]</a>. Hearing it personally prevents feelings of dehumanization and allows for emotional expression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:50">[00:47:50]</a>.

Managers should act as an "agent" for the departing employee, actively helping them find their next "dream job" where they are needed and feel fulfilled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:24">[00:26:24]</a>. This active support, rather than passive offers of references, helps maintain a positive relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:49">[00:26:49]</a>.

## Continuous Learning and Improvement

Mashari emphasizes that these skills, like [[developing_leadership_skills_and_understanding_feedback | developing leadership skills]] or [[overcoming_fear_of_giving_candid_feedback | overcoming fear of giving candid feedback]], can be learned and practiced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:56">[00:34:56]</a>. His curriculum documents offer step-by-step scripts for difficult conversations, and the first successful application can be powerful motivation to continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:11">[00:35:11]</a>.

### The Energy Audit for [[worklife_balance_and_avoiding_burnout_for_leaders | Work-Life Balance and Avoiding Burnout]]
To better manage personal energy and avoid burnout, Mashari recommends an "energy audit," a concept he learned from Diana Chapman at Conscious Leadership Group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:06">[01:02:06]</a>. This audit helps individuals identify what truly energizes them versus what drains their energy.

**Four Zones of Activity:**
1.  **Incompetence:** Activities you are not good at; delegate these <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:58">[01:02:58]</a>.
2.  **Confidence:** Activities you are fine at, but others can also do fine; delegate these <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:08">[01:03:08]</a>.
3.  **Excellence:** Activities you are uniquely good at, but don't love. This is the "danger zone" where you create value but it saps your life force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:24">[01:03:24]</a>.
4.  **Genius:** Activities you are uniquely good at and love so much that "space and time disappear" when you do them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:46">[01:03:46]</a>. This is where you create massive value effortlessly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:50">[01:03:50]</a>.

**Performing the Audit:**
*   Review a representative two weeks of your calendar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:11">[01:04:11]</a>.
*   Fill in time between meetings with actual activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:17">[01:04:17]</a>.
*   Hour by hour, mark activities green if they gave you more energy, and red if they were neutral or negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:24">[01:04:24]</a>.
*   Identify themes in the "red" activities (e.g., unprepared meetings, certain types of interviews) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:48">[01:04:48]</a>.

**Addressing Energy Drains:**
For each "red" activity, ask:
1.  **Does it need to be done at all?** If not, cancel it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:18">[01:05:18]</a>.
2.  **Can someone else do it?** If so, delegate it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:23">[01:05:23]</a>.
3.  **If only I can do it, what would make it "exquisite"?** (e.g., for a team meeting, require pre-prepared updates to reduce discussion time) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:30">[01:05:30]</a>. Share this proposed methodology with the group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:11">[01:06:11]</a>.

The goal is to repeat this process until your calendar is 80% green, allowing you to naturally gravitate towards and do more of the things you love and create value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:45">[01:06:45]</a>. This process of self-discovery and aligning work with joy allows for sustainable and highly effective output, as joy is a more enduring motivator than fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:42">[01:00:42]</a>.

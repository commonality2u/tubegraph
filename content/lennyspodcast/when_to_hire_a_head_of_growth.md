The field of growth is relatively new, leading to a common misconception that a growth team is necessary from the outset to achieve product-market fit and distribution [00:00:00]. However, this is not always the case [00:09:23].

## Early-Stage Startups: Founder-Led Growth is Key

For startups, it is often a mistake to hire a head of growth too soon [00:09:13]. Instead, the founder and founding team must take responsibility for driving initial growth [00:09:34].

You do not need a growth team until you can start running experiments on your user base, which means having a sufficient volume of users to learn from, optimize, and innovate [00:10:20].

Before considering a growth team, two specific conditions must be met:
1.  **Solid Product-Market Fit (PMF)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>: This means your solution addresses a problem, and customers are not only using it but also retaining and staying with you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. You can use the Sean Ellis score (how many people would say they cannot live without your product) as an indicator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.
2.  **Sufficient Data** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>: Growth cannot function without data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. If you only have 10 users or customers, that's not enough data for analysis, hypothesis creation, or experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.

Many companies do not create growth teams until they reach significant revenue milestones, such as $1 million, $5 million, or even $100-$200 million in Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. The longer a company waits to hire a head of growth, the better, as it trains the entire company to be responsible for growth, rather than isolating it to one team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.

### Sales-Led vs. Product-Led Companies

The decision to hire a head of growth also depends on your company's primary revenue collection strategy:

*   **Sales-Led Companies** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>: If your revenue is primarily collected through a sales team, you should hire sales personnel long before a growth team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. In such companies, sales often handles monetization, activation, and retention efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>. A "growth marketing" team might be more akin to a demand generation team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>.
*   **Product-Led Companies** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>: If you are starting with self-serve monetization or relying on a product-led motion for activation or monetization, then a growth hire might come before sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. A head of growth is specifically needed when a product has components responsible for acquisition, activation, monetization, or retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>.

The general advice is to hire a head of growth only when you have clear product-market fit and are a [[working_with_sales_in_a_productled_growth_company | product-led company]], ideally beyond $1 million ARR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. This aligns with advice on [[hiring_for_growth_roles_in_startups | hiring for growth roles in startups]] and addressing [[challenges_and_strategies_in_earlystage_startup_growth | challenges and strategies in early-stage startup growth]].

## Established Companies: Not a Silver Bullet for Decline

A common mistake in more mature companies is hiring a head of growth to fix a business slowdown or decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>. If the overall business is slowing down, a head of growth is destined to fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>.

A growth team can optimize growth and potentially lift metrics by 10-15%, but it cannot fix deeper issues like core product or core marketing problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>. Growth teams amplify great product-market fit and help grow faster once growth is already occurring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>.

Therefore, for an established company experiencing declining revenue or user metrics, the first step is to plateau the decline using core product and marketing teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>. Once there are immediate signs of life and potential in the business, a growth team can then be brought in to further amplify that growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>. Hiring a growth team during a decline is often a significant waste of resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>.

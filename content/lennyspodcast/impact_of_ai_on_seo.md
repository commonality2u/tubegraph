The rise of AI has significantly shifted how SEO operates, particularly with [[integration_of_ai_in_search_results | AI answers being integrated into search results transparently]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. What was once feared as an "apocalypse" for traditional SEO has instead become a catalyst for rethinking strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Eli Schwarz, a growth advisor specializing in SEO, emphasizes that this shift forces companies to pivot their thinking about what SEO traffic truly means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

## The Shift in Search with AI Overviews (SGE)

Google and other tech companies were compelled to accelerate their AI integration into search results following the emergence of OpenAI and ChatGPT at the end of 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. ChatGPT's ability to provide written answers to any question sparked concerns that users might no longer need to click through search results, potentially rendering Google and SEO obsolete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

Google responded by launching what was initially called Search Generative Experience (SGE), now known as AI Overviews, essentially integrating a ChatGPT-like experience directly into search results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:10">[01:01:10]</a>. This strategic move was partly to satisfy Wall Street and demonstrate Google's continued innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

The main impact of AI Overviews on SEO is that it pushes traditional search results down the page, providing answers directly at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. This means users get immediate answers and may not need to click on external links <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.

### How AI Overviews Reshape the Search Journey

AI Overviews are particularly effective for "top-of-funnel" queries â€“ broad, general questions where users are in a discovery phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>. For example, instead of searching for "best beach vacation" and sifting through articles, an AI Overview can provide a summarized answer directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>. This means content that historically aimed to rank for these broad terms, like WebMD's generic health articles, will be significantly impacted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>.

The shift means the "discovery step" of search is increasingly handled by LLMs, guiding users towards a direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:37">[01:37:37]</a>. Once users have a clearer idea of what they need, they then move into "mid-funnel" searches, where traditional Google search and specific product solutions become relevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>. This is where users have intent and are looking to take action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:23">[01:32:23]</a>.

## Adapting to the New Paradigm: Thinking of SEO as a Product

To succeed in this new environment, businesses should think of SEO as a product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>. Product managers, rather than just marketers, should lead the charge on SEO questions because it revolves around the user's journey and experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:29">[00:23:29]</a>. This involves understanding how to position a product to users who are on a self-discovery journey, not those finding it through social channels or ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>.

Eli Schwarz argues that many SaaS companies, for instance, often create products without first asking what users will actually search for to find them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:02">[00:24:02]</a>. If a company cannot identify what problem a user will search for, they should not do SEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:10">[00:33:10]</a>.

### Successful SEO Strategies in the AI Era

Successful [[SEO strategies in the age of AI | SEO strategies]] focus on the mid-funnel, aligning the product with the user's intent to solve a specific problem.

*   **Zapier's Programmatic SEO:** Zapier's success came from recognizing that users were looking to connect specific applications (e.g., Gmail and Salesforce) even if they didn't know a solution like Zapier existed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:41">[00:26:41]</a>. They created programmatic pages for every possible app combination, showcasing how their product solved a real problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:06">[00:27:06]</a>.
*   **Tinder's Loneliness Solution:** Tinder, often perceived as a dating app, realized users were searching for solutions to loneliness in new cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:49">[00:29:49]</a>. By creating localized pages that suggested Tinder as a solution to this "loneliness problem," they tapped into a mid-to-bottom-funnel need that AI Overviews couldn't fully satisfy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:22">[00:30:22]</a>.

These examples highlight that SEO should be part of the buyer journey, providing solutions that lead to conversion, regardless of AI Overviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:17">[00:31:17]</a>.

## Steps for SEO Success

1.  **Be the User:** Understand your customer's empathy. Put yourself in their shoes and ask what problem they would search for that your product solves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:58">[00:31:58]</a>.
2.  **Think About the Asset to Create:** Once the user's need is understood, decide what type of asset (e.g., programmatic page, tool) needs to be created to address that need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:34">[00:33:34]</a>.
3.  **Build the Product for the SEO User:** This involves allocating design, engineering, and product management resources, as well as user research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:10">[00:34:10]</a>. SEO is not merely content optimization; it's a cross-functional product development effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:22">[00:34:22]</a>.

### When to Invest in SEO

SEO is not free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:30">[00:39:30]</a>. Companies must evaluate it as a channel, considering the investment in time, resources, and direct expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:41">[00:39:41]</a>.

For B2B SaaS companies, SEO might not always be the best fit, especially if the customer journey is not fully online and requires a sales motion (e.g., complex, expensive integrations like Mixpanel or Google Cloud) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:19">[00:36:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:56">[00:43:56]</a>. If a product doesn't directly convert from an online search, other channels like brand ads or influencer campaigns might yield a faster ROI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:41">[00:41:41]</a>.

### Measuring SEO Success

The key is to track meaningful conversion metrics relevant to the business, such as Marketing Qualified Leads (MQLs), direct dollar conversions, or specific user actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:53">[00:49:53]</a>. Tracking rankings or raw traffic volume alone can be a "total waste of time" if it doesn't lead to business value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:41">[00:48:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:51">[00:51:51]</a>.

The timeline for seeing results from SEO varies. For established brands with clear demand, results can be seen relatively quickly (e.g., Quora quadrupled traffic in 3 months by exposing answers and improving site navigation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>. For smaller companies or new solutions, it may take many months or even years for Google to notice and for demand to build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:37">[00:47:37]</a>.

## Leveraging AI in SEO

[[AI and programmatic SEO | AI is a tool, not a solution]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:51">[00:59:51]</a>. While AI can generate content, its value depends on the content's usefulness and its role in the user's journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:56">[00:59:56]</a>. Using AI to create "worthless content for the sake of content" is a waste of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:23">[01:00:23]</a>. However, using AI to generate useful content more efficiently, such as product descriptions for an e-commerce site, can be beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:47">[01:00:47]</a>. Google's stance is that the helpfulness and usefulness of content matter, not whether it was AI-generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:27">[01:02:27]</a>.

### AI Overviews as a Branding Exercise

Appearing in an AI Overview can be seen as a branding exercise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:44">[01:04:44]</a>. If a company's brand is mentioned, it signals successful brand-building efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:12">[01:07:12]</a>. However, if Google simply summarizes content and links to it, it might be seen as "stolen content" where people may or may not click through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:27">[01:07:27]</a>.

## Brand Building and Programmatic SEO

True link building is akin to brand building; it involves creating an amazing product that people want to use and mention naturally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:34">[01:08:34]</a>. Google's ability to "read content" means mentions can be as valuable as traditional HTML links <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:12">[01:09:12]</a>.

Programmatic SEO, like Zapier's approach, involves taking various data sources and building pages at scale that address specific user needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:25">[01:10:25]</a>. Examples include Trip Advisor generating pages for every hotel based on UGC and reviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:48">[01:10:48]</a>, or Zillow creating pages for every property, combining government data, comparisons, and photos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:45">[01:11:45]</a>. Editorial SEO, on the other hand, involves manually creating long-form content, which can be costly and less effective for scaled queries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:31">[01:13:31]</a>. The choice depends on the user's specific need and whether there's a scalable use case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:20">[01:15:20]</a>.

## Google's Dominance and the Future of Search

Despite the rise of AI chatbots and other search engines, Google remains dominant. A recent DOJ verdict revealed Google's 98% market share in mobile searches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:55">[01:17:55]</a>. This dominance is attributed to its default partnerships (e.g., with Apple), its strong brand, and its massive data assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:10">[01:18:10]</a>. Competitors like Neva or DuckDuckGo (which only grew from 1% to 2% market share in 12 years) struggle to compete due to these ingrained distribution agreements and user habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:44">[01:22:44]</a>.

Google invests in AI Overviews to satisfy Wall Street and minimize even small percentage losses to competitors, but they likely have no fear of being unseated as the most dominant search engine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:26">[01:20:26]</a>.

## Key Takeaways: SEO is Not Dying

[[Impact of AI on Product Management and Development | SEO is not dying]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:06">[01:24:06]</a>. Users will always request their own information and seek choices beyond a single AI-generated answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:34">[01:24:34]</a>. While top-of-funnel search might shift to AI Overviews or platforms like TikTok (which Google recognizes Gen Z uses for search) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:20">[01:31:20]</a>, Google will remain the go-to for mid-funnel searches where users have intent and are looking to take action (e.g., booking travel, finding a doctor) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:13">[01:32:13]</a>. Businesses selling products or services that lead to direct action will continue to benefit from SEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:36">[01:25:36]</a>.

## Common SEO Myths

*   **Everyone needs to do SEO:** This is a major misconception. Companies should thoughtfully evaluate if SEO aligns with their user journey and business goals, just as they would any other marketing channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:45">[01:26:45]</a>.
*   **Link building is a standalone secret sauce:** Effective link building is brand building. It's about creating a product or content so valuable that others organically mention and link to it, rather than buying low-quality links <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:31">[01:27:31]</a>.
*   **Google's ranking algorithm is a black box:** While nuances exist, the basics of SEO are simple: build a crawlable, user-friendly website with helpful content that users want to read <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:04">[01:28:04]</a>.
*   **Technical SEO is a magic bullet:** While important for large sites (tens of millions of pages like Zillow or Airbnb), technical SEO is often overemphasized for smaller websites. Most issues stem from not providing useful content or meeting user needs, not technical glitches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:08">[01:35:08]</a>.

## Estimating SEO Upside: Top-Down Forecasting

Instead of relying on often inaccurate keyword research tools for bottom-up forecasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:21">[01:42:21]</a>, a top-down approach is more effective for estimating SEO upside. This involves starting with the total addressable market (TAM) and applying filters based on product fit, target demographic, online purchasing behavior, and desired market penetration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:46">[01:38:46]</a>. This provides a more realistic and adjustable forecast for SEO investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:03">[01:41:03]</a>.

## The Future of SEO Expertise

The need for [[Impact of AI on software development and engineering roles | SEO expertise]] is expected to grow as companies are forced to pivot their strategies due to changing search layouts and traffic patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:39">[01:44:39]</a>. This will create significant opportunities for growth advisors specializing in SEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:11">[01:45:11]</a>.

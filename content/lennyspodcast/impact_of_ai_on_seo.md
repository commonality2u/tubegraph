The landscape of SEO is undergoing a significant [[the_impact_of_ai_on_business_and_technology | shift with the rise of AI]] answers integrated into search results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This integration, particularly with Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI Overviews, forces a pivot in thinking about what SEO traffic means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>.

## Google's Response to AI Search Integration

Google and other tech companies were compelled to integrate AI following the emergence of OpenAI's ChatGPT at the end of 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:01">[06:56:01]</a>. ChatGPT's ability to provide written answers to any question led to discussions about Google's relevance and the end of SEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>.

[[googles_response_to_ai_search_integration | Google's response to AI search integration]] was largely driven by concerns from Wall Street about maintaining investment and stock price, which affects their ability to recruit and invest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48:00">[07:48:00]</a>. Initially, Google launched "Bard" (now Gemini) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:25:00">[08:25:00]</a>, followed by a beta called "Search Generative Experience" (SGE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:00">[08:47:00]</a>.

Key issues Google faced with SGE included:
*   **Monetization**: Difficulty integrating ads with AI answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:00">[09:05:00]</a>.
*   **Liability**: Concerns about generative responses giving harmful advice, making Google the publisher rather than just a search engine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:24:00">[09:24:00]</a>.
*   **Plagiarism**: Worries about copyright infringement when extracting content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:45:00">[09:45:00]</a>.

After a year of testing, SGE was renamed "AI Overviews" and launched broader in May <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:10:00">[10:10:00]</a>. Although initial public reactions were embarrassing due to "hallucinations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:38:00">[10:38:00]</a>, Google has since relaunched it more widely, appearing on many search results for both logged-in and Incognito users, and expanding to regions like the UK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:00">[11:11:11]</a>.

> "Google has 98% of mobile searches." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:11:55">[01:17:55]</a>

Google's default partnerships with companies like Apple, its Chrome browser, and its brand recognition contribute significantly to its success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:10">[01:18:10]</a>. Bing's attempt to offer its search engine to Apple for free was rejected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>, and past partnerships like Mozilla with Yahoo saw users switch back to Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:49">[01:19:49]</a>. This suggests Google will likely remain the dominant search engine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:21">[01:19:21]</a>.

## Impact on Search Results and User Journey

AI Overviews push down traditional search results, meaning users may not need to click links to get answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>. This makes content less relevant if it only provides a "top of funnel" answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.

Previously, SEO often focused on ranking for broad, "top of funnel" keywords (e.g., "cars") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>. With AI, these broad queries are increasingly handled by AI Overviews, providing summarized answers (e.g., recommending a beach vacation spot) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>.

This shifts the user journey:
*   **Discovery (Top of Funnel)**: Swallowed by LLMs providing initial directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>.
*   **Mid-Funnel**: Where SEO begins to matter more. Once a user has a direction (e.g., "Cancun"), they then search for specific details (e.g., "hotels in Cancun") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>.
*   **Bottom of Funnel**: Specific searches with high intent (e.g., "Riverside price") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>.

> "If you're looking to take an action [e.g., buying shoes or booking a hotel], the aggregate number of people needing to take that action and pay you for it does not change even if search volume gets cut." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>

Websites that provide generic, informational content (e.g., WebMD for a headache diagnosis) will be heavily impacted by AI Overviews, as the AI can provide a direct answer, making lengthy content unnecessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. However, e-commerce sites or those focused on specific, action-oriented queries may see less impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>.

## Strategies for Success in SEO with AI Prevalence

The shift in SEO with AI requires treating SEO as a product question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>, where [[impact_of_ai_on_product_management | product managers]] should lead the thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>. This means understanding the user's self-discovery journey, especially for users not influenced by social channels or ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>.

[[strategies_for_success_in_seo_with_ai_prevalence | Strategies for success in SEO with AI prevalence]] include:
1.  **Be the User**: Understand the user's problem and what they would search for. If a company cannot answer what a user would search for to find their product, they should not do SEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. This requires customer empathy, as seen with SurveyMonkey's onboarding requiring employees to use the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>.
2.  **Think about the Asset**: Decide what asset (e.g., a programmatic page, a tool) to create for that user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>.
3.  **Envision and Build the Product**: This involves design, engineering, and user research resources, overseen by a product manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>.

SEO is not free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>. Companies need to evaluate if SEO is the right channel by considering the total cost (time, resources, direct expenses like agencies) and comparing it to other marketing channels like brand ads or influencer campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>. If the user journey isn't fully online and requires sales engagement (e.g., B2B SaaS where products are expensive or require integration), SEO may not yield a good ROI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>.

### Programmatic SEO vs. Editorial Content

*   **Programmatic SEO**: Involves taking multiple data sources and combining them into scalable, comprehensive pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. Examples include:
    *   **TripAdvisor**: Combines hotel data, cities, and user-generated content into property pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.
    *   **Zillow**: Uses government data, comparison data, photos, and neighborhood information to provide property valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>.
    *   **Zapier**: Built pages for specific app integrations (e.g., Gmail and Salesforce), showcasing solutions users were looking for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>. This was an accidental but legendary success in SEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.
    *   **Tinder**: Created localized pages for "online dating in [city]" addressing the loneliness problem, which is a mid- or bottom-of-funnel problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.

    Programmatic SEO is ideal when there is scale and a clear user use case that benefits from data aggregation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.
*   **Editorial Content**: Long-form articles or blog posts. While some companies focus on this, it's often expensive and less effective if it doesn't align with a clear user need or monetization strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:40">[01:13:40]</a>.

The opportunity lies in creating pages that *solve problems* for users, acting as a product, rather than just generating vast amounts of content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>. Companies like Canva and Notion, which offer templates, succeed because those templates directly lead to product usage and monetization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>. Copying others' programmatic strategies without a clear user use case or monetization path is ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>.

### Role of AI in Content Creation

AI is a tool, not a solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>. It can be used to create content if that content serves the user journey and company goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>.
*   **Useful applications**: Using AI for product descriptions on e-commerce sites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>.
*   **Ineffective applications**: Generating "fluff" content that is not necessary or useful for the user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>.

Google states that AI-generated content itself is not the problem; its helpfulness and usefulness are what matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>. Some companies use AI to draft initial content, which is then reviewed by human editors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:00">[06:08:00]</a>.

## SEO Measurement and Expectations

Tracking the right metrics is crucial. Often, companies incorrectly focus on "top of funnel" rankings or raw traffic numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>.
*   **Instead, focus on conversion metrics**:
    *   Marketing Qualified Leads (MQLs) for SaaS tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>.
    *   Page views, clicks off the page, or CPM advertising for media companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>.
    *   Dollar conversions, phone calls, or video views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>.
*   **Beware of "worthless traffic"**: Driving traffic to content that doesn't convert or isn't relevant to the business's monetization strategy is not helpful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>.

Estimating SEO upside:
*   **Avoid Bottoms-Up forecasts**: Keyword research tools can be inaccurate in their volume estimations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>. They are indicative for understanding user search patterns (e.g., spelling), but not for precise volume forecasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>.
*   **Use a Top-Down (TAM) forecast**: Start with the total addressable market (e.g., population of a country, then segment by demographics, then by online buyers) to estimate potential reach and revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>. This provides a more realistic and adjustable forecast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>.

## SEO Myths

*   **Everyone needs to do SEO**: Not all businesses or products have an SEO journey that justifies the investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.
*   **Link building is a secret sauce**: Effective "link building" is actually "brand building." Google increasingly understands mentions as equivalent to links <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>. Building links to irrelevant content or from low-authority websites is ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>.
*   **Google is a black box**: The basics of SEO are simple: build a website Google can understand, link pages, and write helpful content that users want to read <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>. While nuances exist, following best practices can achieve significant results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>.
*   **Technical SEO is a magic bullet**: While important for large sites with millions of pages (e.g., Zillow, Airbnb) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>, it's less critical for smaller sites (e.g., a 100-page SaaS tool) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>. Page speed optimizations, for instance, matter more in highly competitive, speed-sensitive industries (like travel) but less so otherwise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>.
*   **TikTok/Instagram are replacing search**: While platforms like TikTok are used by Gen Z for "top of funnel" discovery (e.g., travel inspiration) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>, Google remains essential for "mid-funnel" and "bottom of funnel" searches when users are ready to take action (e.g., booking a hotel or flight) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>.

## Future of SEO

The need for SEO expertise is expected to grow significantly as companies must pivot their approaches in response to changing search layouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>. SEO is not dying; users will always seek out information and choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>. The core need for users to take action and for companies to monetize those actions remains constant, even if the discovery process changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>.

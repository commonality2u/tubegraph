## What is Radical Candor?
[[Communication frameworks for clarity and influence | Radical Candor]] is a framework for effective communication and feedback, defined as the simultaneous combination of **caring personally** and **challenging directly** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. The concept is best understood by contrasting it with its three opposite quadrants in a 2x2 framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>:

*   **Obnoxious Aggression:** Challenging directly without caring personally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. This approach is inefficient because it puts people in a "fight or flight" mode, making them unable to hear the message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.
*   **Ruinous Empathy:** Caring personally but failing to challenge directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. This is the most common mistake, occurring in approximately 90% of cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. It creates a "false harmony" that is ultimately detrimental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:01">[02:10:01]</a>.
*   **Manipulative Insincerity:** Neither caring personally nor challenging directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. This often stems from self-protective insincerity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.
*   **Radical Candor:** The ideal quadrant where both care and direct challenge are present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

## Why Radical Candor Matters
Developing [[Communication frameworks for clarity and influence | Radical Candor]] skills leads to better relationships, improved work quality, increased success, and greater happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

### Impact of Ruinous Empathy: The Bob Story
Kim Scott recounts a personal experience with [[ruinous_empathy | ruinous empathy]] with an employee named Bob <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:01">[02:10:01]</a>. Despite Bob being charming and well-liked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:15">[02:11:15]</a>, his work was consistently terrible and riddled with sloppy mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:19">[02:23:19]</a>. Scott avoided giving direct feedback, partly due to liking Bob and not wanting to hurt his feelings (ruinous empathy), and partly out of fear of how others would perceive her if he reacted negatively (manipulative insincerity) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-23:11:00>[02:31:11]</a>.

This failure to provide candid feedback for ten months led to negative consequences:
*   Bob was eventually fired, and he questioned why no one had told him earlier, believing his colleagues cared about him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:07">[02:50:07]</a>.
*   It was unfair to Bob, who deserved to know his performance was lacking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:07">[02:44:07]</a>.
*   It was unfair to the rest of the team, as Bob's delays impacted their deliverables and forced them to redo his work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:09">[02:46:09]</a>.
*   The company risked losing high performers who would quit because they couldn't do their best work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:09">[02:49:09]</a>.

This experience solidified Scott's commitment to helping others avoid this painful and common mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.

### The "Um" Story: A Positive Example
Scott's boss at Google provided a powerful example of [[Communication frameworks for clarity and influence | Radical Candor]] when giving her feedback on excessive "um" usage during presentations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:00">[00:53:00]</a>. Initially, Scott dismissed the feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>, but her boss escalated the direct challenge by stating, "When you say um every third word it makes you sound stupid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>.

This seemingly harsh statement was effective because:
*   The boss had built a relationship of personal care with Scott, demonstrating support during personal crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>.
*   The boss knew Scott well enough to use words that would penetrate her "sometimes thick skull" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>.
*   The feedback was ultimately the "kindest thing" for Scott's career, leading her to address the issue and improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>.

This highlights that [[Communication frameworks for clarity and influence | Radical Candor]] is measured "at the listener's ear," not the speaker's mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>.

## Practicing Radical Candor
### General Principles (HIP CORE)
When giving feedback (praise or criticism), adhere to these principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>:

*   **Humble:** Approach the conversation with humility, recognizing you might be wrong. Candor implies a dialogue, not a monologue where you possess "the truth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.
*   **Helpful:** State your intention to be helpful and that the feedback is to support the other person, not to dominate or harm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>.
*   **Immediately:** Give feedback as soon as possible. Delaying often means it will never be given <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. Exceptions are when you're too upset to speak constructively or the other person is too upset to listen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.
*   **In-person or Synchronously:** Conduct these conversations in real-time. Phone calls can be more effective than video, as they encourage listening to words over misinterpreting body language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. Avoid email or text for feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>.
*   **Private Criticism, Public Praise:** Praise publicly to reinforce positive behavior, and criticize privately to avoid shaming and defensiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>.
*   **CORE (Context, Observation, Result, Next Step):** Structure feedback around specific situations and behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>.
    *   **Context:** Set the scene (e.g., "In the meeting..." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>).
    *   **Observation:** Describe the specific action (e.g., "...when you said um every third word..." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>).
    *   **Result:** Explain the impact (e.g., "...it made you sound stupid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>).
    *   **Next Step:** Suggest a clear action (e.g., "Go to the speech coach" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>).

### Soliciting Feedback (The First Step)
To build a culture of [[Communication frameworks for clarity and influence | Radical Candor]], start by soliciting criticism yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:17">[00:37:17]</a>. This is especially true for managers, who should do this weekly with direct reports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:31">[00:39:31]</a>.

Steps to solicit feedback effectively:
1.  **Ask a specific question:** Avoid generic "Do you have any feedback for me?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> which elicits "everything's fine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. Instead, ask something like:
    *   "What could I do or stop doing that would make it easier to work with me?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a> (Customize the wording to sound authentic to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>).
    *   "Tell me why I'm wrong." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>
    *   "What's one thing I could be doing better?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:01">[00:41:01]</a>
    *   "What could I have done this week to better support you in your work?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>
2.  **Embrace the discomfort:** After asking, "close your mouth and count to six" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>. Silence can prompt a response.
3.  **Listen with intent to understand:** Manage your defensiveness. Ask follow-up questions to ensure you truly understand what the person is trying to convey, rather than jumping to conclusions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>.
4.  **Reward the candor:** People take a huge risk by giving critical feedback.
    *   **If you agree:** Fix the problem and make your listening tangible (e.g., "Thanks to [person's name], we now have 35 kinds of tea" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>). Ask for follow-up feedback (e.g., "Did I overcorrect or undercorrect?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>).
    *   **If you disagree:** Acknowledge the part you agree with (5-10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>), then say, "As for the rest of it, I want to think about it and get back to you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>. Follow up with a respectful explanation of your disagreement. Unspoken disagreement harms relationships more than open, respectful disagreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>.

### Giving Feedback
*   **Gauge how it's landing:** Start in a neutral place on the challenge directly axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>. If the person seems to brush off the feedback, be prepared to become more direct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>.
*   **Adjust for emotional response:** If the person looks sad or mad, move up on the care personally dimension.
    *   **Sad:** Acknowledge your delivery by saying, "Maybe I didn't say that in the best possible way. How could I have said it differently?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>. Avoid retracting the feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>.
    *   **Mad:** Get curious, not furious. Say, "Look, maybe I didn't say that in the right way, but this is an important issue, and we need to resolve it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>.
*   **Focus on behavior, not personality:** Use the CORE framework to give specific, actionable feedback rather than making generalized statements about someone's character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.

## Overcoming Challenges
### [[Overcoming fear of giving candid feedback | People-Pleasing]] and the Need to Be Liked
Many leaders struggle with [[Overcoming fear of giving candid feedback | people-pleasing]] tendencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>. To overcome this, focus on genuine care for others rather than the need to be liked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>. Realize that in the long run, it is unkind *not* to tell someone when they are making a mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>. Shift from being self-focused (on your discomfort) to being others-focused (on what's best for them and their future) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>.

### Company Culture Resistant to Feedback
If the company culture is closer to [[ruinous_empathy | ruinous empathy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>, start by soliciting feedback yourself. This is the most important step to improving relationships and making it easier to give and receive feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:17">[00:37:17]</a>.

### Leaders with Low Self-Awareness
For leaders who exhibit [[Contrarian approaches in business strategy | obnoxious aggression]] or fire people without feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>, explain the negative impact of their behavior on results and their own careers (enlightened self-interest) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a>. Many such leaders care about results, and sometimes they simply don't realize they are "supposed to care" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>. Share personal stories of acting like a "jerk" and its negative impact to encourage their own self-reflection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.

### Time Management for Feedback
Giving feedback immediately can seem like a lot of work, but it saves significant time in the long run compared to dealing with escalated problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>. It's "relationship hygiene" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:00">[00:53:00]</a>. To make time, schedule slack time (e.g., 25-minute meetings instead of 30) or be willing to be a few minutes late to your next meeting to address important "moments of management" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>.

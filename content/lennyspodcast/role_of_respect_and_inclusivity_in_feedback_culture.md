The foundation of effective feedback and a healthy feedback culture lies in genuine respect and inclusivity. Without respect, it becomes impossible to truly care for others, which is essential for providing effective feedback. This concept is explored in Kim Scott's book, *Radical Respect*, which she describes as a prequel to her widely recognized book, *Radical Candor* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:49">[01:11:49]</a>.

## The Importance of Respect

[[candor_and_feedback_in_professional_growth | Radical Candor]] is defined as the intersection of "caring personally" and "challenging directly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:03">[04:06:03]</a>. However, Scott realized that true caring is impossible without a baseline of respect for the other person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:51">[01:11:51]</a>. When respect is absent, attempts at challenging directly can devolve into "obnoxious aggression," and a lack of care can lead to "ruinous empathy" or "manipulative insincerity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:03">[04:06:03]</a>.

### The Catalyst for *Radical Respect*

The impetus for Kim Scott to write *Radical Respect* came from feedback she received from a Black woman CEO in tech, a former colleague whom Scott deeply respects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:18">[01:11:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:05">[01:12:05]</a>. This CEO explained that it was significantly harder for her to implement [[candor_and_feedback_in_professional_growth | Radical Candor]] in her company because whenever she offered even gentle, compassionate criticism, she was labeled an "angry Black woman" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:29">[01:12:29]</a>. Scott recognized the truth and unfairness of this situation, noting the CEO's consistently even-keeled and cheerful demeanor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:37">[01:12:37]</a>.

This revelation prompted Scott to reflect on her own shortcomings and biases:
*   **Failure to be an upstander**: She realized she had not been the supportive colleague she aspired to be, failing to notice the extent to which her peer had to suppress her true feelings to appear pleasant in every meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:51">[01:12:51]</a>.
*   **Denial of personal experiences**: Scott admitted to being in denial about her own experiences with bias, prejudice, and bullying in the workplace. She had convinced herself that various incidents "were not happening" because she didn't want to see herself as a victim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:23">[01:13:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:46">[01:13:46]</a>.
*   **Denial of personal culpability**: Even more profoundly, she was in denial about times she had said or done things that hurt others, or that were biased or even bullying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:57">[01:13:57]</a>. She acknowledged that leaders are particularly susceptible to bullying, even if they don't see themselves as bullies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:12">[01:14:12]</a>.
*   **Allowance of "BS"**: As a leader, she had mistakenly believed she was creating environments free of "BS" (bias and disrespect), but in reality, she had allowed it to persist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:22">[01:14:22]</a>.

These insights directly led to the creation of *Radical Respect* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:34">[01:14:34]</a>.

## Cultivating a Culture of Respect

The book *Radical Respect* offers guidance for various roles in fostering a respectful and inclusive work environment:
*   **For Leaders**: Strategies for building and maintaining respectful cultures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:10">[01:15:10]</a>.
*   **For Individuals Harmed**: Advice for those who experience bias, prejudice, or bullying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:15">[01:15:15]</a>.
*   **For Colleagues**: How to be an "upstander" and a better colleague <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:19">[01:15:19]</a>.
*   **For Culprits**: How to become part of the solution rather than contributing to the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:26">[01:15:26]</a>.

Scott emphasizes that everyone plays a role in creating a more respectful work environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:41">[01:15:41]</a>.

## Overcoming Obstacles to Respectful Feedback

Leaders who are low on the "care personally" dimension often still care about results and their own careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:24">[00:58:24]</a>. To influence such leaders, it's crucial to explain the negative impact their behavior has, framing it in terms of "enlightened self-interest" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:36">[00:58:36]</a>. For example, being "obnoxiously aggressive" is inefficient because it puts people in a "fight or flight" mode, making them unable to hear the message, thus wasting the speaker's breath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:50">[00:59:50]</a>.

Many leaders may genuinely care but are poor at *showing* it, or they believe they are *not supposed* to care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:55">[00:58:55]</a>. Helping them understand that caring is an inherent part of their job can make them more effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:09">[00:59:09]</a>.

To demonstrate this impact, leaders can share personal stories of when they made mistakes and the negative consequences that followed. This "holding up the mirror" allows others to reflect on their own behavior without feeling judged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:09">[01:00:09]</a>. The goal is to encourage a growth mindset, recognizing that everyone makes mistakes and can learn to improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:37">[01:00:37]</a>.

### Rejecting the "Jerk" Archetype

Scott actively pushes back against the notion that leaders must choose between being "a total jerk but really competent" or "really nice but incompetent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:53">[01:06:53]</a>. [[candor_and_feedback_in_professional_growth | Radical Candor]] offers a third, more effective path that doesn't hurt people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:04">[01:07:04]</a>. There are many examples of incredibly successful and caring leaders, though their stories may not be as sensationalized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:26">[01:07:26]</a>.

It's crucial to understand that [[candor_and_feedback_in_professional_growth | Radical Candor]] is measured by the listener's interpretation, not just the speaker's intent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:41">[01:04:44]</a>. What might be understood as caring directness within a close, established relationship could be perceived as "obnoxious aggression" by others, especially if those others are silenced or intimidated by the behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:47">[01:05:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:11">[01:06:11]</a>.

Ultimately, the goal is to be a successful *kind* person, demonstrating that a leader does not have to be a jerk to achieve success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:54">[01:16:54]</a>.

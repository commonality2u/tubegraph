Seth Godin, a prolific author and speaker, explores the essence of [[developing_a_product_strategy | strategy]] in his book, "This Is Strategy." His insights emphasize that a truly great [[elements_of_a_winning_strategy | strategy]] is rooted in tension, clear choices, and an understanding of the systems at play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>. Godin also reveals his early career as a product manager, which profoundly shaped his views on creating remarkable products and brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>.

## The Role of Tension in Strategy
Godin asserts that tension is central to every art form and innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:56">[00:27:56]</a>. He distinguishes tension from stress:
> "Tension is at the heart of every art form and every innovation. Tension is it might not work, tension is and the other person says because they need to finish the sentence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:10">[00:28:10]</a>.

When a new product is launched with a promise, a "difficult promise, a remarkable promise," it creates tension as users imagine what their life might be like if that promise were true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:24">[00:28:24]</a>. The tension lies in whether the product will deliver on that promise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:37">[00:28:37]</a>.

## Critical Strategic Choices for Product People
For product managers, Godin highlights four critical choices that determine a product's future and even the quality of life associated with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>. These are often overlooked, leading to a sacrifice of agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>.

1.  **Choose Your Customers:** By selecting your "smallest viable audience" – considering their language, finances, problems, and temperament – you define everything about the product and its future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>. For example, a product for "wonky" Raspberry Pi users allows for different development and interaction than one for pre-order Apple customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.
2.  **Choose Your Competition:** The competitive landscape sets "enormous boundaries" on what a company does. Competing against a low-cost leader like Walmart, for instance, dictates pricing and strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>.
3.  **Choose the Source of Validation:** Deciding who to please – whether it's your boss or the target customers – fundamentally changes how meetings proceed and what is built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>. Godin learned that delighting the customer, not the boss, defined high standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:36:00">[07:36:00]</a>.
4.  **Choose Your Distribution:** The distribution method significantly impacts the product. For instance, shifting from physical retail to digital downloads (like Steam) changes everything about how a software product is conceived and released <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>.

## The Importance of Being [[elements_of_a_winning_strategy | Remarkable]]
A core tenet of Godin's philosophy, popularized in his book *Purple Cow*, is the importance of being "remarkable," meaning "worth making a remark about" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:55">[00:29:55]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:20">[00:30:20]</a>. This concept ties directly into marketing and customer traction:
*   **Customer Traction:** The best indicator of a startup's potential is if users stick around and tell their friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:02">[00:30:02]</a>.
*   **Word-of-Mouth Marketing:** If a product improves a person's life and they are prompted to talk about it, the marketing problem is largely solved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:41">[00:30:41]</a>.
*   **Promise and Delivery:** A brand is a promise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>. Being remarkable means making a difficult promise and consistently keeping it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>. Breaking that promise even once can damage a brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>.

## Seeing the System
Godin emphasizes that [[understanding_strategy_and_its_challenges | strategic thinking]] involves recognizing invisible systems that govern interactions and culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:05">[00:35:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:25">[00:35:25]</a>. These systems create cultural norms ("the way things are around here") and protect themselves, often by making change seem "scary" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:51">[00:33:51]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:53">[00:33:53]</a>. To implement a great [[elements_of_a_winning_strategy | strategy]], one must understand these systems and decide whether to work within them or leverage opportunities to change the rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:04">[00:34:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:14">[00:34:14]</a>.

### Examples:
*   **Jaguar Rebrand:** Godin views Jaguar's recent "rebrand" (more accurately, a re-logo) as a mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:26">[00:38:26]</a>. They abandoned an iconic, beloved brand with existing awareness assets, seemingly to please an art director, rather than building customer traction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:15">[00:39:15]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:04">[00:40:04]</a>.
*   **Tesla Model S vs. Cybertruck:** The Model S succeeded through "remarkable" features like pop-out door handles and "ludicrous mode," generating conversations and excitement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:50">[00:40:50]</a>. The Cybertruck, however, is seen as intentionally divisive and a "stunt," failing to appeal to the utility-focused pickup truck market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:17">[00:41:17]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:47">[00:42:47]</a>.

## Leadership and Empathy
A leader's role in [[understanding_strategy_and_its_challenges | strategy]] is to paint a picture of the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>. This picture must be rooted in empathy, showing "where *they* want to go," not where the leader wants to go <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:31">[00:43:31]</a>. The goal is to be of service and help people achieve their existing desires, rather than trying to change what they want <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:08">[00:44:08]</a>.

## Seth Godin as a Product Manager
Godin's early career as the 30th employee at Spinnaker Software, an educational computer game company, deeply influenced his perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. As a de facto [[product_management_insights_and_extreme_clarity | product manager]], he learned that "marketing *is* the product" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. His key takeaways for [[product_management_insights_and_extreme_clarity | product management]] include:
*   **Empathy is Not an Option:** Products are made for other people, so empathy for the user is crucial, not optional. Users are not at fault if they misunderstand a product; the product creator is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>.
*   **Time and Money are Limits:** Projects end when time or money runs out. Professionals anticipate unexpected challenges and don't ask for extensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>.
*   **Network Effects:** For software as a service, building in a network effect is almost essential for success. If a product doesn't work better when users tell others about it, they won't, and it won't spread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>.

These insights underscore Godin's belief that [[elements_of_a_winning_strategy | great strategy]] involves deliberate choices about who to serve, how to compete, how to validate, and how to distribute, all while embracing the tension of innovation and delivering on promises.

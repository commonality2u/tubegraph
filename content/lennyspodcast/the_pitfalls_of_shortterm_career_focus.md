Many individuals in their careers, particularly early on, tend to adopt a short-term focus, leading to potential dissatisfaction and stagnation later on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. This approach often centers on immediate frustrations or singular goals without considering the broader trajectory of one's [[building_a_long_and_meaningful_career | career]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

## What is Short-Term Career Focus?
A short-term focused career framework is often characterized by immediate grievances, such as disliking one's boss or feeling a company is too slow to ship products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. These may be true statements, but they are often prevalent across many jobs, meaning lateral moves might not lead to genuine progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.

Another prime example of short-term thinking is conflating career progression with promotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. While promotions are a system for moving forward within a company, they are a "pretty short-term" goal, often viewed as a means to an end before leaving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

### The Illusion of "Logos"
Some individuals chase "logos" on their resume, such as working at prominent companies like Netflix, Meta, Airbnb, or Uber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. While there is value, especially for executives, in having experience at "magma" (Meta, Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon) or similar large-scale companies that deal with millions or billions of users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>, this pursuit can feel "shallow to most builders" if not aligned with a deeper purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.

Instead of collecting labels, a more beneficial approach is to seek a diverse set of experiences, such as learning about pre-product-market fit, seeing growth from "smoke to fire," and scaling successful products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. This diversity, encompassing consumer and business-to-business problems, makes one a better builder and leads to greater satisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.

## Why is Short-Term Focus Dangerous?
Focusing solely on immediate goals can lead to:

*   **Lack of Long-Term Vision**: Without a clear understanding of the "job after next" or working backwards from a desired "end state," career moves often become lateral rather than forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. This is akin to building a product without thinking about versions 1, 2, and 3 leading to the ideal product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.
*   **The Trap of Ex-Growth Companies**: These companies are characterized by having raised substantial capital and often having high valuations, but they are still trying to find true product-market fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>. For product managers, joining or staying in such a company can be dangerous because:
    *   Equity compensation may not be worth anything if the company's private valuation doesn't reflect market realities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>.
    *   There is "almost no recourse" for employees as it's a long-term investment that may not pay off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a>.
    *   The "opportunity cost" of staying is too high when better options might exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>.
    *   Signs of an ex-growth company include re-framing the core product to find product-market fit, and having a valuation in the hundreds of millions while still searching for strong customer pull <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>. Strong product-market fit means users are acquired with little marketing effort, and there's a "sucking pull" from customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:58">[00:20:58]</a>.
    *   Reasons to consider staying at such a company might include it being the biggest role one could get, offering significant learning opportunities, or personal loyalty to the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:34">[00:21:34]</a>. However, fear of finding another job is considered a poor reason to stay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:27">[00:22:27]</a>.

## The "What's Next?" Dilemma and Mental Health
The metaphor of dog tracks illustrates the ultimate pitfall of a short-term focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:14">[01:04:14]</a>. Just as a greyhound stops running after catching the "fake rabbit" because "what's next?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:17">[01:05:17]</a>, many successful individuals reach their career goals (e.g., becoming a VP, making money, starting a company) only to find themselves lost or sad because they haven't considered "what happens next" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>.

Given that careers can now span 60 years or more, hitting a primary North Star 30 years in leaves a significant portion of one's professional life without a clear purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:50">[01:05:50]</a>. This can lead to keeping a job out of habit, sadness, or engaging in conflict where peace is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:20">[01:06:20]</a>.

It is crucial to start defining new North Stars early in one's [[building_a_long_and_meaningful_career | career]] to ensure continuous motivation and purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>. Potential long-term North Stars can include:
*   **Scaled Economics**: Pursuing increasingly higher levels of financial success through investing or private equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:09">[01:09:09]</a>.
*   **Giving**: Focusing on contributing to others through content creation, volunteering, or building mission-based companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:41">[01:09:41]</a>. This is seen as a path to greater fulfillment and societal benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:43">[01:10:43]</a>.

> Every individual is building their career story daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:35">[01:22:35]</a>. It's essential to ensure this story is meaningful for future career steps. Define the problem solved, the skills built, the headwinds faced, and how they were overcome, focusing on "I" rather than "we" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:02">[01:22:02]</a>. If the story is not compelling, it's time to strategize how to improve it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:26">[01:22:26]</a>.

An "energy audit" is a method designed to help individuals understand what activities or interactions either give them energy or drain their energy, ultimately guiding them towards greater [[maximizing_human_potential_and_personal_growth | personal growth]] and fulfillment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:02">[01:01:02]</a>. The core idea is that what a person is truly good at often aligns with what they love to do, making it feel effortless and potentially undervalued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:11">[01:02:11]</a>.

## The Four Zones

The concept of the energy audit is based on four zones, which categorize different types of activities and their impact on an individual's energy and value creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:40">[01:02:40]</a>. This framework was learned from Diana Chapman at Conscious Leadership Group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:43">[01:02:43]</a>.

1.  **Zone of Incompetence:** Activities where others are better at them than you are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:58">[01:02:58]</a>. These tasks should be delegated, such as fixing a car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:04">[01:03:04]</a>.
2.  **Zone of Confidence:** Tasks you can do fine, but others can also do them fine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:08">[01:03:08]</a>. An example is cleaning your house; while you can do it, it takes time and doesn't create significant value, so it should be delegated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:14">[01:03:14]</a>.
3.  **Zone of Excellence:** Activities you are uniquely good at, but you don't love doing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:24">[01:03:24]</a>. This is considered the "danger zone" because it's often what you're paid for, and while it creates value for others, it "sucks the life force out of you" and hinders your ability to achieve amazing things or create massive value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:29">[01:03:29]</a>.
4.  **Zone of Genius:** The activities you perform that are uniquely excellent, and you enjoy them so much that space and time disappear when you do them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:46">[01:03:46]</a>. You may not even notice you're doing them because you love them so much <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:50">[01:03:50]</a>.

## Conducting an Energy Audit

The key to moving into your zone of genius is not just to figure out what it is and do more of it, but rather to identify what it *isn't* and eliminate those activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:01">[01:04:01]</a>. This will naturally draw you towards what you love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:06">[01:04:06]</a>.

Here's how to perform an energy audit:
1.  **Calendar Review:** Go through a representative two-week period of your calendar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:11">[01:04:11]</a>.
2.  **Fill in Gaps:** Note all meetings, but also fill in the time between meetings, estimating what you were actually doing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:17">[01:04:17]</a>.
3.  **Color-Code Energy:** Hour by hour, from 8 AM to 6 PM each day, ask yourself if you had *more* energy or *less* energy at the end of that hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:31">[01:04:31]</a>.
    *   Mark hours where you had *more* energy in **green** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:41">[01:04:41]</a>.
    *   Mark hours where energy was *neutral* or *negative* in **red** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:44">[01:04:44]</a>.
4.  **Identify Themes:** After two weeks, review all the "red" hours and identify common themes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:48">[01:04:48]</a>. Examples of energy-draining activities often include:
    *   One-on-ones with former direct reports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:52">[01:04:52]</a>
    *   Team meetings without prior preparation where everything is verbal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:54">[01:04:54]</a>
    *   Recruiting interviews for candidates who weren't hired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:01">[01:05:01]</a>
    *   Informational interviews that provide no value to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a>

## Addressing Energy Drains

Once you've identified your energy drains, take action on each one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:14">[01:05:14]</a>:

1.  **Eliminate:** Ask if the activity needs to be done at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:18">[01:05:18]</a>. If not, cancel it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:20">[01:05:20]</a>.
2.  **Delegate:** If it needs to be done but someone else can do it, delegate the task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:23">[01:05:23]</a>.
3.  **Make Exquisite:** If it needs to be done and only you can do it (a common scenario), determine what would make the experience "exquisite" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:28">[01:05:28]</a>.
    *   For example, to make a team meeting exquisite, all participants could pre-prepare their updates (priorities, last week's work, this week's work) and pre-write any problems and proposed solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:42">[01:05:42]</a>. This can reduce a three-hour meeting to 45 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>. Share this new methodology with the group; often, they will agree it would benefit everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:12">[01:06:12]</a>.

## Benefits

By consistently applying the energy audit and making changes, your daily activities will shift from energy-draining to energy-raising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:28">[01:06:28]</a>. The goal is to repeatedly conduct this audit until your calendar is approximately 80% green <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:44">[01:06:44]</a>. When this happens, "magic will occur," leading to a phenomenal life and the ability to create massive value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:52">[01:06:52]</a>.

This approach not only benefits individuals but also organizations. For instance, a co-founder team realized one enjoyed internal meetings and the other external, and by aligning their roles based on this, it significantly changed the company's trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:42">[01:08:42]</a>. For every task you don't enjoy, there is someone else who loves to do it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:20">[01:09:20]</a>, making delegation beneficial for all parties involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:37">[01:09:37]</a>.

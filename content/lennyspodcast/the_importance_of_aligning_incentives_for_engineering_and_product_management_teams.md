Aligning incentives between engineering and product management teams is crucial for effective collaboration and achieving shared goals. Historically, issues often arose from misaligned incentives and a lack of mutual understanding between Engineering Managers (EMs) and Product Managers (PMs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:36">[00:41:36]</a>.

## Core Problems in EM-PM Relationships

The primary challenges in the relationship between Engineering Managers and Product Managers stem from two main issues:

1.  **Misaligned Incentives**
    Often, the incentives for EMs and PMs are not aligned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:44">[00:41:44]</a>. For instance, a PM might prioritize saying "yes" to a sales request for a feature because it's crucial for their promotion, while an engineer might argue it's not feasible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:03">[00:42:03]</a>. While the reality of such situations is rarely as simple as a "villain" scenario, understanding that the business needs to sell products is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:20">[00:42:20]</a>.
2.  **Lack of Mutual Understanding**
    More commonly, EMs and PMs simply don't understand each other's needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:55">[00:42:55]</a>. They may start arguing about shipping a feature or changing an approach without first deeply understanding what the other person genuinely cares about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:02">[00:43:02]</a>. Deeply understanding each other's true needs often leads to compromise solutions that satisfy everyone without requiring more time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:27">[00:43:27]</a>.

## Strategies for Aligning Incentives

To foster more productive and happy relationships between EMs and PMs, several strategies can be employed:

### Shared Performance Ratings
A powerful approach is to mandate that EM-PM pairs generally receive the same performance rating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:06">[00:44:06]</a>. This system, experimented with at Carta, creates a shared sense of "pain" and perspective, encouraging both parties to evaluate and solve for the entire set of constraints, not just their functional ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:50">[00:44:50]</a>. The Chief Product Officer and CTO at Carta calibrate together to ensure this alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:32">[00:45:32]</a>. This approach ensures that incentives are shared, even if tradeoffs remain difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:02">[00:46:02]</a>. Some companies might even extend this to include design managers, especially in design-led organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:18">[00:46:18]</a>.

### Understanding "Invisible Constraints"
Product Managers often don't realize the pressures Engineering Managers face, particularly regarding their team's need for interesting work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>. For instance, a growth team might need to run many "boring" experiments, while engineers desire to build something new and innovative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:13">[00:47:13]</a>. EMs caught in this dilemma may appear unreliable because PMs lack visibility into these "invisible constraints" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:44">[00:47:44]</a>. Pushing to understand *why* an EM might prioritize a seemingly "idiotic" rewrite, for example, allows for an honest conversation about navigating these constraints, rather than fostering a victim-villain mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:53">[00:47:53]</a>.

### Aligning Engineering Evaluation with Business Goals
Engineering evaluation should be wholly accountable to the product and business goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:30">[00:51:30]</a>. The purpose of engineering is to support the product and customers, not just to build novel systems for their own sake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:52">[00:51:52]</a>. By committing to showing the roadmap of valuable, impactful work done in the last six months, and clearly explaining the impact, engineering teams can gain trust and space from stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:03">[00:52:03]</a>. If this list is empty, concerns are rightly raised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:30">[00:52:30]</a>.

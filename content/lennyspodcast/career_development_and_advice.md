Bengali Kaba, an experienced product leader with a diverse career at companies such as Facebook, Instagram, Instacart, and YouTube, shares insights on [[career_development_and_planning | career development and planning]] and product growth. His roles include early growth PM at Facebook, Head of Growth at Instagram, VP of Product at Instacart, and Director of Product Management at YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. He has advised numerous startups, including Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.

## Framework for Choosing Where and What to Work On

Kaba developed a framework to help individuals choose where and what to work on, stemming from a personal struggle at Facebook when he felt stuck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:19:00">[07:19:00]</a>. The core of his framework is that **impact** is the most important output to drive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>.

### The Importance of Impact

Impact, not compensation, is the key variable to optimize for in one's [[career_growth_and_personal_development | career growth and personal development]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>. Compensation and leveling are reflections of the impact an individual has <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:00">[09:02:00]</a>. For a product manager, impact means:
*   Driving extreme clarity about product problems and opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:54:00">[09:54:00]</a>.
*   Focusing and prioritizing correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:01:00">[10:01:00]</a>.
*   Delivering on that impact, showing progress quickly with fast, medium, and slow lane wins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:34:00">[10:34:00]</a>.
*   Consistently validating impact by identifying opportunities and acting on them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:46:00">[10:46:00]</a>.

The formula for success is: **Impact = Environment x Skills** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:54:00">[10:54:00]</a>.

### Environment Variables

Kaba identifies six key environment variables that influence an individual's ability to have impact:
1.  **Manager**: The most crucial variable, as a great manager can help address issues with other variables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:25:00">[16:25:00]</a>. Understanding what your manager optimizes for can help align your work and find synergies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:54:00">[17:54:00]</a>.
2.  **Resources**: Availability of appropriate team staffing and budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:15:00">[11:15:00]</a>.
3.  **Scope**: The breadth of one's responsibilities; too little or too much can hinder impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:27:00">[11:27:00]</a>. Kaba experienced issues with excessive scope at Facebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:37:00">[14:37:00]</a>.
4.  **Team**: The relative skills and composition of the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:36:00">[11:36:00]</a>.
5.  **Compensation**: Feeling fairly compensated is vital for job satisfaction and perceived meaning of work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:38:00">[11:38:00]</a>.
6.  **Company Culture**: A supportive and inclusive culture where one feels able to do their best work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:48:00">[11:48:00]</a>.

Kaba recommends scoring these variables annually to objectively assess one's situation and identify areas for improvement or change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:00:00">[12:00:00]</a>.

### Skills Development

Improving skills is a continuous process that requires consistent evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:38:00">[18:38:00]</a>. Key skills for product managers include:
*   **Communication**: Often the most impactful skill, enabling individuals to influence others and tell compelling stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:59:00">[18:59:00]</a>. Effective communication involves active listening to tailor messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:45:00">[23:45:00]</a>.
*   **Influence**: The ability to get others on board with shared goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:50:00">[18:50:00]</a>.
*   **Leadership**: Guiding and inspiring teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:51:00">[18:51:00]</a>.
*   **Strategic Thinking**: The capacity to identify problems and opportunities and set direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:51:00">[18:51:00]</a>.
*   **Execution**: The ability to consistently get things done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:53:00">[18:53:00]</a>.

To build skills, Kaba advises:
*   **Voracious Reading**: Consuming content from thought leaders helps build a diverse toolkit of frameworks and mental models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:55:00">[19:55:00]</a>.
*   **Multiple Mentors**: Instead of a single mentor, build a "stable of mentors" (three or four) and meet them regularly, allowing for consistent growth even if one mentor is unavailable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:18:00">[20:18:00]</a>. To find mentors, articulate specific challenges and ask trusted contacts for recommendations of individuals who have relevant experience or strong insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:03:00">[24:03:00]</a>.
*   **Learning from Others' Practice**: Observe how other successful product managers hone their craft, deliver results, and lead teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:11:00">[21:11:00]</a>. This includes attending their team or leadership meetings to learn practical application of skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:53:00">[21:53:00]</a>. For example, Kaba learned from George Le's ability to listen, recast discussions, and build trust in meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:32:00">[22:32:00]</a>.

## The Power of "Understand Work"

Kaba champions "understand work," a concept he brought from Facebook to other companies like Instagram, Instacart, Twitter, and YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:57:00">[25:57:00]</a>. It is part of the "understand-identify-execute" framework, countering the "identify-justify-execute" anti-pattern where teams build without truly understanding the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:17:00">[27:17:00]</a>.

Understand work is an **intentional affordance** (planned time) within execution to de-risk projects and gain knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:51:00">[27:51:00]</a>. By consciously allocating time for this, teams can clarify root causes, define "jobs to be done," and identify critical use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:16:00">[29:16:00]</a>.

Key benefits of understand work:
*   **Deeper Insight**: Helps teams understand gaps in knowledge (e.g., missing data, research, or user feedback) before committing to execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:26:00">[32:26:00]</a>.
*   **Empowered Teams**: Fosters a culture where teams feel empowered to ask "what else do we need to understand?" before building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:36:00">[29:36:00]</a>.
*   **Parallel Paths**: Enables simultaneous execution of high-conviction projects and understand work for future initiatives. This creates a "velocity multiplier" over time, leading to more intelligent execution and a higher win rate for shipped products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:56:00">[29:56:00]</a>.
*   **Cross-Functional Collaboration**: Involves all relevant functions (engineering, data science, design, marketing, go-to-market) in the understanding process to ensure holistic insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:40:00">[37:40:00]</a>.

While it seems counterintuitive to slow down to speed up, spending more time understanding leads to shipping fewer, but more impactful, things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:10:00">[34:10:00]</a>.

## Coaching and Building Teams

Kaba views product management as a "team sport," emphasizing that product leaders should act as coaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:56:00">[51:56:00]</a>. Not everyone needs to be a "star player"; strong role players are essential, and coaches must groom them and ensure they feel valued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:21:00">[52:21:00]</a>.

He highlights the concept of a "coaching tree," where leaders take pride in the success and growth of those they've mentored, seeing their success as part of their own legacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:54:00">[52:54:00]</a>. This reinforces the responsibility to coach people to greatness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:01:00">[54:01:00]</a>.

Kaba draws on his background in education, specifically Bloom's Taxonomy, to assess where team members are struggling in their critical thinking (knowledge, comprehension, application, analysis, synthesis, evaluation) and how to support them in filling those gaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:02:00">[48:02:00]</a>. He emphasizes meeting people where they are and providing the necessary support, rather than just expecting them to "figure things out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:05:00">[49:05:00]</a>.

### Managing Complex Change

To drive change within cultures, Kaba uses a framework called "Managing Complex Change" (Vision, Skills, Incentives, Resources, Action Plan) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:57:00">[41:57:00]</a>. If any component is missing, it leads to different negative outcomes (e.g., missing vision leads to confusion; missing incentives leads to resistance; missing an action plan leads to false starts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:37:00">[42:37:00]</a>. Leaders must observe where the team is struggling and address the missing components. Building shared mental models and common language (e.g., for "product craft" at YouTube) is crucial for upleveling teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:03:00">[44:03:00]</a>.

## Lessons from Career Transitions and Growth

### Adjacent User Theory
Kaba popularized the "adjacent user theory," which emerged from his time at Instagram during hypergrowth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>, where the user base changed rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>. The theory posits that to drive growth, one must understand not only current users but also the "next user"—the one just outside the current user base who could be using the product but isn't, or for whom the product isn't working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>. This means:
*   Understanding the persona and motivations of the current user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>.
*   Identifying the next user and their specific needs, which might differ from existing power users (e.g., less tech-savvy, different phone types, different cultural contexts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:00">[04:33:00]</a>.
*   "Dogfooding" the product as the adjacent user to identify pain points and missed opportunities (e.g., creating a new Gmail account to experience YouTube as a new user) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>.
*   Observing, talking to, and visiting these users to understand their "jobs to be done" (e.g., Instacart users buying ingredients for a meal, not just groceries) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40:00">[08:40:00]</a>.

This approach is essential for hypergrowth companies and very helpful for companies seeking to expand their audience beyond current market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21:00">[07:21:00]</a>.

### Growth Opportunities

Most growth opportunities lie in the **onboarding to habit-building experience** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:00">[09:02:00]</a>. Many teams fail to understand the initial "aha moment" for users and how to build habit around the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:00">[09:17:00]</a>. While top-of-funnel acquisition is important, retention (finding value, building habit, staying) is crucial for compounding growth over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:44:00">[09:44:00]</a>.

Kaba emphasizes building **compounding growth loops** with multiple acquisition channels. For Instagram, early growth drivers included:
*   **Invitations**: Core component of users inviting friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:37:00">[10:37:00]</a>.
*   **Celebrity Partnerships**: A savvy strategy to teach celebrities how to use Instagram to build their brand, setting platform norms and driving media attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:52:00">[10:52:00]</a>.
*   **SEO**: News articles linking to celebrity Instagram accounts and the launch of Instagram's web presence (which itself boosted growth by 10%) created a powerful SEO engine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:33:00">[11:33:00]</a>.
*   **Paid Media & Content**: Additional layers leveraging signals from the other channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:21:00">[12:21:00]</a>.

An impactful example of understand work at Instagram was addressing "account churn" (people logging out and not getting back in), which cost Instagram millions of users annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:54:00">[20:54:00]</a>. The team realized people needed to log out to share phones or manage data. The solution was:
1.  An "Omni box" login experience allowing email, phone, or handle in one field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:01:00">[22:01:00]</a>.
2.  Text message verification for trusted devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:11:00">[22:11:00]</a>.
3.  An option to save credentials or set a passcode upon logout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:26:00">[22:26:00]</a>.
This significantly improved retention and unexpectedly led to more content creation from second and third accounts, leading to the development of the multiple accounts feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:34:00">[23:34:00]</a>.

### Facebook Insights
At Facebook, working on people recommendations in India, Kaba observed that users had fewer mutual friends and high friending/unfriending rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:12:00">[26:12:00]</a>. "Understand work" involved on-the-ground research, revealing that Facebook's Western-centric profile fields (school, job title) were irrelevant for many Indian users, who often had common names (e.g., Amit Kumar) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:57:00">[27:57:00]</a>. Users instead relied on pictures to identify friends. This highlighted the need for culturally relevant descriptors and solutions beyond standard Western paradigms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:19:00">[28:19:00]</a>.

### [[Navigating Career Transitions and SelfConfidence | Career Failures and Lessons Learned]]
Kaba considers his time at Instacart less successful because he had a strong vision for product direction but failed to align with the company's core operational DNA and its need for more tactical, in-the-weeds product leadership at that time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:38:00">[29:38:00]</a>. The key lesson was the importance of thorough "understand work" before joining a company, especially by speaking with former employees who can offer a more candid perspective on the company's reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:21:00">[31:21:00]</a>.

### First 90 Days in a New Role
In the first 90 days of a new job, Kaba prioritizes sitting in team meetings, listening, and getting to know individuals by name and story, understanding their professional and personal passions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:11:00">[36:11:00]</a>. This investment in understanding the people and how the team works from their perspective makes them more receptive when he later shares his own thoughts and direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:52:00">[36:52:00]</a>.

## Philosophy for [[Career Development and Progression Strategies | Career Growth Strategies for Product Managers]]

*   **Teams over Goals**: "People and teams don't really reach their goals; they fall to the level of their system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:34:00">[37:34:00]</a>. This applies to both personal and professional systems.
*   **Universal Human Problems**: Kaba's experience as a dean at a boarding school in Switzerland taught him that human challenges and connections are universal, regardless of background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:17:00">[39:17:00]</a>. In tech, valuing diverse voices is critical for building world-class, scalable, and hyper-growth products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:10:00">[40:10:00]</a>.
*   **The Importance of Asking for Help**: When seeking mentorship or guidance, Kaba advises clearly articulating the specific challenge or opportunity and asking if someone knows an expert who can help, rather than a generic request for mentorship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:03:00">[24:03:00]</a>. This creates a "common purpose" and higher likelihood of a beneficial connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:57:00">[24:57:00]</a>.

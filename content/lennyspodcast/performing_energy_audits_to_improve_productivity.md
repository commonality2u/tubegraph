The "Energy Audit" is a method designed to help individuals and organizations optimize their activities by identifying what gives and saps energy, ultimately leading to greater productivity and satisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:58">[01:01:58]</a>. The core idea is that what individuals are truly good at is often what they love, where "space and time disappear" when they are engaged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:11">[01:02:11]</a>. Such activities might not be valued as highly by the individual because they come so easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:22">[01:02:22]</a>. Conversely, tasks that individuals are good at but do not love can drain energy, even if they are creating value for others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:28">[01:02:28]</a>.

## The Four Zones of Performance

This concept, attributed to Diana Chapman at the Conscious Leadership Group, categorizes activities into four zones based on skill and enjoyment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:40">[01:02:40]</a>:

*   **Zone of Incompetence:** Activities where you are not good at something, and someone else is better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:58">[01:02:58]</a>. It's advisable to delegate or avoid these tasks.
*   **Zone of Confidence:** Activities you can perform adequately, but so can many others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:08">[01:03:08]</a>. These tasks might take a lot of time and not create significant value when done by you; they should also be delegated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:16">[01:03:16]</a>.
*   **Zone of Excellence (The Danger Zone):** Activities where you are uniquely good, but you don't love doing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:24">[01:03:24]</a>. People often get paid well for these, and they create value, but they also drain personal energy and hinder growth into areas of true passion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:30">[01:03:30]</a>.
*   **Zone of Genius:** Activities where you are uniquely good and passionately love what you do, often without even noticing the effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:46">[01:03:46]</a>. The goal is to maximize time spent in this zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:51">[01:03:51]</a>.

To shift into the zone of genius, the strategy is not to immediately figure out what it is and do more of it, but rather to identify what it *isn't* and eliminate those tasks. This naturally draws individuals toward what they love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:01">[01:04:01]</a>.

## How to Perform an Energy Audit

1.  **Select a Representative Period:** Choose two weeks from your calendar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:11">[01:04:11]</a>.
2.  **Detail Activities:** Go through each hour, noting not just meetings, but also what you were doing in between them (e.g., email, focused work) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:17">[01:04:17]</a>.
3.  **Mark Energy Levels:** For each hour, ask yourself: "Did I have more energy or less energy at the end of that hour?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:34">[01:04:34]</a>.
    *   Mark green for more energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:41">[01:04:41]</a>.
    *   Mark red for neutral or negative energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:44">[01:04:44]</a>.
4.  **Identify Themes in Red Activities:** After two weeks, review all the "red" marked hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:48">[01:04:48]</a>. Look for recurring patterns (e.g., one-on-ones with former direct reports, unprepared team meetings, interviews with unhired candidates, informational interviews providing no value) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:52">[01:04:52]</a>. These are energy-draining activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:11">[01:05:11]</a>.
5.  **Address Red Activities:** For each identified theme, ask:
    *   **Eliminate:** "Do I need to do this at all?" If not, cancel it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:18">[01:05:18]</a>.
    *   **Delegate:** "It needs to be done, but can someone else do it?" If so, delegate it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:23">[01:05:23]</a>.
    *   **Make Exquisite:** "It needs to be done, and only I can do it." In this case, determine what would make the activity "exquisite" for you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:29">[01:05:29]</a>. For example, for team meetings, this might involve requiring all participants to pre-prepare updates and problems, allowing for quick processing and decision-making, reducing a three-hour meeting to 45 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:42">[01:05:42]</a>. Share this new methodology with the group, as they often feel the same way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:17">[01:06:17]</a>.

## Outcomes and Benefits

Regularly performing [[enhancing_personal_productivity_and_work_efficiency | energy audits]] can transform a calendar filled with energy-draining tasks into one with open space or energy-raising activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:28">[01:06:28]</a>. The goal is to reach a point where your calendar is 80% green, leading to a "phenomenal" life and the ability to create massive value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:47">[01:06:47]</a>.

This method has been successfully applied to teams, such as at Brax, where managers conducting energy audits discovered that one enjoyed internal meetings while another preferred external ones, leading to a division of labor that "changed the trajectory of the company" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:40">[01:08:40]</a>. This highlights that for every task an individual doesn't enjoy, there's likely someone else who loves doing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:20">[01:09:20]</a>.

While fear can be a powerful short-term motivator, akin to adrenaline, the motivation derived from joy is long-term and non-corrosive, allowing for sustained effort and a more fulfilling life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:26">[01:00:26]</a>. Performing energy audits helps align work with joy, fostering [[enhancing_personal_productivity_and_work_efficiency | productivity]] through intrinsic motivation.

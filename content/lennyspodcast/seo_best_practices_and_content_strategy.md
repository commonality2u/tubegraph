## The Foundation of Growth: SEO's Importance

For companies in their [[evaluating_when_to_invest_in_seo_for_startups | early days]], focusing on fundamental elements like a fast website and ensuring search engines recognize its existence is crucial before investing in paid advertising [00:00:09]. Only after these basic questions are answered should a company consider paid ads [00:00:24]. A website loading in four-plus seconds will hinder the success of any paid advertising program [00:00:33].

At Deel, approximately 50% of current growth comes from non-paid channels, including SEO [01:06:04]. Early on, this percentage was even higher, at 80% to 90% [01:16:17].

## Core SEO Philosophy: Ending the Search

The biggest mistake people make in SEO is merely "shoving keywords" into content [01:42:42]. The primary goal of SEO content should be to *end the Google search* for the user [01:17:08]. If someone reads your content after a Google search and doesn't need to return to Google for more information, that indicates successful content [01:17:01]. Search engines prioritize providing users with the quickest answer possible [01:17:11]. This approach makes it easier to write content that people actually want to read, rather than meandering text filled with keywords that bore readers [01:17:19].

## Operationalizing SEO Content

### The Traffic Light System for Content Prioritization
Deel's content team uses a "traffic light system" framework to decide what content gets published [01:47:46].
1.  **Keyword Identification:** The team identifies up to 700 keywords related to their services, ranging from closely related to distant [01:56:00].
2.  **Volume Ranking:** These keywords are ranked from highest to lowest search volume [01:58:00].
3.  **Intent Assessment:** For each keyword, the team assesses the user's search intent [01:59:00]:
    *   **Green Light:** High intent, indicating the person is likely looking for a solution like Deel's [01:34:34].
    *   **Yellow Light:** Medium intent, where the user might be looking to buy a solution but perhaps not immediately [01:38:41].
    *   **Red Light:** Low intent, meaning the search is for reasons other than purchasing a solution [01:46:46].
4.  **Prioritization:** Content creation then prioritizes green-light keywords from highest to lowest volume, followed by yellows [01:59:34]. Red-light keywords are often not addressed [02:00:01].

### Content Creation Process
To create effective SEO content, the first step is understanding the search intent behind a keyword [02:15:00]. This involves checking what Google currently surfaces for a given term [02:24:00]. For instance, typing "eor" into Google initially yields "enhanced oil recovery" rather than "employer of record," indicating that the latter is not the dominant search intent for that acronym [02:32:00].

A good source for understanding subsequent user questions is the "People also ask" section at the bottom of Google search results [02:00:59]. Various [[using_ai_to_optimize_seo_efforts | SEO tools]] can help ensure content is written in simple language (e.g., a fifth-grade reading level) and that keywords are properly placed [02:16:00]. Deel uses tools like Clearscope to score content and ensure its readability and keyword optimization [02:38:00].

### Content Team Structure
Deel's content team is led by a director and comprises approximately eight full-time individuals [02:21:00].
*   **Operations Lead:** One person manages all operations, including working with freelancers, sending briefs, fact-checking, and publishing articles [02:18:00].
*   **Product Line Focus:** Different team members focus on specific product lines to build expertise [02:40:00].
*   **New Mediums:** Recently, a team was established to focus on different content types beyond written articles, such as video and educational content [02:47:00].

### Publication Frequency
Deel's team initially published around 10 net new articles per week [02:37:00]. Currently, they aim for five new articles and five article updates weekly to ensure information remains current, especially regarding regulations that constantly change [02:44:00]. This operation also extends to multiple languages, starting from English and expanding [02:06:00].

## Key Lessons for SEO Success
SEO is time-consuming and cannot be fully automated [02:23:00]. Attempts to cut corners often result in low-quality resources that nobody wants to read, leading to an unsuccessful SEO program [02:47:00]. It requires discipline and a willingness to engage in detailed tasks like keyword research, which senior professionals might mistakenly consider "below them" [02:37:00]. A content team, particularly for SEO, functions more like an operational team than a purely creative one due to the systematic approach required [01:40:00].

> "Is this search over? [01:31:00]"
> "The biggest mistake people make is SEO is one of those things that you can try and automate it... but it never stops being time consuming and to do it well it is going to be time consuming [02:22:00]."

### Case Study: IRS Linking to Deel's Content
In a previous role, a Deel team member wrote an article explaining the PPP program during COVID-19, addressing questions about qualification and application [02:38:00]. This resource was so comprehensive and helpful that the IRS website linked to it as a definitive answer [02:39:00]. This example demonstrates that providing best-in-class, thoroughly answered content can lead to significant organic reach and growth [02:29:00]. This became a huge driver of traffic for a short period when people were trying to apply for PPP [03:55:00].

## When to Invest in SEO
Not every company should prioritize SEO [02:48:00]. SEO is most effective for businesses where people are actively searching for a solution to a problem [02:53:00].
*   **Good Fit:** B2B companies solving an active, specific problem will find SEO valuable [02:55:00].
*   **Less Suitable:** Direct-to-consumer companies selling products like lipstick may find less value in SEO because customers often discover such products through social media or influencers, not Google [02:59:00]. Even for queries like "best lipstick of 2023," it's unlikely a brand's website would rank over third-party, objective review sites [02:13:00].

From an [[evaluating_when_to_invest_in_seo_for_startups | early growth prioritization]] perspective, ensuring a functional and comprehensible website is foundational [02:57:00]. This involves ensuring the site is fast, that search engines recognize its existence, and that content is present to help people find it [02:07:00]. Only after these basics are covered should investment shift to paid ads [02:27:00]. This strategic progression ensures a solid "skeleton" before applying "makeup" [00:03:00].

The direct involvement of a CEO, especially a founder, in product development can be a critical factor in a company's success and direction. Brian Chesky, CEO and co-founder of Airbnb, shares his perspective and experience on this approach, emphasizing the need for clarity, deep engagement in details, and a unified company vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">00:00:00</a>.

## The Founder's Dilemma and the Need for Clarity
Founders sometimes apologize for how they truly want to run their company, leading to a "midpoint" approach that can make everyone miserable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">00:00:00</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:21">00:31:21</a>. Instead, what employees truly desire is clarity and the ability to work together in the same direction quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">00:00:13</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:48">00:31:48</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:33">00:38:33</a>.

Many Founders go through a cycle where they initially direct all efforts, then are encouraged to delegate and empower, which can inadvertently lead to small-scale thinking, excessive optimization work, and organizational issues like bureaucracy and politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">00:15:37</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">00:15:52</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">00:19:57</a>. Ultimately, they may realize the need to retake the reins and steer the company themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">00:16:01</a>, a cycle observed in almost every company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">00:16:10</a>.

Ben Horowitz has noted that [[founder_mode_in_product_leadership | product-led Founders]] or engineering-led Founders often delegate away their core strengths, which are the most difficult to replace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">00:16:16</a>.

## CEO as Chief Product Officer
At Airbnb, there is no Chief Product Officer (CPO) title; Brian Chesky views himself as filling that [[role_of_product_leaders | role of product leaders]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">00:16:33</a>. For a product-led or tech-led company, the CEO should essentially function as the [[role_of_product_leaders | Chief Product Officer]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">00:16:41</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:36">00:35:36</a>. If the CEO isn't deeply involved in the product, the company may not truly be product or tech-led <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">00:16:46</a>.

## Getting "In the Details"
Chesky actively gets involved in every single detail of the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">00:00:20</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">00:00:54</a>, differentiating this from micromanagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">00:00:27</a>. Micromanagement involves telling people exactly what to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">00:00:31</a>, whereas being in the details means understanding the work to assess performance and provide effective leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">00:00:35</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">00:00:44</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:27">00:32:27</a>. This detailed involvement allows leaders to understand bottlenecks and identify individual blockers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:49">00:29:49</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:40">00:32:40</a>.

> "People think that a great leader's job is to like hire people and and just empower them to do a good job. Well, how do you know they're doing a good job if you're not in the details?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">00:00:46</a>

Chesky found that the less he was involved in a project, the more "spin" there was, the less clear the goals were, and the slower teams moved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">00:17:43</a>. Giving teams more control and empowerment paradoxically led to slower movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">00:18:13</a>, as increased delegation to independent teams resulted in organizational divisions, politics, and bureaucracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">00:10:33</a>.

## Reasserting Control and Driving Change
A near-death business experience, such as the 80% loss of business in 8 weeks during the pandemic, provided clarity and prompted Chesky to take more direct control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:20">00:24:20</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:59">00:24:59</a>. Prior to the crisis, some felt he was too involved; after it, there was a clear need for his deeper engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">00:24:52</a>.

Changes implemented at Airbnb to address organizational drift and improve product development included:
*   **Cutting down projects**: Focusing on approximately 20% of prior initiatives, with multiple teams working on one thing rather than one team on many <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">00:30:30</a>.
*   **Removing management layers**: Aiming for as few layers as possible between leaders and teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:46">00:25:46</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:59">00:37:59</a>.
*   **Functional model**: Shifting from divisional leaders to functional leaders (design, engineering, product marketing, marketing, communications, sales, operations) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">00:25:51</a>.
*   **Fewer, more senior employees**: Believing that adding more people can slow projects down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:09">00:26:09</a>, they opted for a smaller, more senior workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">00:26:05</a>.
*   **Expert executives**: Ensuring every executive is an expert in their functional domain, emphasizing managing the work first and people second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:29">00:26:29</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:02">00:36:02</a>.
*   **Centralized decision-making**: Pulling decision-making up rather than pushing it down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:10">00:27:10</a>.
*   **Single shared consciousness**: Ensuring the top 30-40 people in the company have a continuous conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:15">00:27:15</a>.
*   **Calendar-driven roadmap**: Subordinating metrics to a rolling two-year product roadmap updated monthly, with product releases twice a year (May and October/November) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">00:13:52</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:21">00:27:21</a>.
*   **Integrated Product Marketing**: Combining inbound product development responsibilities of a product manager with outbound/marketing responsibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">00:07:03</a>. This function also became responsible for understanding customer learning and telling the product's story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">00:14:32</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:28">00:37:28</a>.
*   **Program Management**: Offloading many program management duties from [[Role of Product Managers | product managers]] to dedicated program managers, making it a high-status job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">00:07:13</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:02">00:28:02</a>.
*   **CEO Product Reviews**: Establishing a CEO review schedule for all product and marketing work, enabling direct tracking of progress and bottlenecks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:31">00:28:31</a>. This removed the need for persuasion or politics, as issues were addressed directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">00:29:02</a>.
*   **In-house Creative Agency**: Building an internal team for marketing communications and creative functions, overseeing not just ads but product creative, to ensure a cohesive voice across all touchpoints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:15">00:30:15</a>.
*   **Consolidated Writing**: Eliminating "UX writing" as a separate function and combining it with marketing writing to ensure a single, consistent brand voice across app, emails, and ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:41">00:30:41</a>.

This intense, hands-on involvement was initially more work, but after one to two years, it led to greater efficiency, fewer conflicts, less turnover, and a more unified company culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:17">00:51:17</a>. The CEO's direct involvement meant fewer bad surprises and less time spent intervening in dysfunctional projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:55">00:51:55</a>.

## Implications for Growth and Product Strategy
By emphasizing product-led growth and reducing reliance on traditional growth channels like paid advertising, Airbnb prioritizes building the best possible product and then educating people about it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">00:01:44</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:34">00:34:34</a>. This strategy shifts focus from short-term "running the ball down the field" (optimization) to long-term "passes" (big leaps in product innovation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:10">00:35:10</a>.

Key elements for this strategy include:
*   The CEO acting as [[role_of_product_leaders | Chief Product Officer]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:36">00:35:36</a>.
*   Close collaboration: All [[Role of Product Managers | product managers]] should be interconnected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50">00:35:50</a>.
*   Expert leadership: Leaders must be experts in their domain, not just people managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:02">00:36:02</a>.
*   Fewer people per team: Growing slowly and deliberately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:25">00:36:25</a>.
*   Launches: Using product launches to tell a cohesive story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:42">00:36:42</a>.
*   Balanced decision-making: Using data, research, and intuition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:51">00:36:51</a>.
*   Direct reporting: [[Engineering and product management integration | Engineering and design should ideally report to the founder/product-led person]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:12">00:37:12</a>. Design should not be under product unless the product person is also effectively a designer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:20">00:37:20</a>.
*   Expanded [[Role of Product Managers | product management]] responsibility: Including distribution and [[talking_to_customers_for_product_development | understanding the customer]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:28">00:37:28</a>.
*   [[Product management and innovation | Art and Science combination]]: Product managers should blend both artistic and scientific thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">00:37:37</a>.
*   Interconnected marketing and engineering: Reflecting that marketing serves as "waiters" interacting with customers, while engineers are "chefs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:55">00:37:55</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">00:11:52</a>.
*   CEO involvement in lower layers: Treating direct reports' direct reports as implicit dotted lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:04">00:38:04</a>.
*   Storytelling through releases: Viewing each product release as a chapter in the company's long-term story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:18">00:38:18</a>.

This integrated approach aims to ensure that everyone in the company works in the same direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">00:14:27</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:33">00:33:33</a>.

## Personal Balance and Leadership Growth
While deeply involved, Chesky has learned to create personal balance by stepping away from work every other weekend, consistently exercising, maintaining a healthy diet, ensuring sufficient sleep, and prioritizing healthy relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:02">00:53:02</a>. He found that once the new operating model was established, he paradoxically had more time on his hands because the organization became more self-sufficient and aligned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:41">00:50:41</a>.

For personal growth as a leader, Chesky maintains a "beginner's mindset" and curiosity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:19">00:59:19</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:03">01:00:03</a>. He studies the history of organizational structures and learns from other leaders like Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, and Alfred Sloan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:14">01:00:14</a>. He is "shameless about reaching out for help," recognizing that asking for help is an honor for others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:51">01:00:51</a>. He values learning from peers and those just a few years ahead, as they often have the most current insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:17">01:01:17</a>.

Chesky emphasizes the importance of setting the pace for a team, encouraging faster decision-making and a bias for action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:37">00:47:37</a>. His "add a zero" philosophy, challenging teams to think 10x bigger or better, aims to break people out of current processes and encourage first-principles thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:33">00:46:33</a>. This approach stems from believing in people's potential beyond what they see in themselves, fostering a growth mindset rather than demoralization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:05">00:49:05</a>.

Ultimately, the CEO's deep involvement, clear vision, and commitment to a cohesive, product-driven strategy are presented as crucial for navigating growth, avoiding bureaucracy, and delivering impactful results.

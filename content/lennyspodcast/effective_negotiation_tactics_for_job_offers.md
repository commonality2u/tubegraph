When seeking a new role, it's crucial to approach the process with a mindset of "playing to win" rather than just avoiding a loss, especially during the interview and negotiation phases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. This means taking charge and demonstrating your value proactively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:04">[01:11:04]</a>.

## Playing to Win with a Job Mission and OKRs

A powerful tactic is to create your own version of the job description, called a "job mission with OKRs (Objectives and Key Results)" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:28">[00:50:28]</a>. This approach turns a typical passive job search into a proactive, product-oriented one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:07">[00:50:07]</a>.

Most job descriptions are often poorly defined, as companies themselves might not have a clear understanding of what they need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:40">[00:50:40]</a>. By drafting your own job mission with measurable OKRs, you're articulating the specific outcomes you plan to deliver for the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:06">[00:51:06]</a>.

### Benefits of the Job Mission with OKRs
1.  **Develops Insightful Questions**: Drafting this document privately helps you formulate excellent [[behavioral_and_situational_interview_techniques | interview questions]] to clarify the role, impressing the hiring team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:21">[00:51:21]</a>.
2.  **Impresses Hiring Managers**: Once you've had a couple of [[behavioral_and_situational_interview_techniques | interviews]], share a draft of your job mission with the hiring manager, ideally via a live conversation (phone, Zoom, or coffee), not email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:33">[00:51:33]</a>. Hiring managers are often blown away by this initiative, as it demonstrates accountability, foresight, and a desire to deliver outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:56">[00:51:56]</a>. This proactive step can significantly increase your chances of receiving an offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:58">[00:52:58]</a>.
3.  **Clarifies Expectations**: The job mission helps prevent taking a job that turns out to be entirely different than expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:20">[00:53:20]</a>. It allows for a collaborative conversation to align on the role's scope and expected outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:16">[00:58:16]</a>.

## Negotiating Beyond Salary: The Four Legs of the Negotiation Stool

Once an offer is on the table, your job mission with OKRs sets the stage for a strategic [[anticipating_objections_and_persuasion_strategies | negotiation]] that goes beyond just compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:50">[00:53:50]</a>. This is a collaborative conversation, not an antagonistic one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:06">[00:58:06]</a>.

Approach the hiring manager (preferably, rather than just the recruiter) and express enthusiasm for the offer, then shift the conversation to what you'll need to succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:08">[00:54:08]</a>.

### Examples of Non-Salary Negotiation Points
*   **Addressing Technical Debt**: For senior roles, you might inquire about significant technical debt and propose a budget or commitment to eliminate it as a priority from day one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:28">[00:54:28]</a>.
    *   *Case Study*: One Chief Product Officer (CPO) successfully negotiated a $20 million budget to address technical debt. This upfront commitment allowed them to update systems, innovate, and ultimately get promoted to a GM role within a year, then be considered for a CEO role a year after <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:55">[00:54:55]</a>. Another CPO who was shy about asking for resources ended up looking for a new job 18 months later due to unresolved tech debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:15">[00:55:15]</a>.
*   **Team Development**: Discuss the need for team training, additional hires (e.g., ICs), or strengthening specific functions like design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:49">[00:55:49]</a>. Even negotiating a training budget shows your commitment to the team's and company's success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>.
*   **Mentorship and Professional Development**: For junior professionals, this could involve discussing access to mentorship, professional development opportunities, or attending conferences and training programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:16">[00:56:16]</a>.

By asking for these resources, you're demonstrating initiative, accountability, and a genuine desire for success, which benefits the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:51">[00:59:51]</a>. If the company is unwilling to commit to these success factors, it can be a "huge red flag" indicating they may not be serious about setting you up for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:14">[00:57:14]</a>.

## Asking for More Money

After discussing the support you need to succeed, transition to the financial discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:14">[01:00:14]</a>. While market conditions can affect negotiation room, historical data shows that 87% of the time, people get more money when they ask for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:17">[01:00:17]</a>.

Don't be afraid to ask, but do so collaboratively, not antagonistically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:35">[01:00:35]</a>. A simple, low-risk phrase can be, "Hey, are you open to [higher number]? That was really what I was hoping for when I think I'm worth. Is that something we can talk about?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:02">[01:01:02]</a>. Most of the time, they will say yes, even if they can't meet your exact figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:17">[01:01:17]</a>.

### Negotiation Best Practices
*   **Live Conversation**: Whenever possible, conduct these discussions in person or over a call (phone or Zoom), rather than email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:50">[01:02:50]</a>. This allows for a more collaborative and human interaction.
*   **Building Relationships**: All effective negotiation hinges on building good relationships throughout the [[behavioral_and_situational_interview_techniques | interview process]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:42">[01:03:42]</a>.
*   **Job Search Councils**: People often feel shy about negotiating, especially when facing a power imbalance with companies that have extensive resources like lawyers and HR teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:50">[01:01:50]</a>. This is where a [[job_search_strategies_and_mindset | Job Search Council]] is invaluable, offering support and a sounding board to overcome this hesitancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:58">[01:01:58]</a>.

## Debriefing and Building Confidence

After [[behavioral_and_situational_interview_techniques | interviews]] and [[anticipating_objections_and_persuasion_strategies | negotiations]], debrief with your [[job_search_strategies_and_mindset | Job Search Council]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:12">[01:07:12]</a>. People often misinterpret their performance, believing they did poorly even when they succeeded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:16">[01:07:16]</a>. A council can help you parse what truly happened and counteract your inner critic or imposter syndrome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:50">[01:07:50]</a>.

Before entering an interview or negotiation, reflect on your "Gratitude House" exercise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:21">[01:05:21]</a>. This involves recalling everyone who has supported you in your life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:26">[01:05:26]</a>. Imagining these people on your shoulders can provide a sense of not being alone and boost your confidence, allowing you to show up as your authentic, capable self <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:36">[01:06:36]</a>. This confidence is vital because anxiety and fear can erode your performance and impact your chances of receiving offers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:54">[01:09:54]</a>.

## Back-Channeling and References

For senior roles, when checking references or receiving an offer, it's wise to "back-channel" by speaking informally with people who have worked with the hiring manager or in the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:21">[01:44:21]</a>. Ask direct questions like, "Would you work with this person?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:33">[01:44:33]</a>.

A powerful reference check question for hiring managers to ask is: "I'm about to hire Lenny. If it would be a huge mistake if I didn't bring him on, if you think he's amazing, then call me back; otherwise, don't bother." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:49">[01:44:49]</a> This cuts through legal jargon and provides clear signals about a candidate's perceived value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:03">[01:44:03]</a>.

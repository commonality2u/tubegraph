Marily Nika, a Product Lead at Meta and a former Google employee with experience in computer vision and machine learning, emphasizes the importance of continuous learning for aspiring [[ai_in_product_management | AI product managers]]. She notes that in the future, all product managers will likely be [[how_to_become_an_ai_product_manager | AI product managers]] by default, as AI will be baked into every product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:54">[03:31:54]</a>.

## General Learning Philosophy

It's crucial for aspiring [[ai_in_product_management | AI product managers]] not to be overwhelmed by AI technologies, even without a technical background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:43:53">[11:43:53]</a>. While product managers will not need to train or code models, understanding the fundamentals of how these systems work is beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:51:57">[11:51:57]</a>. This foundational knowledge provides a different mindset and confidence, preventing blind trust in tools and fostering a deeper understanding of their creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:24:00">[24:24:00]</a>.

Marily encourages flexing the "zero to one muscle," which is crucial for innovation in [[ai_in_product_management | product management]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:09:59">[31:09:59]</a>.

### Books
*   *[[tools_and_techniques_for_ai_product_managers | Inspired: How to Create Products People Love]]* by Marty Cagan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:28:00">[44:28:00]</a>.
*   *You Look Like a Thing and I Love You*: A book about how AI works and why it's making the world a "weirder place" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:37:00">[44:37:00]</a>.
*   *Adventures of Women in Tech Workbook* by Marily Nika and Atlan Carr: A workbook for women in tech to navigate their careers, available on Amazon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:51:00">[44:51:00]</a>.

## Practical Learning Strategies

*   **Shadow AI Researchers/Scientists**: If you're already at a company with AI researchers, spend time talking to and observing them. This provides valuable context on their work and the potential of AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:07:00">[29:07:00]</a>.
*   **Learn to Code (Fundamentals)**: Marily strongly advocates for learning the basics of coding and how to train a small model. This foundational knowledge helps in understanding how AI tools function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:09:00">[24:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:02:00">[25:02:00]</a>.
*   **Get Hands-On**: Engage in practical exercises and pair up with others to learn and build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:06:00">[25:06:00]</a>.
*   **Focus on Problem Solving**: Avoid the "shiny object trap" of doing AI just for the sake of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:21:00">[13:21:00]</a>. Ensure there's a real problem or pain point that needs a smart solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.
*   **Understand Data Collection**: A crucial first step in AI is understanding what data you have, how to collect it, and what can be done with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:38:00">[12:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:46:00">[12:46:00]</a>.

Ravi Mehta, a seasoned product leader and co-founder of Outpace, shares insights from his career transition from roles at large companies like Tinder, Facebook, and TripAdvisor to founding his own startup. He highlights key distinctions in product leadership between established corporations and early-stage ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.

## Speed: Velocity vs. Latency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>

A common misconception is that startups are inherently faster than larger companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. While larger companies generally have higher "velocity" (the quantity of work they can get done due to more engineers and resources) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>, startups excel in "latency" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

*   **Velocity (Big Companies)**: Large companies can execute more work because they have greater resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. However, like a fast car, they cannot turn as quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.
*   **Latency (Startups)**: Startups benefit from low latency, allowing for quick transitions from an idea to testing and validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. This means a tight turning radius, enabling daily or weekly data collection rather than long-term projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.
    *   **Latency Test**: To gauge latency, ask how long it takes to go from deciding to make a simple product change (e.g., A/B testing button text) to getting the results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.

## Decision-Making: Experimental vs. Conviction-Oriented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>

The approach to making decisions differs significantly:

*   **Big Companies (Experimental)**: Large companies with substantial user bases can rely on experimentation, running A/B tests to gather statistically significant results and iterate on product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. This is a common part of [[strategies_for_building_products_at_large_companies | building products at large companies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.
*   **Startups (Conviction-Oriented)**: Startups typically lack the user volume for effective A/B testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. Leaders must shift to a conviction-oriented approach, making decisions based on "enough data to have informed conviction" and moving forward quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. Avoiding paralysis by analysis is key to finding [[finding_productmarket_fit_in_startups | product-market fit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.

## Professional Networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>

The professional networks that are valuable also change with company size:

*   **Big Company Networks**: Individuals at larger companies often build careers and lifestyles around that particular stage, preferring benefits and specific problem types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>. Their expertise is often deep within a craft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.
*   **Startup Networks**: Early-stage work requires a different community of generalists, including founders, freelancers, investors, and angels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>. Marketing and growth for early-stage companies are also distinct, relying on "hackers" who leverage new distribution channels and techniques like TikTok or SEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>.

> Individuals aspiring to start a company should plug into an early-stage network as soon as possible. Useful communities include:
> *   **Indie Hacker Community**: Focuses on solo builders and provides insights into being a generalist and doing everything oneself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>.
> *   **Everything Marketplaces**: A community for founders, specifically focused on marketplace businesses, offering events and curated experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>.

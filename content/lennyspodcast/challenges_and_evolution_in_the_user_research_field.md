The field of user research is undergoing a significant "reckoning," prompting a need for adaptation and change within the discipline itself and in how companies leverage it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>. This shift is partly due to recent layoffs, which disproportionately affected user experience (UX) and UX research teams, signaling that the existing system may be [[common_challenges_and_solutions_in_product_management | broken]] and research is not consistently driving the value or impact it should <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>.

## User-Centered Performance: A Symbolic Practice

A major challenge identified by Jud Anon, former head of research at Facebook and Airbnb, is "user-centered performance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>. This refers to customer obsession or user-centered practice that is symbolic rather than genuinely focused on learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It's work done to signal customer obsession, not to inform different decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

Common examples include:
*   Product Managers (PMs) asking researchers to run a "quick user study" at the end of a product process merely to validate assumptions, at which point it's often too late to make a difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>.
*   "Check-the-box" style research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.
*   Executives or product people requesting "executive listening sessions" or focus groups primarily to feel close to the customer, rather than to genuinely learn and inform decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

This performative user-centeredness is often driven by cognitive biases and ego, where individuals are looking to validate their ideas rather than to be proven wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

> [!WARNING] The goal of research should be to falsify assumptions, not validate them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Categories of Research and Their Impact

Jud Anon outlines three categories of user research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>:

1.  **Macro Research**: This is big-picture, strategic, business-focused, and forward-looking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>. It involves understanding the overall competitive landscape, strategic planning, market analysis, and long-term product direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>.
2.  **Middle-Range Research**: This category addresses middle-altitude research questions focused on user understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>. It often involves asking groups of people how they think, feel, or behave regarding a product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>. While interesting, it often yields insights that are hard to operationalize and can feel obvious in hindsight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>. This type of research frequently delays decisions and fulfills the need for teams to feel user-centered without necessarily changing anything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>.
3.  **Micro Research**: This is highly technical usability research focused on enabling a high-quality, pixel-perfect product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>. It can be laser-focused, for example, on understanding A/B test results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>.

> [!WARNING] The primary issue is that too much time and effort is currently spent on middle-range research, which is "interesting but not impactful enough" for the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>. This is often because researchers are asked to do this type of work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>.

## Challenges in Product Management and Research Integration

A core problem is that user research is often positioned as a reactive "service function" rather than an integrated, proactive partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.
*   Researchers are called in late in the product process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.
*   They have less input on shaping the research questions for maximum business impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.
*   This leads to less impactful research, reinforcing the perception that researchers are not valuable, ultimately leading to them being sidelined or laid off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.

> [!QUOTE] "Product managers love to ask for Middle range research that they can use to justify decisions they're reluctant to make on their own. User designers love to ask for Middle range research because it fits their model of what proper design process should look like Executives love to to ask for Middle range because they don't really understand what research is for it helps them do performative user centeredness in the end they will decide based on their own opinions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>

## The Evolution of User Research: Towards Greater Impact

To navigate this "reckoning," both researchers and companies need to adapt. The discipline is not dying, but evolving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>.

### For Researchers: Developing a "Swiss Army Knife" of Skills

Top researchers possess a diverse skill set, beyond just qualitative methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>:

*   **Formative or Generative User Experience Research**: Looking ahead, innovation-focused, open-ended, potentially ethnographic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>.
*   **Evaluative Research**: Usability testing and micro-level analysis for product refinement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>.
*   **Rigorous Survey Design**: For scaled insights from communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>.
*   **Applied Statistics**: Essential for understanding A/B test results and quantitative data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>.
*   **Technical Skills**: Such as SQL for running queries, understanding data, and increasingly, prompt engineering for interacting with generative AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>.

Beyond methods, researchers must become more business-oriented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>. This means:
*   Understanding company quarterly reports, shareholder calls, OKRs, metrics, and the conversion funnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>.
*   Proposing research questions that directly address business problems or opportunities within the product funnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>.
*   Building strong relationships with product and design partners to be consistently engaged from beginning to end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>.
*   Learning to say "no" and ruthlessly prioritizing the most important projects with their partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>.
*   Being excellent communicators, tailoring their message to the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>.

### For Companies: Integrated and Lean Processes

Companies must restructure how products are made to fully [[the_integration_of_user_research_in_product_development | integrate research]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>.

*   **Constant Engagement**: Researchers should be consistently present in product processes, participating in conversations to frame the right questions that drive maximum business impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>.
*   **Unified Insights**: Avoid siloing different insights disciplines (UX research, consumer insights, market research, data science, customer service feedback) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>. An integrated insights function can synthesize information to provide a clearer picture for product teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.
*   **Shared Metrics**: All team members (PMs, engineers, designers, researchers) should ideally share the same metrics for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>.
*   **Influence through Partnership**: The goal for researchers is to develop such strong, trusting relationships that product teams cannot have key decision-making meetings without them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>.

## Common Misconceptions and Tropes about Research

Several common tropes hinder effective [[strategies_for_effective_user_research_and_its_business_impact | user research]] integration:

*   **"Research is too slow."** Good research, especially micro-level research, can be very fast, yielding results in 48 hours and driving significant business value (e.g., a "multi-million dollar button" fix from changing a few characters of text) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>.
*   **"I can do my own research."** While everyone should engage with customers, talking to users doesn't automatically constitute research or insights work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>. Researchers possess the expertise to avoid biases, turn feedback into actionable insights, and situate individual feedback within a broader context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>.
*   **"A/B test everything."** A/B tests show *what* changed, but rarely *why* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>. Researchers can quickly explain the "how and why" behind A/B test results, preventing endless speculation and enabling better product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>.
*   **The "Henry Ford" quote ("If I'd asked my users, they would have said faster horses").** This quote is apocryphal and misrepresents what good researchers do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>. Researchers do not simply ask users what they want <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>.
*   **"We knew this already" / Hindsight Bias.** This common reaction stems from the narrative fallacy, where people construct simple stories about the past that make them feel like they already knew an outcome, even if they didn't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>. [[the_role_of_empathy_and_user_insights_in_product_management | Great researchers]] expose blind spots and challenge intuition to improve future decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>.

### The Role of Intuition and Data

While intuition is crucial in product development, it's also where biases and blind spots lie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>. To check intuition, teams should engage in "system two" (slow, methodical) thinking and leverage the "wisdom of the crowd" by bringing diverse sources of information and judgment to the table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.

## Critiques of Common Metrics

*   **NPS (Net Promoter Score)**: Jud Anon argues that NPS is a flawed metric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>. It's often based on a 0-10 scale that lacks precision, is usually unlabeled, and can be influenced by options below the fold on mobile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>. It's also an idiosyncratic measure, making industry comparisons unreliable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>.
    *   **Alternative**: A simple customer satisfaction (CSAT) metric (e.g., "Overall, how satisfied are you with your experience?") is often more precise, has better data properties, and correlates more strongly with business outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>.

## Product Walkthroughs and Dogfooding

While dogfooding (using your own product) is important, product managers should be extremely wary of relying solely on their own opinions or intuition when prioritizing issues identified during walkthroughs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>. A PM is not like the average user and cannot imagine all the contexts, priorities, and constraints that real users face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>. Partnering with researchers can help validate and prioritize potential issues more accurately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>.

## The Future is Bright

The future of user research is bright, but it requires both researchers and companies to adapt to a new model that is more influential and inclusive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>.

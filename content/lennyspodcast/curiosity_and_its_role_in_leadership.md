Amy Vora, Chief Product Officer at Fair and former Facebook executive, emphasizes the profound role of curiosity in effective [[leadership_and_company_culture | leadership]] and professional growth. She highlights how embracing curiosity, even in moments of disagreement, can lead to better outcomes and a more interesting work life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>.

## The "Fascinating" Approach to Disagreement

Boz, the CTO of Meta, describes Amy Vora's unique response to profound disagreements: "fascinating, you have to tell me more why you think that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Boz notes that Amy meant this genuinely, reacting with curiosity rather than perceiving disagreement as a threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. This approach can "absolutely tear down walls between points of view" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.

Amy admits that this didn't come naturally to her, as she initially "really enjoy[ed] being right" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. In her childhood, part of her identity was built on being the person who was right and knew everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. However, she learned that this approach "did not serve me so great" in the working world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. An old manager pointed out that not only was she expending a lot of energy trying to think through everything by herself, but she was also "often not really coming to the right answer" because she was ignoring information others had <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.

## Why Curiosity is Essential in Leadership

Amy's shift towards curiosity stemmed from several key realizations:
*   **Outcome over being right** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>: It became more important to reach the best outcome than to be personally correct.
*   **Continuous learning** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>: By deciding she already knew everything, she was "cutting myself off from like learning the things that other people were really good at" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. Opening the door to others' knowledge leads to personal growth and better collective results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.
*   **Engagement and understanding** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>: Assuming everyone in a meeting knows something you don't prevents boredom and transforms discussions into a process of discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.
*   **Healthy tension** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:05">[01:00:05]</a>: Disagreements often arise from different information or incentives, which is a sign of "healthy tension and knowledge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:31">[01:00:31]</a>. Approaching these with curiosity allows for a rational discussion about the best way to achieve an agreed-upon outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:11">[01:01:11]</a>.

## Practical Tips for Cultivating Curiosity

Amy offers practical advice for leaders looking to foster curiosity in their interactions:

*   **Sublimate your ego** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>: Recognize that getting to the best outcome is more important than being right. This is a battle with oneself, but the positive feedback loop of learning and better results outweighs the desire to be right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>.
*   **Embrace the phrase "fascinating, you have to tell me more"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>: Amy frequently uses this phrase because it genuinely reflects her surprise and interest when others interpret the same facts or meetings differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>. Understanding "how people see the world" is immensely helpful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>.
*   **Take a pause** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>: To control the immediate "visceral reaction" to disagreement, take a pause. This allows your body to calm down and your mind to process, leading to a more constructive, open response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>.
*   **Reinterpret feelings as opportunities to learn** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>: Instead of viewing a strong reaction as a signal to shut something down, see it as "a chance to learn more" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>.

Amy also develops "emulators" for different leaders in her head, such as Eric Antonow (master of metaphor and analogy) and Boz (focused on [[effective_leadership_and_strategic_thinking | principle-based decision making]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:19">[00:30:19]</a>. When stumped, she can "load this other person into my head and how would they approach it," gaining a fresh perspective and expanding her own toolkit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:48">[00:30:48]</a>. This highlights a continuous [[role_of_curiosity_and_unique_talents_in_career | role of curiosity and unique talents in career]] development.

> "[The way I do give that feedback is] you do need to be able to work with a broader range of people and the way to do that is to expand your tool sets... you're not going to be any less of who you are, but you are going to build new tools so that you, you know, new keys to unlock new different kinds of doors and that is only going to make you bigger and more powerful and more expansive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:36">[00:50:36]</a>.

For aspiring product managers, Amy's core advice is to constantly "think about the customer, talk to the customer, be an advocate for them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:34">[01:15:34]</a>. This direct connection serves as a shortcut to success, as customer value and company value are rarely adversarial in the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:41">[01:16:41]</a>.

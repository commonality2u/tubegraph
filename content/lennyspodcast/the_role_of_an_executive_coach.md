An executive coach plays a pivotal role in guiding leaders, particularly founders and CEOs, through various challenges inherent in building and growing companies. Matt Mashari, a full-time executive coach, works with a wide array of high-profile individuals, including the CEOs of OpenAI, Coinbase, Reddit, Rippling, Fairfront, and Notion, as well as partners at venture capital firms like Sequoia, YC, and Benchmark [00:01:21].

## Core Responsibilities and Focus Areas

Initially, executive coaching focused on tactical aspects of management and operations. Over time, the scope has expanded to include deeper psychological and interpersonal challenges.

### Addressing Fear and Anger

One of the most common areas where even successful founders struggle is dealing with [[developing_leadership_skills_and_understanding_feedback | fear]] [00:08:10]. Coaches observe that when individuals are gripped by fear, it distorts their perception of reality, preventing them from taking necessary, albeit difficult, actions [00:08:41].

*   **Challenging Fear's Advice**: An executive coach often points out when a client is acting from a place of fear, asserting that fear typically gives bad advice [00:09:02]. For instance, a CEO fearing to disclose business problems to their board might be advised to do the opposite and share transparently, which often leads to increased trust rather than loss [00:10:51]. This strategy applies to "danger to our egos," not physical danger [00:12:10].
*   **Recognizing Anger**: Anger is identified not as a base emotion but as a "cover for when we feel pain" [00:14:15]. Coaches help clients recognize anger by using "I statements," such as "I perceive you to be in anger," which allows the client to acknowledge their state without feeling accused [00:13:07]. The goal is to prevent destructive behavior (like breaking relationships) and instead allow the client to feel the underlying pain [00:13:32].

### Navigating Difficult Conversations, Especially Layoffs

[[hiring_and_developing_growth_leaders | Learning to fire people]] is cited as one of the most important skills for a leader [00:01:41], yet many managers are inexperienced or unskilled in this area [00:23:53]. Executive coaches provide specific frameworks to handle these sensitive situations humanely and effectively.

*   **One-on-One Communication**: The crucial differentiator between a "botched layoff and a successful layoff" is whether the individual hears the news from their manager in a one-on-one meeting, rather than via email, group chat, or in a group setting [00:00:00]. Impersonal communication is dehumanizing and often leads to anger and public backlash [00:00:49].
*   **Separating Decision from Implementation**: Drawing from We Dang of Clipboard Health, this framework suggests that the decision (e.g., what's best for the customer) should be separate from the implementation (how to minimize harm to stakeholders) [00:24:29].
*   **Humanely Letting People Go**:
    *   **Preparation**: Begin by warning the individual that it will be a difficult conversation, allowing them a few seconds to mentally prepare to prevent the amygdala from being triggered by surprise [00:30:00].
    *   **Delivering the News**: Clearly state the decision and the reason [00:30:51].
    *   **Emotional Release**: Invite the individual to share their feelings (anger, fear, sadness) and actively listen to make them feel heard [00:31:07].
    *   **Becoming an "Agent"**: The coach advises managers to actively help the departed employee find their next ideal role, acting as their "agent" by proactively reaching out to contacts, rather than just offering a passive reference [00:20:38]. This helps the individual find a place where they are truly needed and passionate [00:25:17].
*   **Managing Mass Layoffs**: For larger-scale layoffs, the same principles apply, distributed across management layers.
    *   **Manager Ownership**: Instead of asking managers who *can* be let go (who will say "nobody"), the CEO specifies a dollar amount or number of people each manager needs to cut from their budget [00:48:31]. Managers should choose who to let go, not department heads, to maintain accountability and trust [00:49:13].
    *   **Staggered Communication**: Conduct one-on-one meetings with affected individuals in the morning, followed by an all-hands meeting for the "stay team" in the afternoon to address their fears (e.g., job security, company stability) [00:50:14].
    *   **Post-Layoff Support**: Managers should hold one-on-one meetings with every remaining team member for one hour, listening to their thoughts and feelings and making them feel heard [00:51:34]. This process, though time-consuming, accelerates recovery and boosts morale [00:52:11].
*   **Impact of Layoffs**: Counter-intuitively, companies often operate better with fewer people due to reduced overhead, friction in information flow, and morale problems that grow with size [00:21:35]. Deep cuts are preferable to multiple rounds of layoffs, as repeated cuts can cause "PTSD in an organization" [01:00:50].

### Fostering a Culture of "Feeling Heard"

Beyond layoffs, making people feel heard is a crucial skill for leaders.

*   **Methods of Feeling Heard**:
    *   **Written Feedback**: In group settings, ask everyone to write down their solutions, then read them aloud and acknowledge each person (e.g., "Thank you, Lenny") [00:32:17].
    *   **Verbal Repetition**: Ask a person to state their opinion verbally, then repeat it back to them until they confirm you've understood [00:32:41].
    *   **Reflecting Underlying Thoughts**: Especially when receiving feedback, reflect back what you *imagine* the person is thinking or feeling, including unstated emotions like anger. This deepens their sense of being heard, even if their words were softer [00:33:02].
*   **Action After Listening**: Once feedback is received, the leader must either accept it and commit to action, or explain why it cannot be accepted, sharing their own context for the decision [00:34:11].

### Optimizing Personal Energy and Productivity

Coaches also help leaders understand and manage their personal energy to maximize effectiveness and satisfaction.

*   **The Four Zones (from Diana Chapman)**:
    *   **Incompetence**: Tasks others are better at; delegate these [01:03:00].
    *   **Competence**: Tasks you can do fine, but others can too; delegate these [01:03:08].
    *   **Excellence**: Tasks you're uniquely good at but don't love; this is a "danger zone" as it saps energy despite creating value [01:03:24].
    *   **Genius**: Tasks you're uniquely good at and love so much that "space and time disappear" [01:03:46]. This is where maximum value is created [01:04:08].
*   **The Energy Audit**:
    1.  **Calendar Review**: Review two representative weeks of your calendar, noting all meetings and filling in what you were doing in between [01:04:11].
    2.  **Color-Coding Energy**: Hour by hour, mark activities green if they increased your energy, or red if they were neutral or drained energy [01:04:24].
    3.  **Identify Themes**: Look for patterns in the "red" (energy-draining) activities [01:04:48].
    4.  **Action Plan**: For each red activity:
        *   Eliminate if unnecessary [01:05:18].
        *   Delegate if someone else can do it [01:05:23].
        *   If only you can do it, brainstorm what would make it "exquisite" or energy-giving [01:05:29].
    5.  **Iterate**: Repeat the audit until your calendar is "80% green," leading to a more fulfilling and productive life [01:06:45].

### Fostering Innovation within Larger Companies

Executive coaches also help established companies overcome inherent challenges in innovation.

*   **Decoupling from Core Operations**: Large companies struggle to innovate due to extensive review processes for new code (to prevent site outages or security breaches) and slow approval processes within established product and engineering teams [00:55:39].
*   **"YC Startup" Model**: The coach recommends creating a separate, small, "Founder mentality" team for new products, ideally reporting directly to the CEO, outside of traditional engineering or product hierarchies [00:54:47].
*   **Independent Entities**: The most radical idea, successfully implemented by We Dang of Clipboard Health, is to create separate C Corps for new products. This allows teams to iterate rapidly without fear of damaging the core brand [00:57:06]. It fosters autonomy and ownership over creation, which is a stronger motivator than equity for many [00:59:36].

## Coach's Philosophy

Matt Mashari aims to make himself unnecessary to his clients [00:41:41]. He believes that providing detailed, tactical resources (like his publicly available curriculum) empowers leaders to implement changes themselves, without needing continuous coaching [00:39:09]. His work is deeply personal, rooted in his own experiences and continuous learning [00:15:16]. He emphasizes that while fear can be a short-term, extreme motivator, joy is a more sustainable and non-corrosive long-term motivator that allows for greater endurance and life satisfaction [01:00:52].

Product leader Shas Doshi reflected on questions he wished he had asked himself sooner in his career, including a crucial bonus question: "Am I really listening?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:42">[00:43:42]</a>

## Beyond the Basics of Listening

Doshi initially believed himself to be a good listener, noting practices like listening, recapping, making eye contact, and reiterating what was heard as evidence of his skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:48">[00:43:48]</a>. However, he later realized that there is "an entirely other level to listening" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:58">[00:43:58]</a>.

Understanding this deeper level of listening is what enables individuals to become "world-class leaders" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:09">[00:44:09]</a>. Doshi emphasizes that few people discuss what this true level of listening entails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:23">[00:44:23]</a>.

Anonymous social applications, while capable of rapid viral growth, often face significant safety and ethical challenges, particularly concerning user well-being and the spread of misinformation. Nikita Beer, a serial app developer known for hits like TBH and Gas, discusses his experiences navigating these issues.

## The Appeal and Design Philosophy of Positive Anonymous Apps

The core insight behind apps like TBH and Gas stemmed from observing a "latent demand" for positive self-disclosure among teenagers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:43">[00:26:43]</a>. While apps like Saraha, which allowed anonymous messages, rose to popularity (even becoming the number one app in the U.S. despite being entirely in Arabic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:08">[00:26:08]</a>), they often led to negative and bullying messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:17">[00:27:17]</a>.

Recognizing that "people want to know good about themselves and they don't want like these bullying messages" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:27">[00:27:27]</a>, Beer's team developed a unique mechanic: users could only send positive affirmations through pre-authored polls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:08">[00:28:08]</a>. This approach aimed to make teens feel "really good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:32">[01:03:32]</a> and increase message volume, while avoiding the dark side of anonymous apps that historically led to "awful news stories of kids committing suicide" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:53">[00:27:53]</a>. The app even included a system to ensure "everyone got a vote" by increasing the frequency of poll appearances for users who hadn't recently received votes, aiming to "spread the love" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:53">[01:03:53]</a>.

## Battling Misinformation and Hoaxes

Despite their positive design, viral apps are highly susceptible to hoaxes. Gas, a positive anonymous polling app, became the target of a "human trafficking hoax" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:42">[01:04:42]</a>. This phenomenon is common, with "any app that has gone viral in any way has actually had this hoax started" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:09">[01:05:09]</a>. Teenagers may spread such hoaxes because it "gets you attention" and "a bunch of followers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:13">[01:05:13]</a>.

Beer's team fought this "completely made up hoax" on "every vector possible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:22">[01:06:22]</a>:
*   **Media Engagement**: They met with journalists and reporters, insisting that articles carry headlines clarifying the hoax, such as "gas app is not for human trafficking" in the Washington Post <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:39">[01:06:39]</a>.
*   **Direct Outreach**: They called school superintendents and police chiefs to retract public posts claiming the app was used for human trafficking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:54">[01:06:54]</a>.
*   **App Store & Social Media**: They asked Apple to remove review bombs and worked with TikTok to delete videos spreading false information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:02">[01:07:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:11">[01:09:11]</a>.
*   **In-App Communication**: They implemented a feature where users deleting their accounts could watch a TikTok video made by Beer's girlfriend explaining the hoax was false <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:10">[01:07:10]</a>.

This relentless effort reduced account deletions from a catastrophic 3% per day down to 0.1% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:23">[01:07:23]</a>. The experience was "extraordinarily difficult," requiring Beer to sleep "three hours a day for three months" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:13">[01:08:13]</a>. A key takeaway was the necessity to "make sure the hoax is less viral than your app" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:36">[01:09:36]</a>.

## Ethical Growth and the "Gia Hypothesis"

Beer emphasizes the importance of ethical practices in app development:
> "The internet is this like living and breathing thing... where if you are if you do the wrong thing by users the will come back and and get even and defend itself." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:25">[01:01:25]</a>

This philosophy means operating "above board" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:09">[01:02:09]</a>, avoiding practices like secretly using user data or inviting people on their behalf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:09">[01:01:09]</a>. While some might consider such actions "skey growth hacks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:39">[01:02:39]</a>, Beer believes they lead to "way more trouble down the line" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:54">[01:00:54]</a> and burn users.

## Challenges of Sustaining Viral Apps

Despite initial success, maintaining [[challenges_of_scaling_consumer_social_apps | consumer social apps]] that go viral is chaotic. Beer notes that "everything breaks" and needs to be replaced constantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:43">[00:34:43]</a>. For example, their customer support system broke after three days, and the next one after seven, requiring continuous replacement with scalable solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:57">[00:34:57]</a>. This constant firefighting necessitates "ruthless with prioritization" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:20">[00:35:20]</a> and knowing when to "geofence" the app to control growth and allow time for server scaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:58">[00:29:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:42">[00:35:42]</a>.

The experience highlighted that [[developing_viral_consumer_apps | product-market fit]] for consumer products is not subtle; "if your products working you'll know" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:21">[00:36:21]</a> because "people are going to be fighting to get into it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:36">[00:36:36]</a>.

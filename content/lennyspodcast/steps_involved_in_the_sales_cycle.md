This article provides a tactical guide on conducting sales, especially focusing on [[challenges_of_earlystage_sales_for_startups | Founder-Led Sales]]. It aims to address common pitfalls for early-stage founders who might misapply late-stage sales advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Jen AEL, co-founder of Jellyfish, shares her expertise on early customer discovery and setting up repeatable sales motions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## What is Founder-Led Sales?

[[challenges_of_earlystage_sales_for_startups | Founder-Led Sales]] is the initial commercial milestone for a startup, focusing on acquiring the first few customers, whether it's achieving the first million in revenue or the first ten customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. In the early stages, with no brand equity, marketing engine, or customer references, **the founder is the product** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. This means the founder's novel insights, derived from deep study and experience, are what excite the market, even before the product is fully formed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

The purpose of [[challenges_of_earlystage_sales_for_startups | Founder-Led Sales]] is not immediate revenue, but rather to learn as quickly as possible to understand the market's pulse, thereby earning the right to sell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:51">[00:35:51]</a>. Founders should be doing sales for an extended period, potentially until reaching around $500K to $1M in ARR, especially if velocity is slow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:21">[00:36:21]</a>.

### Why Founder-Led Sales is a Competitive Advantage
1.  **Visionary Authority**: No one can articulate the vision as effectively as the founder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.
2.  **Market Excitement**: The market is often eager to engage with a founder who possesses unique insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
3.  **Insight Discovery**: Only a founder can identify "budding moments" in conversations, which hold valuable insights to refine the product and sales approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. This direct feedback loop avoids the "game of telephone" that can occur with salespeople <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

## Key Steps of a Sales Cycle

Traditional sales stages often include:
*   Intro Call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>
*   Second Call (often for a demo) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>
*   Third Call (discussing proposals, scope of work, deeper demo) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>
*   Fourth Call (co-authoring scope, feedback) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>
*   Introduction to Procurement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>
*   Procurement Process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>
*   Getting the Final Signature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>

### 1. Getting Attention (Initial Outreach)

This is a major hurdle: how to get someone to even want to talk to you amidst a "billion SaaS tools emailing constantly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.

*   **Founder's Advantage**: When outreach comes from the founder, it carries significant weight and prompts recipients to look deeper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.
*   **Messaging Strategy**:
    *   **Lead with Novel Insight**: Focus on a technical or business model insight that inspires a new way of thinking, often something counter-intuitive or with "shock value" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. Avoid claiming to be "better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:58">[00:29:58]</a>.
    *   **Relevancy over Personalization**: Clearly state why the message is relevant to the recipient's role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.
    *   **Concise**: Keep messages to 3-4 sentences max, ensuring no scrolling on mobile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:59">[00:25:59]</a>.
    *   **Problem-Focused**: Don't discuss the solution; instead, talk about the problem you want to solve and why it needs to be addressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>.
*   **Channels**: Cold email, LinkedIn DMs, and increasingly, cold calling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>.
*   **Conversion Rates**: While important, initial conversion rates (5-15% for founder outreach) are influenced by "win rate" (closing deals from calls) and the market's felt need for the problem you're solving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a>. If a problem is truly felt by the market, people will respond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>.
*   **Finding Leads**:
    *   **Start Manually**: Before using tools, identify 30 people you are genuinely excited to learn from <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:55">[00:23:55]</a>.
    *   **Thoughtful Outreach**: Invest 15-20 minutes writing a thoughtful, specific note to each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:09">[00:24:09]</a>.
    *   **Discover Commonalities**: Analyze responses (or lack thereof) to identify patterns in roles, industry, team size, etc., to refine your target audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>.
    *   **Natural Experiments**: This manual process forces you to test messaging and target roles before automating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:29">[00:25:29]</a>.
    *   **Test for Discoverability**: If finding 30 prospects is difficult, it's a signal that scaling lead generation will be challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:02">[00:27:02]</a>.
    *   **Focus on Quality, Not Volume**: Volume comes after identifying clear parameters for your ideal customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>.

### 2. First Sales Call (Engaging Further)

Once you're on the phone:
*   **Be Vulnerable and Honest**: As an early-stage startup, be transparent about your stage. This fosters honest feedback, as buyers find it easier to provide critical input if they know the product isn't "fully baked" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:18">[00:31:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:37">[00:32:37]</a>.
*   **Focus on Learning**: Frame the conversation around gaining their insight into how the problem manifests on their side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:58">[00:31:58]</a>.
*   **Avoid Generic Questions**: Do not ask "what keeps you up at night" or "what are your pain points" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:08">[00:42:08]</a>.
*   **Look for "Aha" Moments**: Identify where the prospect's gears start turning, and they visualize the problem or solution in their head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:51">[00:38:51]</a>.
*   **Signals of Product/Market Fit**:
    *   **Growing/Widening Problem**: Is the problem they're facing expanding and becoming a higher priority? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:07">[00:40:07]</a>
    *   **Measurement/Management**: Are they currently measuring or managing this problem? If not, it's likely not a high priority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:24">[00:40:24]</a>.
    *   **Past Attempts**: Have they tried to solve it before (e.g., hiring headcount, other tools) and failed? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:43">[00:40:43]</a>
    *   **Bringing in Others**: A key indicator of momentum is when the prospect wants to pull in colleagues or superiors for the next call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:16">[00:41:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:47">[00:41:47]</a>.
*   **No Demo on First Call (for Enterprise)**: The demo is your main "carrot" in the sales process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:37">[00:49:37]</a>. For high-value deals (hundreds of thousands of dollars), slow down the process to ensure all key stakeholders are present before the demo. For low-value, high-volume sales (e.g., $3,000 tools), demo quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:29">[00:50:29]</a>.
*   **Book the Next Call**: Always aim to book the next meeting directly on the call, getting calendars pulled up and identifying who else should be invited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:28">[00:42:28]</a>. If they defer to email, it's often a sign of disinterest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:50">[00:42:50]</a>.

### 3. Co-authoring and Selling Services

*   **Specificity**: In the early days, exciting prospects means making them feel the product is built specifically for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:21">[00:43:21]</a>.
*   **Co-author the Scope of Work**: This allows you to understand their buyer maturity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:45">[00:43:45]</a>.
*   **Sell Services First**: If a prospect (especially in traditional industries or for new technologies like AI) lacks an existing process or strategy to solve the problem, they are not ready to buy technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:51">[00:43:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:30">[00:46:30]</a>.
    *   **Why Services?**: It allows you to:
        *   Educate the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>.
        *   Gain a customer logo and show intent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:06">[00:44:06]</a>.
        *   Get paid to help them design their process or custom pitch, setting the stage for future technology adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:49">[00:44:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:01">[00:45:01]</a>.
    *   **Time-Boxing**: Time-box service contracts to 90-day increments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:15">[00:45:15]</a>.
    *   This approach is common, with 40-50% of B2B SaaS startups selling services before technology, especially in top-down sales where the user and buyer differ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:28">[00:47:28]</a>.

### 4. Procurement and Signature

*   **Procurement are Professionals**: They are smart, professional buyers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:25">[00:51:25]</a>.
*   **Sell to Procurement**: Your pitch to procurement must be clear, simple, and differentiated from existing preferred vendors to avoid being sidelined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:36">[00:51:36]</a>.
*   **Do Their Work for Them**: Make their job easy by proactively filling out forms and handling administrative tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:40">[00:52:40]</a>.
*   **Be Specific About Offerings**: Clearly state what your product does and doesn't do. If you're too broad, they might classify you as high-risk, leading to complex and demanding contracts (MSA, insurance policies) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:57">[00:52:57]</a>.
*   **Truncate Contracts**: Consider offering separate service and technology contracts. A service contract can allow you to onboard, educate users, and get paid while the technology contract navigates a longer procurement process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:50">[00:53:50]</a>.
*   **Know the Signatory**: Before this stage, identify who the ultimate signatory is (CFO, legal, business unit head, etc.) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:25">[00:58:25]</a>. Prepare concise bullet points of value for them, as a confused signatory can kick the deal back and delay the process significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:46">[00:58:46]</a>.
*   **Payment**: Do not start work until approved by finance and the contract is signed; payment is made through a purchase order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:24">[01:00:24]</a>.

### 5. Post-Signature & Benefits of Enterprise Sales

*   **Long-Term Payoff**: While the process can be lengthy (6-12 months for Enterprise, sometimes 9-12 months for highly regulated industries), once you're "in," the benefits are exponential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:44">[01:03:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:58">[01:02:58]</a>.
*   **Compounding Effects**:
    *   **Preferred Vendor Status**: You become a preferred vendor, gaining access to other business units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:43">[00:54:43]</a>.
    *   **Competitive Moat**: You've beaten competitors to the punch, creating a short-term advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:52">[00:54:52]</a>.
    *   **Exclusive Intel**: You gain access to conversations and information no one else has <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:53">[00:55:53]</a>.
    *   **Partnership**: You transition from a salesperson to a trusted partner, leading to easier introductions and continued engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:06">[00:56:06]</a>.
    *   **Accelerated Growth**: A $100K deal can become $500K next year, and $500K can become $1M the year after, accelerating your growth journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:27">[00:55:27]</a>.
*   **ACV Expectations**: For early-stage startups selling to Enterprise (500-1000+ employees), a good initial Annual Contract Value (ACV) range is $50K-$200K, with $50K-$100K being a sweet spot for initial contracts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:26">[01:05:26]</a>.

### Choosing Your Market: SMB vs. Enterprise

When deciding whether to focus on Small-Medium Business (SMB) or Enterprise, consider:
*   **SMB**:
    *   **Sales Process**: User and buyer are often the same person, leading to a more streamlined process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:55">[00:56:55]</a>.
    *   **Nature**: It's a marketing-intensive, high-velocity, high-volume game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:22">[01:06:22]</a>.
    *   **Challenge**: Higher churn rate; SMBs are quick to cancel if not satisfied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:36">[00:57:36]</a>.
*   **Enterprise**:
    *   **Sales Process**: User and buyer are different, involving multiple stakeholders and procurement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:48">[00:56:48]</a>.
    *   **Nature**: Slower, more complex, but leads to compounding growth once established.
    *   **Considerations**: Do you have an Enterprise product solving an Enterprise problem? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:48">[01:06:48]</a>
*   **Mid-Market**: A "funky place" to start, as you straddle high-value Enterprise and high-volume SMB. Mid-market companies often lack resources for heavy integrations, relying on third parties, which can complicate sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>.

Ultimately, the choice depends on where the problem is most acutely felt, and "which game do you want to play," considering your passion, experience, and the life you want to create for yourself and your team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:10">[01:08:10]</a>.

## Common Pitfalls and Mindset

*   **"Bottom of Funnel Problem" Fallacy**: Many founders incorrectly diagnose slow sales as a "bottom of funnel problem." In reality, it's almost always a **top of funnel problem**, indicating issues with qualification, messaging, or not solving a widely felt problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:42">[01:10:42]</a>.
*   **Bring Passion and Energy**: Sales should feel fun for the buyer. Founders must bring their passion and energy to calls, as this is felt by the market and makes the experience invigorating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:27">[01:11:27]</a>.
*   **Belief and Honesty**: It's difficult to sell something you don't believe in. Be honest about whether your solution truly solves their problem to avoid quick churn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:14">[01:12:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:47">[01:12:47]</a>. When you're honest about not being the right fit, it can build trust, which is the number one currency in sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:07">[01:13:07]</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> [[The Role of Product in Sales | The Role of Product in Sales]] at the early stage is critical. If your product isn't desired by the market, even the best sales efforts won't succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:14">[01:12:14]</a>. Sales is about finding the right people to engage with a problem they truly need solved.

[[finding_productmarket_fit_in_startups | Finding product-market fit]] (PMF) is considered the single most important task for a startup within its first three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Despite its critical nature, it is often underexplored and underexplained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Todd Jackson, a partner at First Round Capital, and his team have developed a practical and actionable [[framework_for_improving_productmarket_fit | framework for improving product-market fit]], drawing on years of data and insights from hundreds of startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:30">[01:30:30]</a>.

This framework is specifically designed for early B2B founders, particularly those with a sales-led approach, in their first six to nine months of operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>. While it cannot guarantee success, it aims to significantly increase the odds of finding PMF by providing a structured approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:27">[01:25:27]</a>.

## Defining Extreme Product-Market Fit

The ultimate goal of [[product_market_fit_and_growth_strategy | product-market fit and growth strategy]] is to achieve "extreme product-market fit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:54">[01:19:54]</a>. This is defined as: "a state of widespread demand for a product that satisfies a critical need and crucially can be delivered repeatably and efficiently to each customer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:27">[01:27:27]</a>.

This definition highlights three key ideas:
*   **Demand** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:08">[01:40:08]</a>
*   **Satisfaction** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:08">[01:40:08]</a>
*   **Efficiency** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:08">[01:40:08]</a>

Efficiency is often overlooked in PMF definitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>. For example, companies like WeWork and Casper achieved customer satisfaction and demand, but lacked efficiency, preventing their businesses from working at scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>. The "dollar vending machine" analogy illustrates this: a machine that gives out $100 for $1 would have immense demand and satisfaction, but is not viable due to inefficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:21">[01:18:21]</a>.

Another concept is the "marginal customer" â€“ the next incremental customer your company acquires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:20">[01:19:20]</a>. As you progress through PMF stages, this customer should become easier to acquire and serve, indicating increasing efficiency and strengthening PMF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>.

## The Four Levels of Product-Market Fit

[[finding_productmarket_fit_in_startups | Product-market fit]] is not a sudden event; it unfolds through a sequence of levels over multiple years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>. For top Enterprise companies, reaching extreme PMF typically takes four to six years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>.

The four levels are:
1.  **Nascent** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>
2.  **Developing** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>
3.  **Strong** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>
4.  **Extreme** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>

At each level, founders must make tradeoffs between satisfaction, demand, and efficiency, optimizing for different aspects depending on their current stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>. The majority of startups (60-70%) do not progress beyond Level 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>.

### Level 1: Nascent Product-Market Fit (L1 PMF)

*   **Characteristics**: Pre-seed or seed stage, less than 10 people on the team, aiming for 0 to 500k ARR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>.
*   **Goal**: Find three to five customers with an important and urgent problem, and deliver a satisfying solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.
*   **Focus**: Satisfaction is paramount; inefficiency is acceptable if it helps uncover an intensely satisfying solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.
*   **Demand Source**: Primarily friends, family, and network (warm intros) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>. It's common for it to take 20 warm intros to get one customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.
*   **Metrics**: Efficiency metrics like burn multiple, gross margin, and NRR are not applicable at this stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.

**Example: [[role_of_marketing_in_product_success | Vanta]]**
Vanta, founded by Christina Cacioppo, initially explored other ideas before focusing on compliance automation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>. Through customer interviews, she discovered a deep-seated hatred for security questionnaires and compliance audits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>. For early customers like Segment, Front, and Figma, Vanta manually provided SOC 2 certification, directly unlocking enterprise revenue for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>. This was a highly inefficient process (Christina manually filled out spreadsheets), but it delivered immense customer satisfaction by solving a critical, revenue-blocking problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>.

**Signs of Being Stuck at L1**:
Staying at L1 for six, nine, or twelve months indicates an issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>. Yellow flags include:
*   Customers wouldn't be disappointed if the product disappeared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.
*   Happy customers, but each uses a different "most important feature," indicating a consulting business rather than a scalable product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>.
*   Difficulty finding new customers (marginal customer is hard to get) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>.
*   Low or stagnant product usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>.

**Getting Unstuck: The 4 Ps**
If stuck, consider changing one or more of the "4 P's":
1.  **Persona**: Who you are targeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>.
2.  **Problem**: The specific issue you are solving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>.
3.  **Promise**: How you pitch your solution (positioning) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>.
4.  **Product**: The actual solution you offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>.

**Example: [[finding_productmarket_fit_in_startups | Lattis]]**
Lattis (Jack Altman) initially started as an OKR tool but struggled with customer retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>. Jack pivoted by keeping the **Persona** (Heads of HR) but changing the **Problem** to performance management and the **Promise** to a modern, employee-friendly solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>. He even sold initial contracts with Figma mockups before building the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>.

**Example: Plaid**
Plaid initially developed a consumer budgeting app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>. When it wasn't popular, they realized the underlying technology for connecting to bank accounts was valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>. They pivoted by changing the **Persona** (developers at fintech companies), **Problem** (connecting to bank accounts), and **Promise** (API for bank accounts), while largely keeping the existing **Product** code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>.

*   **"Friendzoned" Analogy**: Rick Song, founder of Persona, advises founders to actively ask customers if their product is a "necessity" or if they're just "friendzoned" (liked, but not loved or needed) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>. This means directly asking how painful it would be if the product disappeared or if they'd switch for a cheaper competitor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>.

### Level 2: Developing Product-Market Fit (L2 PMF)

*   **Characteristics**: Seed or Series A stage, up to 20 people, aiming for 500k to 5 million ARR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>.
*   **Goal**: Scale from 5 satisfied customers to 25 satisfied customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>.
*   **Focus**: Introduce demand alongside satisfaction; the product must now do much of the heavy lifting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>.
*   **Demand Source**: Beyond warm intros, start investing in scalable channels like cold outreach, content, or community events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>. Sales conversion (first call to closed-won) is typically around 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>.
*   **Metrics**: Start considering efficiency metrics:
    *   Magic Number: 0.5 to 0.75 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>
    *   Regretted Churn: 10-20% is okay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>
    *   Net Revenue Retention (NRR): At least 100% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>
    *   Gross Margin: Not worse than 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>
    *   Burn Multiple: Not worse than 5x (where 5x means burning $5M to generate $1M ARR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>

**Example: Looker**
Looker initially spent a long time in L1 due to the product's nature (users needed to see their own data modeled) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>. Founder Lloyd Tabb spent 20-40 hours per customer doing consulting before they even became customers, building out their data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>. Once this "forward deploy process" was refined, they scaled rapidly from 5 to 25 customers with high close rates and zero churn, developing a repeatable sales model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>.

**Example: Ironclad**
Ironclad (Jason Big) initially struggled to sell their "AI legal assistant" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>. A customer's inbound email asking "Are you a CLM?" (Contract Lifecycle Management) prompted a crucial shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>. Jason realized that instead of creating a new category, he could position Ironclad as a better, AI-powered version of an existing category that customers were already looking for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>. This change in **Promise** (positioning) made demand "click" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>.

**Signs of Being Stuck at L2**:
If stagnating at L2 for 12-18 months, look for these signs:
*   Happy existing customers, but difficulty expanding demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>.
*   Regretted churn > 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>.
*   Sales cycles are too long, or losing deals late in the funnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>.
*   Struggling to hit desired price points, often masked by excuses like "no budget" or "not the right time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>.
*   Lack of organic inbound demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>.

The solution when stuck is often a "200% pivot," meaning a substantial change rather than a minor adjustment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>. This requires founders to be willing to "let go" of previous efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>. The most common issues are that the problem isn't significant enough, or the promise isn't valuable enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>.

### Level 3: Strong Product-Market Fit (L3 PMF)

*   **Characteristics**: Series B stage, 30 to 100 people, aiming for 5 million to 25 million ARR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a>.
*   **Goal**: Achieve repeatability in sales and marketing, expanding from 25 to 100+ customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>.
*   **Focus**: Efficiency becomes a critical focus, alongside maintaining satisfaction and demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>. This is when PMF truly feels "fun," with "fish jumping into the boat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>.
*   **Demand Source**: You've "cracked" at least one scalable demand channel (marketing/sales) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:00">[05:29:00]</a>. At least 10-20% of inbound leads come from referrals and word-of-mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>.
*   **Metrics**:
    *   Gross Margin: Above 60%, ideally above 70% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>
    *   Burn Multiple: Below 3, ideally 1-3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>
    *   Regretted Churn: Less than 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>
    *   NRR: Greater than 110% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:45:00">[05:45:00]</a>

**Signs of Being Stuck at L3**:
Even at L3, challenges arise:
*   Leaky bucket: NRR below 90% or regretted churn above 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:34:00">[06:34:00]</a>.
*   Slowing growth (e.g., struggling to hit 2x growth after 3x growth) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>.
*   Increased competition (new startups or large incumbents) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52:00">[06:52:00]</a>.
*   Saturated demand channels, requiring finding new ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>.
*   Growth is too expensive (burn multiple increases) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:00">[07:17:00]</a>.

### Level 4: Extreme Product-Market Fit (L4 PMF)

*   **Characteristics**: Series C/D or beyond, 100+ people, 25 million+ ARR, already a unicorn, aspiring for decacorn status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a>.
*   **Goal**: Sustain growth by expanding Total Addressable Market (TAM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:00">[07:37:00]</a>.
*   **Focus**: Continue excelling at satisfaction, demand, and efficiency. Expansion typically involves entering new markets or developing multiple products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>.
*   **Metrics**:
    *   Sales Conversion: >15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:00">[07:06:00]</a>
    *   Magic Number: >1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:00">[07:08:00]</a>
    *   CAC Payback: <12 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:00">[07:10:00]</a>
    *   Gross Margin: >80% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:13:00">[07:13:00]</a>
    *   Burn Multiple: <1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a>
    *   Churn: <10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:00">[07:22:00]</a>
    *   NRR: >120% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:00">[07:23:00]</a>

**Examples of TAM Expansion**:
*   [[role_of_marketing_in_product_success | Vanta]]: Started with SOC 2, now offers a trust management platform, security questionnaires, and vendor risk management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:00">[07:54:00]</a>.
*   Verkada: Began with cloud security cameras, expanded to alarms, smoke detectors, and badge readers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:09:00">[08:09:00]</a>.
*   Stripe: Beyond core payments, offers Stripe Radar and Stripe Atlas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18:00">[08:18:00]</a>.
*   Square: Expanded from Square Stand to Cash App, Square Checking, and Square Loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:00">[08:22:00]</a>.

Reaching L4 means building a highly valuable company, but the journey of finding [[product_market_fit_strategies | product-market fit strategies]] is never truly over. It requires continuously re-finding PMF for new products and maintaining a mindset of persistent growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:43:00">[08:43:00]</a>. Customer expectations are constantly increasing, necessitating ongoing innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52:00">[08:52:00]</a>.

## Timelines of the PMF Journey

The entire journey to reach Level 4 PMF typically takes 4 to 6 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:00">[09:11:00]</a>. A potential breakdown of this timeline:
*   **Level 1 (Nascent)**: 12 to 18 months. This is arguably the most crucial stage for selecting the right Persona and Problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:23:00">[09:23:00]</a>.
*   **Level 2 (Developing)**: Approximately 1 year. The goal is to move from 5 to 25 customers quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:00">[09:34:00]</a>.
*   **Level 3 (Strong)**: Approximately 2 years. This involves scaling from 5 million to 25 million in ARR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:36:00">[09:36:00]</a>.
*   **Level 4 (Extreme)**: Several years. Scaling from 25 million to 100 million ARR and beyond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:48:00">[09:48:00]</a>.

If a company has been operating for four to five years and hasn't started to feel pull from the market, or hasn't reached 25 customers, it is unlikely to magically find success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:09:00">[10:09:00]</a>. There is "no shame" in returning money to investors or seeking a soft landing, as [[candidate_market_fit | product-market fit]] is inherently difficult to achieve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:10:00">[11:10:00]</a>.

## Customer Discovery and the 4 Ps

A core component of the framework, especially for Level 1, is "dollar-driven customer discovery" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:16:00">[11:16:00]</a>. This goes beyond casual conversations to elicit high-signal information about a customer's problems and their willingness to pay for a solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:28:00">[11:28:00]</a>.

Key techniques in dollar-driven customer discovery:
*   **Identify Extreme Value**: Ask open-ended questions about their top goals and challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:41:00">[11:41:00]</a>. Avoid "happy ears" by not leading the witness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:51:00">[11:51:00]</a>. Look for "wow" statements ("If that thing works, I'd sign up for the waitlist today!") or demonstrated behavior (asking for another meeting, wanting to share the deck) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:57:00">[11:57:00]</a>. A polite "sounds interesting" is often a "no" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:12:00">[12:12:00]</a>.
*   **Confirm Ability to Pay**:
    *   Are they currently looking for a product like this or building one internally? (An existing problem that they are actively trying to solve is ideal) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:19:00">[12:19:00]</a>.
    *   Where would a budget for this come from? (Existing budget for a competing tool or internal development is best) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:28:00">[12:28:00]</a>.
    *   How does their team make decisions on third-party tools? (Look for a known procurement process) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:33:00">[12:33:00]</a>.
*   **Quantify Willingness to Pay**:
    *   "What's your budget for solving this?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:59:00">[12:59:00]</a>
    *   "What are you paying for a similar tool?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:01:00">[13:01:00]</a>
    *   Use the "fair price," "expensive price," and "prohibitively expensive price" questions to gauge value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:17:00">[13:17:00]</a>. (The "expensive price" is often what they will actually pay if the product delivers value.) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:38:00">[13:38:00]</a>.

Founders must also determine the right level of product fidelity to show (mockups vs. working demo vs. manual service) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:40:00">[13:40:00]</a>. You've talked to enough people when you can predict 70-80% of what the next person will say, indicating clear patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:51:00">[13:51:00]</a>.

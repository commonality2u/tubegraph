At Airbnb, the approach to company growth and marketing has undergone a significant transformation, moving from traditional growth channels to a [[productled_growth_strategy|product-led model]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:51">[01:40:51]</a>. This shift emphasizes building the best possible product and educating users about it, with the belief that growth will naturally follow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:03">[01:44:03]</a>.

## Evolution of Growth Strategy

Historically, Airbnb spent a significant amount on performance marketing, such as AdWords, to drive growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:27">[01:46:27]</a>. While performance marketing can be effective for balancing supply and demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:04">[01:47:04]</a>, it doesn't create accumulating advantages like long-term investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:02">[01:48:02]</a>.

The company's current philosophy views marketing as education, focusing on informing people about the unique benefits and new features of the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:18">[01:48:18]</a>. Many companies often rely on brand marketing (ads about the app) or performance marketing, but fail to educate users about new developments, which can disincentivize shipping new features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:03">[01:49:03]</a>.

Airbnb made a conscious decision to shift away from traditional growth channels like paid growth, betting that an exceptional product, combined with effective storytelling, would drive growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:33">[03:34:33]</a>. While they still utilize some performance marketing and measure conversion, the emphasis is now on big, strategic leaps (like "passes" in football) rather than incremental optimizations ("running the ball down the field") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:10">[03:35:10]</a>.

## The CEO's Role in Product and Growth

Brian Chesky, CEO and co-founder of Airbnb, asserts that in a product or tech-led company, the CEO should effectively serve as the chief product officer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:38">[01:46:38]</a>. This involves being deeply involved in the product's details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>.

He distinguishes between "micromanagement" (telling people exactly what to do) and "being in the details" (understanding the work to ensure quality and provide support) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>. Responsible company boards engage with CEOs on details without dictating actions, which is the same principle applied internally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>.

When a CEO delegates too much, especially in product, it can lead to slower progress, lack of clarity, and increased internal politics and bureaucracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:06">[01:54:06]</a>. This was a challenge Airbnb faced between 2015 and 2019, where product changes became stagnant despite rising costs and increased headcount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:06">[02:00:06]</a>.

The pandemic acted as a "near-death business experience" for Airbnb, providing clarity and prompting a shift towards a more hands-on, detail-oriented approach from leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:20">[02:24:20]</a>.

## Organizational Design for Product-Led Growth

To support its new strategy, Airbnb implemented several key [[strategies_for_company_growth_and_overcoming_internal_challenges|organizational changes]]:
*   **Centralized Road Map** The entire company now operates on a single, rolling two-year product road map, updated every six months with releases in May and October/November <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>. This ensures everyone is rowing in the same direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:45">[01:52:45]</a>.
*   **Functional Model** The company transitioned back to a functional model, akin to a startup, with core functions like design, engineering, product marketing, communications, sales, and operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. This eliminated divisional leaders who fostered internal subdivisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>.
*   **Fewer, More Senior Employees** There's a deliberate choice to have fewer, more senior employees, which is believed to prevent project slowdowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. Airbnb has fewer than 7,000 employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.
*   **Expert Executives** Executives are expected to be experts in their functional domains, actively managing the work, not just the people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>.
*   **Decision-Making Centralization** Decision-making was pulled inwards, creating one shared consciousness among the top 30-40 leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>.
*   **Integrated Product and Marketing** Product management now includes product marketing responsibilities, meaning teams are accountable for how the product is discussed and understood in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>. They focus on understanding the market and educating users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46:00">[07:46:00]</a>.
*   **Program Management** Many traditional product management program functions were offloaded to dedicated program managers, allowing product managers to focus on product development and marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>. Program management is a high-status role at Airbnb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.
*   **CEO Review Schedule** Brian Chesky personally reviews all product and marketing work on a regular cadence (weekly, bi-weekly, etc.) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>. This ensures accountability and quick resolution of bottlenecks, fostering collaboration without needing direct mandate or influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>.
*   **In-House Creative Agency** Airbnb developed its own in-house creative group to manage all brand touchpoints, from ads to product design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>. This includes combining UX writing with marketing writing to ensure a consistent voice across all communications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>.
*   **No Separate Guest/Host Teams** The previous structure of separate guest and host teams was eliminated because most features connect both, leading to incompatible road maps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:00">[04:19:00]</a>. Designers and engineers are now more fungible, moving between projects to cover a larger surface area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>.

## Product Development Philosophy

### AB Testing and Intuition
While AB testing is utilized, it's approached with a strong hypothesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>. The focus is on understanding the "whole cohesive system" of the product, rather than isolated optimizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>. Data is used, but complemented by research and intuition, recognizing that "you can't delegate understanding" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>.

### Story-Driven Product Development
A key aspect of this [[productled_growth_strategy|product-led growth strategy]] is that the "story will often dictate the product" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>. This approach helps in developing cohesive products that feel like the work of a few, even if a thousand people contributed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>. Each product release is viewed as a "chapter of a story" or an "episode of a TV series" within a 5 to 10-year company narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>.

### Recent Product Examples
*   **Guest Favorites** This feature addresses Airbnb's "Achilles heel" of reliability, combining the platform's unique inventory with the predictability expected from hotels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>. It uses 370 million reviews, customer service tickets, and host cancellation data to identify the top 2 million homes that guests love most <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>.
*   **Overhauled Host Tab** Recognizing that great guest experiences require great hosts with great tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>, the host tab was redesigned. This includes an AI-powered photo tour that uses computer vision language trained on 100 million photos to organize listing photos by room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>.
*   **New Design Aesthetic** Airbnb is moving away from flat design towards a more three-dimensional, colorful, and tactile aesthetic, predicting a broader industry shift to interfaces with color, texture, and dimensionality that replicate the natural environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>.

## Setting Ambitious Goals

Brian Chesky encourages a "10x" mindset, encapsulated by the saying "add a zero" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>. This exercise is not about setting impossible targets but about forcing teams to think differently about problems and identify foundational elements through "first principle thinking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>.

This approach also aims to set the pace for the team, prioritizing decisive action and a "bias for action" over prolonged discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>. The goal is to motivate teams by seeing and pushing their potential, fostering a "growth mindset" rather than demoralization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>.

## Leadership and Personal Growth

For leaders, avoiding burnout and maintaining balance are critical for [[challenges_and_strategies_in_startup_growth|sustainable growth]] and effective decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>. Chesky notes that deep involvement in details, while initially demanding, ultimately leads to more efficiency and fewer reactive surprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>.

Key practices for balance include:
*   Regular breaks from intense work (e.g., alternating intense and off-weekends) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>.
*   Prioritizing physical health through exercise and healthy eating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a>.
*   Nurturing healthy relationships, which a Harvard study identified as the secret to happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>. This includes making proactive efforts to stay in touch with friends and family, and creating new shared experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:00">[05:49:00]</a>.
*   Actively managing time to focus on meaningful work and relationships, rather than reacting to external demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>. Saying "no" to "fake work" that doesn't move the ball forward is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>.

For continuous [[career_growth_and_strategic_positioning|career growth and strategic positioning]], Chesky emphasizes:
*   Maintaining a "beginner's mindset" and curiosity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>.
*   Being "shameless about reaching out for help," recognizing that offering help is often an honor for others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>.
*   Embracing a constant state of "becoming" like an artist, always evolving and learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:00]</a>.

Chesky's background as an artist and industrial designer heavily influences his approach to product development, emphasizing intuition, imagination, and a holistic, well-rounded way of thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>. He believes this artistic lens contributes to Airbnb's distinctiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:00">[06:55:00]</a>.

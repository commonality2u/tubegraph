Developing "taste" in product design is considered a crucial skill, not an inherent trait, and is something that can be actively cultivated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:07">[01:04:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:04">[01:09:04]</a>. It involves understanding what users find valuable and aesthetically pleasing, which is critical for creating successful products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:34">[01:07:34]</a>.

## Cultivating Taste and High Standards

Key strategies for [[developing_good_taste_and_high_standards | developing good taste and high standards]] in product design include:

*   **Extensive Product Exposure**
    *   Trying many different products helps develop a discerning "muscle" for taste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:06">[01:07:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:10">[01:09:10]</a>.
    *   An internal operating principle at Vercel is to increase "exposure hours" by quantifying time spent watching how people use products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:34">[01:08:34]</a>. This includes observing how people use both one's own products and those of others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:49">[01:08:49]</a>.
    *   This exposure helps product builders become more grounded and humble by directly confronting the realities of user interaction, even if it's painful to see issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:11">[01:11:11]</a>.
    *   Leadership can encourage this by scheduling time for customer meetings and product demos where teams observe users directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:27">[01:12:27]</a>.

*   **Iterative Design and Feedback**
    *   Building and shipping ideas, then observing user reactions and iterating, is fundamental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:16">[01:08:16]</a>.
    *   It's important to be open to trying different things, even when facing challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:28">[00:38:28]</a>.
    *   Creating opportunities for users to provide feedback directly within the product is crucial for a tight feedback loop, especially with AI products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:40">[01:01:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:27">[01:02:27]</a>. This continuous stream of feedback helps refine and improve the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:42">[01:02:42]</a>.

*   **[[importance_of_attention_to_detail_in_product_design | Attention to Detail]] and Restraint**
    *   A great product is composed of "a thousand little details" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:56">[01:20:56]</a>.
    *   [[importance_of_attention_to_detail_in_product_design | Attention to such details]] and deciding what to feature (or omit) is vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:49">[01:10:49]</a>.
    *   Achieving high [[creating_productmarket_fit_and_operationalizing_product_quality | quality]] often requires "blood, sweat, and tears" and a deep sense of dedication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:20">[01:20:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:27">[01:22:27]</a>.
    *   "Creative restraint" is essential; not every idea should be pursued, as each feature adopted is like "adopting a puppy" â€“ demanding and growing into a "beast" that requires constant care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:29">[01:21:29]</a>.

*   **Dogfooding**
    *   Using one's own products (dogfooding) is a powerful mechanism for ensuring [[creating_productmarket_fit_and_operationalizing_product_quality | quality]] and continuously improving them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:18">[01:22:18]</a>.

## The Role of AI in Quality and Taste

AI tools like V0 play a significant role in elevating [[operationalizing_quality_and_design_excellence_in_product_teams | quality and design excellence]] in product teams:

*   **Automated Best Practices**: V0 aims to embed web best practices, generating more accessible code than humans might write, as it "knows everything" about web standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:37">[00:22:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:02">[00:52:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:24">[00:52:24]</a>.
*   **Design Generation**: V0 creates "very nice designs out of the box" and can be influenced to apply specific styles, even from existing screenshots or broad descriptive terms like "jazzy" or "make it pop" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:22">[00:26:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:24">[00:52:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:55">[01:18:55]</a>.
*   **Steering the Model**: Users can steer the AI with specific "tokens" or terms (e.g., CSS, layout, `turbulence`) to influence the output and make it follow their intention, which is crucial for achieving desired design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:05">[00:23:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:42">[00:26:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:24">[00:27:24]</a>.
*   **Enhanced Prompting**: Tools like V0 offer "enhanced prompt" features that tap into the model's latent space, providing suggestions and preventing "writer's block" for design prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:37">[00:50:37]</a>.
*   **Transparent AI Thinking**: The ability to introspect the AI's thinking process allows users to understand its approach and provide corrective feedback, improving iterative design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:09">[00:51:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:28">[01:00:28]</a>.

[!NOTE]
While AI can produce sophisticated results quickly (e.g., a complex flight radar app in two hours for $20, compared to weeks and tens of thousands of dollars for a human engineer), human oversight and continuous refinement remain critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:10">[00:42:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:07">[00:43:07]</a>. AI is a "copilot," "partner," and "assistant," not a replacement for human intention and creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:13">[01:07:13]</a>.

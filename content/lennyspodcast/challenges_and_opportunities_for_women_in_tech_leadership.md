Claire V., a long-time Chief Product Officer and two-time founder, engineer, designer, and marketer, offers insights into what it takes to be a successful woman in tech, especially as an executive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

## Challenges Faced by Women in Tech Leadership

Claire notes that despite her success, navigating the tech industry as a woman has not been easy, and this remains true even at her executive level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:04">[00:34:04]</a>.

### Statistical Realities
Claire highlights that women are not present in equal proportions in leadership roles within tech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:52">[00:33:52]</a>:
*   Roughly 13% of founders were women last year, a number that is declining year-over-year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:34">[00:33:34]</a>.
*   Female-led founding teams received only about 2% of venture capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:41">[00:33:41]</a>.
*   Women hold 30% of senior leadership roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:44">[00:33:44]</a>.
*   Women comprise 30% of software engineering teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:48">[00:33:48]</a>.

### Personal Experiences
Claire emphasizes that her experiences are not about impostor syndrome, as she has a proven track record including founding companies, raising venture capital, successful exits, and leading large teams as a CPO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:15">[00:34:15]</a>. Instead, it's about the inherent difficulty and difference of being a woman in the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:39">[00:34:39]</a>.

She shares historical examples:
*   Fighting for her all-girls school to offer computer science at the same level as the all-boys school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:58">[00:34:58]</a>.
*   Encountering "nonsense" in early-stage startups, including VCs telling her not to get pregnant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:06">[00:35:06]</a>.

Even at her current leadership level, such incidents continue to occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:26">[00:35:26]</a>. A consistent challenge Claire faces is being asked if she is "technical enough" or even "technical," despite her background as a technical co-founder, having written code for 12 months solo (which is still in production in large environments), and running multi-hundred-person engineering teams for years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:31">[00:37:31]</a>.

### Underlying Issues
Claire remains curious about the root causes of these challenges, classifying them into categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:47">[00:35:47]</a>:
*   **Structural:** What in the tech industry's structure contributes to these issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50">[00:35:50]</a>.
*   **Cultural:** The norms and environment within tech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:55">[00:35:55]</a>.
*   **External:** Incidents or perceptions originating outside her direct control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:59">[00:35:59]</a>.
*   **Internal:** What she might bring into the room that doesn't serve her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:02">[00:36:02]</a>.

She suggests that perceptions of "who is technical" are influenced by broader societal elements, including media representation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:26">[00:39:26]</a>. This impacts economic participation, as a lack of technical women starting companies and leading organizations leads to missed innovation and economic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:10">[00:40:10]</a>.

## Strategies and Opportunities for Women in Tech Leadership

Claire's approach to navigating these challenges is grounded in curiosity and empowerment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:58">[00:36:58]</a>. She believes the "universe is bendable to your will" and that these numbers are not intractable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:44">[00:36:44]</a>.

### Empowerment and Curiosity
*   **Embrace Curiosity:** Staying curious helps to understand the underlying causes of challenges and identify leverage points to drive change, not just for oneself but for the industry broadly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:13">[00:36:13]</a>.
*   **Stay Empowered:** Claire emphasizes knowing one's value and having "no time for impostor syndrome" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:29">[00:36:29]</a>. This empowered mindset helps maintain control and influence change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:03">[00:39:03]</a>.

### Normalizing Visibility
A key strategy to overcome these challenges is to normalize seeing women in tech leadership roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:34">[00:40:34]</a>. By providing platforms for diverse voices to share their journeys, exposing leaders from various technical and cultural backgrounds, the industry can begin to imagine different types of leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:59">[00:40:59]</a>. Claire actively seeks to invest in and raise the voices of female founders and CTOs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:17">[00:41:17]</a>.

### Leveraging Broader Experiences
Claire's own career path exemplifies a valuable strategy:
*   **Generalist Role Advantages:** Product management, being a generalist role, allows for lateral moves into other functions like marketing or engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>. Her first director role was in marketing and growth, demonstrating the value of learning and developing skills outside pure product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>.
*   **Operating in the Zone of Genius:** Focusing on areas where one is exceptional and derives intellectual and emotional joy leads to sustainable growth and impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>. Claire identifies her "zone of genius" as traversing horizontally across product, engineering, design, data, operations, and revenue, and vertically between high-level strategy and low-level details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>.
*   **Building a [[leadership_and_career_advancement | Founder Mindset]]**: Working in very small startups offers the opportunity to experience and develop a broad range of functional skills, which can prepare individuals for senior leadership roles like the [[evolving_skills_in_the_tech_industry | CPTO]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:20">[00:52:20]</a>. This includes being scrappy and able to "do a lot with a little" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:10">[00:45:10]</a>.
*   **Challenging "Lanes":** Encouraging teams to operate with "dotted lanes" rather than solid ones, allowing individuals to shift responsibilities (e.g., an engineer writing a spec or a designer contributing to code), fosters a healthy, collaborative environment that breeds future leaders capable of versatile roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:04">[00:53:04]</a>.

Claire also uses her personal experiences, such as negotiating the sale of her startup while 34 weeks pregnant, to demonstrate the "universe is bendable to your will" and how leaning into one's power can be an effective tactic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:44">[00:45:44]</a>.

Ultimately, Claire believes that while it's a complicated landscape, individuals can be successful, and the industry needs to strive for greater female participation for innovation and economic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:04">[00:40:04]</a>.

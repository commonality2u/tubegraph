The traditional perception of engineers as needing to be "coddled" or "sheltered" from real problems is shifting. There's a growing recognition that engineers can and should be treated as peers and placed in senior leadership roles, fostering their growth and development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This perspective views engineers as capable adults who can thrive with responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## Evolution of Engineering Leadership Roles

Will Larson, current CTO at Carta and former software engineering leader at Stripe, Uber, and Calm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>, notes a significant change in the engineering landscape, especially from the "zero interest rate era" to the current market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. Previously, engineering leaders often spent half or more of their time on hiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. In contrast, today they might conduct only a couple of interviews a month, or even zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

This shift means that competencies beyond just hiring have become critical for engineering leaders. An engineering director who was once a top performer primarily due to their hiring abilities may now be perceived as a low performer if they cannot [[leadership_and_career_advancement | lead the team]], delve deeper into details, or determine the right allocation and sizing of engineering teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. This includes navigating situations where teams are shrinking, being cut, or consolidated—a reality largely avoided in the previous era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.

## Accountability and Growth

Historically, the focus on hiring and retention often led to middle management "coddling" engineers to avoid losing team members, which was seen as a significant issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. This approach, however, was detrimental to engineers, teams, and organizational efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

The current shift allows leaders to give engineers real, hard problems and hold them accountable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. This accountability is crucial for placing engineers in senior roles, enabling them to pursue the career growth they desire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

## Collaboration with Product Management

A significant challenge in the relationship between Engineering Managers (EMs) and Product Managers (PMs) often stems from misaligned incentives or a lack of mutual understanding of each other's needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:36">[00:41:36]</a>.

### Understanding Incentives and Needs
*   **Misaligned Incentives**: Sometimes, the EM and PM might have incentives that are so far apart (e.g., timelines, saying "yes" to sales) that compromise seems impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:44">[00:41:44]</a>. While simplistic narratives often paint one party as a "villain," the reality is complex, driven by various business needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:20">[00:42:20]</a>.
*   **Lack of Understanding**: More commonly, EMs and PMs argue without deeply understanding what the other person truly cares about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:55">[00:42:55]</a>. By digging deeper to understand the "true needs" (which may differ from what is explicitly stated), a compromise solution that satisfies everyone can often be found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:27">[00:43:27]</a>.

### [[the_importance_of_aligning_incentives_for_engineering_and_product_management_teams | Aligning Incentives]]
One powerful approach to align incentives is to ensure that EM-PM pairs generally receive the same performance rating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:06">[00:44:06]</a>. While exceptions exist for clear non-performance, in generally hard situations involving two otherwise good individuals, a shared performance rating drives a common perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:39">[00:44:39]</a>. This can extend to business leadership as well, where all parties are graded on their ability to evaluate and solve for the entire set of constraints, not just their functional ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:06">[00:45:06]</a>.

A common stressor for EMs is the perceived need to provide their team with "interesting work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:06">[00:47:06]</a>. This can create friction, for instance, when a growth team needs to run many "boring" experiments, but engineers desire to build something new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:13">[00:47:13]</a>. EMs, caught between these demands, may appear unreliable to PMs due to these "invisible constraints" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:44">[00:47:44]</a>. Open communication about these underlying pressures is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:08">[00:48:08]</a>.

## Developing Engineering Strategy

Like any other function, engineering *always* has a strategy, even if it's not explicitly written down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>. The first step in [[developing_engineering_strategy_and_its_importance | developing engineering strategy]] is to document it. A written strategy allows for improvement and debugging of misapplications or misunderstandings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>.

Good strategy is often "boring" but powerful because it focuses energy on problems valued by the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>. For example, a strategy of "only using existing tools" (like Carta's "standard kit") may frustrate some engineers but aligns efforts with company priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>.

Richard Rumelt's definition of strategy includes three components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:22">[00:21:22]</a>:
1.  **Diagnosis**: Understanding the current status quo and real-world conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:25">[00:21:25]</a>.
2.  **Guiding Policies**: How to address the diagnosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>.
3.  **Actions**: How to implement those policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:37">[00:21:37]</a>.

Examples of effective engineering strategies include:
*   **Uber's "own data centers" policy (2014 era)**: While annoying for engineers who had to build everything, it enabled rapid expansion into geopolitically constrained regions like China within three months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:07">[00:22:07]</a>.
*   **Stripe's "Ruby monolith" policy**: This focused engineers on building innovative user features rather than supporting multiple programming languages and tooling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:25">[00:23:25]</a>.

These strategies often involve **constraint** – limiting options to accelerate movement and focus on core priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:18">[00:24:18]</a>. Bad strategies typically stem from a "willful disbelief" of an accurate diagnosis, leading to incoherent guiding policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:58">[00:24:58]</a>.

## Measuring Engineering Productivity

In an era of reduced team sizes and increased scrutiny on efficiency, engineering leaders are pressed to demonstrate productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:45">[00:48:45]</a>.

### Approaches to Measurement
*   **Benchmarking Funding**: A straightforward, mechanical exercise comparing R&D spending to industry benchmarks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:16">[00:49:16]</a>. While it can appease stakeholders, it doesn't offer insights for effective organizational management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:07">[00:50:07]</a>.
*   **Direct Feedback**: Engineers themselves often know if their teams are effective and why. Leaders can gather these "crumbs" of information and use their experience to diagnose underlying issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:28">[00:50:28]</a>.
*   **Aligning with Business Goals**: Engineering evaluation should be wholly accountable to product and business goals, not just internal metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:30">[00:51:30]</a>.
*   **Showcasing Roadmap Impact**: Presenting a roadmap of "meaningful, meaty things" with demonstrable impact over the past six months is powerful. If this list is robust, it provides confidence; if not, it signals areas of concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:03">[00:52:03]</a>.

### Metrics and Tools
While many startups offer dashboards based on metrics from books like *Accelerate* (e.g., lead time, incident remediation time, failure rate) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:51">[00:52:51]</a>, these are primarily diagnostic tools. For example, slow deployments indicate an area for improvement, not necessarily a sign of a bad company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:32">[00:53:32]</a>.

The key is to **measure something, even if imperfect**, and use it as an opportunity to educate stakeholders about the nuances and complexities of the underlying data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:41">[00:54:41]</a>. Refusing to measure anything due to perceived inaccuracies leads to a lack of understanding from non-experts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:25">[00:54:25]</a>.

## Defining Company Values

When establishing company or organizational values, leaders should prioritize three aspects:
1.  **Honesty**: Values must genuinely reflect what the company *actually* does, not just what it aspires to be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:07">[00:57:07]</a>. Claiming to be "users first" while making decisions that contradict this undermines trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:58">[00:56:58]</a>.
2.  **Applicability**: Values should be actionable and help guide real-world decisions. For instance, whether to "optimize globally" (as Stripe did) or "do what's good for your team and ignore everyone else" (Uber's implicit value) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:33">[00:57:33]</a>.
3.  **Reversibility**: A truly useful value implies a meaningful alternative. If the opposite of a value is nonsensical (e.g., "we build bad software" or "we don't care about our customers"), then it's likely an "identity value" that describes who you *want* to be, rather than a practical guide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:01">[00:59:01]</a>. These are less useful for decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:49">[00:59:49]</a>.

Values should also serve as a "hiring filter," clearly indicating who would *not* be a good fit, rather than applying to everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:59">[01:00:59]</a>. Concise, memorable values (e.g., four instead of seventeen) are more effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:23">[01:01:23]</a>.

## Lessons from Failure: The Dig Rewrite

Will Larson recounted a significant failure during his time at Dig, specifically the Dig V4 rewrite, which was a "complete rewrite" of the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:46">[01:03:46]</a>. This decision, often a prelude to failure in software development, was made to integrate social functionality in response to competition from social networks like Twitter and Facebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:09">[01:03:09]</a>.

Upon launch, the site repeatedly crashed, taking a month to become fully functional again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:47">[01:04:47]</a>. Key issues included having to rewrite a caching system from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:22">[01:05:22]</a> and a critical bug related to how Python initializes variables used as default parameters, which caused excessive server load <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:51">[01:05:51]</a>.

Despite the team's "heroic stretch" to get the site working, Dig ultimately went to zero, ran out of money, and was sold for parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:27">[01:09:27]</a>. The company was already in crisis due to an SEO change that drastically cut traffic and monetization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:14">[01:10:14]</a>.

However, this challenging experience provided immense learning. Larson became a manager within a few years of his career, effectively running the entire engineering team because most others had quit or were laid off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:14">[01:07:14]</a>. This difficult, high-pressure situation, though not something he would have voluntarily chosen, proved to be the "kernel" that shaped his entire career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:40">[01:07:40]</a>. Such intense experiences, when shared with a respected team, can be incredibly powerful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:16">[01:08:16]</a>.

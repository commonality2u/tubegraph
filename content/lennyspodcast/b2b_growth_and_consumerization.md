The landscape of [[Growth Hacking and Strategies | B2B growth]] is undergoing a significant transformation, moving closer to the consumer-like experiences found in B2C markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>. Elena Verna, an expert in [[Growth Hacking and Strategies | growth strategy]], highlights this shift, emphasizing that successful companies are no longer viewing [[sales_strategies_for_b2b_and_saas_companies | sales-led]] and [[productled_growth_strategy | product-led]] approaches as mutually exclusive choices, but rather as sequential layers of growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## The Evolution of B2B Products

Historically, B2B products were designed with the Enterprise buyer in mind, prioritizing utility, efficiency, and problem-solving for organizations, often resulting in cold, unusable interfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a>. The users themselves were not the primary decision-makers or direct beneficiaries of a "shiny" product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>.

However, over the last decade, there has been a tremendous shift:
*   **Decision-making power has shifted**: More B2B purchasing decisions are now influenced by the "prosumer" or individual employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>.
*   **Emphasis on user experience**: The new wave of B2B products is "shiny and fun," resembling consumer products in how they work, the feelings they invoke, and their ability to build user habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>.
*   **Focus on effectiveness**: The goal has moved beyond just efficient task completion to making employees' lives better, more productive, and more successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>.

This consumerization of B2B is driven by a redefinition of "customer centricity," where the user, not just the Enterprise buyer, is now the central focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>.

## Key Elements of B2B Consumerization

Consumer-like experiences in B2B products are characterized by:
*   **Onboarding experience**: Smooth and intuitive initial setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>.
*   **Time to value**: Quick realization of the product's benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:22">[00:20:22]</a>.
*   **Activation experience**: Ensuring users quickly become engaged and productive with the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>.
*   **Habit loops**: Building features that encourage repeated and habitual use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>.
*   **User affinity and advocacy**: Measuring user satisfaction through metrics like NPS (Net Promoter Score) and encouraging word-of-mouth growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>.

Examples of companies that have successfully achieved this user-driven adoption include Slack and Miro, where users bring the software into the company because it enhances their collaboration and effectiveness, leading Enterprise buyers to pay based on existing utilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:44">[00:20:44]</a>. Amplitude is also experiencing this shift, with adoption starting from the bottom-up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>.

## [[productled_growth_strategy | Product-Led Growth]] (PLG) as a Foundation

[[productled_growth_strategy | Product-led growth]] (PLG) is a model where product usage generates leads for sales and drives monetization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>. For any company, the first focus should be on [[productled_growth_strategy | product-led]] retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>. If a product cannot activate and engage users habitually, it has little chance of hooking an acquisition engine into the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:25">[00:24:25]</a>.

[[productled_growth_strategy | Product-led]] acquisition means users either buy, refer, or create content that attracts other users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:38">[00:24:38]</a>. This is most effective for products with a "one-to-many" relationship or collaboration at their core, like Slack or Miro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:05">[00:25:05]</a>. If a product lacks this, it becomes increasingly difficult to stand up [[productled_growth_strategy | product-led]] acquisition, requiring reliance on [[sales_strategies_for_b2b_and_saas_companies | marketing-led]] and [[sales_strategies_for_b2b_and_saas_companies | sales-led]] models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:29">[00:25:29]</a>.

## Layering Growth Strategies: Not a Choice, But a Sequence

The most successful companies do not abandon one growth strategy for another; they learn to execute both correctly and together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. If a company is currently [[sales_strategies_for_b2b_and_saas_companies | sales-led]], continuing solely down that path risks disruption from a [[productled_growth_strategy | product-led]] competitor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Instead, they should reinforce their [[sales_strategies_for_b2b_and_saas_companies | sales-led]] approach and overlay [[productled_growth_strategy | product-led]] initiatives to amplify existing growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

### Avoiding the Downfall of PLG when Adding Sales

Many companies that start as [[productled_growth_strategy | product-led]] fall into a common pattern of overcorrecting when they add a [[sales_strategies_for_b2b_and_saas_companies | sales]] team to chase larger Enterprise contracts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:40">[00:28:40]</a>.
1.  **Initial success**: High usage, strong advocates, easy early Enterprise closes.
2.  **Slowdown**: Companies run out of Enterprise buyers already in their user base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:56">[00:29:56]</a>.
3.  **Crucial mistake**: They neglect their product usage growth and [[productled_growth_strategy | product-led]] tactics, shifting resources to Enterprise sales and marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:51">[00:30:51]</a>.
4.  **Consequence**: The [[sales-led]] inbound, which relied on usage, starts to dry up, leading to a massive slowdown in Enterprise pipeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:36">[00:31:36]</a>. This often results in a complete reinvention of the growth model or a significant downturn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:36">[00:34:36]</a>.

To avoid this:
*   **Understand ACVs are not comparable**: The average contract value (ACV) in [[productled_growth_strategy | PLG]] or self-serve is generally lower initially than [[sales-led]] top-down, because PLG aims to land earlier and expand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:33">[00:35:33]</a>.
*   **Prioritize user delight**: The product roadmap should not *exclusively* focus on Enterprise features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:03">[00:36:03]</a>. Companies must continue to innovate and delight users, as these users act as the primary selling agents within an organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:19">[00:36:19]</a>.

## Product-Led Sales (PLS): The Future of B2B Growth

[[Product-led growth strategy | Product-led sales]] (PLS) is an emerging trend that Elena Verna predicts will eventually "box out" traditional top-down sales organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:52">[00:36:52]</a>.
*   **Focus on user value**: PLS drives expansion through user value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:16">[00:37:16]</a>.
*   **Lower cost of acquisition**: The cost of acquiring a user is significantly cheaper than acquiring a buyer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:22">[00:37:22]</a>.
*   **Usage-driven pipeline**: PLS creates pipeline based on actual usage, rather than traditional marketing qualified leads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:29">[00:37:29]</a>.
*   **Process**:
    1.  Starts with **self-serve usage** (freemium or self-serve monetization) without human involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:15">[00:39:15]</a>.
    2.  Product team monitors usage for **network effects** within an organization (e.g., multiple users, teams using the product) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:41">[00:39:41]</a>.
    3.  Develop a **product qualification model** to score users based on volume, velocity, feature breadth, behavioral tactics, and demographics to assess the probability of selling to the entire organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:02">[00:40:02]</a>.
    4.  **Sales involvement**: Initially focuses on encouraging "hand-raisers" (users who proactively seek sales) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:28">[00:40:28]</a>. The next layer involves "outbounding" to qualified users who haven't raised their hand, seeking to connect with an Enterprise buyer or facilitate an introduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:44">[00:40:44]</a>.

In this model, the product itself becomes the sales enablement material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>. Enterprise buyers are increasingly "boxed out" of the initial decision-making process, as the user drives adoption and justifies the spend through demonstrated value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:13">[00:41:13]</a>.

## [[The process of achieving productmarket fit in B2B SaaS | Freemium vs. Trial]] Models

[[The process of achieving productmarket fit in B2B SaaS | Freemium]] and trial models both offer free usage of a product, but with a key distinction:
*   **[[The process of achieving productmarket fit in B2B SaaS | Freemium]]**: Allows ongoing free usage, often with feature or usage walls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:13">[00:42:13]</a>.
*   **Trial**: Time-bound free usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:26">[00:42:26]</a>.

The challenge with time-bound trials is that the time needed to evaluate a product varies greatly by user and organization size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:47">[00:42:47]</a>. A 7-day trial might be sufficient for a small startup but alienate a large Enterprise that requires months for evaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:56">[00:42:56]</a>. Instead of time-based trials, Elena advocates for **usage-based freemium**, like MongoDB's free community cluster, which allows users to prototype without time constraints but requires a paid model for production use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:53">[00:43:53]</a>.

Even high-friction B2B products (like those requiring data source connections or database setup) can benefit from a freemium model. While complex for large enterprises, a small startup can quickly get value from it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:18">[00:45:18]</a>. The continuous innovation in the field, including no-code platforms, is pushing down the cost and complexity of self-serve provisioning, making freemium increasingly viable across all sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:37">[00:46:37]</a>.

### Strategic Reasons for Freemium

[[The process of achieving productmarket fit in B2B SaaS | Freemium]] should not be viewed merely as a conversion rate optimization tactic for paid products, but as a strategic business driver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:51">[00:49:51]</a>. Key strategies for freemium include:
*   **Indirect Monetization/Virality**: Allowing free usage to drive [[marketplace_growth_strategies | virality]] or network effects that lead to acquisition (e.g., Miro's free boards that encourage sharing; SurveyMonkey's free tier driving 100% of acquisition) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:50">[00:47:50]</a>.
*   **Strategic Land**: Landing with a segment not immediately monetized but offering future expansion potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:43">[00:48:43]</a>.
*   **Commoditization**: If features are commoditized, offering them for free, but differentiating with innovation to stand out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:47">[00:48:47]</a>.
*   **Product Incubation**: Using freemium as a breeding ground for discovering adjacent use cases and personas, informing the roadmap, and staying ahead of trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:06">[00:49:06]</a>.
*   **Data Collection**: Collecting data on freemium users to build and sell paid products (e.g., LinkedIn leveraging its free user base to build Sales Navigator and recruiting products) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:25">[00:49:25]</a>.

When deciding what to make free, consider if it helps with indirect monetization (virality/network effects), suffices for all users (commoditization), accelerates the "aha!" moment (POC), or creates habit loops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:34">[00:50:34]</a>. Anything that creates friction for the growth model should be gated behind payment; anything that promotes it should be free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:09">[00:51:09]</a>.

## Hiring for [[Growth Hacking and Strategies | Growth]]

[[Growth Hacking and Strategies | Growth]] is an evolution, not a revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:18">[00:52:18]</a>. It's often best to find a first [[Growth Hacking and Strategies | growth]] hire internally (e.g., a data analyst, product manager, or engineer with business acumen) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:27">[00:52:27]</a>.
*   **Internal hires**: They are already familiar with the product and its authentic [[Growth Hacking and Strategies | growth]] model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:54">[00:52:54]</a>. Applying an external individual's previous company's [[Growth Hacking and Strategies | growth]] model without understanding the specific product leads to a high failure rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:07">[00:53:07]</a>.
*   **External hires**: While possible, they require significant time (3-6 months or more) to understand the product and its unique [[Growth Hacking and Strategies | growth]] dynamics. Bringing an external hire under pressure to deliver quick results often leads to ineffective "copy-pasting" of past successes, which rarely works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:41">[00:53:41]</a>.

A company should only consider hiring a dedicated [[Growth Hacking and Strategies | growth]] person once it has achieved [[the_process_of_achieving_productmarket_fit_in_b2b_saas | strong product-market fit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:27">[00:55:27]</a>. This means having proven retention (at least 6 months to a year post-launch) and some initial ability to acquire and monetize customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:36">[00:55:36]</a>. The founding team must establish the initial [[Growth Hacking and Strategies | growth]] model themselves, rather than delegating this crucial aspect of the business from the start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:10">[00:56:10]</a>.

## General Tips for Driving Growth

To drive [[Growth Hacking and Strategies | growth]], companies and teams should focus on:
*   **Finding patterns**: Understanding how to find repeatable patterns in the problems being solved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:07">[00:57:07]</a>.
*   **Frameworks over patterns**: Investing in creating frameworks for problem-solving rather than simply replicating past success patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:23">[00:57:23]</a>. This allows for scalable, repeatable, and sustainable [[Growth Hacking and Strategies | growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:29">[00:57:29]</a>.
*   **Minimize context switching**: This is key to creating a competitively defensible [[Growth Hacking and Strategies | growth]] model and fostering a [[Growth Hacking and Strategies | growth]] culture across the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:57">[00:57:57]</a>.

The concept of "power" often makes people uncomfortable, but understanding and growing it is crucial for career advancement, happiness, and reducing stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This perspective views power not as an ethical judgment, but as a pragmatic reality of how the world operates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. Jeffrey Pfeffer, a professor of organizational behavior at Stanford's Graduate School of Business and author of "The Seven Rules of Power," teaches that these are skills that can be mastered, not innate personality traits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. The core idea is that if power is to be used for good, more good people need to have it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

Research shows that "political skill," which is closely related to power, is associated with positive outcomes such as higher salary, promotions, career happiness, and reduced stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. The discomfort arises because the realities of acquiring power often conflict with conventional upbringing and societal ideals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. Power, like a hammer or a surgeon's knife, is a tool; its impact depends on how it is used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. Those who come from disadvantaged backgrounds or characteristics especially need to understand and build power skills, as the world may be "stacked against them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

Jeffrey Pfeffer's course, "Paths to Power," is one of the most popular and oversubscribed at Stanford's MBA program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. It's described as the "cod liver oil of the Graduate School of Business" â€“ good for you, but it might make you nervous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. To benefit from the class, students must be open to learning the material, as psychological discomfort hinders learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. The class emphasizes being "curious not judgmental," especially when dealing with individuals who are on your "critical path" for getting things done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.

> "Not everyone we encounter in paths to power [is] someone you're going to want to emulate. This is a class about how to get things done, how to build and wield influence, and there are multiple ways to accomplish these objectives." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>

## The Seven Rules of Power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>
1.  Get out of your own way
2.  Break The Rules
3.  Appear powerful
4.  Build a powerful brand
5.  Network relentlessly
6.  Use your power
7.  Success excuses almost everything (or "what you did to get there will be forgiven, forgotten, or both")

### Rule 1: Get Out of Your Own Way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:15">[00:21:15]</a>
This rule addresses internal barriers to acquiring power. A primary obstacle is discomfort with the idea of power itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:28">[00:21:28]</a>. If one views power as "dirty" or "evil," they will shy away from the actions needed for career success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:35">[00:21:35]</a>.

Another common barrier is "impostor syndrome," where individuals believe they don't deserve their position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:55">[00:21:55]</a>. This can lead to self-deprecating behaviors like preemptory apologies ("I don't know if this comment is going to be useful") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>. The advice is to stop apologizing and using self-disempowering language, as these attitudes leak out and influence how others perceive you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:52">[00:22:52]</a>.

Prioritizing being liked over competence and respect can also be a self-inflicted wound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:56">[00:25:56]</a>. While one shouldn't actively try to be disliked, the primary goal in a professional role is to perform and get the job done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a>. Being hired implies you have the skills to make the organization successful, and not using those skills due to worry about others' opinions harms both yourself and the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:27">[00:25:27]</a>.

### Rule 2: Break The Rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">[00:26:05]</a>
Breaking rules can be a powerful strategy because it makes you stand out and become memorable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:19">[00:26:19]</a>. Often, rules are established by those who benefit from the existing system, so disruption is key to advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:30">[00:26:30]</a>. Just as companies like Southwest Airlines or Amazon disrupt industries by doing things differently, individuals can be "disruptors" in their careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:40">[00:26:40]</a>.

One common rule to break is "don't ask for help" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:39">[00:27:39]</a>. People often overestimate the negative consequences of asking, and doing so can actually make others more comfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:54">[00:27:54]</a>. The worst outcome of asking is "no," which leaves you no worse off than if you hadn't asked at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:45">[00:28:45]</a>.

### Rule 3: Appear Powerful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:56">[00:43:56]</a>
How one looks and sounds often has a greater impact than the content of what is said <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:54">[00:44:54]</a>. People respond subconsciously and emotionally to body language and presentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:28">[00:45:28]</a>. Studies show that factors like height and attractiveness can influence salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:37">[00:45:37]</a>.

Key aspects of appearing powerful include:
*   **Body Language**: Open posture, more gestures, invading personal space (gentle touching on the arm or shoulder), and eye contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:17">[00:48:17]</a>.
*   **Vocal Delivery**: Louder voice and more speaking time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:19">[00:48:19]</a>.
*   **Presence**: Not reading from notes (shows mastery and control), disinhibited laughs (humor can build rapport), and confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:04">[00:48:04]</a>.
*   **Strategic Dressing**: Like Laura Chow, dressing strategically to create a unique and memorable style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>.

These are learnable skills, not innate traits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:41">[00:46:41]</a>. For example, Regis McKenna and his team famously helped Steve Jobs develop his presentation skills, transforming him into a captivating speaker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:05">[00:47:05]</a>.

### Rule 4: Build a Powerful Brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>
To advance in a hierarchical world, it's essential to be known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>. Being smart or personable is not enough; people need to know *who you are* and *what you bring to the table* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>. A strong brand differentiates you in a crowded field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>.

Examples of effective brand building include:
*   **Creating Value**: Keith Ferrazzi started the Lincoln Quality Award at Deloitte to boost brand recognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>.
*   **Taking Initiative**: Tristan Walker secured partnerships for Foursquare *before* being hired, demonstrating value and forcing the founder to notice him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>.
*   **Visible Contributions**: Laura Chow, a venture capitalist, used writing, podcasting, contributing to books, and networking dinners to make herself known in the consumer tech space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a>.
*   **Strategic Self-Promotion**: Reframing "self-promotion" as amplifying the team's impact or scaling oneself by sharing knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>.

Ultimately, visibility without substance is useless, but substance without visibility will go unnoticed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a>.

### Rule 5: Network Relentlessly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:34">[00:30:34]</a>
Many people find networking uncomfortable due to misconceptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:44">[00:30:44]</a>. The primary principle of networking is generosity: "What can I do for you?" or "Who can I introduce you to?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>. A broad social network provides more knowledge and more opportunities to connect people, and if "knowledge is power," networking is a fantastic way to acquire it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:20">[00:31:20]</a>.

Networking is a necessary component of acquiring more power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:03">[00:32:03]</a>. Omid Kordestani's story exemplifies this: he stopped doing his official job at Netscape to focus on networking, first internally, then with people across Silicon Valley, eventually becoming employee #11 at Google through widespread referrals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:16">[00:33:16]</a>.

To make networking less "cringey," focus on strategic outreach rather than formal events. This can involve:
*   Identifying 10 key people important to your career goals and strategizing how to meet them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:32">[00:35:32]</a>.
*   Hosting dinners or casual meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:03">[00:36:03]</a>.
*   Offering value first, such as sharing relevant articles or making introductions that benefit others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:22">[00:36:22]</a>.

A key networking strategy is to become a "broker" by connecting people and groups who would benefit from knowing each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:39">[00:37:39]</a>. This is the essence of what venture capitalists, investment bankers, and real estate agents do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:57">[00:37:57]</a>. If leadership is about getting things done through others, then knowing more people naturally leads to getting more done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:33">[00:38:33]</a>.

Another important aspect is pursuing "weak ties" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:11">[00:40:11]</a>. People with strong ties (family, close friends, immediate colleagues) often share the same information and connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:14">[00:40:14]</a>. Building ties with people who are more different from you leads to learning non-redundant information and discovering new opportunities, as shown in studies on job seekers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:33">[00:40:33]</a>.

### Rule 6: Use Your Power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:01">[00:42:01]</a>
When placed in a position of power or authority, it's essential to mobilize resources and make things happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>. The more you get things done, the more resources and opportunities you will be given <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:07">[00:43:07]</a>. Success attracts more success, as people want to be associated with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:14">[00:43:14]</a>. Simply *showing* that you have power creates more power, as people tend to follow the lead of those they perceive as powerful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:48">[00:43:48]</a>.

### Rule 7: Success Excuses Almost Everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>
This rule posits that life is not "homeostatic" â€“ it doesn't automatically correct itself or bring powerful people down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:17">[01:00:17]</a>. Instead, it is often "self-fulfilling": if you believe someone is powerful, they tend to become more powerful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:22">[01:00:22]</a>. Therefore, actions taken to acquire power, even if controversial, are often "forgotten and forgiven" once power is achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:32">[01:00:32]</a>.

Examples include:
*   **Lindsey Graham**: Who once spoke critically of Donald Trump but later became a staunch supporter, stating he wanted to remain "relevant" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:41">[01:00:41]</a>.
*   **Bill Gates**: Accused of stealing code, but this is often overlooked due to his massive success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:41">[01:01:41]</a>.
*   **Martha Stewart**: Who served jail time but whose brand became even more valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:04">[01:02:04]</a>.
*   **Jeffrey Epstein**: Who, despite being a convicted sex offender, continued to associate with high-profile figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:50">[01:01:50]</a>.

People are drawn to money, power, and success, and will often overlook flaws to be close to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:08">[01:03:08]</a>. This perspective describes how the world *is*, not how it *should be*, and is supported by social science and logic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:20">[01:03:20]</a>.

### Mastering the Skills: The Knowing-Doing Gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:13">[01:13:13]</a>
Simply reading about power is not enough; one must *do* it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:34">[01:21:34]</a>. Jeffrey Pfeffer's course incorporates "doing power" assignments to ensure learning sticks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:30">[01:13:30]</a>. This approach aims to move students through stages of denial, anger, and sadness to eventual acceptance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:45">[01:51:45]</a>.

Assignments include:
*   **Goal Setting**: Defining what success looks like for the individual's career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:51">[00:55:51]</a>.
*   **Self-Assessment**: Identifying strengths and weaknesses in power attributes and setting development plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:04">[00:56:04]</a>.
*   **Resource Creation**: Identifying or creating resources that provide leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:46">[00:56:46]</a>.
*   **Branding Statement**: Crafting a personal brand statement and seeking feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>.
*   **Role-playing**: Practicing "appearing powerful" by recording videos and getting feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:24">[00:57:24]</a>.

The key is to push oneself gradually out of one's comfort zone, akin to the [[importance_of_selfawareness_and_personal_operating_principles | 15% rule]] where one pushes a little bit beyond their comfort zone but not too far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:50">[00:54:50]</a>. To master these skills, seeking coaching and building a "personal board of directors" for advice, support, and accountability is highly recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:50">[01:17:50]</a>.

### The Price of Power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:56">[01:15:56]</a>
While power brings benefits, it also comes with significant downsides, primarily a lack of [[the_impact_of_power_on_personal_life_and_autonomy | autonomy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:14">[01:11:14]</a>. High-power individuals like CEOs or presidents have extremely demanding and scheduled lives, with little control over their time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:05">[01:14:05]</a>.

Increased power also brings enormous visibility and scrutiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:22">[01:14:22]</a>. Everything, from personal life to past actions, can be publicly dissected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:59">[01:14:59]</a>. This intense scrutiny can lead to a "trust dilemma," where powerful individuals question if people associate with them for who they are or for the position they hold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:26">[01:15:26]</a>. The price of power is paid not just by the individual, but also by their family, impacting relationships and well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:01">[01:17:01]</a>.

Jeffrey Pfeffer emphasizes that his role is to educate people about the realities of power, including both its benefits and its costs, so they can make informed choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:56">[01:20:56]</a>. His books, including "The Seven Rules of Power" and "The Knowing-Doing Gap," are available wherever books are sold, and further resources can be found on his personal website, jeffreypfeffer.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:39">[01:19:39]</a>.

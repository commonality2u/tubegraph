The discussion highlights the distinct roles of product owners and product managers, particularly within large, non-tech organizations undergoing [[the_evolution_and_future_of_product_management | digital transformations]]. Melissa Perri, a prominent figure in the product management community, discusses the historical context, challenges, and [[strategies_for_career_growth_and_breaking_into_product_management | career growth strategies]] for individuals in these roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.

## The Product Owner Role

The product owner role emerged from Scrum as a way to help developers prioritize what to work on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. It was not originally an extension of product management as it is known today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

### Origin and Description in Scrum
The Agile Manifesto, written by software developers in 2001, focused on building better products through software development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>. None of the manifesto's signers were product managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.

The Scrum Guide, developed by Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland, outlines roles including developers, a scrum master, and a product owner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>. In the first Scrum Guide, the product owner was responsible for maximizing the value of work done by the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. It suggested the product owner could be a product manager for commercial development or a user department manager for in-house development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>. However, later versions of the Scrum Guide, specifically the 2013 version, removed the explicit mention that a product manager could be a product owner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>.

### Training and Responsibilities
Product owner training typically consists of a two-day class focusing on:
*   Breaking down a backlog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>
*   Conducting stand-ups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>
*   Prioritizing work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>
*   Working with retrospectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>

Crucially, this training often lacks coverage of essential product management skills such as experimentation, market research, or data analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:18:55]</a>. This means product owners, especially in large organizations undergoing agile transformations, often become tactical "order takers" responsible primarily for feeding backlog items to developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:37">[00:34:37]</a>.

### The Problem with Product Owners
*   **Narrow Focus**: Many product owners operate at a component level, making up work to keep developers busy, rather than focusing on strategic value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:49">[00:29:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:05">[00:30:05]</a>.
*   **Lack of Strategic Input**: They may not engage in customer discovery or market research, relying on product managers to provide requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:31">[00:31:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:17">[00:32:17]</a>.
*   **Accountability Issues**: Developers may rely on product owners to define work, shifting accountability if the "right thing" wasn't built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:41">[00:32:41]</a>.
*   **Career Path Limitations**: Many organizations lack a clear [[product_management_career_growth_framework | career path]] for product owners to advance into more strategic product management roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:50">[00:45:50]</a>. This can lead to high churn in the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:38">[01:00:38]</a>.
*   **Absence in Tech**: Notably, top tech companies like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Netflix do not have product owners; they exclusively employ product managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:21">[01:02:21]</a>.

## The Product Manager Role

Product managers in Silicon Valley-native software companies emerged from a business role, where software *is* the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. They perform end-to-end product management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>.

### Key Responsibilities of a Product Manager
*   Understanding the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>
*   Conducting market research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:58">[00:18:58]</a>
*   Testing hypotheses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>
*   Data analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>
*   Working with developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>
*   Iterating on products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>
*   Determining value and strategic direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:50">[00:38:50]</a>
*   Balancing discovery and delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:19">[00:34:19]</a>

## Career Development for Product Owners and Product Managers

### Advice for Organizations
Organizations aiming for a [[coaching_and_leadership_in_product_management | successful digital transformation]] or improving product development should avoid overly rigid frameworks and focus on a holistic operating model.
*   **Holistic Operating Model**: A product operating model should encompass:
    *   **Product Strategy**: Clearly defined and tied to company goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:51">[00:41:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:19">[00:43:19]</a>.
    *   **Organizational Design**: Organized around products with skilled product managers at all levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:08">[00:42:08]</a>.
    *   **Product Operations**: Infrastructure to support teams with data and customer access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:21">[00:42:21]</a>.
    *   **Culture and Incentives**: Reward value delivery over just shipping features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:58">[00:42:58]</a>.
*   **Transparency**: Implement tools and processes (like roadmapping tools) for transparency across teams to ensure alignment with business goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:03">[00:44:03]</a>.
*   **Strategic Leadership**: Ensure C-suite and leaders understand the product role as a business role that rolls up to strategic objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:03">[00:46:03]</a>. Hire experienced product leaders (CPOs, VPs) to bring in external expertise and mentor internal talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:26">[00:53:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:27">[00:55:27]</a>.
*   **Unified Titles and Clear [[product_management_career_growth_framework | Career Paths]]**:
    *   It is generally recommended to get rid of separate "product owner" and "product manager" titles as they cause confusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:08">[01:13:08]</a>.
    *   Instead, adopt a unified "product manager" title with levels like Associate Product Manager, Product Manager, Senior Product Manager, etc. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:03">[01:12:03]</a>.
    *   Assess individuals' actual skill sets to determine appropriate leveling when [[transitioning_into_product_management | transitioning]] roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:54">[01:13:54]</a>.
    *   Some individuals, upon understanding the full scope of product management, may opt out, preferring roles in operations, data, or user research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:42">[01:14:42]</a>.

### Advice for Individuals (Product Owners and Product Managers)
For product owners looking to advance their [[career_growth_strategies_for_product_managers | careers]] into product management:
*   **Seek Strategic Ownership**: Push back on tasks and take ownership of more strategic work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:01">[00:58:01]</a>.
*   **Engage with Customers**: If your product manager is doing all customer research, ask to participate or observe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:03">[00:59:03]</a>.
*   **Focus on Value and Outcomes**:
    *   Shift focus from merely writing user stories or managing backlog to delivering measurable value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:14">[00:59:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:22">[00:59:22]</a>.
    *   When presenting work or plans, ask "What do we hope will happen when we release this? What metrics will change?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:32">[00:59:32]</a>.
*   **Advocate for [[product_management_career_growth_framework | Career Paths]]**: Ask leaders about your [[product_management_career_growth_framework | career path]] to prompt organizational change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:47">[00:58:47]</a>.
*   **Tailor Your Resume**:
    *   Emphasize value brought to users and metrics moved, rather than agile processes or ceremonies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:26">[01:03:26]</a>.
    *   Focus on leading work, solving problems, and resulting business outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:03">[01:05:03]</a>.
    *   Consider adding "Product Manager" to your title on your resume, alongside "Product Owner," to indicate broader capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:29">[01:06:29]</a>.
*   **Be Skeptical of Certifications**: While some large enterprises may require Certified Scrum Product Owner (CSPO) certifications for hiring or promotion, they typically indicate only a two-day class and do not guarantee product management skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:51">[01:06:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:11">[01:08:11]</a>. Tech companies prioritize experience over certifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:21">[01:10:21]</a>.
*   **Seek Mentorship and Exposure**: Find leaders who embody good product management practices and learn from them. If your current organization doesn't provide this exposure, consider moving internally or externally to a place that does <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:37">[01:16:37]</a>.

### Overcoming [[challenges_in_transitioning_to_product_management | Challenges]]

Organizations, especially large ones not natively software-focused, often adopt rigid frameworks like Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) because they provide a "plug-and-play" map for technology operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:42">[00:40:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:40">[00:36:40]</a>. However, SAFe is often overkill, focuses heavily on process, and doesn't adequately address good product management practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:12">[00:37:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:40">[00:44:40]</a>. Many companies eventually abandon or significantly modify SAFe implementations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>.

The core principle of agile should be to move quickly and deliver great value to customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:32">[01:17:32]</a>. If processes don't serve this goal, they should be changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:01">[01:20:01]</a>. Successful transformations involve blending existing talent with experienced product leaders who can guide the organization and train people to understand [[the_art_and_role_of_product_management | the art and role of product management]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:35">[00:53:35]</a>. This approach can lead to significant improvements in product delivery and business outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:21">[01:21:21]</a>.

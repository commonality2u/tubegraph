Finding [[The concept of product market fit and its evolution | product market fit]] (PMF) is considered the single most important task for a startup within its first three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Despite its critical importance, it is often underexplored and poorly explained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. First Round Capital has developed a practical and actionable framework, based on consistent patterns observed across hundreds of startups, to guide founders in this journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>.

This framework aims to increase the odds of achieving PMF by providing a structured way of thinking about necessary actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>. It is primarily designed for early B2B founders, particularly those with a sales-led approach, in their first six to nine months of operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>.

## The Ultimate Goal: Extreme Product Market Fit

The ultimate goal of the framework is to reach **Extreme [[The concept of product market fit and its evolution | Product Market Fit]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>. This state is defined as:
> "A state of widespread demand for a product that satisfies a critical need and crucially can be delivered repeatably and efficiently to each customer." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>

This definition highlights three key ideas or dimensions:
1.  **Demand**: Widespread interest and need for the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>.
2.  **Satisfaction**: The product effectively meets a critical customer need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>.
3.  **Efficiency**: The product can be delivered repeatably and economically at scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>.

Efficiency is often overlooked in definitions of PMF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>. Companies like WeWork or Casper achieved customer satisfaction and demand but struggled with efficiency, preventing their businesses from working at scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>. The "marginal customer" concept is key: as you progress, acquiring and serving the next incremental customer should become easier and easier, indicating increasing efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>.

These three dimensions are intertwined, and founders often make tradeoffs between them at different stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. For example, spending heavily on marketing increases demand but decreases efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>.

## The Four Levels of Product Market Fit

[[Levels of productmarket fit and their significance | Product market fit]] is not a single, overnight event but rather a sequence of four levels that unfolds over multiple years, typically four to six years for the best Enterprise companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>.

### Level 1: Nascent Product Market Fit
*   **Goal**: Find three to five customers with an important and urgent problem, and deliver a deeply satisfying solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.
*   **Focus**: Primarily **satisfaction**, then demand, with efficiency being the least concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>. It's acceptable to be highly inefficient if it leads to uncovering a deeply satisfying customer experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>.
*   **Typical Stage**: Pre-seed or seed-stage company, less than 10 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>.
*   **ARR**: Roughly $0 to $500K ARR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>.
*   **Demand Source**: Mostly personal network (friends, family, VCs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>. It's normal for it to be hard to find customers, potentially taking 20 warm intros to get one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>.
*   **Examples**:
    *   **Vanta**: Initially focused on solving the painful problem of compliance audits (e.g., SOC 2) for early customers, even manually filling out spreadsheets to deliver the solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. The core was delivering on the promise of "unlocking revenue" by enabling enterprise deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.
    *   **Lattis**: Started as an OKR tool, but customers' usage and retention were low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>. They [[Product Market Fit Strategy | pivoted]] by keeping the same "Persona" (Head of HR) but changing the "Problem" and "Promise" to Performance Management, selling with Figma mockups before building the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>.
*   **Signs of Being Stuck**: If you spend 6-12 months at this stage with these flags <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>:
    *   Customers wouldn't be disappointed if your product disappeared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.
    *   Each of your few happy customers values a different feature (feels more like consulting than a product) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>.
    *   It's incredibly hard to find the next new customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>.
    *   Usage is low or not growing after the product is in their hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>.
*   **How to Get Unstuck**: Consider a "pivot" using the **4 Ps** (Persona, Problem, Promise, Product) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>. As seen with Lattis and Vanta, you might keep one P and change others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>. The focus is on finding a problem that truly matters and a promise that deeply resonates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>.
    *   **Rick Song (Persona)**: Avoid being "friendzoned" by customers (they like you, but don't *need* you) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>. Ask direct questions: "If Persona went away, how painful would that be?" or "If a competitor charged half, would you switch?" to gauge criticality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>.

### Level 2: Developing Product Market Fit
*   **Goal**: Scale from 5 satisfied customers to 25 satisfied customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>.
*   **Focus**: Start thinking about **demand** in addition to satisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>. The product needs to do more of the "heavy lifting" for sales, not just sheer willpower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>.
*   **Typical Stage**: Seed or Series A company, up to 20 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.
*   **ARR**: $500K to $5 million ARR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>.
*   **Demand Source**: Early signs of scalable channels beyond warm intros (e.g., cold outreach, content, community events) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>. Sales conversion (first call to close) around 10% is typical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>.
*   **Efficiency Metrics (Starting to Monitor)**:
    *   Magic Number: 0.5 to 0.75 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>.
    *   Regretted Churn: Up to 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:00">[04:19:00]</a>.
    *   Net Revenue Retention (NRR): At least 100% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>.
    *   Gross Margin: Not worse than 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>.
    *   Burn Multiple: Not worse than 5x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:00">[04:33:00]</a>.
*   **Examples**:
    *   **Looker**: Spent a long time at Level 1 refining their complex product (data modeling requires seeing real data) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>. Once their "forward deploy" process (deep pre-sales engagement) was repeatable, they flew through Level 2 with high close rates (75%) and zero churn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>. They then focused on demand channels like SDRs and partner marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>.
    *   **Ironclad**: Initially struggled with "AI Legal Assistant" positioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>. A customer's inbound query for "CLM" (Contract Lifecycle Management) revealed an existing category with buyers. They changed their "Promise" and "Positioning" to an "AI-powered CLM," winning deals against established players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19:00">[05:19:00]</a>.
*   **Signs of Being Stuck**: If you spend 12-18 months at this stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>:
    *   Current customers are happy, but you're struggling to open the demand floodgates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>.
    *   Regretted churn is >20% (satisfaction warning) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>.
    *   Sales cycles are too long, or you're losing deals late in the funnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>.
    *   Customers say "no budget" or "not the right time" (means they don't *need* it urgently) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>.
*   **How to Get Unstuck**: Often requires a "200% pivot," changing one or more of the 4 Ps, especially if the "Problem" is not significant enough or the "Promise" is not valuable enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>. It's psychologically hard to let go of what's been built, but necessary for progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>.

### Level 3: Strong Product Market Fit
*   **Goal**: Achieve repeatability, scaling from 25 customers to 100 or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:00">[05:55:00]</a>.
*   **Focus**: All three dimensions – maintaining satisfaction and demand while actively focusing on **efficiency** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:00]</a>. The marginal customer should be much easier to acquire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:45:00">[05:45:00]</a>.
*   **Typical Stage**: Series B venture funding, 30-100 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:00">[05:14:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19:00">[05:19:00]</a>.
*   **ARR**: $5 million to $25 million ARR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>. Average Contract Value (ACV) around $75K is a good benchmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>.
*   **Demand Source**: Cracked at least one scalable marketing and sales channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a>. At least 10-20% of inbound leads come from referrals and word-of-mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>.
*   **Efficiency Metrics (Key Focus)**:
    *   Gross Margin: Above 60%, ideally above 70% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:00">[05:29:00]</a>.
    *   Burn Multiple: Below 3x, ideally 1-3x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>.
    *   Regretted Churn: Less than 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>.
    *   NRR: Greater than 110% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>.
*   **Feeling**: The "fish are jumping into the boat," the "boulder is rolling down the hill," and leads are coming in without knowing where they're from <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>.
*   **Signs of Being Stuck**:
    *   Leaky bucket: NRR below 90% or regretted churn >10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:34:00">[06:34:00]</a>.
    *   Growth is slowing down (e.g., struggling to do 2x after 3x growth) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>.
    *   Increased competition, saturating existing scalable channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52:00">[06:52:00]</a>.
    *   Inefficient growth (burn multiple above 3x to sustain growth) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:57:00">[06:57:00]</a>.

### Level 4: Extreme Product Market Fit
*   **Goal**: Continued growth through expanding Total Addressable Market (TAM) via new markets or multiple products, while maintaining high satisfaction, demand, and efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:57:00">[06:57:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>.
*   **Typical Stage**: Unicorn status and beyond, Series C, D, or later, team larger than 100 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>.
*   **ARR**: $25 million ARR and up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:00">[06:56:00]</a>.
*   **Metrics (All Looking Really Good)**:
    *   Sales Conversion (first call to close): Better than 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:00">[07:06:00]</a>.
    *   Magic Number: Greater than 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>.
    *   CAC Payback: Less than 12 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:00">[07:12:12]</a>.
    *   Gross Margin: Above 80% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:15:00">[07:15:00]</a>.
    *   Burn Multiple: Ideally less than 1x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18:00">[07:18:00]</a>.
    *   Churn: Less than 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:00">[07:22:00]</a>.
    *   NRR: Greater than 120% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:00">[07:23:00]</a>.
*   **Examples of Expanding TAM**:
    *   **Vanta**: Expanded from SOC 2 to Vanta Trust Management Platform, security questionnaires, and vendor risk management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:59:00">[07:59:00]</a>.
    *   **Verkada**: Started with cloud security cameras, then added alarms, smoke detectors, and badge readers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a>.
    *   **Stripe**: Beyond classic payments, developed Stripe Radar, Stripe Atlas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18:00">[08:18:00]</a>.
    *   **Square**: Added Square Stand, Cash App, Square Checking, Square Loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:00">[08:23:00]</a>.
*   **Insight**: Reaching Level 4 on one product doesn't guarantee PMF for new products. It requires finding [[Product Market Fit Strategy | product market fit]] "over and over again" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:00">[08:44:00]</a>. Customer expectations also continuously rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:24:00">[09:24:00]</a>.

## Typical Timelines & Progression

*   The entire journey to Level 4 ideally takes **4 to 6 years** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:11:00">[10:11:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:14:00">[10:14:00]</a>.
*   **Level 1**: Ideally, spend **12 to 18 months** here. This is crucial for choosing the right Persona and Problem, as this choice fundamentally shapes the company's future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:23:00">[10:23:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:30:00">[10:30:00]</a>.
*   **Level 2**: Moving from 5 to 25 customers should happen **quickly**, ideally around **one year** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:29:00">[10:29:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:49:00">[10:49:00]</a>.
*   **Level 3**: Scaling from $5M to $25M ARR might take **one to two years**, even in a good scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:36:00">[10:36:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:43:00">[10:43:00]</a>.
*   **Level 4**: Getting from $25M to $100M ARR and beyond also takes **a couple of years** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:47:00">[10:47:00]</a>.

The majority of companies (60-70%) get stuck at Level 1 or Level 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:36:00">[10:36:00]</a>. The goal of this framework is to increase the percentage of companies that make it to Level 3 or Level 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:17:00">[11:17:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:23:00">[11:23:00]</a>. If a company has been operating for four to five years and still isn't feeling market pull, it's a very difficult situation, and there's "no shame" in returning money to investors or seeking a soft landing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:20:00">[11:20:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:41:00">[11:41:00]</a>.

## The Four Ps: Levers for Change

The "4 Ps" are the key variables founders should focus on when they are stuck and need to pivot or adapt their strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:29:00">[12:29:00]</a>:
1.  **Persona**: Who are you targeting? Think of the market as a collection of people with specific problems and willingness to pay, rather than a broad macroeconomic category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:36:00">[12:36:00]</a>. Get deeply into the mind of the persona, understanding their challenges, goals, and how they succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:44:00">[12:44:00]</a>.
2.  **Problem**: What critical pain point are you solving for this persona? It must be an important and urgent issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.
3.  **Promise**: How are you pitching your solution? This is about positioning and how you describe the value the product delivers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:25:00">[12:25:00]</a>.
4.  **Product**: What are you building or delivering? The product's job is to satisfy the Persona's Problem by delivering on the Promise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:26:00">[12:26:00]</a>.

Founders can change any combination of these Ps. For example, Lattis changed Problem and Promise while keeping Persona, and Vanta changed all four <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>. Plaid, for instance, kept elements of their product (connecting to bank accounts) but changed their Persona, Problem, and Promise from a consumer budgeting app to an API for developers at fintech companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>.

The order of change often involves focusing on Persona, Problem, and Promise first, as they are easier to iterate on than rebuilding the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>. It's often easier to put a new spin on an existing category (like Ironclad did) than to create a completely new one, as customers are already looking to spend money in existing categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>.

## Customer Discovery Methods: Dollar-Driven Discovery

To effectively understand the Problem and Promise, First Round emphasizes "dollar-driven customer discovery" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>. This goes beyond casual chats, aiming to test the potential for customers to pay money for a solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>.

Key aspects of effective [[Developing customer discovery methods for productmarket fit | customer discovery methods]] include:
*   **Identifying Extreme Value**: Ask non-leading questions about their top goals, challenges, and what stands in their way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>. Avoid "happy ears" – don't just listen for what confirms your existing ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>. Look for "wow" statements (e.g., "If that thing works, I'd sign up for the waitlist today!") or demonstrated interest (e.g., "Can we meet again next week? Can you send me the deck?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>.
*   **Confirming Ability to Pay**:
    *   Are they currently looking for or building a solution internally for this problem? The best customers are those who know they have a problem, are actively looking for a solution, or have tried and failed to build one themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>.
    *   Where would a budget for this come from? The best answer is an existing budget (e.g., from a competing tool or internal development) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>.
    *   How does their team make decisions on third-party tools? Look for a known, albeit potentially complex, decision-making process, not ambiguity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>.
*   **Quantifying Willingness to Pay (using the Simon-Kucher method)**:
    *   "What is a fair price you would pay for this thing?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>
    *   "What would be an expensive price?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a> (This is often the price they would actually pay if the product is good)
    *   "What would be a prohibitively expensive price?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>
*   **When to Stop**: When you can predict 70-80% of what the next person will say because you've heard the patterns so clearly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>.

Founders need to determine the right level of product fidelity (mockup, demo, or manual service) required to land the sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>.

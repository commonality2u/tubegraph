Yuki Yamashita, Chief Product Officer at Figma, discusses various aspects of product management at the company, including its philosophy, how they build high-quality software, their approach to goal setting, and how they hire product managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:39">[01:34:39]</a>.

## Product Management Philosophy: Owning the "Why"

At Figma, product managers (PMs) are uniquely responsible for owning the "why" behind a product or idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>. This philosophy developed from Yuki's experience at YouTube, where he realized that with a large team, PMs cannot specify every detail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:26">[02:24:26]</a>. By understanding the "why" — the problem being solved — designers and engineers can make great decisions independently, which is essential for scaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:04">[02:04:04]</a>.

The concept of "five whys" used in engineering retro/postmortems is extended to product management:
*   A customer asks for a feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>.
*   Ask: Why are they asking for it? (backing out the problem) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>.
*   Ask: Why do they have that problem in the first place? (identifying underlying conditions for bigger [[Impact in product management | impact]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>.

## Customer Proximity and Feedback

Figma has an obsession with proximity to customers, rooted in its origin story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>. Co-founder Dylan Field consistently put the product in front of designers for feedback, implementing it and making them evangelists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. This deep connection with the community has shaped the product to date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>.

Figma actively solicits feedback:
*   Teams tweet out ideas or focus areas to the community, gathering passionate responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>.
*   Dylan Field himself reads the most customer feedback, even noticing tweets with zero likes that might signal a deeper issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.
*   A "concerning tweets" private Slack channel exists to filter these insights and prevent immediate overreaction from the wider team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.

Balancing vocal minority feedback with actual usage data is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>. Different input sources (support tickets, sales conversations, user studies) provide a balanced portfolio of feedback, preventing blind spots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>.

## Building High-Quality Software

Figma is known for building beloved, high-quality software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>. A key factor is getting the entire company to use its own products (dogfooding) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>.
*   Figma transitioned from a memo culture to a deck culture, encouraging teams to build presentations in Figma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>.
*   Internal processes like performance reviews use FigJam templates, driving internal adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.
*   Increased internal usage naturally improves the product as employees fix issues to better their own workflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.

Personal accountability also drives quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>. When engineers or designers personally experience a problem with the product, they feel compelled to fix it, leading to faster progress and more creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>. Figma encourages bottom-up energy, allowing developers to fix issues they notice, as their self-advocated fixes are often completed in half the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>.

## Challenges with OKRs and Goal Setting

Figma has experimented with different approaches to Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>. Yuki describes a "love-hate relationship" with OKRs, especially when working on core experiences where impact can be hard to quantify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>. Common pitfalls include:
*   Creating secondary metrics that are measurable but don't prove real business value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>.
*   Setting ambitious business goals that are hard to control or prove direct impact on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>.

Initially, Figma's OKRs were treated like a to-do list, and review meetings were "dreadful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>. To address this, Yuki deprecated traditional OKRs, asking teams to focus on their "headline" — the philosophical aim — rather than stressing about immediate measurability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>. This allowed for qualitative and evolving metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>.

While a data science team brought back more rigor to OKRs, the challenge shifted to ensuring teams were truly *committed* to moving those OKRs, not just post-rationalizing projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>. Many couldn't articulate their team's OKRs on a daily basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>.

Yuki's philosophy for good goals (regardless of the name) includes three characteristics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:00">[04:38:00]</a>:
1.  **Legendary**: Easy to understand and not an "obfuscated metric" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>.
2.  **Actionability**: Inspires different actions or behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>.
3.  **Authenticity**: Honestly depicts what the team is doing or trying to do daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>.

## Hiring Product Managers

Figma looks for several key attributes in product managers:

*   [[Storytelling and drawing in product management | Storytelling]] and communication skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>. Yuki often asks candidates to describe a controversial product decision, looking for their ability to set up conflict, represent both sides, and compel action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>. He also looks for the ability to make any problem, no matter how "boring," seem exciting and worth working on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>.
*   "High-bandwidth UX conversations": The ability to quickly navigate through different solutions and altitudes of thinking, leading to progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:00">[05:14:00]</a>.
*   "Fast-forwarding to the future": The ability to imagine outcomes of experiments or user studies to make efficient decisions and know when *not* to build something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:00">[05:09:00]</a>.

## [[Figmas approach to productled growth and community building | Product-Led Growth]] and Community

Figma is a prime example of [[Figmas approach to productled growth and community building | product-led growth]], which Yuki prefers to call "community-led growth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>. The focus is on empowering individuals within companies who are passionate about Figma to become advocates and evangelists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>. Sales teams help create human connections and equip these internal champions with data and stories to make their case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>.

Early success for Figma stemmed from intentional community building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>. Sharing Figma files openly, allowing others to see "how we do it at XYZ company," fostered immense interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>. Programs like "Friends of Figma" foster human connections and loyalty, fueling champions to advocate internally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>.

The core idea for founders pursuing [[Figmas approach to productled growth and community building | product-led growth]] is to cultivate an "irrational emotional response" or love for the product, both internally and externally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>. This includes providing a unique tool and a philosophy around a different way of working. Figma's controversial idea of multiple designers in one file simultaneously, initially met with resistance ("If this is a feature of design I'm quitting"), became a signal of a revolution and a new way of working that users could champion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>.

## Lessons Learned: What Didn't Work Out

Not everything at Figma is a success story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>. Experiments don't always yield winning results, and complex features can take time to gain traction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>.

One example is "branching and merging" in the design system space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>. While requested by customers, its initial adoption was low due to performance issues and being a "foreign workflow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>. This highlighted a [[Challenges in Product Organizations | challenge]] as Figma grows: building features for organizations unlike their own, which means their strong culture of internal testing (dogfooding) is less effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>. They need to develop new muscles to understand the effectiveness of these features for external customer types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>.

## Product Management as a "Work in Progress"

Yuki emphasizes that Figma, and product management in general, is a "work in progress" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>. Processes, strategies, and the way product teams operate are constantly evolving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:24">[01:02:24]</a>. There is always more to learn from others about age-old problems like goal setting, work review, and planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:48">[01:02:48]</a>. This mindset encourages continuous experimentation and improvement rather than assuming perfected solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:24">[01:02:24]</a>.

Uri Levine, co-founder of Waze and other companies, emphasizes that the biggest lesson from his career is to "fall in love with the problem, not the solution" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:03">[02:55:03]</a>. This core principle underpins the importance of understanding and analyzing user behavior to create value and achieve success. The entrepreneurship journey is fundamentally about value creation, and the simplest way to do this is to solve a problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:04">[03:30:04]</a>.

## Focusing on the Problem, Not the Solution

Instead of starting with "what we are doing," entrepreneurs should focus on "why you are doing that" —the problem being solved or the value being created for the user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:00">[06:09:00]</a>. If a company's story begins by describing its system (e.g., "our AI system is"), it focuses on the solution. However, if it starts with "the problem we are solving is" or "the value that we create for you is," it focuses on the problem or the user, which are "way better" approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>.

Levine suggests starting with a big problem that is "worth solving" and would make the world a better place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>. Then, it's crucial to identify who has this problem. If only one person has the problem, it's not a basis for a startup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>. If many people share the problem, the next step is to "go and speak with those people and understand their perception of the problem" before building a solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:04">[05:33:04]</a>. This path guarantees value creation if the solution works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>.

> [!TIP] The Problem as a North Star
> When you "fall in love with the problem," it serves as the "north star of your journey," leading to fewer deviations and a higher likelihood of success. The story you tell also becomes "way more compelling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>. For example, instead of saying Waze would build "an AI crowdsourced-based navigation system," stating "I'm going to help you to avoid traffic jams" instantly creates user care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>. When customers care, they want the company to be successful and will help it achieve success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>.

## Methods for Understanding Users

To understand if a problem is big enough, Levine advises speaking with around 20 people you don't know, rather than just close friends and family, to validate if the problem is real <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:31:00">[09:31:00]</a>.

Key methods include:
*   **Observing Users**: Simply "watch users and see what they're doing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:23">[01:07:23]</a>. People often use products in unexpected ways, and acknowledging these different use cases is crucial for product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:49">[01:05:49]</a>. Not understanding that users may not be like the product builder can lead to significant mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:12">[01:07:12]</a>.
*   **Asking "Why"**: If users are not behaving as expected, ask them "why" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:29">[01:07:29]</a>. This "why" is what makes a product successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:13">[01:13:13]</a>.
*   **Speaking with Unsuccessful Users**: It's common to speak with successful users at the bottom of the funnel, but to improve, it's essential to "speak with those that fail" — users who downloaded but didn't register, or registered but didn't use, or used but didn't return. They possess critical knowledge for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:48">[01:12:48]</a>.

## User Adoption Stages and Simplicity

Users can be grouped by their ability to adapt to new behaviors (not just new technology) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:51">[01:07:51]</a>:
*   **Innovators (2%)**: Use new things simply because they are new and care about the subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:16">[01:08:16]</a>.
*   **Early Adopters**: Give a new product a try as soon as they realize there is value in it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:37">[01:08:37]</a>.
*   **Early Majority (approx. 1/3 of population)**: This is where market leaders emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:58">[01:08:58]</a>. This group is "afraid of change" and operates with a "don't rock the boat" mentality, believing their current methods are "good enough" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:10">[01:09:10]</a>. They fear complexity and embarrassment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:39">[01:09:39]</a>.

To win the early majority, the solution is always **simplicity** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:03">[01:10:03]</a>. While building a product involves adding features through iterations, it's crucial to remove features that users are not utilizing, as they add "complexity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:22">[01:10:22]</a>. Product owners, often innovators or early adopters themselves, must observe and ask the early majority to understand their barriers to adoption, as they cannot inherently understand this group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:40">[01:10:40]</a>.

## Key Metrics and Product-Market Fit

Ultimately, the key metric for [[Product-Market Fit]] is **retention** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>. If users find value, they will return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:06">[00:21:06]</a>. If they don't return, it means value is not being created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>.

An example from Waze demonstrates iterative development based on user feedback. After making Waze global in late 2009, it "was not good enough" in most places except for a few countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>. They spoke with churned drivers, asked what didn't work, and built new versions addressing their feedback. This process involved "iteration after iteration after iteration" for over a year until it started working in early 2011 in various metropolitan areas and countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:58">[00:23:58]</a>.

[[Integrating UX research into product development cycles]] and [[Incorporating user feedback into product development]] were critical for Waze. The company learned that users' primary concern was not just avoiding traffic, but achieving **certainty** about arrival times, which was a "way higher value" than just saving time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:50">[00:28:50]</a>. This [[Leveraging User Insights for Product Development | insight]] came directly from speaking with users in the U.S. market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:03">[00:29:03]</a>.

This highlights the [[Importance of Customer and User Research]] and [[Improving user experience through customer feedback]]. Understanding these nuances helps in [[Balancing user research with business goals]] and adapting the product for broader adoption.

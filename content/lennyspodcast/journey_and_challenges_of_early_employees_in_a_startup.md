Roz Herberg, the Chief Marketing Officer and VP of Product Strategy at Wiz, joined the company as one of its first 10 employees and its first product manager [00:00:00]. Wiz is renowned as the fastest-growing software company in history, hitting $100 million ARR just 18 months after its founding [00:01:37]. Despite this rapid growth, the journey for early employees, including Roz, involved significant [[navigating_the_phases_of_a_startup_journey | challenges]] and pivots.

## Initial Uncertainty and the Search for Product-Market Fit

When Roz joined Wiz (then officially named Beyond Networks) in March 2020, at the onset of the global pandemic, the founders did not yet have a clear idea for their product [00:00:05], [00:07:33], [00:08:10]. The initial concept focused on network security, despite the team's background in cloud security [00:07:50], [00:07:52].

The early days involved a high volume of potential customer meetings—10 to 15 calls every day, primarily with CISOs (Chief Information Security Officers) [00:00:16], [00:08:26], [00:08:31]. During these meetings, the team would present their idea, often receiving polite but unenthusiastic responses like "Oh, sounds interesting" or "would love to hear more" [00:09:16], [00:09:20].

### The Product Manager's Dilemma
As the first product manager, Roz sat in on these calls, officially participating or just listening [00:09:32], [00:09:40]. After several weeks, she realized she still did not understand what they were supposed to build, which was confusing given her role was to initiate development [00:00:26], [00:09:49]. She found it difficult to admit her confusion, fearing she was the only one who didn't understand [00:10:07], [00:15:32].

> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a> "I was sure that I was the only one not understanding... it's hard to get the courage to say actually I don't understand."

Roz's eventual decision to ask, "what exactly are we doing here?" led to a pivotal five-hour discussion among the founders [00:00:31], [00:10:24], [00:18:06]. This moment highlighted a common [[challenges_of_earlystage_sales_for_startups | startup challenge]]: the bias to seek affirmation rather than critical feedback from potential customers, who are often incentivized to be polite rather than deeply analytical [00:00:51], [00:11:18], [00:13:51].

## The Pivot and Signs of True Product-Market Fit

The deep discussion prompted a [[navigating_the_phases_of_a_startup_journey | pivot]] back to cloud security, a domain the founding team knew best [00:00:37], [00:11:28], [00:18:21]. This shift immediately changed the nature of customer conversations [00:18:47]. Instead of generic interest, customers began asking pointed questions:

*   "How are you pricing this?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>
*   "When can we start doing a PO (Purchase Order)?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>
*   "I know exactly who I need to connect you to in my team." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>

These signals demonstrated "deep enthusiasm" and a customer "pull," indicating a genuine need for the product [00:11:24], [00:13:51], [00:20:57]. An example illustrating this was a Fortune 10 company quickly completing a long list of technical questions for a Proof of Value (POV), demonstrating their strong commitment even though Wiz's product was still in its early stages [00:19:21], [00:20:01].

## Learning by Doing: Early Sales and Shifting Focus

Wiz's rapid success meant the company was "always being behind" in terms of organizational structure [00:21:38]. The founding team, including Roz, found themselves personally closing deals and handling contracts, even without a dedicated sales team [00:21:41], [00:21:51]. This "accidental" direct engagement with sales proved to be an invaluable [[challenges_of_earlystage_sales_for_startups | learning experience]], providing deep insights before hiring specialized sales personnel [00:22:17], [00:22:21].

Roz emphasizes that if the core team cannot "do it one time end to end," bringing in an outside hire to solve that problem is often "wishful" [00:22:52], [00:23:01]. The experience gained by the founders directly engaging in sales instilled confidence in their first sales hires [00:22:08].

As the company grew, Roz observed a shift in the "heat" (or critical focus) within the organization:
*   **Product Kitchen**: Early days, everybody waits for a product [00:28:24].
*   **Engineering**: Once the idea solidified, the focus shifted to building the product [00:28:38].
*   **Sales**: After initial deals were closed, the heat moved to selling the product [00:28:51].
*   **Marketing**: At scale, with product-market fit and a functional sales team, the need for awareness and pipeline generation shifts the focus to marketing [00:28:58]. Roz's [[transitioning_from_large_companies_to_startups | transition]] from product to CMO was a direct response to this organizational need [00:24:55], [00:29:08].

## Embracing Vulnerability and the Culture of "I Don't Understand"

Roz's personal [[resilience_and_perseverance_in_startups | journey]] highlights the importance of embracing vulnerability and being comfortable with failure. She attributes her willingness to attempt tasks despite being "pretty sure I'm going to fail" to her upbringing, where her mother encouraged pushing past areas of weakness rather than perfecting existing strengths [00:41:19], [00:42:53].

> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:50">[00:40:50]</a> "I'm kind of okay with being pretty sure I'm going to fail at something and still attempting it."
> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:44">[00:43:44]</a> "Friction is kind of good."

Wiz's [[building_a_startup_culture | culture]], fostered by its founders, is characterized by a flat organization where seniority is less important than driving impact [00:16:22], [00:52:23]. This environment encourages employees to voice concerns, even if it means admitting they don't understand something [00:16:09], [00:52:51]. This openness and trust lead to greater [[onboarding_and_decisionmaking_at_startups | loyalty]] and allows employees to have significant influence regardless of their title [00:53:11], [00:53:28].

Roz also shares a contrarian perspective on imposter syndrome: rather than trying to build confidence to overcome it, she suggests embracing the feeling and not letting it prevent action [00:54:36], [00:55:15]. Taking on a new role often means you *are* an imposter, and that's a normal part of growth [00:55:25].

## The Role of Marketing and [[the_role_of_storytelling_and_movements_in_startup_success | Brand Storytelling]]

Roz's transition to marketing revealed a critical insight: unlike product development, where "less is more" and mistakes are costly due to engineering time and product complexity, marketing allows for extensive experimentation with little risk [00:36:56], [00:37:42].

> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:42">[00:37:42]</a> "Marketing is quite the opposite... There's no cost to anything, no maintenance, no technical debt."

To address Wiz's lack of awareness, Roz decided to "make a lot of noise" and take chances [00:33:06], [00:38:09]. A notable example was at RSA, a major security conference, where she replaced a traditional cyber booth with a "Wiz of Oz" themed booth complete with actors and a bright, optimistic brand aesthetic (pink, bright blue) [00:38:49], [00:39:13], [00:39:23]. This unconventional approach led to five times more visitors than the previous year, demonstrating the power of standing out [00:40:06]. This bold move even inspired other cybersecurity companies to adopt themed booths later [00:40:22].

From a marketing perspective, Roz realized the importance of clear, unambiguous communication. While product teams might work with "fluffy or blurry" concepts, messages must be "Crystal Clear, black and white" for effective scaling and to avoid being lost in translation for broader audiences or sales teams [00:46:04], [00:46:27], [00:47:21]. She refers to this as the "dummy explanation" — ensuring that all external communications are understandable by anyone, without assuming prior knowledge of Wiz or deep technical market specifics [00:48:42], [00:49:12], [00:49:50]. This constant awareness of being in a "bubble" (the company's internal understanding) versus the broader market's perception is a daily reminder for her team [00:50:17], [00:50:47].

## Long-Term Vision and Growth

The unique relationship among Wiz's four co-founders, who have worked together for over 20 years across multiple ventures, creates a foundation of "complete trust" and clear domains for decision-making, enabling incredibly fast decision execution [00:51:40], [00:52:00], [00:52:11], [00:52:23]. This environment, coupled with Wiz's focus on the rapidly growing cloud security market, underpins their collective decision to remain an independent company despite significant acquisition offers, aiming to become one of the biggest security companies in the world [01:01:00]. Wiz currently employs around 1,500 people [00:53:38], continuing to hire across all domains [00:56:20].

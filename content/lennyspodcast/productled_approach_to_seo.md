From: [[lennyspodcast]] <br/> 

The rise of [[impact_of_ai_on_seo | AI]] answers integrated into search results marks a significant shift in how SEO works, moving away from a traditional content-focused approach to one that prioritizes user experience and product integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This new paradigm necessitates thinking of SEO as a product, with product managers playing a crucial role in its strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Eli Schwarz, a growth adviser specializing in SEO and author of *Product-Led SEO*, emphasizes that successful SEO is not a "dark art" but a simple, product-driven discipline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## The Changing Landscape of Search

Google and other tech companies were compelled to integrate [[impact_of_ai_on_seo | AI]] answers into search results, largely due to the emergence of ChatGPT in late 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. This development, offering written answers to queries, sparked concerns that users might no longer need to click on search results or even engage in SEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. Google responded by launching "Search Generative Experience" (SGE), later renamed "AI Overviews," which provides chatbot-like answers directly in search results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

This change pushes traditional search results down the page, meaning users may get their answers without clicking links, making content less relevant if it's purely informational <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. The shift is from Google presenting a list of links to providing a direct answer, particularly for top-of-funnel queries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:38">[00:22:38]</a>.

### Top-of-Funnel vs. Mid/Bottom-Funnel Searches

Historically, SEO focused on ranking for broad, top-of-funnel keywords like "cars" or "best beach vacation," often leading users to generic, long-form content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. With [[impact_of_ai_on_seo | AI]] overviews, these broad queries are increasingly answered directly by the search engine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>.

For example, asking for "top podcast tools" might now yield an [[impact_of_ai_on_seo | AI]]-generated summary of options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:46">[00:20:46]</a>. This means content sites like G2 or Capterra that list and compare software are being significantly disrupted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:54">[00:20:54]</a>.

The opportunity for SEO now lies in the mid-to-bottom funnel, where users have more specific intent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>. Once a user gets an initial answer (e.g., "Cancun is a good beach destination") they then move to more specific searches (e.g., "Cancun hotel prices," "best resorts in Cancun") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. These are the queries where SEO can drive conversions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:06">[00:22:06]</a>. The user journey becomes:
1.  **Discovery (Top-Funnel):** Handled by [[impact_of_ai_on_seo | LLMs]] providing direct answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>.
2.  **Specific Intent (Mid/Bottom-Funnel):** Where users return to Google for deeper searches, often looking to take an action or make a purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>. This is where [[productled_growth_strategy | product-led growth]] and SEO intersect.

## Why Many B2B SaaS Companies Shouldn't Do SEO

Many B2B SaaS companies misallocate resources to SEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:02">[00:24:02]</a>. Often, marketers are expected to make a product fit search results, but the product isn't designed for a search-driven discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:11">[00:24:11]</a>.

A key indicator of whether SEO is a good fit is if users are actively searching for the problem your product solves, and if the purchase journey can happen online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>. For products that require extensive sales processes, committee decisions, or large investments (like Mixpanel or Google Cloud), SEO is often not the most effective channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:16">[00:36:16]</a>. These products often have a "brand challenge" – educating users about a problem they didn't know they had – which isn't typically solved by SEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:56">[00:36:56]</a>.

> "If you can't answer the question about what is it that someone's going to do a search on, then don't do SEO" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:07">[00:33:07]</a>

## How to Succeed with a Product-Led SEO Approach

A [[strategies_for_success_in_seo_with_ai_prevalence | product-led SEO strategy]] involves three key steps:

1.  **Be the User:** Understand your user deeply and identify the specific problem they are searching for that your product can solve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:58">[00:31:58]</a>. This means thinking about the customer empathy challenge, not just a work challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:36">[00:32:36]</a>.
2.  **Decide What Asset to Create:** Once you understand the user's need, determine what kind of content or product asset will best serve them in their mid-to-bottom funnel journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:34">[00:33:34]</a>. This often involves thinking about [[programmatic_versus_editorial_seo | programmatic vs editorial SEO]] approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:55">[00:33:55]</a>.
3.  **Envision and Build the Product:** This step requires collaboration between product, design, and engineering teams. SEO is no longer just about optimizing content; it's about building a product experience for the search user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:10">[00:34:10]</a>.

### Examples of Product-Led SEO in Action

*   **Zapier:** Realized users searched for specific app integrations (e.g., "Gmail and Salesforce"), not for Zapier itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:47">[00:26:47]</a>. They programmatically built pages for every possible app integration, solving a specific user problem and driving discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:06">[00:27:06]</a>.
*   **Tinder:** Instead of focusing on generic "online dating" content, Tinder identified itself as a "loneliness solving solution" for users in new cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:51">[00:29:51]</a>. They created local pages (e.g., "online dating in Dubai") that offered solutions and led users to the app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:10">[00:30:10]</a>. This mid-funnel approach remains effective even with [[impact_of_ai_on_seo | AI]] overviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:13">[00:31:13]</a>.
*   **Quora:** Quadrupled traffic by showing answers directly on the page (instead of forcing logins) and creating a categorized HTML sitemap that allowed search engines to navigate and index all questions and answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>.
*   **SurveyMonkey:** Generated significant revenue from organic traffic by offering survey templates users specifically searched for, which then led to product sign-ups and paid conversions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:02">[00:40:02]</a>.
*   **Canva:** Successful with [[programmatic_vs_editorial_seo | programmatic SEO]] by creating templates that users directly search for and then monetize through upgrades and subscriptions within their product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:06">[00:56:06]</a>.

## The Role of AI in Content Creation

[[impact_of_ai_on_seo | AI]] is a tool, not a solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:49">[00:59:49]</a>. Using [[impact_of_ai_on_seo | AI]] to generate content that is inherently worthless (like generic blog posts just for the sake of having content) is a waste of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:23">[01:00:23]</a>.

However, [[impact_of_ai_on_seo | AI]] can be highly effective when used to create useful content more efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:45">[01:00:45]</a>. Examples include:
*   Generating product descriptions for e-commerce sites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:57">[01:00:57]</a>.
*   Summarizing multiple product reviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:10">[01:03:10]</a>.
*   Automating earnings reports summaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:34">[01:03:34]</a>.

Google's stance is that [[impact_of_ai_on_seo | AI]] content itself is not the problem; the key is the helpfulness and usefulness of the content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:27">[01:02:27]</a>.

## Measuring Success and Resource Allocation

[[effective_seo_resource_allocation | Deciding how much to invest in SEO]] requires careful evaluation. SEO is not free; it demands time, resources, and direct expenses for agencies, teams, CMS, and design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:30">[00:39:30]</a>.

Instead of defaulting to SEO, companies should compare the return on investment (ROI) against other marketing channels like brand ads or influencer campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:41">[00:41:41]</a>.

> "If you don't think it'll convert online, if you think sales is the core motion of the process, it's probably not a good ROI for you [for SEO]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:40">[00:43:40]</a>

The primary metric for SEO success should be tied to business goals, not just vanity metrics like rankings or traffic volume alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:41">[00:48:41]</a>. For a media company, page views might be a valid metric, but for a SaaS company, it should be marketing-qualified leads (MQLs) or actual conversions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:30">[00:49:30]</a>.

> "Traffic alone is not valuable if it doesn't convert" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:48">[00:57:48]</a>

### Forecasting SEO Upside

Instead of a "bottoms-up" forecast (relying on potentially inaccurate keyword research tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:23">[01:42:23]</a>), a "top-down" approach (similar to a Total Addressable Market (TAM) forecast) is more reliable for estimating SEO upside, especially when launching in new markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:49">[01:39:49]</a>. This involves:
1.  Starting with the total population of the target market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:58">[01:38:58]</a>.
2.  Segmenting by relevant demographics (e.g., gender, age) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:07">[01:39:07]</a>.
3.  Estimating the percentage of that segment that would engage with your product online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:37">[01:39:37]</a>.
4.  Multiplying by expected market penetration, average order value, and purchase frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:51">[01:39:51]</a>.

This method, though inexact, provides a better foundation for investment decisions than flawed keyword data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:06">[01:40:06]</a>.

## SEO Myths Debunked

*   **"Everyone needs to do SEO":** False. SEO is a strategic choice, not a default <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:45">[01:26:45]</a>.
*   **"Link building is the secret sauce":** False. Link building should be brand building; quality mentions from relevant sources matter more than buying low-authority links <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:58">[01:07:58]</a>.
*   **"Google is a black box":** False. While nuances exist, the basics of SEO are simple: build an understandable website, link appropriately, and create helpful content users want to read <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:04">[01:28:04]</a>.
*   **"Technical SEO solves all problems":** False. While crucial for large, complex sites, technical SEO is less impactful for smaller sites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:10">[01:35:10]</a>. Focusing on fixing problems that aren't negatively impacting user experience (like minute page speed improvements for non-competitive sites) is often a waste of resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:48">[01:35:48]</a>.
*   **"TikTok/Instagram are replacing search":** While Gen Z uses these platforms for top-of-funnel discovery (e.g., travel inspiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:56">[01:31:56]</a>), Google remains dominant for mid-funnel, action-oriented searches like booking hotels or flights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:13">[01:32:13]</a>.

## The Future of SEO and Google's Dominance

Based on analyses of the Google antitrust trial, Google's market share in mobile searches is approximately 98% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:55">[01:17:55]</a>. Their dominance is attributed not only to the quality of their search engine but also to their default distribution agreements with companies like Apple, and their brand recognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:29">[01:19:29]</a>. Competitors like Bing and Neva have struggled to gain significant market share despite offering quality alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:40">[01:40:40]</a>.

This implies that while [[impact_of_ai_on_seo | AI]] will continue to change search layouts and impact top-of-funnel queries, SEO is not dying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:06">[01:24:06]</a>. Users will always seek choices and information, and companies that provide useful solutions for specific user needs in the mid-to-bottom funnel will continue to benefit from search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:46">[01:24:46]</a>. The core concept of SEO remains: understanding the user's journey and positioning your product to solve their problems at the right moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:21">[01:30:21]</a>.

Building a successful sales team in a B2B SaaS environment requires a shift from traditional "selling" to a focus on problem-solving for customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Founders often make common [[mistakes_founders_make_in_building_sales_teams | mistakes]] when establishing sales teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. The core job of a SaaS sales representative is to be an expert in the product and market, helping customers understand why a solution is the best fit for their problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:53">[00:37:53]</a>.

## When to Build a Sales Team

For B2B businesses, needing a sales team is generally a matter of "when," not "if" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

*   **Founder-Led Sales:** Founders must close the first 10-15-20 customers themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. Even if a founder dislikes sales, customers typically enjoy speaking directly with the CEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. Founders are often "A+ middlers," excelling at the core conversation about the product and market, even if they struggle with initial outreach or closing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.
*   **Signs to Hire:** It's time to hire the first salesperson when more than 20% of a founder's time is booked with customer sales conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>. This indicates a need for leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>. Additionally, a repeatable sales process should be emerging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>.

## Hiring and Scaling a Sales Team

The [[hiring_and_scaling_a_sales_team | hiring and scaling a sales team]] process requires careful consideration, especially in the early stages.

*   **First Hires:**
    *   **Hire two salespeople, not one:** This allows for A/B testing of humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>.
    *   **"Would you buy your own product from them?"**: The most critical criterion for early reps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>. These individuals are often "quirky pirates and romantics" who love the product despite its early-stage limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>.
    *   **Experience and Maturity:** Early reps should have a couple of years of B2B sales experience and sufficient maturity to be trusted with leads and customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:15">[00:26:15]</a>.
    *   **Interview Process:** Founders should interview around 30 candidates to find the right fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>. A key test is "sell me this app" – candidates should demonstrate product knowledge gained from explainer videos or webinars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:48">[00:35:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:11">[00:36:11]</a>.
    *   **Product Expertise:** Early sales team members must be product gurus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:34">[00:31:34]</a>.
    *   **Prior Experience:** Ideal candidates previously sold a product that was *harder* to sell than yours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:02">[00:55:02]</a>. This means a more technical product, a more competitive space, or a more complicated business process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:04">[00:57:04]</a>.

*   **Hiring a VP of Sales:**
    *   **Timing:** A VP of Sales should only be hired *after* two sales representatives are consistently hitting their quota and closing deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>. Hiring too early (e.g., before product-market fit is found) has an "almost 100% chance of failure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>.
    *   **Role:** The VP of Sales' job is to scale the sales process from a few reps to hundreds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">[00:37:37]</a>.
    *   **Carrying a Bag:** In today's market, a VP of Sales should "carry a bag" (close sales themselves) or at least be deeply involved in deals 20-30 hours a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:29">[00:22:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:51">[00:26:51]</a>. If they only want to manage and not sell, it's a red flag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:02">[00:28:02]</a>.
    *   **Interview Question:** Ask what they plan to do in their first 14 days; a good answer involves meeting customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:31">[00:30:31]</a>. Avoid candidates who prioritize internal processes like Salesforce setup or territory planning over customer interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:39">[00:31:39]</a>.
    *   **"Stretch VP"**: For 95% of companies, the first head of sales should be a "stretch VP" – someone who was previously a director or senior director and is ready for career growth, willing to "do the job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:29">[01:02:29]</a>.

### Sales Compensation and Quota

*   **Paying Market Rate:** Companies must pay market rate for sales talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:34">[00:36:34]</a>. A typical structure is 50% base salary and 50% bonus (On-Target Earnings - OTE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:07">[00:47:07]</a>.
*   **Initial Ramp-Up:** For the first three months, reps can keep 100% of what they close, allowing them to gain momentum and "put supper on the stove" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:09">[00:46:09]</a>. This should ideally be for one quarter max <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:44">[00:53:44]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Profitability:** Ultimately, a sales rep should bring in 4-5 times what they take home in total compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:50">[00:47:50]</a>. If this ratio is met, the rep is accretive to the business, and founders should want them to make a lot of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:25">[00:49:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:21">[00:53:21]</a>.
*   **Avoid Over-Tweaking:** Once a compensation plan is effective, it shouldn't require constant adjustment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:31">[00:50:31]</a>. Too many tweaks can lead to a "leaky boat" that burns cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>.
*   **Fewer, Better Reps:** In early stages, it's better to have fewer, highly effective reps closing significant deals than many struggling ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:13">[00:51:13]</a>. Concentrate leads with the best closers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:51">[00:51:51]</a>.

### Sales Org Evolution

*   **Rules of Eight:** A common heuristic for scaling sales teams is that eight individual contributors (e.g., SDRs, AEs) require one manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:06">[01:00:06]</a>. This structure extends up the hierarchy (eight managers per director, etc.) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:49">[01:00:49]</a>.
*   **Specialization:** Sales organizations often specialize roles:
    *   **SDR (Sales Development Representative):** Typically an entry-level position focused on generating and screening leads through email and calls, passing them to Account Executives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:45">[01:04:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>.
    *   **AE (Account Executive):** More seasoned professionals focused on closing deals once leads are generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:15">[01:06:15]</a>.
*   **Management Progression:** The career path in sales is typically into management, as there isn't a widely established "super IC" (Individual Contributor) track <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:01">[01:09:01]</a>. However, not all top AEs make good managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:41">[01:09:41]</a>.

## Product and Sales Relationship

The relationship between sales and product teams is crucial for B2B success.

*   **Product Involvement in Sales:**
    *   The head of product (and potentially product managers/directors) should be deeply involved in sales, especially for large deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:28">[01:10:28]</a>. Their deep product knowledge and gravitas can help secure deals by making informed commitments about features and roadmap adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:42">[01:12:42]</a>.
    *   The CEO, Head of Product, and even VP of Engineering can act as "weapons" in critical sales meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:57">[01:11:57]</a>.
*   **Managing Sales Feature Requests:**
    *   Provide the Head of Sales with a fixed "budget" (e.g., 10% of story points) per quarter for features they prioritize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:40">[01:14:40]</a>. This forces internal prioritization within the sales team and prevents constant disruption of the product roadmap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:51">[01:14:51]</a>.
    *   Maintain regular, objective communication between product and sales leadership about this budget and roadmap commitments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:05">[01:16:05]</a>.
    *   Individual sales reps should not be empowered to commit to product changes directly with customers; these decisions should be escalated to management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:51">[01:17:51]</a>.

> "The stress between product and sales is a good thing... it's a sign of a well-run B2B company when there is stress between product and sales." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>

## Product-Led Growth (PLG) and Trials

While sales-led growth is often necessary, the approach to trials and contracts impacts long-term customer relationships and revenue compounding.

*   **Trial Length:** The choice of trial length (e.g., 14 days vs. infinite) often reflects sales' desire for quick conversions over customer benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:21">[01:31:21]</a>. Companies like Slack and Canva thrived with infinite trials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:01">[01:32:01]</a>.
*   **Annual Contracts:** Forcing SMB customers into annual contracts can be "terrible advice" because it ignores customer payment preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:51">[01:32:51]</a>. Product teams should champion the voice of the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:28">[01:33:28]</a>.
*   **"VP of Free"**: In models with a substantial free user base, there should be a dedicated role or focus on nurturing the long tail of non-converting users, as they are often advocates and contribute to the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:15">[01:36:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:26">[01:38:26]</a>.
*   **Customer Centricity:** Prioritizing revenue from existing customers (e.g., by forcing upsells or aggressive pricing) can destroy customer relationships and hinder long-term revenue compounding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:40">[01:21:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:28">[01:25:28]</a>. Price increases should be *earned* through significant added product value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:33">[01:35:33]</a>.

## General Advice for Founders and Product Leaders

*   **Becoming Better at Sales:** The most impactful action a founder or product leader can take is to consistently ask "what's the next step?" at the end of every meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:44">[01:27:44]</a>. This keeps deals moving forward, even if it's just scheduling another demo for a new stakeholder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>.

*   **Empathy and Kindness:** Be kind, especially when employees fail. It's often the company's fault for hiring or managing them incorrectly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:08">[01:47:08]</a>.
*   **Ship Great Products:** Product teams should focus on delivering genuinely great features and products, as this inspires the entire company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:10">[01:41:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:22">[01:41:22]</a>.
*   **Leverage Events:** Even small customer dinners or meetups can be valuable for sales, as customers will advocate for the product to prospects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:23">[01:52:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:48">[01:52:48]</a>.

Marily Nika, a Product Lead at Meta focusing on metaverse avatars and identity, and formerly at Google working on Google Glass, computer vision, and speech recognition, teaches a popular course on AI and product management. She shares insights on how product managers (PMs) can navigate and build a career in the evolving landscape of artificial intelligence (AI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Understanding the AI Product Management Landscape

### The "Shiny Object Trap"
Marily warns against the "shiny object trap," advising that AI should not be pursued merely for its own sake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Instead, PMs should first identify a problem or pain point that needs to be solved in a smart way. Only after defining the problem and a high-level solution should one consider how to implement it using AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

> "Don't do AI for the sake of doing AI. Make sure there is a problem there, make sure there is a pain point that needs to be solved in a smart way." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>

An [[role_of_product_managers_in_ai | AI product manager]] (AI PM) helps their team and company solve the *right problem*, rather than just building and shipping the right product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>.

### AI as the Default
Marily believes that in the future, all products will be AI by default, and consequently, all product managers will be [[the_future_of_product_management_in_the_ai_era | AI product managers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. This is driven by the increasing need for personalized experiences, good recommender systems (e.g., Netflix), and continuous automation improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.

### The Role of a Research Scientist
Becoming an [[impact_of_ai_on_product_management | AI PM]] means getting comfortable partnering with research scientists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. These individuals can produce smart models for automations, personalizations, and recommendations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. This collaboration requires PMs to embrace uncertainty, as research involves experimentation where outcomes might not be immediately successful, potentially leading to projects being shut down if they don't work out after a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

## Developing Skills for [[how_to_become_an_ai_product_manager | AI Product Managers]]

### Embrace Uncertainty and Research
A key skill for an [[how_to_become_an_ai_product_manager | AI PM]] is to become comfortable with the inherent uncertainty of research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. Unlike traditional product development with predictable launches, AI research often involves trying things out that may not yield immediate or expected results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. PMs must understand that research might not always yield optimal results aligned with initial hypotheses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:43">[00:29:43]</a>.

### Learning to Code and No-Code Tools
PMs should not be intimidated by technology or feel overwhelmed if they lack a technical background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>. While PMs won't typically need to code or train models, understanding the fundamentals is beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

[!TIP]
Learning to code, even the basics, can provide a different mindset and confidence, helping PMs understand how AI tools are created and how they work, rather than blindly trusting them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:21">[00:24:21]</a>.

Resources for learning to code:
*   **Coursera:** Offers courses like "Introduction to AI by Stanford" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:37">[00:26:37]</a>.
*   **Career Foundry:** An online coding school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:06">[00:27:06]</a>.
*   **General Assembly** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:10">[00:27:10]</a>
*   **Coding Dojo:** Offers Python training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:13">[00:27:13]</a>.

There are also no-code approaches for training models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.

### Leveraging Data
Any product can be improved with AI, especially where data exists about user behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>. This could involve making a product more secure, personalized, ethical, or providing better recommendations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. A crucial first step is to collect data and build dashboards if they don't already exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>.

> "Basically anything where you can get data behind the behavior [of] users can be improved with AI." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>

## Practical Applications of AI Tools for PMs

Marily uses current AI tools in her daily workflow:

### ChatGPT for Mission Statements and User Segments
Marily utilizes ChatGPT to refine mission statements and generate user segments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.
*   **Mission Statements:** ChatGPT can rewrite mission statements to be more omni-orient and universally understandable, even by a child, ensuring they inspire all disciplines and stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.
*   **User Segments:** It can create fantastic user segments, thinking of motivations and pain points that a human mind might not consider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. For example, asking "Who would be interested in a fitness band that doesn't have a screen?" can yield a bulleted list of potential users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.

### AutoML for Model Training
For those wanting to build their own models without extensive coding knowledge, tools like AutoML from Google Cloud allow users to train high-quality custom machine learning models with minimal effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:18">[00:39:18]</a>. An example is a company using drones to photograph wind turbines, uploading the images to AutoML to identify which turbines needed maintenance, reducing inspection time from weeks to hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:45">[00:39:45]</a>.

## Challenges in AI Product Management

[[challenges_and_advantages_of_ai_in_product_management | AI product management]] comes with specific challenges:
1.  **Uncertainty and Managing Expectations:** Research often involves hypotheses that may not be confirmed by model training results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:41">[00:29:41]</a>. The PM must encourage and guide the team through this uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>.
2.  **Changing Direction:** PMs must be prepared to change direction based on research outcomes, and managing this from a leadership perspective can be tricky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:11">[00:30:11]</a>.
3.  **Data Collection Difficulties:** Acquiring good, meaningful data for training models is hard and often requires creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:23">[00:30:23]</a>. The amount of data needed varies greatly; simple classification (cat or dog) might only need 15-20 labeled photos, while complex Natural Language Processing (NLP) or voice recognition needs thousands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>. Startups often lack sufficient data to build their own sophisticated models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>.
4.  **Career Trajectory in Research-Heavy Roles:** Unlike traditional PM roles where launches often dictate progress, AI PMs in research might not launch as often <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:45">[00:30:45]</a>. It's important to clarify how progress will be assessed with hiring managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:54">[00:30:54]</a>.

## Seeking Investment for AI Initiatives

To secure buy-in for AI/Machine Learning (ML) investments, especially for initiatives that may take six months to a year to yield results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:37">[00:31:37]</a>:

*   **Leverage Adjacent Product Successes:** Use examples of successful, AI-first products already launched by the company or in adjacent spaces as inspiration and to de-risk proposals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:10">[00:32:10]</a>.
*   **De-risking with Rollback Plans:** Propose a clear rollback plan and highlight the maximum negative impact, demonstrating that even if it fails, the consequences are manageable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:42">[00:32:42]</a>.
*   **Importance of Academic and Research Blogs:** Stay updated by following academic papers and research blogs (e.g., arXiv) where new technologies are often first discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:38">[00:33:38]</a>. The gap between academic research and productionized products is closing, and PMs are crucial in bridging this gap and monetizing research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:04">[00:34:04]</a>.

[!CAUTION]
Avoid using AI for Minimum Viable Products (MVPs). Instead, fake it with prototypes (e.g., Figma) to get initial buy-in, as training models for an MVP is a waste of time and resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>. AI should be used when there's already some data, or data from an adjacent product, that can be leveraged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>.

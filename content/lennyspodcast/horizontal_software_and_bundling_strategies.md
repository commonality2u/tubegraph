Notion, co-founded by Ivan Zhao, has evolved into one of the world's most popular and beloved products, largely due to its approach to building horizontal software and its strategic use of bundling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:54">[00:51:54]</a>.

## The "Lost Years" and Product Evolution

The first three to four years of Notion's development, starting in 2013, are described as "the Lost Years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. Initially, the vision was to create a developer tool so easy that "everybody can make and create their software" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. However, after a couple of years, the team realized that most people "just don't care" about creating software to optimize their work; they simply need to get their jobs done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>.

This led to a crucial realization: Notion needed to "hide" its vision of enabling everyone to create software within a form factor people already cared about, which was productivity software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>.

### The "Sugar and Broccoli" Analogy

Ivan Zhao uses the analogy of "sugar and broccoli" to explain this strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>:
> "We call the sugar called the broccoli. People don't want to eat the broccoli, but people like sugar. So give them the sugar that hides your broccoli inside of it." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>

Notion's "broccoli" is its underlying "no-code developer power," allowing users to create almost any kind of productivity software within Notion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. The "sugar" is its presentation as a productivity suite (documents, notes, project management, CRM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.

## Building a Horizontal Platform: "Lego for Software"

The core vision for Notion has always been to build a "Lego for software" – a meta-tool that allows people to create other tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:38">[00:31:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:04">[00:52:04]</a>. This horizontal approach means it's designed to be adaptable for many use cases rather than a single vertical solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:48">[00:53:48]</a>.

### Challenges and Advantages of Horizontal Products

Building a horizontal platform is notoriously difficult and often takes a long time to find product-market fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:21">[00:51:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:32">[00:51:32]</a>.
*   **Problem Space:** The problem space is "too large" to have a single best practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:36">[00:56:36]</a>.
*   **Mindset Shift:** As companies grow and move upmarket (e.g., B2B), they need to shift from a "Lego brick" mindset (focusing on core modular components) to a "Lego box" or "solutions" mindset (pre-packaged solutions for specific customer needs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:59">[00:52:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:08">[00:53:08]</a>. This requires balancing building core bricks with offering clear solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:12">[00:54:12]</a>.
*   **No Market Wall:** Unlike vertical software, which has defined market constraints, horizontal platforms have no inherent market "wall," requiring the company to define its own go-to-market and positioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:50">[00:53:50]</a>.

Despite these challenges, horizontal products like Notion offer significant advantages:
*   **Versatility:** Notion can address multiple use cases in one place (e.g., project management, docs, CRM), especially for smaller companies or startups whose needs for each vertical aren't overly complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:15">[00:55:15]</a>.
*   **Cost Savings:** Bundling multiple functionalities can save costs for users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:41">[00:55:41]</a>.

### B2C2B Growth Strategy

Notion's initial horizontal success came from stumbling upon document notes as a core use case, which provided a massive top-of-funnel opportunity with over a billion daily users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:52">[00:56:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:56">[00:56:56]</a>. This enabled a "B2C2B" internal strategy:
*   Consumers and personal users leverage Notion for simple tasks like note-taking or document sharing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:03">[00:57:03]</a>.
*   They then discover Notion's advanced features like relational databases and task management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:16">[00:57:16]</a>.
*   Half of Notion's B2B customers originate from these personal users who then introduce Notion into their workplaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:23">[00:57:23]</a>.
This strategy continues to drive product development, leading to new horizontal features like a calendar product (another billion-user category) and an upcoming email product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:49">[00:57:49]</a>.

## The Bundling and Unbundling Cycle

Ivan Zhao highlights a historical pattern in the software market:
> "Empires long united must divide, long divided must unite. As has always been bundling unbundling." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:10">[01:01:10]</a>
*   **Early PC Era (1980s):** Initial unbundling with many standalone applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:42">[01:01:42]</a>.
*   **Microsoft (1990s):** Bundled everything back into integrated suites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>.
*   **SaaS Era:** A new phase of unbundling, leading to companies using nearly 100 different vertical tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:05">[01:02:05]</a>.
*   **Current Trend:** The market is now shifting towards a bundling approach again, with more value being created through integrated solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:20">[01:02:20]</a>.

## AI's Impact on Horizontal Tools

The advent of AI, particularly large language models (LLMs), is seen as a "gift" that fundamentally changes the material developers can work with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:19">[00:58:19]</a>. This technology is particularly beneficial for horizontal tools like Notion because:
*   **Data Advantage:** AI excels at reasoning, understanding, and searching when "all the information are together" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:49">[00:58:49]</a>, making bundled offerings highly advantageous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:02">[00:59:02]</a>.
*   **AI Writing & Q&A:** Notion's first AI products focused on writing assistance and Q&A, leveraging the surface area where users already write and manage tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:40">[00:58:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:07">[00:59:07]</a>.
*   **Bridging the Gap:** AI can solve the "biggest weakness" of Lego-like systems – the difficulty for non-builders to piece things together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:40">[00:59:40]</a>. LLMs, especially those good at "coding," can act as "AI coding agents" on top of Notion's existing Lego blocks, enabling the creation of "any kind of knowledge customer software customer agent" for various vertical use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:09">[01:00:09]</a>.

## Staying Lean and Efficient

Notion has maintained a lean and efficient operational model, remaining profitable for years and retaining most of its raised capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:11">[00:30:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:18">[00:30:18]</a>. This approach is attributed to:
*   **Multiskilled Founders:** Early on, the founders could perform various roles (coding, design, marketing, sales), naturally keeping the company small <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:54">[00:30:54]</a>.
*   **Minimizing Overhead:** A smaller team reduces internal communication overhead and alignment challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:24">[00:31:24]</a>.
*   **System-Based Solutions:** Instead of hiring more people, Notion solves problems through better systems and tools, often using Notion itself as a meta-tool to run the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:36">[00:31:36]</a>.
*   **Talent Density:** The focus is on "talent density" and "revenue per employee" rather than sheer headcount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:11">[00:32:11]</a>.
*   **"Small Bus" Metaphor:** Internally, Notion uses the metaphor of a "small bus" that is easier to maneuver, accelerate, and turn corners, emphasizing that picking the right "seatmates" (employees) dictates the bus's speed and experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:40">[00:33:40]</a>.

This lean approach, influenced by the early "Lost Years" where financial solvency was a constant concern, allows Notion to focus on building rather than fundraising cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:56">[00:31:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:30">[00:32:30]</a>. The philosophy is that a "better system is much better than brute force through people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>.

## The Art of Trade-offs and Craftsmanship

Building product and business is an ongoing process of making trade-offs, as "there's no free lunch" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:22">[00:39:22]</a>. This requires balancing different dimensions:
*   **Technology Trade-offs:** Adapting to new technologies (like AI, which is seen as a new "material" like aluminum) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:55">[00:39:55]</a>.
*   **Human Behavior Trade-offs:** Understanding user needs and preferences, which are more static than technological advancements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:31">[00:40:31]</a>.
*   **Business vs. Values:** Balancing the need for users and revenue with the desire to build something authentic and aligned with one's values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:41">[00:41:41]</a>. Too much focus on self-value without user consideration leads to an "art project," while too much business focus results in a "commodity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:54">[00:54:54]</a>.

Ivan Zhao emphasizes the concept of "craft" in building products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:38">[00:37:38]</a>:
> "Craft is kind of like about apply your value to some technical know-how and to make more clever trade-offs to create something new and useful." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:53">[00:37:53]</a>

This commitment to craftsmanship is reflected in Notion's deliberate choices, from its office aesthetics designed to foster creativity and ease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:21">[00:35:21]</a>, to naming conference rooms after "Timeless Tools in history" to inspire long-lasting impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:09">[00:36:09]</a>.

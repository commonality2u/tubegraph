For early-stage startups, having a technical co-founder is often a critical element for success, particularly when it comes to building a successful technology company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:24">[00:25:24]</a>. Y Combinator (YC) actively screens for teams that possess the ability to build their initial prototype themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:38">[00:25:38]</a>. This is because a lack of technical expertise within the founding team is a common pattern for startup failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:48">[00:25:48]</a>.

## Why Technical Co-founders are Crucial

Many foundational decisions and product iterations in a startup rely heavily on engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:35">[00:36:35]</a>. Without a technical co-founder, it's challenging to make the right decisions as the product evolves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:43">[00:36:43]</a>. Building a product isn't a one-and-done process of writing a specification; it involves an infinite number of iterations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:50">[00:36:50]</a>. Having an engineer as part of the founding team ensures they understand how these iterations look and can execute them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:32">[00:38:32]</a>.

### Valuing Engineering Contributions

A common mistake for non-technical founders is undervaluing the engineering piece of a startup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:41">[00:34:41]</a>.

> "I have an idea for a song; I just need a musician to help me make it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:55">[00:34:55]</a>. This analogy reflects a common misconception: if you see engineering as merely executing an idea without deep creative input, you are not valuing the skill set enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:05">[00:35:05]</a>. The engineering part is often the really hard part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:18">[00:35:18]</a>.

Undervaluing can be seen in equity splits, such as a non-technical founder taking 90% and offering only 10% to an engineer, which signals a lack of understanding of the engineering value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:28">[00:35:28]</a>.

## Finding a Technical Co-founder

Many technical individuals are eager to find business co-founders. They may not want to handle sales or fundraising, preferring to focus on solving technical problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50">[00:35:50]</a>.

Here are strategies for finding one:
*   **YC's Co-founder Matching**: YC offers a [[co_founder_matching | co-founder matching]] program to help founders connect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:01">[00:36:01]</a>.
*   **Reach Out to Your Network**: Ask the best technical people you know if they are interested in starting a company with you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:09">[00:36:09]</a>. Be prepared for rejections, as many will be happy in their current roles, but some may have been hoping for such an opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:14">[00:36:14]</a>.

## Learning to Code as a Non-Technical Founder

It is possible for non-technical founders to learn how to code themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:57">[00:36:57]</a>. There are numerous online resources available to acquire the skills needed to build a prototype <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:01">[00:37:01]</a>. While you don't need to be the *best* engineer, it's crucial to be sufficiently skilled to understand the value of engineering and how software can solve most problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:13">[00:37:13]</a>. Many successful founders, while not coding today, started by learning to code and then hired engineers as the company grew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:06">[00:37:06]</a>.

## The Pitfalls of Contracting Firms

Relying on an external contracting firm to build the entire product is generally not recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:42">[00:37:42]</a>. YC cannot recall any specific examples of companies succeeding using this model for their core product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:15">[00:38:15]</a>. This is because building a product requires more than just writing a spec; it demands being part of the iterative process yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:20">[00:38:20]</a>.

While rare, some non-technical founders have made it work by building strong internal engineering teams who feel like part of the founding team, even if they aren't co-founders by definition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:39">[00:38:39]</a>. An example of a company that successfully worked with an external development team early on is Calendly, which leveraged a Ukrainian development team that not only built the initial product but also contributed to early growth and continued to work with the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:52">[00:38:52]</a>.

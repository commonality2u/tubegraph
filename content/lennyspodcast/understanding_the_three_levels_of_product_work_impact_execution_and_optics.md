The idea of three levels of product work—Impact, Execution, and Optics—provides a framework for understanding dynamics within product teams and organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:54">[00:53:54]</a>. Understanding these levels can help explain conflicts between smart and well-intentioned individuals or groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:17">[00:57:17]</a>.

### Impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:38">[00:56:38]</a>
The "Impact" level refers to thinking about the overall effect of a product or project, particularly its effect on the customer experience and the brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:42">[00:56:42]</a>. Founders and CEOs often operate at this level, prioritizing the broad, long-term consequences of decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:47">[00:56:47]</a>. For example, a CEO might question why customer service response time will be high for a new product, focusing on the negative impact to the customer experience and brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:42">[00:54:42]</a>.

### Execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:20">[00:56:20]</a>
The "Execution" level focuses on what it takes to get something done and how to hit the next milestone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:23">[00:56:23]</a>. Product managers often find themselves fixated on this level when dealing with launches or projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:13">[00:56:13]</a>.

While essential, focusing solely on execution can lead to problems if not aligned with higher-level thinking. For early-stage teams, optimizing for [[executing_strategy_effectively_in_product_management | execution]] is crucial, assuming they have a reasonable hypothesis about success, as impact might not be readily visible on short horizons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:02">[01:02:02]</a>.

### Optics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:26">[00:58:26]</a>
"Optics" is defined as creating awareness of the impact and execution being done by you or your team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:39">[00:58:39]</a>. Internal optics are beneficial because they create energy, awareness, excitement, and opportunities for feedback, which can enable greater impact and better execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:16">[00:59:16]</a>.

However, challenges arise when optics become the primary goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:32">[00:59:32]</a>. Organizations can implicitly signal that performing well on optics (e.g., sending awesome status updates) is sufficient for appreciation and reward, even if it doesn't directly accomplish anything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:31">[01:00:31]</a>. This imbalance can be harmful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:01">[01:01:01]</a>. Organizational culture, shaped by who is hired, fired, promoted, and what is appreciated by leadership, dictates the emphasis on optics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:14">[01:00:14]</a>.

For instance, a platform team experiencing availability issues might need to pay more attention to optics by improving communication channels and status updates with teams that rely on them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:55">[01:02:55]</a>.

### Mismatches and Conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:59">[00:56:59]</a>
Conflicts often arise when individuals or teams default to thinking at different levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:12">[00:57:12]</a>. A product manager focused on execution might not understand why a CEO is concerned about customer service impact, leading to a mismatch in perspectives during discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:13">[00:56:13]</a>. The key is not that one level is "right" or "wrong," but rather to be sensitive to what level is appropriate for the given situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:34">[01:03:34]</a>.

### Addressing Problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:09">[01:04:09]</a>
Many perceived [[executing_strategy_effectively_in_product_management | execution problems are actually strategy problems or culture problems]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:55">[01:03:55]</a>. Leaders often find themselves constantly solving new [[executing_strategy_effectively_in_product_management | execution problems]], which reappear like a "vacuum hole" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:35">[01:05:35]</a>.

*   **Strategy Problems:** A common "execution problem" like two teams being misaligned often stems from them pursuing different, unclear, or unknown strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:40">[01:07:40]</a>. Without a clear strategy, OKRs may not align, priorities are unclear, and there's no guidance for adapting to changing realities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:01">[01:08:01]</a>.
*   **Culture Problems:** Misalignment can also be a culture problem if the organization implicitly encourages optimizing for individual OKRs above company-wide collaboration. This can lead to teams being penalized for helping others, even if it benefits the broader company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:03">[01:09:03]</a>.
*   **Interpersonal Problems:** Sometimes, execution issues are due to interpersonal conflicts between team managers, which require coaching to resolve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:55">[01:09:55]</a>.

Real [[executing_strategy_effectively_in_product_management | execution problems]] exist, such as infrastructure issues (e.g., old systems causing slow performance or outages) or skill gaps within the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:03">[01:10:03]</a>. A reliable sign that an "execution problem" is actually a deeper issue is when "band-aids" repeatedly fail to solve the same recurring problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:23">[01:12:23]</a>. This indicates that the root cause is not truly an execution flaw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:06">[01:13:06]</a>.

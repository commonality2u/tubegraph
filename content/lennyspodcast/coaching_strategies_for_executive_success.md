Matt Mochary is a full-time executive coach who has worked with notable figures such as Naval Ravikant and the CEOs of OpenAI, Coinbase, Reddit, Rippling, Fair, and Notion, as well as partners at top VC firms like Sequoia and YC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. His aim is to help leaders improve the craft of building and growing products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

## Matt Mochary's Coaching Philosophy

Mochary's [[leadership_and_management_development | coaching]] approach has evolved over the years. Initially, it was very tactical, focusing on elements like setting and tracking goals at company, department, and individual levels, and using tools like Asana for transparency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:09">[00:39:09]</a>. However, a significant shift has been incorporating strategies for dealing with emotions like fear and anger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:31">[00:39:31]</a>.

### Common Struggles of Successful Founders

Even highly successful founders and leaders often struggle with fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. Fear can grip the mind, preventing individuals from taking difficult but necessary actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. Mochary posits that "fear gives bad advice," leading to exaggerated predictions about negative outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. In contrast, operating without fear allows for a clearer perception of reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.

A common example is a CEO with a business problem fearing transparently sharing it with their board and investors, especially when a new funding round is approaching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. Counter-intuitively, sharing these problems transparently often leads to increased trust from the board, rather than its loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.

To [[career_advancement_strategies | overcome]] fear, Mochary advises doing the opposite of what one's brain, clouded by fear, suggests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. This applies to ego-perceived dangers, not physical ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. Consulting someone not in fear can provide clarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>.

### Addressing Anger

Anger is viewed not as a base emotion, but as a cover for pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>. When expressed, it can destroy relationships, especially with those closest to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>. To address anger, Mochary's wife developed a neutral "I statement" approach: "I perceive you to be in anger" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. This non-judgmental phrasing allows the individual to recognize their state and avoid destructive actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>. The ultimate solution is to allow oneself to feel the underlying pain, rather than externalizing it as anger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>.

## Key Coaching Strategies and Lessons

### Handling Layoffs and Terminations

Learning to terminate employment is considered one of the most important [[effective_leadership_and_strategic_thinking | leadership]] skills, yet many managers struggle with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:44">[00:23:44]</a>.

**Elements of a Humane Layoff:**
*   **One-on-One Communication:** The most crucial factor for a successful layoff is that the employee hears the news directly from their manager in a one-on-one conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:25">[00:47:25]</a>. Receiving the news via email or group chat is dehumanizing and leads to anger and public backlash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
*   **Prepare the Employee:** Start the conversation by stating it will be difficult and allow the person a few seconds to mentally prepare. This can prevent the amygdala from being fully triggered by surprise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>.
*   **Deliver the Message Clearly:** State directly that they are being let go and explain why <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:51">[00:30:51]</a>.
*   **Allow Emotional Release:** Encourage them to share their feelings (anger, fear, sadness). Actively listen to make them feel heard and show you are not running away from their pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>.
*   **Become Their Agent:** Actively help the person find their next "dream job" by discovering their ideal role and reaching out to contacts on their behalf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:38">[00:20:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:22">[00:26:22]</a>. This compassionate approach maintains friendship and respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a>. Even if an individual is a poor performer, they are likely good at something else aligned with their passions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:04">[00:27:04]</a>.
*   **Separate Decision from Implementation:** As learned from Wei Ding of Clipboard Health, focus the decision on what is best for the customer (e.g., only the best employees). Then, for implementation, consider how to minimize harm to affected stakeholders (the employee, the manager, the team) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:29">[00:24:29]</a>.

**Impact of Layoffs on Company Performance:**
Counter-intuitively, companies often operate better after layoffs, sometimes within 60 days, even on an absolute scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:39">[00:21:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:17">[00:45:17]</a>. This is because every additional human causes extra overhead and geometrically increases friction in information flow and morale problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>. The ideal is to keep the team super small, like WhatsApp, Instagram, and Notion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:38">[00:22:38]</a>.

**Strategies for Large-Scale Layoffs:**
1.  **Inner Circle Decision:** The leadership team (including all managers) decides the required cost savings, expressed in dollars rather than headcount, to avoid cutting only the cheapest/most junior staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:20">[00:48:20]</a>. Managers then determine who to let go within their teams, fostering ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:08">[00:49:08]</a>.
2.  **Morning of Implementation:** Managers conduct one-on-one meetings, delivering the news personally and scheduling follow-up "agent" sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:34">[00:49:34]</a>.
3.  **Afternoon All-Hands (for Stay Team):** The CEO holds an all-hands meeting to inform the remaining team about the layoffs, answer questions (especially those related to fear of future cuts or company implosion), and reassure them that this is the final cut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:14">[00:50:14]</a>. Cutting deep once is better than multiple rounds, which cause PTSD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:55">[00:50:55]</a>.
4.  **One-on-One Follow-Ups (for Stay Team):** Managers conduct one-hour one-on-ones with each remaining team member to allow them to express their thoughts and feelings (sadness, anger, fear) and make them feel heard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:34">[00:51:34]</a>. This reduces emotional intensity, prevents rash actions, and accelerates recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:11">[00:52:11]</a>.

### [[strategies_for_effective_communication_and_alignment_in_growing_organizations | Effective Communication]] & Making People Feel Heard

Making people feel heard is essential for [[lessons_in_leadership_and_team_management | team management]] and organizational health.
*   **Written Acknowledgement:** In group settings, ask everyone to write down their thoughts. Acknowledge each submission (e.g., "Thank you, Lenny") to show it was read <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:14">[00:32:14]</a>.
*   **Verbal Repetition:** Ask the person to express their thoughts verbally, then repeat it back to them until they confirm you've accurately understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:41">[00:32:41]</a>.
*   **Reflecting Deeper Thoughts:** Especially when receiving feedback, reflect back what you imagine their unstated thoughts and emotions might be (e.g., "I think what I'm hearing you say is you're pissed off and you're thinking screw you Matt..."). This makes them feel deeply understood, as thoughts are often "bigger than words" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:02">[00:33:02]</a>.
*   **Action/Explanation:** After hearing someone, either accept their feedback and commit to an action, or explain why you cannot accept it, sharing your perspective so they can understand the situation more fully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:11">[00:34:11]</a>.

### Prioritization and Focus ("Top Goal")

To avoid spending all day responding to others' requests, leaders need to:
1.  **Define Priorities:** Clearly establish personal priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>.
2.  **Dedicated Time:** Allocate a specific block of time each day (30 minutes to 2 hours) to work solely on personal priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:51">[00:40:51]</a>. This practice alone can lead to massive gains and significantly change one's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:01">[00:41:01]</a>.
3.  **Accountability Partners:** For those who struggle with focus, an accountability partner (like a gym trainer) can help ensure dedicated work during this time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:47">[00:41:47]</a>.

### Optimizing Energy ("Energy Audit")

This concept, drawn from Diana Chapman at Conscious Leadership Group, identifies four zones of activity based on skill and enjoyment:
*   **Zone of Incompetence:** Tasks others are better at; should be delegated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:58">[01:02:58]</a>.
*   **Zone of Competence:** Tasks one can do fine, but others can too; consider delegating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:08">[01:03:08]</a>.
*   **Zone of Excellence:** Tasks one is uniquely good at but doesn't love. This is a "danger zone" where one might be highly paid and valued, but it drains life force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:24">[01:03:24]</a>.
*   **Zone of Genius:** Tasks one is uniquely good at and loves, often losing track of time while doing them. These activities are often undervalued by the person performing them because they come so easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:46">[01:03:46]</a>.

**Conducting an Energy Audit:**
1.  **Map Your Time:** Review two representative weeks of your calendar, logging all meetings and filling in what was done during time between meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:11">[01:04:11]</a>.
2.  **Color-Code Energy:** For each hour, mark it green if it increased your energy, or red if it was neutral or negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:24">[01:04:24]</a>.
3.  **Identify Themes:** Look for patterns in the "red" activities (e.g., one-on-ones with non-direct reports, unprepared meetings, unproductive recruiting) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:48">[01:04:48]</a>.
4.  **Eliminate, Delegate, or Refine:**
    *   **Eliminate:** If a task doesn't need to be done at all, cancel it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:16">[01:05:16]</a>.
    *   **Delegate:** If it needs to be done but someone else can do it, delegate it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:23">[01:05:23]</a>.
    *   **Refine:** If only you can do it, brainstorm what would make it "exquisite" or energy-raising (e.g., for team meetings, pre-circulate updates and problems/solutions to allow for faster decision-making) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:28">[01:05:28]</a>. Share proposed changes with the team, as they often feel similarly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:13">[01:06:13]</a>.

The goal is to get your calendar to 80% green, allowing you to naturally gravitate towards and do more of what you love, leading to greater value creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:47">[01:06:47]</a>. This process can be revolutionary for [[building_strategy_skills_and_effective_goal_setting | personal effectiveness]] and [[strategies_for_company_growth_and_overcoming_internal_challenges | organizational trajectory]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:43">[01:08:43]</a>. For every task you don't enjoy, someone else out there likely loves to do it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:20">[01:09:20]</a>.

### Innovation within Larger Companies

Large companies often struggle with [[engineering_leadership_and_management_strategies | innovation]] due to the need to maintain site uptime and security for millions of users, leading to slow code review and approval processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:39">[00:55:39]</a>.

**Strategies for Success:**
*   **Create "YC Startup"-like Entities:** Form small, independent teams with a "founder mentality" led by individuals willing to break glass and push through obstacles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:47">[00:54:47]</a>. These individuals can often be found among founders of failed startups who still possess the drive but seek a more stable environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:06">[00:55:06]</a>.
*   **Decouple from Core Code/Approval:** These teams should not touch the core product's code base to avoid lengthy review processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:16">[00:56:16]</a>.
*   **Direct Reporting to CEO:** To bypass slow product or engineering approval hierarchies, these innovation teams should report directly to the CEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:36">[00:56:36]</a>.
*   **Establish Separate C-Corps:** A radical but effective strategy is to create entirely new C-Corps for new product initiatives, making it clear they are separate entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:59">[00:56:59]</a>. This allows teams to iterate faster without worrying about damaging the core brand, as seen with Clipboard Health, which created five C-Corps in two months for new products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:44">[00:57:44]</a>.
*   **Dual Teams for New Products:** Wei Ding also implemented having two independent teams work on each new product: one engineering-focused building custom code, and another customer-relationship focused building manual or off-the-shelf solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:05">[00:58:05]</a>. This allows for rapid testing to see which approach makes faster progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:27">[00:58:27]</a>.
*   **Motivation Beyond Equity:** While financial incentives exist, Mochary suggests that the primary motivator for individuals in these innovation teams is the joy of [[entrepreneurship_lessons_and_strategies | building]] and seeing their creations used in the world, coupled with autonomy and ownership over decision-making and creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:12">[00:59:12]</a>. Fear can be a strong, short-term motivator, but joy provides sustainable, long-term drive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:21">[01:00:21]</a>. Amazon is cited as an example of a company that fosters innovation by providing resources and autonomy without necessarily granting large equity stakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:47">[00:59:47]</a>.

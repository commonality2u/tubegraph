Many people mistakenly believe that the only time a significant investment in presentation skills, including scripting and [[story structure in presentations | contrasting stories]], is necessary is for a large stage talk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, the ability to present effectively is valuable in any moment of influence, from phone calls to daily meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

Nancy Duarte, best-selling author, speaker, and CEO of Duarte Incorporated, has played a pivotal role in shaping the field of presentations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. Her company has contributed to over 250,000 presentations for leading brands and institutions, including Apple, Google, the World Bank, and famously, Al Gore's *An Inconvenient Truth* presentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Duarte's approach offers tactical advice on how to improve presentations, tell better stories, construct convincing arguments, and manage public speaking nerves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## Key Principles for Presentations

Duarte emphasizes three foundational tips for [[crafting effective sales pitches | crafting effective sales pitches]] and presentations:

### Audience as the Hero: Empathy First

At the core of Duarte's methodology is empathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>. Instead of the presenter being the hero, the **audience is the hero** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>. The presenter's role is that of a mentor, coming alongside the audience to help them overcome internal conflicts and empower them to take action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>.

> [!tip] Shift Your Mindset
> When building your presentation, think: "Who am I talking to? How am I going to help them get unstuck?" This empathetic approach is a super foundational principle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:14">[00:20:14]</a>.

This principle applies even to personal interactions; for example, using an empathetic approach to get a spouse to do chores involves understanding their context and framing the request in a way that resonates with their needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:56">[00:32:56]</a>.

### Infuse with Story: The "What Is, What Could Be, New Bliss" Framework

The second key tip is to **infuse your talk with story** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>. [[Story structure in presentations | Story structures]], rooted in human cognition, align the brains of the speaker and listener, creating engagement and longing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:14">[00:24:14]</a>.

Duarte proposes a visual framework that can be applied to any presentation, from a large speech to a brief conversation:
*   **What Is:** Start by stating the current reality or problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:58">[00:26:58]</a>.
*   **What Could Be:** Introduce a contrasting future state or solution, building tension and desire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:04">[00:27:04]</a>.
*   **New Bliss:** Conclude by painting a picture of the world where your idea is adopted, offering a compelling happy ending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:14">[00:27:14]</a>.

This "what is, what could be, new bliss" cadence creates longing for an alternate future, moving people from the status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:26">[00:27:26]</a>. It works in any format, even a brief suggestion to a family member <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:31">[00:31:31]</a>.

### Can They See What You're Saying? (Visual Communication)

The third tip is to **ask yourself: "Can they see what I'm saying?"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>. Visual tools, whether presentation software, live sketching, or even drawing on a napkin in a meeting, help align understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:22">[00:36:22]</a>. For complex concepts, like technology architecture or system flows, diagrams are crucial for conveying information that mere verbal narrative cannot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:04">[00:37:04]</a>.

> [!tip] Visual Alignment
> To ensure alignment in a meeting, draw concepts on a whiteboard or paper. This allows everyone to see the exact same thing, steps, and insights, preventing questions and fostering shared understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:05">[00:38:05]</a>.

## Practical Application and Considerations

### Designing Effective Slides

When creating slides, it's important to make one point per slide, ensuring it supports the overall "big idea" of your presentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:38">[00:41:38]</a>. Avoid simply pulling old, disparate slides from a repository without modifying them for your specific audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:51">[00:43:51]</a>.

*   **Slide Docs:** For presentations circulated via email, "slide docs" are useful. These contain more words and stronger pictures, potentially with a hundred-page appendix, allowing people to read and understand the full context without a presenter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:56">[00:42:56]</a>. They are akin to Amazon's six-page memos, but enhanced with visuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:14">[00:43:14]</a>.
*   **Audience-Specific Density:** The ideal density and style of slides depend on the audience and their cultural norms. For internal team meetings, denser slides using commonly accepted frameworks or tables might be appropriate to move objectives along <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:13">[00:49:13]</a>. For high-stakes external audiences, a more cinematic, visual approach might be preferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:47">[00:44:47]</a>.

### Presenting in Remote/Virtual Settings

Remote [[conversational public speaking techniques | public speaking]] requires specific adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:22">[00:53:22]</a>:
*   **Eye Contact:** Consciously look at the camera, not just the faces on your screen, to create the impression of direct eye contact with the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:30">[00:53:30]</a>.
*   **Presence:** Without the visual cues of body language and physical space, developing strong virtual presence becomes critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:10">[00:54:10]</a>.

### Overcoming Public Speaking Nerves

Nervousness before public speaking, often stemming from a fight-or-flight instinct, can actually indicate a thoughtful and deep content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:07">[00:56:07]</a>.

> [!tip] Managing Stage Fright
> *   **Visualize Success:** Sit in the audience before your talk and imagine yourself confidently delivering your presentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>.
> *   **Change Your Chemical State:** Use pre-talk rituals to shift from anxiety to a more positive emotional state. This could include breathing exercises, or, as Nancy Duarte does, watching a short, funny video right before going on stage to induce laughter and a chemical shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:20">[00:58:20]</a>.

## Leadership and Vision: The Torchbearer Concept

In her book *Illuminate*, co-authored with Patty Sanchez, Duarte introduces the concept of the "Torchbearer" leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:13">[01:01:13]</a>. This idea recognizes that every presentation is often part of a larger movement to guide people towards an alternate future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:42">[01:01:42]</a>.

A torchbearer knows the general direction but doesn't see the entire path clearly. The torch provides enough light (5-8 feet) to dissipate fear for those following <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:34">[01:02:34]</a>. Movements follow a five-act structure:
1.  **Dream:** Articulating the vision for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:05">[01:02:05]</a>.
2.  **Leap:** The moment when people choose to commit to the journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:09">[01:03:09]</a>.
3.  **Fight & Climb:** The "messy middle" of the journey, where challenges and roadblocks are overcome (an undulating process of "fight, climb, fight, climb") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:27">[01:03:27]</a>.
4.  **Arrive:** The culmination of the journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:56">[01:03:56]</a>.

At each phase, leaders need to use speeches, [[developing storytelling skills | stories]], ceremonies, and symbols to provide emotional fuel for those traveling with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:58">[01:03:58]</a>.

## Case Studies and Examples

### Al Gore's *An Inconvenient Truth*

This famous presentation came out before TED Talks were widely available online, showcasing how a data-driven story could captivate an audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. Duarte's team worked with Al Gore for five years before the movie's release, helping him refine the talk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. Gore consistently deferred to Duarte's team as experts, which was a "delightful" consulting experience given his stature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. The movie's success was partly due to Gore's five years of traveling and "planting seeds for a groundswell," creating a desire for the presentation before it hit the big screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

### Apple's Presentation Evolution

Duarte Incorporated has been an Apple client since its founding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. In the early days, Apple pushed Duarte to create presentations using the new Macintosh, which was initially perceived as a "toy" by graphic designers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.

A memorable example of [[innovative presentation design | innovative presentation design]] occurred at a 1992 sales conference where a sales leader requested an entire slide be covered with the hot pink word "BIG" on a black background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. This bold visual had a striking effect, lighting up the audience's faces and prompting gasps from the production team, demonstrating a new way presentations could be done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>. This moment highlighted that putting presentation tools in the hands of the masses had initially "destroyed the medium," and Duarte's mission became reshaping it to be more visually pleasing and clear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>.

### Airbnb's Superhost Program

An example of [[storytelling and drawing in product management | storytelling and drawing in product management]] is Airbnb's development of its Superhost program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:01">[01:08:01]</a>. The team decided to "walk in the shoes of their customer," hiring an illustrator to create keyframes of a host's and guest's journey, from waking up to booking and arrival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:12">[01:08:12]</a>. This "day in the life" storytelling method revealed that their strategy was flawed and they needed to move to a mobile-first approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:41">[01:08:41]</a>. These visualized journeys became central to the company's strategy, with 12 frames depicting the host and guest experience prominently displayed in the office, guiding teams to improve specific moments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:36">[01:10:36]</a>. This demonstrates the power of visualizing a [[crafting a compelling product vision | compelling product vision]] through empathy.

## General Advice for Presenters

*   **Prioritize Thinking and Planning:** Before opening presentation software, spend time thinking and planning your narrative, perhaps by sketching storyboards. This ensures the message is right before focusing on individual slides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:47">[00:48:47]</a>.
*   **Passion is Key:** To become a better presenter, choose a topic you are genuinely passionate about. Working on a talk that makes you feel deeply invested will teach you to present "from your soul," a skill transferable to less exciting business presentations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:20">[01:15:20]</a>.

Many people mistakenly believe that the only time a strong presentation is needed is for a large stage talk requiring significant investment in script and contrasting stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, the ability to effectively communicate and influence works in any format, from a meeting to a phone call, or even getting chores done at home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

Nancy Duarte, a best-selling author, speaker, and CEO of Duarte Incorporated, emphasizes that effective communication and storytelling are vital for influencing others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. Her company has assisted in creating over 250,000 presentations for influential business leaders, brands like Apple and Google, and famously, Al Gore's *An Inconvenient Truth* presentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## Core Principles for Presentations

Nancy Duarte's methodology for [[improving communication skills | improving communication skills]] and presentations revolves around three core principles:

1.  **Your Audience is the Hero** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>
2.  **Infuse Your Talk with Story** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>
3.  **Can They See What You're Saying?** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>

### 1. The Audience as the Hero: An Empathy-Centric Approach

At the heart of Duarte's methodology is empathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>. Speakers should adopt the role of a mentor, guiding the audience (the hero) to overcome challenges or adopt new ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a>. The audience holds the power, choosing whether to accept or reject an idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a>.

Thinking empathetically means understanding the audience's internal conflicts and what they need to "soothe" them, before asking them to take action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>. This approach shifts the presenter's mindset from what they want to say to how they can help the audience get unstuck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:14">[00:20:14]</a>.

An example of this in practice is Duarte's own internal annual vision talks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:54">[00:20:54]</a>. They conduct listening tours, surveys, and interviews to understand their team's current state and concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:59">[00:20:59]</a>. They then create a rough draft of the message and models, inviting leaders for feedback to ensure it resonates before sharing it with the entire company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>.

### 2. Infusing with Story Structures

While anecdotes are stories, for presentations, it's more about utilizing story structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:56">[00:23:56]</a>. A powerful [[how to construct effective and memorable stories | storytelling]] framework is the "What Is, What Could Be, New Bliss" model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:52">[00:26:52]</a>:

*   **What Is**: Describe the current reality or problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:58">[00:26:58]</a>.
*   **What Could Be**: Present a contrasting future state or solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:04">[00:27:04]</a>.
*   **New Bliss**: Conclude by painting a picture of the ideal future where your idea is adopted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:14">[00:27:14]</a>.

This pattern, often seen as a series of peaks and valleys, creates longing for the future and helps people move away from the status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:24">[00:27:24]</a>. Steve Jobs's iPhone launch speech famously used this contrast by highlighting the current state of phones before revealing the iPhone's capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:21">[00:28:21]</a>.

This [[presentation_structure_and_frameworks | presentation structure and framework]] is applicable beyond major stage talks; it can be used in brief interactions like meetings or phone calls to influence outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:22">[00:31:22]</a>. For example, when asking her husband to do chores, Nancy uses this pattern by explaining the current challenges (her busy schedule, the dog's needs) before presenting the "new bliss" of the chore being done and the positive outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:10">[00:33:10]</a>.

### 3. Can They See What You're Saying? Visual Communication

To ensure the audience understands, leverage visual tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:20">[00:36:20]</a>. This could involve presentation software, live sketchers, or even just drawing on a napkin or whiteboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:43">[00:37:43]</a>. Diagrams and visual models help clarify complex systems or processes, especially in technical fields like product architecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:04">[00:37:04]</a>. When people can visually see what you're conveying, it leads to better alignment and understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:19">[00:37:19]</a>.

One important tip is to consider periods where there are no visuals. Powerful moments can occur when the audience is 100% focused on the verbal stream and the speaker's body language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:36">[00:40:36]</a>.

## Tactical Advice for Slide Design

*   **One Point Per Slide**: Each slide should support the single big idea of your entire presentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:38">[00:41:38]</a>. People cannot process too many things simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:03">[00:42:03]</a>.
*   **Context Matters**: The placement of key insights or calls to action on a slide can vary by company culture or audience preference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:08">[00:42:08]</a>.
*   **Slide Docs**: For presentations circulated via email without a live presenter, create "slide docs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:53">[00:42:53]</a>. These contain more words, stronger pictures, and can have an extensive appendix to provide context, similar to Amazon's six-page memos, but enhanced with visuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:56">[00:42:56]</a>.
*   **Avoid Repositories for High-Stakes**: While using old slides can save time, for important or high-stakes presentations, content should be specifically modified and mapped to the current audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:03">[00:44:03]</a>.
*   **Audience Communication Style**: Understand your audience's communication culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:26">[00:44:26]</a>. Some audiences, especially in certain corporate cultures, might prefer denser, highly detailed slides over cinematic ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:26">[00:44:26]</a>.
*   **Plan First**: Before opening presentation software, sketch or storyboard your narrative to ensure the flow is right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:47">[00:48:47]</a>. Then choose the appropriate slide type (table, diagram, image) to convey each point effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:54">[00:49:54]</a>.

## The Presentation Process

Duarte Incorporated approaches [[crafting_a_sales_pitch | crafting a sales pitch]] and other high-stakes presentations by following a process similar to how Pixar makes movies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:42">[00:50:42]</a>. This includes:
*   Crafting the narrative and big idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:57">[00:50:57]</a>.
*   Developing the script and visualizing key moments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:59">[00:50:59]</a>.
*   Creating revolutionary models that can also drive other assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:09">[00:51:09]</a>.
*   Circulating early versions for consensus building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:22">[00:51:22]</a>.
*   Working out "kinks" in the narrative before delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:41">[00:51:41]</a>.

The process is highly tailored to the presenter and the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:09">[00:53:09]</a>. In one instance, rather than rely on five slides for a $100 million budget petition, Duarte advised a multinational company head to use a simple mental model and draw out key points on a whiteboard for direct eye contact and passion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:30">[00:52:30]</a>.

## Remote Presentations

For virtual presentations, eye contact is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:30">[00:53:30]</a>. Nancy recommends looking directly into the camera, even if it feels unnatural, to maintain connection with the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:30">[00:53:30]</a>. It's also important to consider that remote settings limit the visibility of body language, like hand gestures or how much space a person occupies, which can affect presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:09">[00:54:09]</a>.

## [[managing_presentation_nerves_and_stage_presence | Managing Presentation Nerves]]

For those who get nervous, it often indicates a thoughtful and contemplative speaker with potentially strong content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:07">[00:56:07]</a>. Nerves are a "fight or flight" response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:45">[00:56:45]</a>. To combat this:
*   **Visualize Success**: Sit in the audience before your talk and picture yourself on stage, smiling and happy, with a friendly, delighted audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>.
*   **Pre-Talk Rituals**: Some speakers find it helpful to pump themselves up with high-energy activities like listening to heavy metal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:58">[00:57:58]</a>. Others, like Nancy, prefer calming rituals such as deep breathing or finding a dark, quiet place backstage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:08">[00:58:08]</a>.
*   **Chemical Shift**: Watching funny videos or engaging in activities that induce laughter can chemically shift the body from nervousness to a more relaxed state before walking on stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:26">[00:58:26]</a>.

## Leading Change: The Torchbearer Concept

Presentations are often part of a larger movement to shift people toward an alternate future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:42">[01:01:42]</a>. The "torchbearer" leader knows the direction, even if the future isn't entirely clear, using their vision to dissipate fear for followers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:26">[01:02:26]</a>.

Movements, like stories, often follow a five-act structure:
1.  **Dream**: Verbalize the aspirational future state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:05">[01:02:05]</a>.
2.  **Leap**: Individuals commit to the journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:11">[01:03:11]</a>.
3.  **Fight**: The challenging and messy middle where obstacles are encountered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:29">[01:03:29]</a>.
4.  **Climb**: Persistence through difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:54">[01:03:54]</a>.
5.  **Arrive**: The successful realization of the dream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:56">[01:03:56]</a>.

At each phase, leaders need to use speeches, stories, ceremonies, and symbols to provide emotional fuel to their followers, helping them continue towards the shared goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>.

## Production Quality in Video Content

Expectations for video content production quality have shifted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:24">[01:05:24]</a>. Informal, informative videos can often outperform highly produced ones, suggesting that content and clarity are more important than cinematic polish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:18">[01:06:18]</a>.

## [[improving_product_management_skills | Improving Product Management Skills]] with Storytelling

[[developing_a_product_vision_and_communicating_it_effectively | Developing a product vision and communicating it effectively]] benefits greatly from [[how to construct effective and memorable stories | storytelling]]. For product managers, storytelling can be integrated into every phase of the product development cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:48">[01:07:48]</a>.

A notable example is Airbnb's "Snow White" project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:01">[01:08:01]</a>. By literally walking in the shoes of their customer and illustrating each step of a user's day, they realized their strategy was flawed and needed to pivot to a mobile-first approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:12">[01:08:12]</a>. This "day in the life" exercise, a classic storytelling method, led to a fundamental strategic shift based on a deep, empathetic understanding of the user journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:33">[01:08:33]</a>.

Even after a product is developed, product managers need to infuse it with meaning and passion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:46">[01:09:46]</a>. Instead of just presenting a new product, explain the "why"—the passion behind design choices, the problem it solves, and how it will "increase human flourishing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:49">[01:09:49]</a>. This ability to add meaning can determine whether a product is chosen or rejected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:52">[01:09:52]</a>.

## Final Advice for Becoming a Better Presenter

To become a better presenter, choose a topic you are deeply passionate about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:20">[01:15:20]</a>. Working on a presentation about something that truly moves you will allow you to present from your soul, tapping into a place of genuine passion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:45">[01:15:45]</a>. This experience will then translate and apply to future business presentations, even if you are not as passionate about the subject matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:38">[01:15:38]</a>.

Effective presentation skills are crucial not only for major stage talks but also for everyday moments of influence, such as meetings or phone calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The ability to structure communication with a clear framework can be applied universally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Nancy Duarte's Background and Approach
Nancy Duarte is a best-selling author, speaker, and CEO of Duarte Incorporated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. Her company has assisted in creating over 250,000 presentations for influential business leaders, brands, and institutions, including Apple, Google, the World Bank, and notably Al Gore's "An Inconvenient Truth" presentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

Duarte Incorporated began as Duarte Desktop Publishing and Graphic Design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. They gained early contracts with NASA, Tandem (now HP), and Apple by cold-calling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. Their entry coincided with a period when graphic designers resisted using the Macintosh for its "bitmabbed" and "ugly" output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>. Duarte's team pushed the boundaries of the tools, experimenting with colorizing clip art and creating impactful visuals like a slide completely covered with the word "BIG" in hot pink, which surprised production teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. This led to the realization that the medium needed reshaping after mass adoption by users often "destroyed" its potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.

The company excels at mapping visuals to brand requirements, making presentations cinematic and visually experiential when speakers are on stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>. For example, their work on Apple's "Think Different" campaign involved pushing for clean, impactful visuals like particulates floating with the six-color Apple logo, avoiding common "hideous templates" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. This approach aims to create visuals that are more pleasing to the audience by clearly showing what to focus on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>.

## Core Principles of Compelling Presentations
Nancy Duarte highlights three essential tips for creating effective presentations:

1.  [[Using empathy in presentations | Make the Audience the Hero]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>
2.  [[Storytelling and drawing in product management | Infuse your talk with story]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>
3.  [[Visualization techniques for public speaking | Ask yourself: Can they see what I'm saying?]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>

### [[Using empathy in presentations | Make the Audience the Hero]]
Empathy is foundational to Duarte's methodology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>. The presenter should act as a mentor, coming alongside the audience (the hero) to help them overcome internal conflicts and empower them to take action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>. The audience holds the power, choosing whether to accept or reject an idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a>. An empathetic approach involves understanding the audience's current state and how challenging the proposed action might be for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:08">[00:20:08]</a>. This mindset shift is critical when building a deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:16">[00:20:16]</a>.

An example of this in practice is Duarte's own annual vision talk, which begins with a "listening tour" (surveys and interviews) to understand the team's current state and challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>. A rough cut of the message is then shared with leaders for feedback before being delivered to the entire company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>. This ensures the message resonates and addresses potential skepticism from an audience that might feel their job is about to get harder or priorities change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:12">[00:22:12]</a>.

### [[Storytelling and drawing in product management | Infuse with Story]]
Storytelling in presentations is not just about anecdotes, but about utilizing inherent story structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">[00:23:54]</a>. Neuroscience shows that when a story is told, the listener's brain fires in the same order and place as the storyteller's, aligning minds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:16">[00:24:16]</a>.

#### The "What Is, What Could Be, New Bliss" Framework
This framework involves traversing between "what is" (the current state) and "what could be" (the proposed future or solution), creating a sense of longing for the future state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:17">[00:27:17]</a>. The final "new bliss" is the desired outcome where the idea is adopted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:27">[00:35:27]</a>.

This "rise and fall" cadence builds tension and resolves it, much like a classic story arc <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:47">[00:24:47]</a>. It helps people envision an alternate future and be influenced towards it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:04">[00:25:04]</a>.

Examples:
*   Steve Jobs frequently used this structure, comparing the current state of technology (what is) to the groundbreaking new product (what could be), as seen in the iPhone launch speech when comparing it to a Blackberry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:21">[00:28:21]</a>.
*   Even brief interactions, like getting a spouse to do chores, can leverage this framework by framing the current situation (what is), the desired outcome (what could be), and the resulting benefit (new bliss) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:43">[00:30:43]</a>.

### [[Visualization techniques for public speaking | Can They See What I'm Saying?]]
Visual tools are critical to help an audience see what you're conveying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:20">[00:36:20]</a>.

#### Slide Design Tips
*   **One Point Per Slide:** Each slide should convey only one main point in support of the overall presentation's big idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:38">[00:41:38]</a>.
*   **Support the Big Idea:** Don't create a slide unless it directly supports the single big idea of your entire talk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:40">[00:43:40]</a>. Avoid quickly assembling "crappy slides" from old repositories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:56">[00:43:56]</a>.
*   **Audience Adaptation:** Understand your audience's communication culture. Some audiences, especially in corporate settings, may prefer dense slides with a lot of information, which is acceptable if it aligns with their internal communication norms and helps achieve an objective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:12">[00:49:12]</a>.
*   **Think & Plan First:** Before opening presentation software, sketch out the narrative using storyboards or simple boxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:38">[00:48:38]</a>. This allows for focus on the message and structure before visual execution.
*   **Verbal-Only Moments:** Sometimes, turning off visuals allows the audience to fully focus on the speaker's words, body language, and passion, creating a powerful moment where they "verbally see" what you're saying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>.

#### Slide Docs
For circulating information via email without a presenter, a "slide doc" is effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:53">[00:42:53]</a>. These are built in presentation software but include more words, stronger pictures, and a potentially hundreds-page appendix for supporting detail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:56">[00:42:56]</a>. They function like Amazon's six-page memos but with visuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:13">[00:43:13]</a>.

## [[innovative_methods_for_preparing_public_speeches | Crafting the Presentation: Duarte's Process]]
Duarte Incorporated approaches presentation creation like Pixar makes movies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:42">[00:50:42]</a>. Their process involves:
*   Crafting the narrative, big idea, and script <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:57">[00:50:57]</a>.
*   Visualizing key moments and mapping out the presentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:02">[00:51:02]</a>.
*   Developing revolutionary models that can also drive web assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:07">[00:51:07]</a>.
*   Circulating key ideas and models around the company to build consensus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:22">[00:51:22]</a>.
*   Working out "kinks" in the narrative before delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:41">[00:51:41]</a>.

The process is highly adaptable and unique to each presenter and audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:09">[00:53:09]</a>. Sometimes, for high-stakes meetings like pitching a large budget, foregoing slides in favor of direct eye contact, passion, and drawing on a whiteboard can be more effective than relying on technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:19">[00:52:19]</a>.

## [[presentation_design_and_communication_strategies | Remote Presentation Considerations]]
Remote presentations present unique challenges:
*   **Eye Contact:** Presenters must learn to look directly into the camera, rather than at faces on the screen, to simulate eye contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:30">[00:53:30]</a>.
*   **Lack of Body Language:** Audiences can't see hands or the space occupied by the presenter, reducing non-verbal cues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:09">[00:54:09]</a>.
*   **Presence:** Coaching around presence becomes vital to convey information and authority in a virtual setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:22">[00:54:22]</a>.
*   **Hybrid Meetings:** In hybrid environments, remote participants often struggle to be heard, as in-room participants tend to dominate discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:11">[00:55:11]</a>.

## [[techniques_for_reducing_presentation_nerves | Overcoming Presentation Nerves]]
Nervousness before public speaking is often a fight-or-flight instinct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:45">[00:56:45]</a>. People who are more thoughtful and contemplative about speaking often have better content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:07">[00:56:07]</a>.

Tips for managing nerves:
*   **Visualize a Friendly Audience:** Sit in the audience seats before a talk, look at the stage, and then picture yourself speaking to a smiling, happy audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>. This helps change the mental model of a judgmental audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:26">[00:57:26]</a>.
*   **Calming Rituals:** Find a quiet, dark place backstage to breathe and focus on content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:08">[00:58:08]</a>.
*   **Chemical Shift:** Before going on stage, watch short, funny videos that trigger laughter to chemically shift the body from nervousness to a relaxed state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:28">[00:58:28]</a>. This can transport you out of the fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:29">[00:59:29]</a>.
*   **Breathing Techniques:** Practice specific breathing patterns, like taking deep breaths, holding them, and releasing slowly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:50">[00:59:50]</a>.

## [[creating_and_communicating_a_vision | Leading Change: The Torchbearer Concept]]
Presentations often form part of a larger "movement" to shift people towards an alternate future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:42">[01:01:42]</a>. The "Torchbearer" concept in leadership illustrates that leaders (torchbearers) know the general direction but may not see the entire future clearly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:26">[01:02:26]</a>. The torch provides enough light to dissipate fear for those following <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:40">[01:02:40]</a>.

Movements follow a five-act story structure:
1.  **Dream:** Verbalize the vision of where the collective is headed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:05">[01:02:05]</a>.
2.  **Leap:** The moment individuals choose to commit to the journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:11">[01:03:11]</a>.
3.  **Fight & Climb:** The "messy middle" where challenges and roadblocks are overcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:27">[01:03:27]</a>. This phase requires speeches, stories, ceremonies, and symbols to provide emotional fuel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>.
4.  **Arrive:** The ultimate achievement of the desired future state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:56">[01:03:56]</a>.

## [[Storytelling and drawing in product management | Storytelling in Product Management]]
Storytelling is vital throughout the product development process, from exploration to production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:45">[01:07:45]</a>.

*   **Empathy and User Journeys:** Airbnb's "Snow White" project is a prime example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:01">[01:08:01]</a>. They hired an illustrator to map out a customer's daily life, scene by scene, which led them to realize their strategy needed to shift to mobile-first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:12">[01:08:12]</a>. These illustrated "keyframes" of the host and guest journey became the company's strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:36">[01:10:36]</a>.
*   **Adding Meaning to Products:** Product teams often spend years developing products but struggle to articulate their "why" or passion for design choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:22">[01:09:22]</a>. Adding meaning and wrapping it in a story can influence whether a product is chosen or rejected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:49">[01:09:49]</a>.

### Final Tip for Better Presentations
To become a better presenter, choose a topic you are deeply passionate about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:20">[01:15:20]</a>. Work on that talk or volunteer to speak on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:29">[01:15:29]</a>. The experience of presenting from your soul will enable you to tap into that passion even for topics you might not be as enthusiastic about in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:43">[01:15:43]</a>.

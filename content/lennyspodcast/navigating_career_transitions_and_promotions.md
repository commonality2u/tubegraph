Nikhail Singall, a product leader who has worked at companies like Meta (Facebook App), Credit Karma, and Google, shares his insights on [[Career growth and strategic positioning | career growth]] for product managers, drawing from his experience coaching hundreds of individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:26">[01:13:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:16">[01:17:16]</a>. He emphasizes the importance of long-term thinking, understanding market dynamics, and continuous personal development to ensure a fulfilling and successful journey in product management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:02">[01:40:02]</a>.

## The Danger of Short-Term Career Focus

A common mistake in [[Career advancement strategies | early career]] is focusing too much on short-term problems, such as disliking a boss or perceiving a company as stagnant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. These issues may exist in many potential roles, and lateral moves often don't represent forward progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

Instead, individuals should "work backwards from their end state," viewing their career as a product to be built in versions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. This means thinking beyond the next job, or even the job after that, to consider what skills and experiences are needed for a long-term vision, like starting a company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. This long-term perspective can help individuals decide whether to "grit it out" and learn to deal with ambiguity in their current role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

Another common short-term focus is equating career progression solely with promotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. While promotions signify movement within a company's system, they are distinct from an individual's long-term career arc <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. Many people plan to leave a company immediately after a promotion, highlighting a disconnect between the promotion as a goal and its service to a broader career objective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

## The "Ex-Growth Company" Trap

Nikhail advises against joining or staying at what he calls "ex-growth companies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. These are companies that experienced rapid "blitzscaling" growth over the last decade, often fueled by easy capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:12">[01:15:12]</a>. However, with changes in economic conditions, many of these companies are no longer growing at the same pace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:47">[01:15:47]</a>.

### Identifying an Ex-Growth Company
An ex-growth company typically:
*   Has raised substantial capital but isn't seeing new funding rounds or layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:22">[01:16:22]</a>.
*   Is still trying to find product-market fit, despite having a valuation in the hundreds of millions or billions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:37">[01:17:37]</a>. This means they are working hard to acquire users, rather than experiencing a natural "sucking sound" of customer demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:42">[01:20:42]</a>.

### Why They Are Dangerous
For employees, especially product managers, ex-growth companies are risky because:
*   Equity compensation is often tied to unrealistic valuations and may become worthless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:17">[01:17:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>.
*   Promotions and career advancement may be stagnant due to a lack of actual growth or new roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>.
*   The opportunity cost of staying is high, as employees could be gaining more valuable experience elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:17">[01:19:17]</a>.

### Reasons to Stay (with Caution)
While generally advised to leave, there are limited reasons to stay in an ex-growth company:
*   **Unique Learning Opportunity**: If the role is the biggest one you could get (e.g., an executive team position), and you have an appetite to learn from that specific experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:02">[01:40:02]</a>.
*   **Loyalty**: A strong commitment to the team or the "baby" project can be a valid, though bounded, reason to stay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:03">[02:22:03]</a>.
*   However, fear of finding another job is **not** a good reason to stay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:40">[02:29:40]</a>.

## Early Career Advice for Product Managers

For those in [[Career development for product owners and managers | early product management careers]], two key pieces of advice stand out:

1.  **Build a World-Class Skill**: Identify and become an expert in one of the key product ambiguities:
    *   **Crafting**: Being exceptionally strong at execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:15">[02:13:15]</a>.
    *   **Market Ambiguity**: Understanding and navigating markets to create new things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:21">[02:30:21]</a>.
    *   **Organizational Ambiguity**: Solving internal problems with complex teams and goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:29">[02:37:29]</a>.
    *   **Domain Expertise**: Specializing in areas like ML or hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:39">[02:37:39]</a>.
    *   **Team Expertise**: Excelling at managing managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:47">[02:38:47]</a>.
    *   **Growth**: Mastering strategies for product growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:47">[02:38:47]</a>.
    Picking a "lane" early on is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:21">[02:41:21]</a>.

2.  **Have a Story to Tell**: Think about the narrative you'll present to your next employer and the one after that <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:26">[02:42:26]</a>. Like Amazon writing a press release before a product, think about the story, the skills, and then solve your day-to-day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>. This "story" should highlight what *you* learned and did, not just "we" did <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>.

## Understanding Promotions: Why They Don't Happen

When someone isn't getting promoted, Nikhail suggests four common reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:57">[02:57:57]</a>:

1.  **Lack of Advocacy**: No one sees your "magic" or advocates for you, either your manager or the promotion committee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:26">[02:26:26]</a>. If this is the case, a shift within the project, finding a new manager, or leaving the company might be necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:51">[02:53:51]</a>.
2.  **No Role Exists**: Especially in current market conditions with layoffs and restructuring, the next logical role for promotion may simply not exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:51">[02:53:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:05">[02:57:05]</a>.
3.  **Impatience**: High performers often set aggressive promotion goals (e.g., annually) that don't align with the longer, more subtle progression required for leadership roles, which often depends on lagging impact metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:05">[02:57:05]</a>.
4.  **Undeclared Development Area**: There's a substantive development area that the individual doesn't recognize or refuses to address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:05">[02:57:05]</a>. Managers might be poor at identifying it, or the individual might reject feedback, clinging to their current identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:05">[02:57:05]</a>.

## The Importance of Real Feedback

To understand if you genuinely have a development area or if you're not being seen, seek "real feedback" rather than just formal feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. Formal feedback systems in large companies often differ significantly from the "ground truth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:45">[03:04:45]</a>.

### Tips for Getting Better Feedback:
*   **Be a Strong Listener**: Avoid justifying or correcting when receiving feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:13">[03:11:13]</a>.
*   **Triangulate Feedback**: Seek input from peers, those who see you all the time, and those who don't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:49">[03:41:49]</a>.
*   **Create Safety**: Ensure people feel safe to give honest feedback without fear of retaliation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:49">[03:41:49]</a>.
*   **Repeat and Appreciate**: Acknowledge the feedback by repeating it back to demonstrate understanding and express genuine appreciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:49">[03:41:49]</a>.
*   **Recognize Givers**: As a manager, publicly acknowledge and thank individuals who provide valuable feedback in team settings, encouraging others to do the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:49">[03:41:49]</a>.

## Becoming a Better Manager

Nikhail highlights that the tech industry has historically failed to adequately train managers, often promoting good individual contributors directly into management roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:14">[03:51:14]</a>. This creates an "epidemic" of challenges, from bias to ineffective coaching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:14">[03:51:14]</a>.

### Advice for New Managers:
1.  **Share the Steering Wheel**: Management is not about "divide and conquer" or simply "teaching to ride a bike" and then letting go. It's more like a "sidecar on a motorcycle," where you are attached but provide specific counsel, sharing the responsibility of driving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:14">[03:51:14]</a>.
2.  **Be Invited In**: Managers should not assume their organizational power grants them the right to manage. They must earn that right and be "invited in" by their reports, often by asking "What can I help you with?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:14">[03:51:14]</a>. Start by partnering on one or two specific areas rather than broadly managing.

## The Rise of the IC Path

Nikhail sees the increasing prominence of the individual contributor (IC) path as one of the best developments in the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:50">[04:40:50]</a>. Historically, product managers were often pushed into management roles, leading to "average managers" and a lack of true building experience for future leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:50">[04:40:50]</a>.

*   **Value of ICs**: Companies need builders who can crack complex market codes or navigate complicated organizational structures, not just people who manage others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:50">[04:40:50]</a>.
*   **Future**: The IC track is well-established in engineering and design, and product management is finally catching up, correcting a long-standing "bug" in the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:50">[04:40:50]</a>. While still in development, these tracks are becoming more solid and promising for builders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:50">[04:40:50]</a>.

## The "Shadows of Superpowers"

Senior leaders often face unique [[Career growth and strategic positioning | career growth]] challenges because their greatest strengths, or "superpowers," can cast "shadows" that become significant development areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>. The adage "what gets you there isn't what got you here" applies directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>.

*   **Examples**:
    *   A "great collaborator" who struggles when others don't agree with their opinion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>.
    *   An "amazing listener" who struggles to be decisive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>.
    *   Someone "strong politically" whose decisions become unprincipled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>.
*   **The Challenge**: Leaders may dismiss feedback on these "shadows" because they are tied to their identity and past successes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>. It requires rewiring oneself and recognizing that perceived "anomalies" in feedback are often insights into these development areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>.

## Mental Health Challenges at the Top

As individuals progress in their [[Career growth and strategic positioning | careers]], especially to senior leadership, they can encounter unexpected mental health challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:23:23">[06:23:23]</a>.

Nikhail uses the analogy of dog tracks: dogs chase a mechanical rabbit, but if they ever catch it, they stop running because their North Star is achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:14">[01:04:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:10">[01:05:10]</a>. Similarly, many professionals spend their lives focused on achieving a specific goal (e.g., becoming a VP, making a certain amount of money, starting a company) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:25">[01:05:25]</a>. Once achieved, often in their 30s, 40s, or 50s, they realize their career might be 60 years long, leaving them lost without a clear "what's next" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. This can lead to sadness, unhealthy habits, or creating conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:12">[01:06:12]</a>.

### The Second North Star: Giving
To combat this, Nikhail emphasizes the importance of developing a "second North Star" early in one's career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>. While early career stages (Act 1 and 2) may be about "taking" and "creating," later stages (Act 3) should focus on "giving" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:41">[01:09:41]</a>. This could involve:
*   Content creation and teaching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:52">[01:09:52]</a>.
*   Volunteering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:29">[01:10:29]</a>.
*   Starting a mission-based company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:29">[01:10:29]</a>.
*   Coaching and mentoring others to change their trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:37">[01:11:37]</a>.

## Building Community for Growth

Learning is a lifelong opportunity, and while self-service tools and structured teaching exist, community is the most powerful propellant for learning and growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>.

*   **Benefits of Community**: Communities offer a safe space for authentic conversations, shared experiences, and best practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>. They help individuals realize they are not alone in their struggles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>.
*   **The Skip CPO Community**: Nikhail co-founded "The Skip CPO Community" to address the loneliness of senior product roles. It connects Chief Product Officers (CPOs) in mid to late-stage companies through a WhatsApp channel and Zoom calls, fostering trust and shared learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>.

## Final Advice for PMs

The most impactful action any PM can take for their [[Career growth and strategic positioning | career growth]] is to ensure that the story they will tell about their current work is meaningful for their "skip job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:31">[01:21:31]</a>.

*   **Craft Your Story**: Before you start, think about what you want to write in six, twelve, or twenty-four months: "Here's the problem I solved, here's the skill I built, here's the headwind I faced, here's what I did to overcome it." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:31">[01:21:31]</a>.
*   **Use "I," Not "We"**: Focus on *your* individual contributions and learnings, not just team achievements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:11">[01:22:11]</a>.
*   **Evaluate**: If the story "sucks," re-evaluate how to make it compelling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:26">[01:22:26]</a>. A compelling story, regardless of formal promotion, signifies true career advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:41">[01:22:41]</a>.

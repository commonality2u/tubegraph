In high-leverage roles, the conventional approach of maximizing Return on Investment (ROI) for [[decision_making_in_product_management | project prioritization]] is often sub-optimal and potentially harmful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:07">[01:15:07]</a>. Instead, a more effective strategy is to focus on minimizing opportunity cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:15">[01:15:15]</a>.

## Why the ROI Mindset is Sub-Optimal for High-Leverage Roles

For individuals in [[balancing_output_and_impact_in_product_management_roles | high leverage roles]] such as product managers, founders, engineering leaders, or design leaders, there are often hundreds of tasks that could yield a positive ROI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:38">[01:14:38]</a>. Positive ROI simply means that the value created is greater than the value (or cost) of the time invested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:47">[01:14:47]</a>.

However, the ROI formula, which places time in the denominator (Value Created / Cost of Your Time), inadvertently encourages focusing on tasks that take less time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:20">[01:15:20]</a>. This often leads to prioritizing "low-hanging fruit" or "[[Speed vs Quality in Product Development | quick wins]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:04">[01:16:04]</a>. While there's nothing inherently wrong with [[Speed vs Quality in Product Development | quick wins]], consistently filling one's plate with them can lead to missing out on larger opportunities and significant upside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:17">[01:16:17]</a>.

## Shifting to an Opportunity Cost Mindset

Opportunity cost is defined as the value of the optimal option minus the value of the chosen option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:42">[01:16:42]</a>. The goal is to minimize this cost, which implies working on the optimal tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:57">[01:16:57]</a>.

This shift in mindset from "is this a good use of my time?" to "is this the best use of my time?" is subtle but profound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:10">[01:17:10]</a>. It compels individuals and teams to choose tasks they might never have considered with a pure ROI mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:22">[01:17:22]</a>.

### Practical Application

*   **Avoid Quantifying Opportunity Cost:** It is not recommended to try and numerically quantify opportunity cost in spreadsheets, as it can be a "lost cause" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:28">[01:21:28]</a>.
*   **Grant Freedom and Permission:** Leaders should give teams the freedom and permission to explore and pursue opportunities that minimize opportunity cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:47">[01:21:47]</a>.
*   **Allocate Time Strategically:** During planning, leaders can provide rough allocation guidance for different types of activities, similar to Google's classic 70/20/10 rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:12">[01:22:12]</a>.
    *   For example, a team might allocate:
        *   **60%** of time to incrementals (features that improve user lives daily, typically high ROI activities) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:12">[01:23:12]</a>.
        *   **30%** of time to big new initiatives (which might include one or two projects that, while potentially ambiguous, could significantly change the business's trajectory) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:37">[01:23:37]</a>.
        *   **10%** of time to stability and infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:49">[01:23:49]</a>.

This structured guidance encourages teams to pursue larger, potentially scarier projects, even if their immediate ROI isn't clear, because they address the greatest opportunity cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:40">[01:18:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:29">[01:20:29]</a>. This approach enables teams to make different [[strategies_for_simplifying_and_prioritizing_tasks_as_a_pm | prioritization]] decisions and can lead to significant business growth, as observed with Stripe Connect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:47">[01:20:47]</a>.

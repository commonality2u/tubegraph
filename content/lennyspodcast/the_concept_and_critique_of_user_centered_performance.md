User-centered performance refers to a [[customercentric_product_development | customer obsession]] or user-centered practice that is symbolic rather than focused on learning [00:00:00]. It is work done to signal [[customercentric_product_development | customer obsession]] rather than to inform different decisions [00:00:09]. This phenomenon is described as extremely common [00:00:23].

## Manifestations in Product Development

User-centered performance manifests in several ways:
*   **Late-Stage Validation Studies**: A common example is a Product Manager (PM) asking a researcher at the end of a product process to run a quick user study "just to validate our assumptions" [00:00:26]. At this stage, it is often "too late to matter" [00:00:32] as the product needs to ship, and the primary goal is to "check the box" [00:00:36].
*   **Reluctance to Be Wrong**: Many PMs and designers are not looking to be wrong; they are looking to validate their existing ideas, which exemplifies user-centered performance [00:00:45]. A contrasting mantra suggests, "we don't validate, we falsify" [00:00:39], meaning the goal is to actively seek out flaws and challenges to assumptions.
*   **Executive Listening Sessions**: Researchers are often asked to conduct executive listening sessions or focus groups, where PMs, founders, and designers want to "get close to the customer" [00:32:51]. While well-intentioned, these sessions can be "97% performance" [00:39:07] and not genuinely focused on learning or driving better outcomes [00:39:13].
*   **Middle-Range Research**: Doing too much "middle-range research" is a symptom of a broken system [00:08:47]. This type of research often addresses questions that are interesting but not impactful enough for the business, serving to fulfill a need to feel and be [[customercentric_product_development | user-centered]] without actually changing anything [00:10:04].

## Underlying Causes

*   **Signaling and "Product Management Theater"**: The drive to appear [[customercentric_product_development | customer-obsessed]] can lead to superficial engagement with user feedback. This aligns with the concept of [[product_management_theater | product management theater]], where actions are more about appearances than genuine impact [00:23:31].
*   **Cognitive Biases and Ego**: Confirmation bias and ego play a significant role. Many individuals do not want to be wrong and instead seek validation [00:25:52]. There is an important place for intuition in product development, but intuition can be a source of biases and blind spots [00:27:08].
*   **Research as a Service Function**: User-centered performance thrives when research is treated as a "service function" that gets called in reactively, often at the end of a process [00:15:04]. When researchers are not consistently involved from the beginning, they have less input on framing the right questions that would drive maximum business impact [00:15:25].
*   **"Zero Interest Rates Phenomenon" (ZIRP) Era**: During times of easy money, companies may have hired many user researchers with good intentions but failed to set them up for success by not properly integrating them or understanding research's purpose [00:11:32].

## Consequences

*   **Lack of Impact**: Research conducted under user-centered performance often fails to drive significant value or impact for the business [00:08:32].
*   **Delays and Inefficiency**: This approach can lead to delays as teams wait for research that may not be pointed enough to lead to clear decisions [00:13:38].
*   **Post Hoc Bias**: When research results are revealed, people often claim, "that was kind of obvious, we knew that already" [00:10:53]. This "hindsight bias" or "narrative fallacy" leads individuals to selectively remember things and construct narratives that make them feel like they already knew the outcome, even if they did not [00:43:55].
*   **Sidelining of Researchers**: When research is perceived as less impactful, researchers can be sidelined or even laid off, perpetuating a vicious cycle where their perceived lack of impact leads to reduced involvement [00:16:56].

## Overcoming User-Centered Performance

Moving beyond user-centered performance requires a shift in mindset and approach from both researchers and the companies they work with.

### For Researchers

*   **Diverse Skill Development**: Researchers should develop diverse skills beyond qualitative methods. These include:
    1.  **Formative/Generative User Experience Research**: Forward-looking, innovation-focused, open-ended, ethnographic research [00:18:11].
    2.  **Evaluative Research**: Usability testing [00:18:28].
    3.  **Rigorous Survey Design**: For scaled responses from communities [00:18:35].
    4.  **Applied Statistics**: Essential for understanding AB test results and quantitative data [00:18:46].
    5.  **Technical Skills**: Such as SQL for running queries or prompt engineering for interacting with generative AI [00:19:01].
*   **Business-Oriented Mindset**: Researchers need to be more profit-focused and explicitly find the overlap between user needs and business goals [00:21:45]. This includes understanding quarterly reports, shareholder calls, company strategies, OKRs, metrics, and conversion funnels [00:22:00].
*   **Focus on Falsification**: Embrace the mindset of looking to be wrong rather than seeking validation [00:26:04].
*   **Strong Relationships**: Building strong, trusting relationships with product managers and designers is crucial for [[the_relationship_between_product_managers_and_user_researchers | effective partnership]] [00:48:20].
*   **Prioritization and Saying No**: Researchers must learn to say no and focus on the most important projects, working with their partners to prioritize [00:48:44].

### For Companies and Product Teams

*   **[[integrating_user_research_effectively_into_product_development | Integrating user research effectively into product development]]**: Researchers should be consistently involved in the product development process from beginning to end, rather than being a reactive service function [00:14:32]. This deeper [[integrating_user_research_effectively_into_product_development | integration]] fosters better framing of research questions and maximizes impact [00:15:11].
*   **Leveraging Micro and Macro Research**: While middle-range research can slow things down, companies should focus on micro-level usability research (which can provide significant business value quickly) and macro-level strategic planning research [00:34:52].
*   **Embracing Disagreement and Diverse Perspectives**: Foster a culture where product teams are open to having their intuition challenged by evidence [00:27:08]. Bringing in "the wisdom of the crowd" with diverse sources of information and judgment can help check assumptions and biases [00:30:00].
*   **Unified Success Metrics**: All team members, including PMs, engineers, designers, and researchers, should share the same metrics for success to ensure collective effort towards product improvement [00:31:51].
*   **Optimal Researcher-to-Team Ratio**: The ideal ratio of researchers depends on the product stage and company context, but the key is to ensure researchers have consistent, engaged partners [00:57:29]. Even early-stage startups can benefit significantly from a researcher's ability to drive value and answer otherwise impossible questions [00:59:14].
*   **Breaking Down Silos**: Companies should avoid siloing different insights disciplines (e.g., UX research, consumer insights, market research). Integrating these functions can provide a more unified and comprehensive understanding of customer feedback, as experienced at Airbnb [00:49:29].

By adopting these changes, the [[the_evolution_and_challenges_within_the_user_research_field | user research field]] can evolve from its past challenges to become a more impactful and indispensable part of product development [01:02:50].

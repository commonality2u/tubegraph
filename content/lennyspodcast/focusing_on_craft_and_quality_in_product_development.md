Kii Sarin, co-founder and CEO of Linear, emphasizes that in any domain or industry, the more a product matters, the more its design matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. While early iterations of new paradigms (like mobile or web) might not need to be exceptionally well-designed because they are the first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>, the bar significantly rises as more products enter the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Today, a high level of design is almost a basic requirement for people to even pay attention or consider a product seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Linear's Approach to Craft and Quality

Linear, a leading issue tracking tool, is known for its intense focus on craft and quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Their philosophy stands out:
*   No A/B tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
*   No metric-based goals for features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
*   A strong focus on taste and opinions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

This commitment to quality is seen as essential for business success, especially for collaboration tools like Linear, where friction or a poor experience can be annoying for users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

### [[balancing_speed_and_quality_in_product_development | Balancing Speed and Quality]]

While prioritizing craft can sometimes push timelines back by a few days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>, Linear employs strategies to [[balancing_speed_and_quality_in_product_development | balance speed and quality]]:
*   **Internal and Beta Releases**: Features are first shipped to production, visible only to internal teams for testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
*   **Early Customer Feedback**: They then seek out interested customers for a beta program (1-10 customers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. In these early stages, the experience might be "janky" or unpolished, as the goal is to get early feedback for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.
*   **Co-creation with Customers**: For larger company-facing features, they often work directly with a large company to co-create and evolve the feature, gathering feedback along the way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.
*   **Later Polish**: The full general release is when significant attention is paid to polish and craft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. This contrasts with a "perfection mindset" that can prevent anything from being released <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.

### [[strategies_for_operationalizing_quality_in_design | Operationalizing Quality]]

Linear's success in upholding quality is due to several key [[strategies_for_operationalizing_quality_in_design | strategies for operationalizing quality in design]]:

*   **Hiring Philosophy**: They prioritize hiring individuals who inherently care about craft and product quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. The hiring process seeks candidates interested in a broader scope beyond their specific skill set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:28">[00:20:28]</a>.
*   **Leadership Alignment**: All co-founders, including those with engineering backgrounds, are deeply involved in and committed to design details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. It's crucial for founders to align on the value of quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>.
*   **Empowered Project Teams**: Unlike many companies with specialized roles, Linear has minimal Product Managers (only one Head of Product) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:29">[00:29:29]</a>. Project teams, consisting of engineers and designers, are given significant ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>. This allows them to identify and implement quality improvements, such as an engineer proactively creating "safe areas" for right-click sub-menus to improve usability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>.
*   **Culture of Trust**: There isn't a culture of constant reviews before shipping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. Instead, teams are encouraged to put things into the app, which can then be tried out and refined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.
*   **Intuition Over Metrics**: Linear doesn't typically set specific metric goals for features or rely on A/B testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>. Success is defined by customers agreeing the problem is solved and enjoying the solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00">[00:45:00]</a>.
*   **Deep User Understanding**: The entire team is encouraged to engage directly with users, through calls, customer Slack channels, and internal discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:01">[00:46:01]</a>. This constant exposure to user needs and problems builds empathy and understanding, allowing for informed intuitive decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:11">[00:47:11]</a>. This forms the "magic" part of their "magic and science" approach to product management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:09">[00:47:09]</a>.
*   **Acceptance of Mistakes**: The company culture embraces that mistakes will happen, and they can be fixed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:52">[00:49:52]</a>.

### Design as a Differentiator

Design and user experience serve as a significant differentiator for Linear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.
*   **Crowded Markets**: In crowded product categories, where users have many choices, design helps a product stand out as the "best" or "highest quality" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:28">[00:29:28]</a>.
*   **Building Brand**: A strong brand, built through consistent actions, communication, and product quality, can draw people in and set expectations before they even use the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:56">[00:27:56]</a>. Authenticity in brand building is key, avoiding superficial imitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:59">[00:30:59]</a>.
*   **User Acquisition and Retention**: Good design and a strong brand can enable user acquisition and improve user retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:02">[00:28:02]</a>. For a B2B product like Linear, which is in the "retention and trust business," continuously delivering a quality product is crucial for long-term customer relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:10">[00:51:10]</a>.

## The Linear Method: Opinionated Software and Cycles

Linear's development philosophy, known as "The Linear Method," emphasizes [[developing_and_implementing_product_strategy | building opinionated software]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:52">[00:38:52]</a>.
*   **Opinionated Software**: This means providing "good defaults" or "good opinions" on how features and workflows should operate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:31">[00:40:31]</a>. The goal is to free users from spending excessive time configuring tools, allowing them to focus on their actual work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:15">[00:41:15]</a>. It's challenging to design everything for everyone, so an opinionated approach aims for the most optimized solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:50">[00:40:50]</a>.
*   **Cycles**: Similar to sprints, cycles are optional timeframes (e.g., 1-2 weeks) where teams focus on a prioritized list of tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:15">[00:42:15]</a>. This helps teams avoid distraction from an "infinite list of things to do" and maintain focus on current priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:53">[00:41:53]</a>.

## Fostering a Product-Oriented Culture

[[building_a_productfocused_company_culture | Building a product-focused company culture]] that prioritizes craft and quality is deeply ingrained in Linear. This includes:
*   [[building_a_productoriented_engineering_culture | Building a product-oriented engineering culture]] where engineers and designers take ownership of product decisions and quality beyond their specific tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>.
*   The hiring process specifically screens for "product sensibility" â€“ the ability to form and articulate opinions about product design and functionality, backed by reasoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:05">[01:07:05]</a>.
*   A company-wide focus on "main quests" (core product development) and avoiding "side quests" (distractions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:48">[00:55:48]</a>.
*   The life motto "go slow to go fast" reflects their belief in taking time to think and plan before executing, which ultimately leads to faster and better results by avoiding rushed mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:04">[01:36:04]</a>.

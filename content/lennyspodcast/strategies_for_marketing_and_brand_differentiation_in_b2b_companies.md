Whiz, co-founded by Ros Herberg (Chief Marketing Officer and VP of Product Strategy), has experienced unprecedented growth, hitting $100 million ARR in just 18 months, becoming the fastest-growing software company in history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:58"> [01:36:58]</a>. The company's journey from an initial misstep to hyper-growth offers valuable insights into effective marketing and brand differentiation for B2B companies.

## Identifying Product-Market Fit: The Foundation of Growth

Initially, Whiz (then officially founded as Beyond Networks) struggled to define its product, leading to confusion among even the first product manager, Ros Herberg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53"> [00:09:53]</a>. The company was focused on network security, a departure from the founding team's prior experience in cloud security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48"> [00:07:48]</a>.

During this period, the team engaged in 10 to 15 meetings daily with potential customers, presenting their idea with a deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36"> [00:08:36]</a>. While customers responded with polite interest ("Oh Yes sounds interesting") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20"> [00:09:20]</a>, there was a lack of clarity, even for the product manager who was supposed to begin building the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56"> [00:09:56]</a>. This polite affirmation was misleading because customers are not incentivized to deeply challenge a smart group of people building something they assume is interesting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05"> [00:11:05]</a>. This highlights a common human bias to seek affirmation over critical feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51"> [00:13:51]</a>.

### Signals of Product-Market Fit

A crucial pivot occurred when Ros vocalized her confusion about what the company was actually building, leading to a deep discussion among the founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24"> [00:10:24]</a>. They shifted focus to cloud security, a domain they knew best from prior experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21"> [00:18:21]</a>.

Upon this pivot, the type of questions from potential customers dramatically changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12"> [00:13:12]</a>. Instead of general interest, customers began asking:
*   "How are you pricing this?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22"> [00:13:22]</a>
*   "When can we start doing a PO (Proof of Value)?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28"> [00:13:28]</a>
*   "I know exactly who I need to connect you to in my team" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31"> [00:13:31]</a>

These questions demonstrated a strong "pull" from the customer, indicating genuine enthusiasm and a desire for the next step in the [[purchasing_process_challenges_in_b2b_environments | purchasing process]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24"> [00:14:24]</a>. Even when Whiz deliberately imposed technical questionnaires to gauge commitment and buy time for development, a Fortune 10 company quickly returned the completed document, signifying high commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40"> [00:19:40]</a>. This "pull" from the customer is critical for identifying [[differentiated_value_and_its_role_in_sales | differentiated value]] and ensuring true interest, especially for early-stage B2B products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27"> [00:20:27]</a>.

## Founder-Led Sales: Building Confidence and Understanding

Before hiring a dedicated sales team, Whiz's founders, including Ros, personally handled sales, closing deals themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51"> [00:21:51]</a>. This unconventional approach, born out of the rapid pace of product-market fit, provided invaluable learning for the core team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:02"> [00:22:02]</a>. It instilled confidence when hiring the first sales professionals, allowing the founders to demonstrate that the product could indeed be sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:08"> [00:22:08]</a>. The lesson: if the core team can't sell the product, it's wishful thinking to expect an external hire to magically solve the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:54"> [00:22:54]</a>.

## Marketing as the Next "Heat" Source for Growth

Ros's transition from engineer to product manager, and then to Chief Marketing Officer and VP of Product Strategy at Whiz, was an unconventional path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:01"> [00:24:01]</a>. She views the company's focus, or "heat," as shifting with growth:
1.  **Product Kitchen:** Early days, focus on building something desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:24"> [00:28:24]</a>.
2.  **Engineering:** Once the idea is clear, focus on making it work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:38"> [00:28:38]</a>.
3.  **Sales:** After initial deals, focus on scaling sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:49"> [00:28:49]</a>.
4.  **Marketing:** At a certain scale, the "heat" moves to marketing to build awareness and generate pipeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:58"> [00:28:58]</a>.

Whiz reached a point where, despite strong product-market fit and a functioning sales team, they were losing potential customers who hadn't heard of them before signing with a competitor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:12"> [00:25:12]</a>. This highlighted a critical need for increased awareness and brand building, even for a complex B2B product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:26"> [00:27:26]</a>.

## Marketing Philosophy: Taking Risks and Embracing "No Cost"

Ros's approach to marketing is distinctly different from her product background:
*   **Product:** "Less is more." Adding a feature has a high cost (engineering time, future complexity, irreversible) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:56"> [00:36:56]</a>. Mistakes in product are costly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:33"> [00:37:33]</a>.
*   **Marketing:** "No cost to anything." There's no maintenance or technical debt. If a marketing effort fails, it can be quickly abandoned without lasting impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:42"> [00:37:42]</a>. This encourages experimentation and a willingness to "try everything" to "make a lot of noise" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:05"> [00:38:05]</a>.

This philosophy enabled bold moves to differentiate Whiz's brand:

### Brand Differentiation Through Unconventionality

Whiz consciously chose a completely opposite approach to brand from typical cybersecurity companies, which often use dark colors and fear-based messaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:09"> [00:39:09]</a>. Instead, Whiz adopted a positive, optimistic brand with bright colors (pink, bright blue) and a focus on "magic" over "scaring people from the attack" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:23"> [00:39:23]</a>.

A prime example of this was their "Whiz of Oz" booth at RSA, a major cybersecurity conference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:12"> [00:38:12]</a>. Instead of a classical cyber booth, it looked like a Wizard of Oz set with actors like Dorothy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:52"> [00:38:52]</a>. This highly unconventional approach made Whiz stand out dramatically, increasing booth traffic fivefold from the previous year in the same space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:06"> [00:40:06]</a>. This success led to other cyber companies beginning to adopt themed booths, demonstrating the impact of this [[b2b_growth_strategies | brand differentiation strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:22"> [00:40:22]</a>.

### The "Dummy Explanation": Simplifying Complex B2B Concepts

A key learning for product leaders moving into marketing is the need for crystal-clear communication that scales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:25"> [00:46:25]</a>. Product people often live "inside their own bubble," using technical jargon and acronyms (e.g., "CSPM," "CNAPP") that are not understood by the broader market or even sellers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:32"> [00:47:32]</a>.

Ros emphasizes the "dummy explanation" concept: ensuring that every message is understandable by anyone, without assuming deep knowledge of the product or market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:50"> [00:49:50]</a>. For example, instead of saying "the Whiz graph database," simplify it for a common person who wouldn't know it by that name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:38"> [00:49:38]</a>. This simplifies the message and helps overcome challenges like those related to [[seo_best_practices_for_b2b_companies | SEO best practices for B2B companies]] by aligning language with how buyers actually search (e.g., "Cloud security solution" instead of "CNAPP") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:05"> [00:48:05]</a>.

Marketing, especially product marketing, bridges the gap between deep technical understanding and market perception, acting as a multiplier for messages that need to be clear to scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:41"> [00:45:41]</a>. This highlights the [[importance_of_product_positioning_in_b2b_tech | importance of product positioning in B2B tech]] to ensure clear, black-and-white communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:27"> [00:46:27]</a>.

## Embracing Failure and Cultivating Trust

Ros's personal mindset of being "okay with failing" is central to her leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40"> [00:40:40]</a>. She believes in attempting things even when unsure of success, and that taking opportunities to fail is empowering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:22"> [00:41:22]</a>. This approach fosters a culture where challenging norms and taking risks is acceptable, as seen in Whiz's marketing experiments.

For a CMO, building deep trust with the founding team is paramount, as marketing efforts are highly visible and represent the company to the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:22"> [00:34:22]</a>. This trust, combined with a deep connection to the product and market, is crucial for success, especially when coming from a non-traditional background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:23"> [00:35:23]</a>.

## The Whiz Culture: Flat, Open, and Impact-Driven

Whiz maintains a flat organizational structure and an open culture, where employees are empowered to drive impact regardless of title or experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:55"> [00:52:55]</a>. This environment fosters loyalty and encourages employees to contribute to strategy and decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:07"> [00:53:07]</a>. The founding team, with 20+ years of working together across military and successful ventures, operates with complete trust and clear domains, enabling rapid decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:09"> [00:52:09]</a>.

Whiz's success in cloud security stems from addressing the biggest growing market in security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:12"> [01:03:12]</a>. As a "market of leaders" (similar to buying insurance), being perceived as the leader in a new space is critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:49"> [01:03:49]</a>, reinforcing the importance of strong brand and marketing for [[differentiation_and_cost_leadership_strategies | differentiation and cost leadership strategies]].

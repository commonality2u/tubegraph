[[Developing a growth model | Growth models]] serve as an analytical representation of how a business grows, typically constructed in a spreadsheet to force a deep understanding of its mechanisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. A significant portion of the value derived from a [[developing_a_growth_model | growth model]] comes from the process of building it, which compels an understanding of the business's inner workings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. While not a forecasting tool, it is invaluable for assessing opportunities and understanding the impact of various initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

## Retention as a Core Building Block
For a typical SaaS business, a [[developing_a_growth_model | growth model]] fundamentally consists of three components:
1.  **Acquisition Channels**: This involves understanding traffic sources, spend, and conversion rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.
2.  **Retention**: This measures the rate at which customers activate and how long they remain active, often represented by a monthly retention curve or survival rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.
3.  **Monetization**: This accounts for the revenue generated per customer, such as monthly or annual fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

These three building blocks are essential for most businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. However, the true insights emerge when considering the non-linear aspects, such as virality or reinvestment of contribution margin, which significantly impact growth speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

## The Disproportionate Impact of Retention
Experience in building numerous [[developing_a_growth_model | growth models]] reveals that a business's growth is "much more sensitive to customer retention than you can ever intuit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>. This is due to the strong interplay between a healthy retained customer base and other crucial metrics, including customer referrals, content generation, and contribution margin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>.

> "a smaller percentage gain on retention is often much more valuable than making a bigger change in some other area and as a result you may be misallocated your product and growth resources in a pretty significant way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>

At Thumbtack, for instance, building a [[developing_a_growth_model | growth model]] made it immediately clear that the company was "exceptionally sensitive to the repeat rate of new customers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a>. This insight led to a significant shift in resources from top-of-funnel [[marketing_strategies_and_growth | marketing]] efforts, such as SEO and conversion rate optimization, to deeper life cycle initiatives like cross-selling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>. This strategic pivot ultimately led to a "much much better customer journey" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:34">[00:20:34]</a>.

## Strategies for Improving Retention
Improving retention is challenging because it "is the culmination of the entire product experience" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>. The decision for users to return is influenced by every interaction they have with the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:08">[00:21:08]</a>.

Key advice for improving retention includes:
*   **Focus on the Customer Experience**: Instead of relying solely on "growth product levers" like emails or push notifications, efforts should concentrate on understanding and improving the core customer experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:13">[00:21:13]</a>. In a Marketplace context, this often means focusing on the depth of supply or the quality of interactions with suppliers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:21:26]</a>.
*   **Prioritize the Early User Experience**: The most significant gains in retention often come from "inflecting the early user experience" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>. The initial interactions provide a crucial opportunity to demonstrate the product's value and build foundational understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:05">[00:22:05]</a>. Identifying and streamlining variable or poor early experiences can significantly improve long-term retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>. For example, Uber and Lyft guarantee high first-week earnings for drivers to "homogenize" the initial experience, pulling up below-average first experiences to improve retention curves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>.
*   **Avoid Over-Reliance on Resurrection Efforts**: While tempting to target churned users, convincing them to return is "very hard" because they've already decided not to use the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:46">[00:24:46]</a>. Focusing on new users typically offers "much higher leverage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:53">[00:24:53]</a>.

## Retention in Marketplaces and Product Development
In marketplaces, the health of the business is closely tied to retention. Measures like "share of wallet"—the percentage of a customer's total spend or a seller's total business that occurs on the platform—are critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:43">[00:30:43]</a>. A higher share of wallet indicates a deeper customer relationship, leading to better future retention and increased defensibility against competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:10">[00:31:10]</a>.

For any business, especially marketplaces, sustainable growth hinges on delivering an "incredible end-to-end customer experience" first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:37">[00:45:37]</a>. Rapid expansion or heavy [[marketing_strategies_and_growth | go-to-market]] spend without a solid, enjoyable product experience is unsustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:54">[00:45:54]</a>. When cohorts show strong retention and engagement, it provides the necessary conviction for further investment and growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:27">[00:46:27]</a>.

When considering adding a SaaS component to a marketplace, the focus should remain on creating a better customer experience by solving painful problems, which in turn enhances product stickiness and improves retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:26">[00:48:26]</a>. Prioritizing a "liquid high performance Marketplace" is essential before exploring such expansion [[implementing_productled_growth | levers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:16">[00:49:16]</a>.

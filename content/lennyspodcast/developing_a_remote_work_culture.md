Developing a culture in a remote or [[running_a_remote_and_distributed_team_effectively | distributed team]] environment requires intentionality, especially in the early stages of a company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:01">[00:58:01]</a>. Deal, a global payroll, HR, and compliance platform, operated remotely from day one, which allowed for the natural development of a unique culture.

## Core Cultural Pillars at Deal

Deal's culture is built on core values that emphasize action, positivity, and customer-centricity:

### Deal Speed
This concept embodies acting with urgency on behalf of customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:30">[00:55:30]</a>. It means ensuring customer problems are solved quickly, often within 24 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:41">[00:55:41]</a>, and building new products in a fraction of the time competitors might <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:48">[00:55:48]</a>. Employees are expected to constantly push themselves to act with urgency and find the quickest way to solve problems properly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:57">[00:55:57]</a>.

### Default Optimism
In a new and evolving space, maintaining a positive outlook is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:09">[00:56:09]</a>. Pessimism can slow things down; instead, employees are encouraged to believe something will work for specific reasons and then identify and mitigate associated risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:21">[00:56:21]</a>.

### Customer Care
Recognizing the human element in their work is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:37">[00:56:37]</a>. Deal manages people's livelihoods, including payroll and legal compliance, making it deeply personal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:42">[00:56:42]</a>. The focus is on a business paying a human so they can live their lives and the business can continue growing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:06">[00:57:06]</a>.

## Fostering a Remote Culture

### Flexibility and Autonomy
Deal provides employees with the flexibility to choose how and when they perform their jobs, including where they work from and their hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:23">[00:57:23]</a>. This freedom allows individuals to set up their lives as they wish, provided they deliver on expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:32">[00:57:32]</a>. This intense but rewarding culture is part of what sets the company apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:39">[00:57:39]</a>.

### Authenticity and Camaraderie
Operating remotely from day one meant employees could show up as their authentic selves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:40">[01:04:40]</a>. This led to colleagues meeting each other's pets and partners on camera, fostering a sense of sincerity and camaraderie that might not develop as quickly in a traditional office setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:44">[01:04:44]</a>. There was no pressure to dress up or conform to a certain professional image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:58">[01:04:58]</a>.

### Formalizing Values
While culture evolves organically, formalizing values helps solidify them. Deal's core values were established about a year into the company's existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:08">[00:58:08]</a>. These values were not invented but rather recognized from existing practices and common phrases used internally, such as "Deal speed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:12">[00:58:12]</a>. This approach ensures that values reflect "who you are" rather than "who you hope to be," making them more genuine and impactful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:04">[00:59:04]</a>.

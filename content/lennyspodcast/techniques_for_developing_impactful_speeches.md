Developing impactful speeches involves adopting a conversational style, understanding the subconscious nature of communication, and utilizing specific preparation and practice techniques. Public speaking is considered a [[transformative_nature_of_improving_public_speaking_skills | meta-skill]] that can accelerate one's professional and personal life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>.

## Core Principles and Mindset

The approach to impactful public speaking emphasizes an internal shift rather than merely focusing on external tactics.

### Speak Conversationally
Many people adopt a formal "public speaking voice" when put on the spot, even if they speak normally in casual settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, speaking conversationally is far more freeing, powerful, connecting, and effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>. The goal is to "think out loud" rather than overthinking or controlling every word <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:27">[01:18:27]</a>.

### Find Enjoyment
If you don't enjoy speaking, it's a sign that something is being done wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:13:00">[09:13:00]</a>. Humans are naturally evolved to speak, so it should be a rewarding activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:00">[09:41:00]</a>. When feeling like yourself, communication is enjoyable and empowering, serving as a means to connect and share thoughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:27:00">[10:27:00]</a>. Practice itself must also be enjoyable to ensure consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:41:00">[11:41:00]</a>.

### Speaking as a Subconscious Flow
Impactful speaking is a subconscious, flow-oriented process, not a conscious one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:27">[01:12:27]</a>. When speaking effectively, the speaker is not thinking about the act of speaking, but rather is completely in tune with the message being conveyed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:52">[01:12:52]</a>. The objective is to enter and maintain a flow state throughout the speech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:09">[01:13:09]</a>. This means addressing root causes of speaking issues (e.g., discomfort with slowing down) rather than just symptoms (e.g., filler words) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:40">[01:13:40]</a>.

### Harnessing Natural Ability
Humans possess incredible "hardware" for speaking, as babies learn to speak without formal education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:00">[07:54:00]</a>. Over time, "bugs in the software" (e.g., self-consciousness, overthinking, anxiety) can hinder this natural ability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:13:00">[08:13:00]</a>. The path to improvement involves debugging and upgrading this internal software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40:00">[08:40:00]</a>, allowing the inherent "superpower" of speech to emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46:00">[07:46:00]</a>.

## Tactical Advice for Delivery

While the focus is on internal shifts, certain tactical adjustments can significantly improve outward appearance and confidence.

*   **Think Up**: When gathering thoughts, avoid looking down, as it can appear unconfident or distracted (especially on video calls). Instead, look up. This makes you appear thoughtful and confident by default, reducing interruptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:23">[01:16:23]</a>. A simple reminder like a "think up" sticky note can help establish this habit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>.
*   **End Strong**: People often "end weak," either trailing off or verbalizing self-doubt at the conclusion of their statements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:05">[01:18:05]</a>. This can negatively color the audience's perception of the entire message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:14">[01:19:14]</a>. To counter this, anticipate this natural tendency to "slow down" at the finish line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:51">[01:19:51]</a> and consciously "land the plane" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:10">[01:20:10]</a>. Using "summary prompts" (e.g., "So to wrap up...", "In summary...") can help guide your brain to a clear conclusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:25">[01:20:25]</a>.
*   **Stay in Character**: Speakers often self-sabotage by "leaking" insecurities (e.g., nervous laughter, verbalizing doubt like "I don't really know if that makes sense") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. This breaks character and forces the audience to view the speaker through a lens of uncertainty, even if they initially perceived competence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>. The solution is simple: don't share your insecurities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>. Stay in character from beginning to end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>. Most of the time, the audience cannot perceive your internal nervousness unless you reveal it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. This practice reinforces confidence because the audience will react positively, confirming that "I didn't need to break character" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.

## Preparation Methods

For planned talks and presentations, specific methods can help structure content and internalize the message.

### The Accordion Method
The Accordion Method is a preparation technique that revolutionizes how speeches are built, moving away from script-writing and memorization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:17">[01:24:17]</a>. The traditional approach (dumping ideas, writing scripts, memorizing) is inefficient and prone to failure if one link in the "memorization chain" is missed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:01">[01:25:01]</a>.

Instead, the Accordion Method involves preparing by *speaking* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:29">[01:26:29]</a>:
1.  **Go Down the Accordion**: Start by speaking the full duration of your talk (e.g., 3 minutes). Then, progressively reduce the time limit (e.g., 2 minutes, 1 minute, down to 30 seconds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:31">[01:28:31]</a>. With each reduction, eliminate unnecessary "noise" to distill the core message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:31">[01:29:31]</a>.
2.  **Go Up the Accordion**: Once at the shortest duration (e.g., 30 seconds), progressively increase the time limit back up (e.g., 1 minute, 2 minutes, back to 3 minutes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:06">[01:30:06]</a>. This allows for intentional reintroduction of supporting points or stories, ensuring every element serves a clear purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:26">[01:30:26]</a>.

This process clarifies the essence of the talk, making it intentional and internalized rather than memorized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:51">[01:30:51]</a>. Speakers gain immense mental space and flexibility to deliver the talk within various timeframes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:33">[01:31:33]</a>.

### The Bow and Arrow Technique
This technique shifts the focus from "what I want to say" to "what I want my audience to remember" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:31">[01:38:31]</a>.

*   **The Arrow (One Thing)**: The "arrow" is a single, clear sentence that is the *only* thing the audience should remember from the talk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:22">[01:39:22]</a>. This "North Star" provides clarity for the speaker and audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:42">[01:39:42]</a>.
*   **The Bow (Support)**: The "bow" is the supporting content—anecdotes, data points, stories, or examples—that add weight and emotion to the arrow, increasing its impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:02">[01:40:02]</a>.

This technique is applicable at both macro and micro levels. For a full presentation with slides, define one core "arrow" for the entire talk. Then, for each slide, identify its individual "one thing" to ensure clarity and purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:26">[01:42:26]</a>. A useful [[building_effective_communication_strategies | pro tip]] is to make the title of each slide exactly the one thing you want the audience to take away from it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:23">[01:43:23]</a>.

## Practice and Games

Effective public speaking relies heavily on practice. While traditional methods often involve giving talks or presentations, structured [[public_speaking_exercises_and_games | games]] can provide more targeted and enjoyable practice.

*   You cannot get better at speaking without speaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>.
*   Games are fun, providing intrinsic reward necessary for consistent practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.
*   They offer short, deliberate practice reps followed by immediate feedback, allowing for quick adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>.
*   Games create "turbulence" (simulated challenges) that highlight areas for improvement and build resilience, similar to a pilot's flight simulator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>. This helps speakers learn to recover gracefully from mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:00">[04:38:00]</a>.
*   They push back the "sides of the box" of self-consciousness, expanding the speaker's range and comfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>.

### Examples of Games:
*   **Conductor**: This game helps speakers tap into different energy levels and emotions. A speaker is given a topic and instructed to speak while adapting their voice and intensity to random numbers (1-10) or "breathe" prompts appearing on screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>. It teaches that tapping into a specific energy creates emotion, and words naturally follow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>. Practicing this can reveal a speaker's natural comfort zone (e.g., highs or lows) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>.
*   **Triple Step**: Designed for those who struggle to stay on track or get easily distracted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>. The speaker receives a random title and must integrate random words or phrases seamlessly into their speech as they appear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19:00">[05:19:00]</a>. This builds resiliency and the ability to stay composed amidst unexpected interruptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:00">[05:55:00]</a>. It also serves as an excellent warm-up exercise for important speaking engagements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:00">[05:55:00]</a>.
*   **Conviction Prompts**: A game to build executive presence by forcing the speaker into a state of conviction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:11">[01:10:11]</a>. The speaker is given a random topic and must integrate specific "conviction prompts" (e.g., "This matters a ton," "I genuinely believe...") as the beginning of sentences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:36">[01:10:36]</a>. This helps speakers stand more truly behind their words, allowing their ideas to have greater impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:43">[01:11:43]</a>.

## Avoiding the "Bullshitter" Alarm
A common fear when trying to speak more freely or confidently is becoming a "bullshitter"—someone who masters communication skills but lacks substance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:22">[01:20:22]</a>. This fear can trigger an "immune response" that holds people back from speaking freely or confidently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:02">[01:21:02]</a>.

However, if the thought of becoming a bullshitter even crosses your mind, it means you possess the acute skill set to notice when others are doing it, and thus, you have a strong internal compass for yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:44">[01:21:44]</a>. The goal is to develop the same level of effective communication as a "bullshitter," but with solid ideas and effort to back it up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:07">[01:22:07]</a>. This internal listener will naturally ping you when you are at your limit, ensuring you stay true to your message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:47">[01:22:47]</a>.

## Conclusion
Improving public speaking is an empowering and addictive journey. By focusing on natural, conversational delivery, understanding the subconscious flow, and utilizing structured practice through games and preparation methods like the Accordion and Bow and Arrow, individuals can unlock their innate communication abilities. This not only leads to more impactful speeches but also has a [[transformative_nature_of_improving_public_speaking_skills | profound positive impact]] on all areas of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:11">[01:44:11]</a>.

Maggie Crowley, VP of Product at Toast, highlights the importance of [[becoming_more_strategic_in_product_management | becoming more strategic in product management]] and tactically writing out a product strategy to share with teams and managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. While [[product_strategy_and_vision_development | strategy]] is a crucial component of a Product Manager's (PM) role, it represents only about 5% of the overall work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. The ultimate success of a PM hinges on their ability to ship more products and create tangible impact, rather than solely possessing a good strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.

## Components of a Product Strategy Document

Crowley outlines a comprehensive approach to writing a product strategy, often stemming from feedback about needing to be "more strategic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:16">[00:35:16]</a>. This process was initially developed to satisfy an engineer who desired a deeper understanding of the team's direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:48">[00:35:48]</a>. The document is typically a Google Doc, structured with simple bullets and headers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>.

The strategy document serves as a "home base" for decisions and helps align the team around the problem being solved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:30">[00:51:30]</a>.

### Core Sections:

1.  **Mission and Goals** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:05">[00:36:05]</a>
    *   The overall company mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:05">[00:36:05]</a>.
    *   High-level framing of current work and goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:10">[00:36:10]</a>.
    *   Current quarter's business goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:30">[00:36:30]</a>.

2.  **The Landscape** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:14">[00:36:14]</a>
    *   What is happening with the business and products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:19">[00:36:19]</a>.
    *   Point of view on the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:19">[00:36:19]</a>.
    *   Competitor analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:24">[00:36:24]</a>.
    *   SWOT analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:24">[00:36:24]</a>.
    *   Key risks being faced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:24">[00:36:24]</a>.

3.  **Current State Assessment** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:46">[00:36:46]</a>
    *   An honest accounting of the product's current state and the overall business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:47">[00:36:47]</a>.
    *   What works and what doesn't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:51">[00:36:51]</a>.
    *   Customer feedback, user insights, and support tickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:58">[00:36:58]</a>.
    *   Technical hurdles, significant tech debt, and upcoming technical considerations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:04">[00:37:04]</a>.

4.  **The Opportunity** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:33">[00:37:33]</a>
    *   The top one or two opportunities that emerge from the assessment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">[00:37:37]</a>.
    *   Where the team wants to "play" and where they can "win" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">[00:37:37]</a>.
    *   Identification of unique competitive advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:42">[00:37:42]</a>.

5.  **Challenges** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:55">[00:37:55]</a>
    *   The most difficult aspects of pursuing the identified opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:55">[00:37:55]</a>.
    *   What conditions or factors must be true for the strategy to succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:59">[00:37:59]</a>.

6.  **Proposed Solution / What to Do** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:06">[00:38:06]</a>
    *   A concise swing at the solution, detailing what needs to be built and how it might work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:12">[00:38:12]</a>.
    *   Ideally limited to three main bullet points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:18">[00:38:18]</a>.

7.  **The Plan** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:26">[00:38:26]</a>
    *   How to sequence the work, organize the team, and estimate costs, assuming no external opinions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:26">[00:38:26]</a>.

### Writing and Sharing the Strategy

The strategy document can be quite long, potentially 20 pages or more, including screenshots and external website content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:10">[00:42:10]</a>. It's often written with a summary at the very top, following the Minto Pyramid principle, to quickly convey the main conclusion and suggestion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:55">[00:41:55]</a>.

Crowley emphasizes that the primary purpose of writing such a detailed document is for the PM themselves, acting as "homework" to ensure confidence in decisions and to facilitate effective communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:01">[00:43:01]</a>. It's crucial to share the document with everyone, ensuring there are no secrets, and that the logic chain from the company mission to individual team priorities is clear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:35">[00:38:35]</a>. This allows for arguments and disagreements to focus on specific points of data or feedback, rather than general disagreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:08">[00:39:08]</a>.

A common application of this strategy document is for annual or quarterly planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:55">[00:45:55]</a>. It's also useful when a product or team needs to pivot, or when a new opportunity needs to be thoroughly explored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:18">[00:46:18]</a>.

It's common for PMs to realize, after developing a sound strategy, that their current roadmap is "bloated" with unrelated tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:31">[00:47:31]</a>. While a PM may not have the authority to scrap the entire roadmap, this exercise still allows for critical evaluation and helps determine if ongoing work is the most important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:47">[00:47:47]</a>.

## One-Pager Template for Product Teams

Beyond the detailed strategy document, Crowley also touches on the one-pager (or PRD/spec), which is the PM's core artifact for defining what a product team is building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:03">[00:50:03]</a>. The most important section of this document is the initial part, focusing on the "why" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:51">[00:50:51]</a>:

*   **Background and Context** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:01">[00:52:01]</a>.
*   **The Problem** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:01">[00:52:01]</a>.
*   **Why this problem matters** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:01">[00:52:01]</a>.
*   **Why this problem matters now** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:07">[00:52:07]</a>.

The "why now" is critical, as some opportunities are perishable and must be acted upon immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:00">[00:53:00]</a>. This section helps center the team and justify the current focus over other potential problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:07">[00:51:07]</a>. It also helps manage expectations, as someone is likely to ask that question anyway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:57">[00:53:57]</a>.

The document should also include a running list of decisions made and links to relevant artifacts and research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:36">[00:51:36]</a>. It's essential for PMs to not be "precious" about their work and actively seek feedback, especially from engineering counterparts, by asking them to "shred" the document to improve it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:27">[00:52:27]</a>.

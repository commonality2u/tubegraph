Melissa Perri, having worked with over 4,000 product managers and more than 30 companies in deep consulting roles, offers extensive insights into the common problems product teams face and how to overcome them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:16">[00:31:16]</a>. Her experience includes serving as an interim CPO and teaching at Harvard Business School <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:51">[00:33:51]</a>.

### Core Issues in Product Organizations

Many organizations mistakenly believe their issues stem primarily from a lack of staff training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. However, 99% of the time, the problem lies in how goals are set and strategy is deployed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Without proper context and strategic direction, trained people have nothing to work towards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Product transformation requires a holistic approach, either by bringing in external help or by ensuring internal readiness to move when assistance arrives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

When companies hire consultants to level up their product teams, some of the most common issues Perri encounters, especially in modern tech companies, revolve around strategy and scaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

### Signs It's Time to Hire a Chief Product Officer (CPO)

For SaaS companies that understand software is critical to their strategy, the biggest issues emerge during the pivotal scale-up phase, transitioning from product-market fit to rapid growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.

[!NOTE] A critical sign is the need to rethink their entire strategy, focus, and prioritize, especially when moving from a single product to a multi-product portfolio and managing its complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. This is often the first time a company needs to form and deploy a comprehensive, prioritized strategy to hundreds, or even thousands, of employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.

**Key Indicators:**

*   **Lack of Strategic Clarity & Communication** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>:
    *   Executives and the board express not knowing what's happening in tech or product, or if goals are being achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. If the person communicating these things is not at a CPO level, it's a significant problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.
    *   Product teams are working hard, but key metrics are not moving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:06">[00:22:06]</a>.
    *   Product and tech are seen as "black boxes" by leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:13">[00:22:13]</a>.
    *   Teams are all working on features without clear connection or understanding of how their work ladders up to business value or company vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a>. This indicates a "missing middle" in the strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>.
    *   Different executive team members have conflicting goals and are not aligned on overall company goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:51">[00:28:51]</a>.
    *   Executives struggle to elaborate on the company's vision beyond a tagline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>.

*   **Organizational Growth and Complexity** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>:
    *   The company is going above $10 million in Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR), typically reaching $20-30 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>.
    *   The product is expanding into a more complex portfolio, moving from single to multi-product offerings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.
    *   The company is expanding geographically or entering drastically new markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.
    *   A major transformation, pivot, or merger of two companies is underway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>.
    *   The number of product managers reaches around seven to eight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.

*   **Product Team Maturity & Development Gaps** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>:
    *   Great product managers are frustrated due to a lack of clear direction or leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.
    *   Trouble hiring product managers, indicating a need for a leader who can mentor and provide opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.
    *   A large number of junior product managers without a clear training path or established process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.
    *   A general lack of leadership at the product level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>.

*   **Scope of Leadership Needed** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>:
    *   If a singular leader is needed to bring together product, design, product operations, and potentially engineering and analytics under one umbrella <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>. This role is broader than a VP of Product who typically focuses more on functional leadership within product management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>.
    *   The product leader needs to deeply understand financials, create revenue projections from roadmaps, confidently present to the board, and act as a strong executive navigator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>.

### When to Bring in External Help (Interim CPO/Consultant)

Companies might consider bringing in someone like Melissa Perri as an interim CPO or consultant when:

*   The CEO is unsure who to hire for a product leadership role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>.
*   The CEO realizes challenges are caused by not having a product partner to offload responsibilities and allow them to focus on vision and fundraising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>.
*   The company needs help setting up product management processes, designing the organization, or deploying strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>.
*   The goal is to hire a permanent CPO quickly, and an interim CPO can keep things on track, provide initial strategy, and train teams for a temporary period (e.g., three months) until the full-time leader is found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a>.
*   The company realizes something is not working but isn't sure how to fix it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:19:59]</a>.

[!WARNING] Consultants can only be effective if the company is ready and willing to take action, which may involve drastic changes to people or strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a>. Thinking that most issues are in training, rather than strategy deployment, is a common misconception that can hinder transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>.

### Cultivating a Strong Product Strategy

A well-deployed strategy leads to every team member understanding exactly what they're doing and why, connecting their tactical work to business metrics and company vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:51">[00:27:51]</a>. This alignment significantly reduces infighting among stakeholders and executives who are all working towards the same objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:44">[00:28:44]</a>.

To improve strategy, individuals should:
*   **Act as if they are the CPO** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:18">[00:39:18]</a>: Imagine what they would do in that role, dig into data, and ask challenging questions.
*   **Talk to people** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:01">[00:40:01]</a>: Engage with the CPO to understand their process, analyze conversations with sales to grasp market win/loss factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:24">[00:40:24]</a>.
*   **Leverage data** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:06">[00:41:06]</a>: Leaders need to start with internal and external data. Hiring a data analyst or working with consultants who can crunch data helps surface patterns and inform decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:20">[00:41:20]</a>.
*   **Embrace decision-making** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:17">[00:42:17]</a>: It's rare to be 100% certain about a strategy, but leaders must make the best-informed decision at the time and be willing to course-correct if it's wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:20">[00:42:20]</a>.

Perri is also writing a new book on [[product_management_and_leadership_insights | product operations]] which addresses how to scale product management by getting the right insights to teams and standardizing outputs and check-ins to stay on track with strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:13">[00:45:13]</a>. It covers internal data/insights, customer/user insights, and standardizing processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:26">[00:45:26]</a>.

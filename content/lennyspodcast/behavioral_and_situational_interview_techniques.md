This article compiles favorite [[favorite_interview_questions | interview questions]] shared by over 100 guests on a podcast, designed to assist in [[interview_preparation_for_candidates | preparing to interview candidates]], [[improving_interview_questions | improving existing interview questions]], or [[interview_preparation_for_candidates | preparing for interviews]] as a candidate [00:00:31]. The questions often delve into a candidate's past experiences and hypothetical situations to reveal deeper insights into their skills, mindset, and values.

## Evaluating Self-Awareness and Introspection

Several questions aim to assess a candidate's self-awareness, introspection, and ability to reflect on their own experiences and growth.

### To what do you attribute your success, and you can't say luck?
*   **Source**: Aka Demano, Head of Product at Role and former PM at Stripe [00:03:26]
*   **Purpose**: This question seeks to understand a candidate's level of self-awareness and curiosity [00:03:46]. Interviewers look for candidates who have reflected on *why* they are where they are today, providing insight into their worldview [00:03:50]. This is key for [[evaluating_selfawareness_and_introspection_in_interviews | evaluating self-awareness and introspection]].

### Fast forward three years, what's different about you?
*   **Source**: Ben Williams, former VP Product at Snyk [00:13:13]
*   **Purpose**: While many candidates might default to discussing future roles or titles [00:13:26], the interviewer is looking for signals of humility and [[evaluating_selfawareness_and_introspection_in_interviews | self-awareness]] regarding areas of personal and professional growth [00:13:33]. Ideal answers demonstrate openness about aspects they need to work on for self-improvement [00:13:40].

### What would your siblings say about you? / What would your parents say about you?
*   **Source**: Melum Quan Barwitz, Head of Growth at Deal [00:14:43]
*   **Purpose**: This question aims to gauge a candidate's sincerity and [[evaluating_selfawareness_and_introspection_in_interviews | self-awareness]] by understanding how they perceive others view them [000:14:56]. A good answer exhibits humbleness and recognition of both positive traits and quirks, rather than an overly idealized self-perception [00:15:07].

### Tell me something you did that worked out, but not for the reason that you thought it would work. / Tell me something you did that was a good decision that didn't work.
*   **Source**: Ime Omalu, Chief Product Officer at Carbon Health [00:17:53]
*   **Purpose**: The core objective is to tease out introspection [00:18:10]. The interviewer wants to know if the candidate is reflective about their decisions, understands *why* things worked or didn't, and incorporates these learnings into their future decision-making model [00:18:12]. This helps reveal [[evaluating_selfawareness_and_introspection_in_interviews | introspection]].

### Something people have learned about themselves that reveal a limitation in how they work.
*   **Source**: Scott Belsky, Chief Strategy Officer at Adobe [00:18:21]
*   **Purpose**: This question tests [[evaluating_selfawareness_and_introspection_in_interviews | introspection]] and the ability to be open about one's limits or struggles, rather than blaming others or pointing fingers [00:18:37].

### Do you consider yourself lucky?
*   **Source**: Scott Belsky, Chief Strategy Officer at Adobe [00:18:21]
*   **Purpose**: This is a fascinating question that can reveal a candidate's comfort with acknowledging external factors in their success [00:18:50]. Those who are comfortable often admit to being lucky, indicating humility and a grounded perspective [00:19:06].

## Assessing Problem-Solving and Handling Ambiguity

These questions focus on how candidates approach challenges, navigate uncertainty, and think strategically.

### What's the hardest thing you've ever done?
*   **Source**: Jeff Charles, Head of Product at Ramp [00:04:06]
*   **Purpose**: This question helps understand a candidate's definition of "hard," how they overcame difficulty, their collaboration skills, and their personal agency in resolving issues [00:04:11]. It reveals the effort they put into overcoming obstacles [00:04:28].

### Tell me about a time when you're part of a controversial product decision.
*   **Source**: Yuki Yamashita, Chief Product Officer at Figma [00:08:45]
*   **Purpose**: The interviewer looks for a candidate's ability to articulate the conflict, understand the problem's importance, and represent both sides of the issue in an even-keeled manner [00:09:02]. This demonstrates their ability to take on different perspectives [00:09:20].

### Talk about a big problem that you worked on.
*   **Source**: Yuki Yamashita, Chief Product Officer at Figma [00:08:45]
*   **Purpose**: The "thought experiment" for the interviewer is whether they feel compelled to work on that problem after the candidate describes it [00:09:31]. A great product manager can make even seemingly "boring" problems sound existential and interesting, showcasing strong storytelling and communication skills, which are crucial for the role [00:09:39]. This relates to [[effective_spontaneous_speaking_techniques | effective spontaneous speaking techniques]].

### How do they navigate ambiguity?
*   **Source**: Jie Zhou, Head of Product at Webflow [00:11:29]
*   **Purpose**: Since product management is inherently ambiguous, interviewers look for candidates who can provide structure and a clear path forward through uncertainty [00:11:46]. Good candidates also seek help and inputs from others, and they define small milestones to assess whether their chosen path is working and if adjustments are needed [00:12:07].

### What unfair secrets have you learned to improve the velocity and energy level of a product/team?
*   **Source**: Noah Weiss, Chief Product Officer at Slack [00:12:44]
*   **Purpose**: This question seeks insights beyond conventional wisdom found in articles [00:12:59]. It aims to discover what the candidate learned, how they learned it, and how they apply it [00:13:02]. This also provides amazing and interesting inspiration for the interviewer [00:13:07].

### Tell me about a time something went wrong.
*   **Source**: Paige Costello, Co-Head of Product Management and Head of AI at Asana [00:15:29]

## Assessing Authenticity and Critical Thinking

These questions are designed to move beyond rehearsed answers and uncover a candidate's genuine opinions and unique perspectives.

### What's something that everyone takes for granted that you think is essentially hogwash or inaccurate?
*   **Source**: Niel Singal, VP of Product at Facebook [00:16:17]
*   **Purpose**: This question is designed to break the typical [[interview_preparation_for_candidates | interview mindset]] where candidates try to predict what the interviewer wants to hear [00:17:01]. It forces candidates to be genuinely opinionated, revealing their authenticity. The interviewer aims to avoid dismissing high-quality candidates who may not be skilled at giving "expected" answers [00:17:01].

## Understanding Values and Motivations

These questions delve into what a candidate values, what drives them, and what constitutes "good work" in their view.

### Tell me what work you are most proud of.
*   **Source**: Katie Dill (Head of Design at Stripe), Ki Sarin (CEO of Linear), and Camille Hurst (Product Leader at Spotify) [00:09:59]
*   **Purpose**: This question helps understand a candidate's taste, judgment, and motivations [00:10:17]. It reveals what kind of work they consider good and what outcomes they value [00:10:26]. It also offers insight into what they enjoy doing and where their natural interests lie [00:10:31]. It's a positive way for candidates to share something they believe they did well [00:10:53]. By asking about the process and reasons for pride, interviewers learn about motivations, work ethic, and what "good" looks like to the candidate [00:11:11].

### Tell me about the Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging initiatives that you've recently personally been involved with.
*   **Source**: Ben Williams, former VP Product at Snyk (a question asked *to* him by a candidate) [00:13:13]
*   **Purpose**: This is a brilliant question for a candidate to ask an interviewer to test alignment of their personal values with those of the person they would be working closely with [00:14:26].

### Tell me about a time that you delivered something that was impactful.
*   **Source**: Lauren Isord, Head of Growth at Notion [00:19:19]
*   **Purpose**: This question helps the interviewer understand how the candidate defines "impact" and what it means to them [00:19:30]. For a growth practitioner, a good answer often reflects intrinsic motivation for having a business impact [00:19:42].

## Reference Call Question

### What feedback will I be giving this person in their first performance review?
*   **Source**: Paul Adams, Chief Product Officer at Intercom (for reference calls) [00:19:54]

[!NOTE] General Interviewer Insights:
*   **Curiosity**: Throughout [[interview techniques for discovering customer insights | interviews]], look for curiosity. Good product managers consistently ask "why" [00:13:52]. This relates to [[customer_interviewing_techniques | customer interviewing techniques]].
*   **Identifying "IR" (Impactful/Important/Relevant) Questions**: Shashir Marocha emphasizes identifying key, high-leverage questions in ambiguous situations [00:06:06]. Kids are often good at simplifying problems to find these essential questions [00:07:56]. This skill can be applied to any product or problem, by asking "what is the question that really drives the answer?" [00:08:41].

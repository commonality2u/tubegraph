Working with AI models presents unique challenges and opportunities for human interaction and personalization, demanding a new approach to product development and user adaptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>.

## Adapting to AI's Non-Deterministic Nature

Unlike traditional product development that relies on a fixed technology base, AI development constantly evolves, with new capabilities emerging every couple of months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>. This means the initial stages of [[developing_ai_products_and_utilizing_technology | developing AI products]] are unlike traditional product shipping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:23:00">[06:23:00]</a>.

When training new models, it's often uncertain if a feature will perform at 60%, 90%, or 99% accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>. The product design must adapt to these varying levels of success; a product designed for 60% accuracy is very different from one designed for 99% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:00">[07:06:00]</a>.

Even with 60% success, AI can be valuable if designed with a human in the loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:50:00">[10:50:00]</a>. An example is GitHub Co-pilot, which, despite being built on older models, saved developers time by completing significant portions of code that could then be edited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:02:00">[11:02:00]</a>. The combination of human and model can achieve much higher than 60% success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:05:00">[12:05:00]</a>.

AI models are often [[impact_of_ai_and_machine_learning_on_product_development | intelligence limited]], not intelligence limited, meaning they can do more than currently apparent if properly taught <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:13:00">[13:13:17]</a>. The biggest hurdle is defining what success looks like and developing effective evaluation methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:47:00">[13:47:00]</a>.

## Educating Users and Driving Adoption

User adaptation to AI is happening rapidly, often faster than previous technology shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:13:00">[23:13:00]</a>. AI products are unintuitive because they go against the expectation that the same inputs yield the same outputs, which has been standard for the last 25 years of computing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:32:00">[21:32:00]</a>. This requires product developers to empathize with users who are adapting to this non-deterministic interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:44:00">[21:44:00]</a>.

### Consumer Adaptation
The rapid adaptation of users to AI is remarkable; what was once "magic" quickly becomes expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:16:00">[23:16:00]</a>. ChatGPT, less than two years old, was mind-blowing at launch but would now be considered "garbage" compared to current models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:00:00">[24:00:00]</a>. Young people, especially those around 14 years old, show a natural, intuitive interaction with AI, often pouring their hearts out to voice modes in ways older generations wouldn't consider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:09:00">[37:09:00]</a>.

AI models are also becoming better at solving UI problems and user confusion by providing direct assistance and links to documentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:38:00">[25:38:00]</a>.

### Enterprise Adaptation
In the [[enterprise_ai_solutions_and_user_adaptation | enterprise AI solutions and user adaptation]] space, user adoption can be more challenging due to existing organizational processes and non-technical users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:50:00">[25:50:00]</a>. However, enterprises offer the luxury of running educational sessions and providing materials to introduce non-technical users to AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:30:00">[26:30:00]</a>.

Power users within organizations can act as evangelists, creating custom GPTs and other tools to make AI immediately valuable and easier to use for less technical colleagues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:50:00">[26:50:00]</a>.

## Future of AI Interaction

The future of AI interaction is expected to bring more advanced and personalized experiences, driven by continuously smarter models and evolving interaction paradigms.

### Proactive AI
Future models will become more proactive, monitoring user data (with authorization) to spot trends, provide proactive recaps of daily activities, prepare research for meetings, or even draft presentations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:50:00">[33:50:00]</a>. This proactive intelligence will be very powerful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:18:00">[34:18:00]</a>.

### Asynchronous Interaction
AI will also become more asynchronous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:21:00">[34:21:00]</a>. Users will be able to initiate a task and let the AI "think" for a while, returning later for the result, similar to how humans might conduct research or vet an answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:34:00">[34:34:00]</a>. This will enable AI to handle larger, more complex projects, like fleshing out a project plan or adapting a PRD for new market conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:04:00">[35:04:00]</a>.

### Multimodal Interaction
Interaction with models will expand beyond typing to include speech and sight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:40:00">[35:40:00]</a>. An example is the "advanced voice mode" for universal translation, allowing business conversations between people with no common language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:57:00">[35:57:00]</a>. This capability could significantly increase willingness to travel and interact across language barriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:35:00">[36:35:00]</a>.

### AI Personality and Empathy
AI models are developing distinct personalities, and users are starting to build relationships and two-way empathy with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:45:00">[38:45:00]</a>. The model's personality is a key product attribute, leading to questions about whether AI should customize its personality or maintain a consistent brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:43:00">[39:43:00]</a>. Users may choose different models based on personality preferences, similar to how people choose friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:03:00">[40:03:00]</a>. The model's ability to describe itself based on past interactions with a user further blurs the line between AI and a person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:16:00">[40:16:00]</a>.

## Developing Intuition for AI

For product people, key skills for the future include:
*   [[prototyping_with_ai_tools | Prototyping with AI tools]]: Using models to quickly create and evaluate UI variations for faster iteration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:05:00">[19:05:00]</a>.
*   [[tips_for_using_ai_in_product_development | Going deeper into the tech stack]]: While not every PM needs to be a researcher, understanding the language and gaining intuition for how the underlying technology works is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:49:00">[19:49:00]</a>.
*   Managing non-deterministic systems: Designing feedback mechanisms, guardrails, and methods to understand aggregate AI behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:24:00">[20:24:00]</a>.
*   Writing evaluations: This is becoming a core skill for product managers. Models like Claude can even assist in writing and grading evaluations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:01:00">[14:01:00]</a>. Building intuition for evaluations involves looking at actual answers, not just aggregate scores, and being prepared to evolve the evaluations themselves as models improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:01:00">[17:01:00]</a>. As AI handles more ambiguous tasks, evaluations will become softer and more nuanced, resembling performance reviews rather than simple right/wrong assessments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:38:00">[17:38:00]</a>.

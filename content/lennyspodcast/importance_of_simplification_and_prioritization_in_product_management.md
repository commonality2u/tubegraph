Maggie Crowley, VP of Product at Toast and former VP and Head of Product at Charlie Health and Senior Director of Product at Drift, emphasizes that the ability to simplify and prioritize is a fundamental skill for successful product managers (PMs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. This skill is consistent across various company stages, from zero-to-one startups to large enterprises, and across different product types (consumer or B2B) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

## The Essence of the Product Manager Role: Simplification at its Core

Crowley identifies [[strategies_to_prioritize_tasks_as_a_product_manager | simplifying things]] as the primary common thread among the best product managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. For PMs, this means:
*   **Identifying the "One Thing"**: Finding the single most crucial task or problem to address at any given moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.
*   **Staying Focused**: The ability to stick with that "one thing" long enough to see it through to completion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. This requires resilience and energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

[[importance_of_communication_prioritization_and_execution_for_pms | Prioritization]] is often considered the core of a PM's job: "they're just prioritizing and telling people what is next" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

### Why Simplification Matters

*   **Faster Progress**: Individuals willing to simplify and get work done move faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.
*   **Product Success**: Their products are more successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
*   **Reduced Frustration**: It helps PMs avoid carrying anger and negative emotions that can arise from complexity and indecision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. As the emotional center of the team, a PM's job is to maintain optimism and motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Challenges to Simplification and Prioritization

PMs face unique challenges in simplifying and prioritizing:
*   **Overwhelming Priorities**: In large companies, there can be "8 million priorities, 700 OKRs, 25,000 projects" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>, which can bog teams down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.
*   **Startup Complexity**: Even in startups, where finding the "one thing" might seem easier, numerous "fires" and a "world of opportunity" make it difficult to pick one and stick with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.
*   **Re-litigating Priorities**: Some leaders may constantly seek a "formula for prioritization" and "re-evaluate the priority" every week, hindering sustained focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.
*   **Difficulty in Saying No**: It is extremely difficult to say no to the many things that could be done, even if only one or two are truly impactful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>.
*   **Lack of Agency**: PMs often lack the agency to completely scrap existing roadmaps that don't align with a simplified strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:57">[00:47:57]</a>.

## Practical Approaches to Simplification

Developing the skill of simplification requires practice and specific techniques:

### Clarity in Communication
*   **Read Aloud**: When writing, read your content out loud. Often, you'll realize it's too complicated or doesn't make sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.
*   **"Just Say That"**: If you can explain your point simply in conversation, write it down that way. Avoid overly complex prose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.
*   **Cut Excess**: Maggie Crowley advises deleting the first two paragraphs of almost any document you write <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>. The book *On Writing Well* is recommended for learning how to cut unnecessary words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.
*   **Minto Pyramid Principle**: Structure communications with the conclusion first, followed by supporting arguments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>. This ensures the main point is immediately clear.

### Structured Thinking
*   **Rule of Three**: Limit strategies, conclusions, or next steps to a maximum of three points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>. This forces focus and prevents dilution of ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>.
*   **Focused Decision-Making**: Pick the one thing that will have the most impact and eliminate other less important items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>.

### Seeking Feedback
*   **Get Reps In**: Practice simplification repeatedly and ask others to review your work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.
*   **Listen to Founders/Leaders**: Acknowledge that founders and senior leaders often have deep market insights that can help simplify your approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>.
*   **Peer Review**: Form a small peer group to exchange work and help each other simplify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>. This is particularly valuable for senior PMs, as external feedback becomes harder to obtain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:28">[00:20:28]</a>.

## Prioritization in Action: Strategy and One-Pagers

[[strategies_to_prioritize_tasks_as_a_product_manager | Prioritization]] isn't just about choosing what to build, but also ensuring it gets shipped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. The best PMs have the "resilience and the energy to stay with it" for weeks, months, or even a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

### Product Strategy Document
Crowley developed a detailed product strategy outline to ensure a comprehensive yet clear approach, especially for broader, long-term decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:41">[00:40:41]</a>. This document's purpose is to connect the company's mission to individual team priorities, creating a clear "logic chain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:40">[00:38:40]</a>.

The strategy document structure:
1.  **Mission**: Company and team mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:05">[00:36:05]</a>.
2.  **Goals**: High-level company goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:10">[00:36:10]</a>.
3.  **Landscape**: Current business, product, market view, competitors, SWOT analysis, and key risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:14">[00:36:14]</a>.
4.  **Current Business Goals**: Alignment with current quarterly or annual company objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:30">[00:36:30]</a>.
5.  **Current State**: Honest assessment of product, business, customer feedback (support tickets, user insights), and technical hurdles (tech debt, major upcoming technical shifts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:47">[00:36:47]</a>.
6.  **Opportunity**: Top one or two opportunities, where the team can win based on unique competitive advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:33">[00:37:33]</a>.
7.  **Challenges**: What makes taking advantage of the opportunity difficult, and what must be true for it to work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:55">[00:37:55]</a>.
8.  **Solution**: The proposed solution and what needs to be built (ideally three key points) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:06">[00:38:06]</a>.
9.  **Plan**: How the solution would be sequenced and implemented, including team structure and estimated costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:18">[00:38:18]</a>.

This detailed approach helps the PM gain confidence in their decisions and facilitates informed discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:52">[00:40:52]</a>.

### The "Why Now" Principle

For any project or problem, it's crucial to answer the question: "Why does this problem matter, and why does it matter now?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:01">[00:52:01]</a>. This point is often overlooked but is essential because some opportunities are perishable and must be pursued immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:00">[00:53:00]</a>. Including this in a one-pager or strategy document helps center the team and justifies the focus over other potential initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:07">[00:51:07]</a>.

A "remarkable" product is defined as something "worth making a remark about" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:20">[00:30:20]</a>. It's not about creating viral gimmickry, but rather something that genuinely improves a person's life in such a way that they feel compelled to talk about it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>. This concept, often referred to as the "Purple Cow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:54">[00:29:54]</a>, emphasizes building something so distinct and valuable that it inherently drives word-of-mouth marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:07">[00:32:07]</a>.

## Core Principles

### Marketing as Product
The product itself *is* the marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. It's not about developing a product and then handing it off to a marketing team to put a logo on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. The inherent design and utility of the product should drive its success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>.

### The Power of Empathy
[[building_customercentric_products_through_design | Empathy]] is crucial for product success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>. It's about understanding what the product is being made for *other people* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>. If customers struggle, it's the product's fault, not the user's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>. A product manager's goal should be to delight the customer, not just to please their boss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

### Building a Network Effect
For software, especially Software as a Service (SaaS), building a [[building_minimum_lovable_products | network effect]] into the product is almost essential for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>. If the product works better when users tell others about it, the marketing problem is largely solved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>.

## Strategic Choices for Remarkability

[[developing_and_deploying_a_product_strategy | A great strategy]] involves making critical choices that often get overlooked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:35">[00:23:35]</a>. These choices define the product and its future:

1.  **Choose Your Customers**: Define the smallest viable audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:02">[00:24:02]</a>. This decision dictates everything from the language they speak, their financial situation, problems they are trying to solve, and even their temperament. It shapes the product and the company's future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:04">[00:24:04]</a>. Choosing customers who are open to experimentation (e.g., Raspberry Pi enthusiasts on Product Hunt) allows for more flexibility than targeting those expecting a polished, Apple-quality product from day one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:47">[00:24:47]</a>.
2.  **Choose Your Competition**: Understand the competitive landscape you are entering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:16">[00:25:16]</a>. If competing with a company like Walmart, expect continuous price drops because that's their strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>. The chosen competitive space sets significant boundaries for what the product can and should do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:27">[00:25:27]</a>.
3.  **Choose Your Source of Validation**: Clarify who the product is trying to please <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:36">[00:25:36]</a>. If it's to please a boss, that will be the outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:39">[00:25:39]</a>. If the goal is to match the taste of a specific customer segment, this needs to be explicitly agreed upon to align efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:49">[00:25:49]</a>.
4.  **Choose Your Distribution**: The method of distribution significantly impacts the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>. For example, the rise of digital distribution platforms like Steam transformed the video game industry, affecting product design and market approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:06">[00:26:06]</a>.

## The Importance of Tension

A great strategy often has "tension at the center of it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:46">[00:27:46]</a>. Tension, distinct from stress, is inherent in every art form and [[creativity_and_innovation_in_product_design | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:10">[00:28:10]</a>. It represents the possibility that "it might not work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:13">[00:28:13]</a>. When a new product is launched, it makes a promise to the user, creating an imaginative picture of how their life might improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:27">[00:28:27]</a>. If users "fall in love with that possibility," tension arises around whether the promise will be kept and if the product will work for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:35">[00:28:35]</a>. This tension encourages engagement and word-of-mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:57">[00:28:57]</a>.

### Making and Keeping Promises
A strong brand is built on making "a difficult promise, a remarkable promise," and then consistently keeping it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>. Breaking a promise even once can erode trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>. This applies to products, especially with the rise of AI. While AI will soon be a ubiquitous feature, companies must differentiate themselves by focusing on what's in it for the user and delivering on those promises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>.

## Avoiding Mediocrity

To create a remarkable product, it's essential to avoid being average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:01">[00:38:01]</a>. "Mediocre" simply means average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:01">[00:38:01]</a>. To achieve something different, one must *do* something different than what others are doing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:03">[00:38:03]</a>. This often means challenging existing systems and cultures that promote safety or convention, as "safety is risky" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:18">[00:33:18]</a>. Being strategic involves seeing these invisible systems and understanding why certain actions might feel "scary" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:25">[00:33:25]</a>.

### Examples of Remarkable Products
*   **Google Search (early days)**: Its simplicity with only two buttons on the homepage, compared to Yahoo's 183 links, made a clear promise: "we are smart enough to take you where you want to go without you spending a lot of time browsing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:16">[00:31:16]</a>. This design choice was remarkable and easy to tell others about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:51">[00:31:51]</a>.
*   **Tesla Model S**: The noticeable, unique "popping out" door handles created a conversation starter, and the "ludicrous mode" acceleration provided a thrilling, shareable experience that made the product remarkable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:37">[00:40:37]</a>.

### Examples of Less Remarkable (or Misguided) Approaches
*   **AI companies**: Many AI companies struggle to build brands because AI is becoming a feature, like electricity, rather than a differentiator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>. They need to articulate "what's in this for the user" and make a distinct promise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>.
*   **Humane Pin**: Failed because it tried to appeal to consumers expecting an Apple-quality finished product on pre-order, but shipped something that wasn't that <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:23">[00:24:23]</a>.
*   **Jaguar Relogoing**: A "relogoing" rather than a true rebrand, it undermined existing brand equity by discarding beloved iconic elements in an attempt to please an art director, without a clear promise or customer traction strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:26">[00:38:26]</a>. Buzz from such stunts does not necessarily translate to sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:46">[00:39:46]</a>.
*   **Tesla Cybertruck**: Described as a "clown car" and "intentionally divisive," its design trickery alienated the target market of pickup truck buyers who value utility and are skeptical of radical change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:17">[00:41:17]</a>. This approach prevented it from "crossing the chasm" and appealing to a broader audience that could make it as significant as the Ford F-150 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:49">[00:42:49]</a>.

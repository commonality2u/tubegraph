A Chief Operating Officer (COO) is a senior executive role that can provide significant leverage for high-growth companies, particularly when a founder-CEO is balancing product development with company building and hiring leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:40">[01:06:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>. While not every company requires a COO, the role is often prevalent in early-stage or high-growth environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:37">[01:05:37]</a>.

## When a COO is Needed

Only a minority of companies, fewer than 20-30%, have a COO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:17">[01:05:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:24">[01:05:24]</a>. However, a COO can be useful in situations where a founder-CEO needs leverage to scale the company, especially when they are simultaneously building the product, the business, and bringing in new talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:33">[01:06:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:50">[01:06:50]</a>. Businesses with a deeply operational component, such as manufacturing, may also find this role more prevalent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:11">[01:06:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:18">[01:06:18]</a>.

> "A COO type of role can give you leverage, right, which is essentially it's a layer that takes some of those functions and helps build them with you and on your behalf and also in some cases bring some experience in in you know maybe there's a particular function like go to market that needs to be built." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:47">[01:06:47]</a>

## Functions and Impact

A COO typically takes on various functions to help build and scale the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:53">[01:06:53]</a>. Claire Hughes Johnson, former Chief Operating Officer at Stripe for seven years, helped scale the company from a small startup to a prominent entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>. Her roles at Google, including VP of Self-Driving Cars and VP of Global Online Sales, also involved significant operational responsibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>.

A COO's impact can be seen in:
*   **Scaling operations**: Bringing in leaders and stabilizing operations such as support, recruiting, and HR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:28">[01:11:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:35">[01:11:35]</a>.
*   **Implementing structure**: Introducing job structures, levels, and ladders to manage compensation and expectations, ideally earlier in a company's growth to avoid greater challenges later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:40">[01:11:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:54">[01:12:54]</a>.
*   **Driving momentum**: Being a force for positive momentum in the company, contributing to progress and impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:31">[01:19:31]</a>.
*   **Building an [[the_operating_model_in_product_management | operating system]]**: Establishing foundational processes and rhythms for how the company works, including goal setting, reviews, and planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:57">[01:43:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:52">[01:44:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:57">[01:52:57]</a>. This includes having a clear mission, long-term goals, and [[importance_of_personal_and_company_operating_principles | operating principles]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:01">[01:53:01]</a>.
*   **Fostering cohesion**: Utilizing off-sites and other deliberate communication practices to create space for team bonding, solidify plans, and ensure alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:06">[02:12:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:21">[02:13:21]</a>.
*   **Decision-making processes**: Ensuring clarity on decision-makers, criteria, and processes to prevent paralysis and maintain velocity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:01">[01:18:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:22">[01:18:22]</a>.

## Relationship with the CEO

A fantastic COO-CEO relationship is characterized by "just the right amount of tension" with forward momentum and mutual trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:55">[01:08:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:53">[01:09:53]</a>. This allows the COO to take on functions, build them on the CEO's behalf, and bring in valuable experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:50">[01:06:50]</a>. It also permits the COO to provide candid feedback or challenge priorities, creating a synergy where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:27">[01:09:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:57">[01:09:57]</a>. The relationship should involve collaborative work rather than simply handing off undesirable tasks to the COO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:13">[01:11:13]</a>.

## Misconceptions and De-risking the Hire

There's a misconception that hiring a COO is a "silver bullet" that will automatically solve all company issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:12">[01:11:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:14">[01:11:14]</a>, or that the COO is merely someone to offload undesirable tasks to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:29">[01:10:29]</a>. This approach can be risky and lead to prolonged searches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:17">[01:08:17]</a>.

To de-risk a COO hire, companies can consider:
*   Bringing in a head of business operations or a COO-like role to try a couple of functions and see if they scale with the company and role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:40">[01:07:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:52">[01:07:52]</a>.
*   Leveraging existing operational CFOs who could potentially take on broader scope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:07">[01:08:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:10">[01:08:10]</a>.

Ultimately, the COO role is about bringing structure and stability to a potentially chaotic environment, ensuring consistent progress, and contributing to overall company momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:19">[01:44:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:18">[01:52:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:26">[01:52:26]</a>.

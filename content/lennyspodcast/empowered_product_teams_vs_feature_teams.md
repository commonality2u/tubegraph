The field of product management is undergoing significant changes, including concerns about "product management theater," where individuals in product roles are seen as overpaid for the value they provide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>. This phenomenon is often linked to the distinction between feature teams and [[empowering_product_teams | empowered product teams]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>.

## Feature Teams (or Feature Factories)
A feature team is primarily focused on delivering output rather than outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a>.

### Characteristics
*   **Output-driven** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a>: Teams are given a roadmap of features or projects, often originating from executives or large customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:14">[00:21:14]</a>.
*   **Project Management Role**: The primary task is to design, build, test, and deploy these features, often with given dates and timeframes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:25">[00:21:25]</a>.
*   **Over-hiring and Redundant Roles**: Many companies, especially those outside Silicon Valley, over-hired during the pandemic, leading to an abundance of roles like agile coaches, [[Product management vs Product owner | product owners]], product Ops, and business analysts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. These roles often function as "assistant product manager types" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>.
*   **Lack of Outcome Focus**: It is significantly easier to deliver output than to deliver outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:39">[00:21:39]</a>. There is little in the way of outcomes to show for the cost of these roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:21">[00:27:21]</a>.
*   **Perception of Product Managers**: In feature teams, engineers and designers may prefer to handle tasks themselves rather than deal with a product manager who doesn't contribute significant value beyond project management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>. Product managers in this setup are often dramatically overpaid for the value they provide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:19:59]</a>.

## Empowered Product Teams
An empowered product team focuses on solving problems and delivering measurable outcomes for the customer and the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a>.

### Characteristics
*   **Outcome-driven**: Instead of features, teams are given customer or business problems to solve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>. The measure of success is solving the problem, not merely shipping a feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:07">[00:22:07]</a>.
*   **Focus on "Time to Money"**: Strong product companies prioritize time to money—the time it takes for a product to generate value—over just time to market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:31">[00:22:31]</a>.
*   **Strategic Decision-making**: Product leaders define the product strategy and "big bets," but teams are given the latitude to figure out the best way to solve problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:55">[00:45:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:02">[00:46:02]</a>. This is seen as product leaders doing their job and product teams doing their job, not a top-down model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:33">[00:46:33]</a>.
*   **Importance of Product Managers**: A "real" product manager is essential because they are responsible for ensuring a solution is not only usable and feasible (which feature teams might achieve) but also **valuable** and **viable** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>.
*   **Skills of an Empowered Product Manager**:
    *   **Creator, not Facilitator**: A product manager is a creator who collaborates with design and engineering to develop solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:17">[00:25:17]</a>.
    *   **User and Customer Expertise**: Deep understanding of users and customers is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>.
    *   **Data Analysis**: Expert knowledge of how the product is used and how usage changes over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:27">[00:26:27]</a>.
    *   **Business Acumen**: Represents compliance, sales, marketing, financial costs, monetization, and legal constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:37">[00:26:37]</a>.
    *   **Market Understanding**: Possesses deep knowledge of the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:18">[00:27:18]</a>.
    *   **Viability**: Ensuring the product works for the business, can be sold, marketed, serviced, and is legal and compliant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:09">[00:55:09]</a>.

## The Reckoning and Transformation
The current climate of over-hiring, increased cost of funds, the predicted impact of [[role of AI in product teams | generative AI]], and bloated team sizes has led to a "reckoning" for companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:31">[00:29:31]</a>. Many traditional companies, especially those outside Silicon Valley, have invested in excessive roles and rigid processes like SAFe, leading to high costs and little outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>.

Companies are realizing that smaller, more focused teams often produce better results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>. There is a need for companies to take a hard look at how they build products and serve customers, learning from the best companies that achieve more with less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>.

### Raising Your Game
Individuals within feature teams are often "trapped" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:44">[00:30:44]</a>, but they have more agency than they realize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:04">[00:31:04]</a>. It is crucial to:
*   **Develop Core Skills**: Focus on building skills related to value and viability, which are the responsibilities of a true product manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:54">[00:24:54]</a>.
*   **Be Critical of Information**: A significant portion of online content and certifications regarding product management propagates a "feature team" model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:14">[00:33:14]</a>. Product professionals must learn to think critically and use judgment when seeking advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:16">[00:37:16]</a>.
*   **Seek [[Empowering Product Teams | Empowerment]]**: Understand that [[empowerment_and_team_autonomy_in_product_management | empowerment]] means teams can solve problems within a strategic framework set by leaders, not anarchy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:42">[00:46:42]</a>.
*   **Focus on Transformation**: Moving to a product operating model involves adopting a set of principles that consistently lead to innovation and success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:04">[01:03:04]</a>.

### The Product Operating Model
This model emphasizes a conceptual framework of principles rather than rigid processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:58">[01:03:58]</a>. Key principles include:
*   **Culture**: Innovation over predictability, learning over failure, principles over process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:48">[01:08:48]</a>.
*   **Teams**: Empowered with problems to solve and a real sense of ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:05">[01:09:05]</a>.
*   **Discovery**: Addressing product risks, embracing quick experimentation, and testing ideas responsibly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:21">[01:09:21]</a>.
*   **Delivery**: Small, frequent, uncoupled releases; continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD); and comprehensive instrumentation and monitoring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:35">[01:09:35]</a>.

#### Four Core Competencies
For most companies, moving to the product operating model requires developing or strengthening four key competencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>:
1.  **Real Product Manager**: Focused on value and viability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:02">[01:07:02]</a>.
2.  **Real Product Designer**: Encompassing service, interaction, visual design, and user research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:10">[01:07:10]</a>.
3.  **Real Tech Lead**: Highly important, especially with advancements in technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:15">[01:07:15]</a>.
4.  **Real [[Role of product leaders | Product Leader]]**: Managers of product, design, and engineering who can coach their teams and define product strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:19">[01:07:19]</a>.

### Product Ops
Product Ops can support the product operating model, similar to DevOps or DesignOps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:57">[01:11:57]</a>. In effective companies, Product Ops primarily encompasses user research and data analysts, providing high-leverage support to multiple teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:16">[01:12:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:34">[01:14:34]</a>. However, some companies misuse Product Ops to justify more administrative roles or to offload the responsibilities of product leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:56">[01:14:56]</a>.

### Advice for Founders
Founders often hesitate to hire product managers, sometimes correctly, as bringing in a product manager too soon can cause conflict if the founder is still the primary product person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:56">[01:15:56]</a>. It's generally more beneficial to hire a product manager after achieving product-market fit, especially when the engineering team scales to around 20-25 individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:03">[01:17:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:25">[01:17:25]</a>.

Michael Tru, co-founder and CEO of Any Sphere, the company behind Cursor, envisions a future "after code" where the fundamental way software is built will be transformed by [[ai_and_software_development | AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. His company, Cursor, is at the forefront of this change, serving as a leading [[ai_and_software_development | AI]] code editor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

## A World "After Code"

Tru's core vision for the future of software development involves inventing a new type of programming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This future will be distilled into users describing their intent to the computer in the most concise way possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. Instead of writing code, engineers will become "logic designers," focusing on specifying how they want everything to work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This shift will lead to a method of building software that is "legions higher level and more productive," and in some cases, more accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

Tru contrasts this vision with two common, but in his view, flawed perspectives:
*   **Traditional text editing:** Some believe software building will remain largely the same, using formal programming languages like TypeScript, Go, C, and Rust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.
*   **Chatbot-style interaction:** Others imagine simply typing requests into a bot, asking it to build or modify software via a chatbot or Slackbot interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

Tru argues that the chatbot-style approach lacks the necessary precision for humans to maintain complete control over software appearance and functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. The "after code" world will feature a representation of software logic that resembles English or an evolution of programming language towards pseudocode, making it "much terser and easier to navigate" and human-editable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. In this future, humans will remain firmly in the driver's seat, retaining full control over all aspects of the software and having the ability to make changes very quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

## Evolving Skills in the AI-Driven Software Landscape

With this transformation, the skills required for engineers, designers, and product managers will also evolve. Tru believes that "taste" will become increasingly valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. While taste often refers to visual design (UI/UX), in this context, it extends to the logic of how software works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. Engineers will function more as "logic designers," specifying their intent for how everything should work, shifting focus from "the how" to "the what" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.

Currently, practices like "vibe coding" – generating a lot of code without understanding the details – often lead to limitations and unwieldy creations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. The challenge is to provide users with continued control over details even when they don't fully understand the underlying code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>. Tru defines "taste" as having the right idea for what should be built, enabling an "effortless translation" from conceptual desire to functional software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.

## The Origin Story of Cursor

Cursor began as a solution in search of a problem, born from reflections on how [[The role of AI in software development | AI]] would improve over a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. Two key moments ignited its inception:
1.  **GitHub Copilot:** The first beta version of Git Copilot was a truly useful [[The role of AI in software development | AI]] product and one of the most useful dev tools adopted by the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.
2.  **Scaling Papers:** Papers from OpenAI and others demonstrated that [[ai_and_software_development | AI]] would continue to improve simply by scaling models and data, even without new ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.

These insights in late 2021/early 2022 showed that [[ai_and_software_development | AI]] products were now possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>. The Cursor team observed a gap: while many focused on making models, few were deeply considering how specific areas of knowledge work would transform as [[ai_and_software_development | AI]] matured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>.

Initially, the team made a "misstep" by attempting to automate mechanical engineering, believing it would be an uncompetitive space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>. However, they lacked domain expertise and realized the difficulty of generating training data for 3D models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>. They eventually pivoted back to programming, feeling that existing efforts in the space weren't sufficiently ambitious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>.

## Cursor's Strategy and Growth

Cursor's choice to build a full Integrated Development Environment (IDE) rather than just a plugin or an AI agent stemmed from a belief that the act of programming will change significantly, and existing coding environments lack the necessary extensibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:40">[00:20:40]</a>. The goal is to keep humans in the driver's seat, avoiding full end-to-end automation where [[ai_and_software_development | AI]] makes all decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>.

The company's product development was heavily influenced by "dogfooding" – using the tool intensely every day – which instilled realism about the current state of the technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:03">[00:20:03]</a>. Cursor went from $0 to $100 million ARR in 20 months, and then to $300 million ARR in 2 years, making it one of the fastest-growing products of all time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Tru attributes this success to a "sustained paranoia" about how much better the product could be and consistent iteration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:16">[00:27:16]</a>.

A surprising counterintuitive learning for Cursor was the necessity of its own [[impact_of_ai_on_skills_and_products | model development]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:10">[00:32:10]</a>. While they initially thought relying on existing foundation models would suffice, "every magic moment in Cursor involves a custom model" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:24">[00:24:24]</a>. Cursor employs an "ensemble of models" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:45">[00:37:45]</a>. They leverage the biggest generative models (like GPT, Gemini, Sonnet) for high-level tasks, while also developing specialized, fast, and cost-effective internal models for tasks like autocomplete and filling in code details after a foundation model provides a sketch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:31">[00:34:31]</a>. These custom models often start from open-source models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:37">[00:38:37]</a>.

## Defensibility and the Future of AI in Software

In the rapidly evolving [[the_impact_of_ai_on_software_and_business | AI and software development]] space, Tru believes that the primary moat is to "continue to try to build the best thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:16">[00:39:16]</a>. This market resembles early search engines or personal computers, where the "ceiling is incredibly high" and continuous innovation is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:05">[00:40:05]</a>. It's a "consumer-like" moat, prioritizing being the best consistently over creating lock-in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:56">[00:40:56]</a>.

Tru believes the market is "very, very big" and will support many solutions, especially niche ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:54">[00:51:54]</a>. However, he predicts there will likely be "one company that builds the general tool that builds almost all the world's software," a "generationally big business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:37">[00:43:37]</a>.

Regarding competitors like Microsoft's Copilot, Tru suggests that incumbents may struggle in this market due to its dynamic nature, where innovation trumps established positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:06">[00:45:06]</a>.

## Advice for Users and Future Engineers

For new Cursor users, Tru offers two key tips:
1.  **Chop up tasks:** Instead of attempting to specify a large task to the [[ai_and_software_development | AI]] in one go, break it into smaller, manageable chunks. This allows for iterative specification and review, a more reliable approach than expecting the [[ai_and_software_development | AI]] to handle complex tasks wholesale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:28">[00:47:28]</a>.
2.  **Discover limits:** In a safe environment (like a side project), explicitly try to "fall on their face" and push the boundaries of what the [[ai_and_software_development | AI]] models can do. This helps users develop a "taste" for the model's capabilities and limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:05">[00:48:05]</a>.

Tru notes that junior engineers tend to over-rely on [[ai_and_software_development | AI]] wholesale, while senior engineers often underrate its potential and stick to existing workflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:55">[00:49:55]</a>. Both cohorts benefit significantly but fall into different anti-patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:57">[00:50:57]</a>.

Despite [[ai_and_software_development | AI]]'s increasing capabilities, Tru believes there will be even *more* demand for engineers in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:49">[01:08:49]</a>. This is because the demand for software is "very lasting" and the current cost and labor intensity of building even simple software are high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:26">[01:07:26]</a>. If [[ai_and_software_development | AI]] can reduce this friction, it will unlock a vast amount of previously unfeasible software development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:47">[01:07:47]</a>.

## Cursor's Internal Philosophy

Reflecting on his journey, Tru wishes he had known to hire faster initially, noting that while many companies hire too quickly, Cursor was too slow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:18">[00:53:18]</a>. They prioritize building a "world-class group of engineers and researchers" who possess intellectual curiosity, a willingness to experiment, and intellectual honesty with "micro pessimism" to maintain a level head amidst industry noise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:26">[00:52:26]</a>.

The company employs a two-day onsite work test as a core part of its interview process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:56">[00:55:56]</a>. This allows candidates to work on a real, mock project in Cursor's codebase, providing insight into their actual work product and cultural fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:06">[00:56:06]</a>.

To stay focused amidst the constant [[Future expectations and development trends in AI | AI development trends]], Cursor emphasizes hiring people with the right disposition: those less focused on external validation and more on building something great and performing high-quality work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:54">[00:59:54]</a>. Tru notes that they have developed an "immune system" for the constant "chatter" in the [[ai_and_software_development | AI]] space, understanding that only a few events truly matter for their business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:47">[01:01:47]</a>.

Ultimately, the [[Transformation in Product Development with AI | transformation in product development with AI]] will be a multi-decade shift, more consequential than the internet or the advent of computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:06">[01:03:06]</a>. It requires progress on both the science of [[ai_and_software_development | AI]] models and the human experience of working with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:36">[01:03:36]</a>.

Netflix's organizational culture, championed by founder Reed Hastings, is built on the belief that a different approach can foster an environment where people thrive and achieve excellence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:06">[00:26:06]</a>. A cornerstone of this culture is [[netflix_culture_of_high_talent_density | high talent density]], which is considered a prerequisite for other aspects like candor, continuous learning, striving for excellence, and [[freedom_and_responsibility | freedom and responsibility]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:49">[00:29:49]</a>.

## Direct Feedback and Candor

Instead of relying on traditional performance reviews, Netflix emphasizes ongoing, direct feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:11">[00:35:11]</a>. This requires individuals to be willing to engage in "uncomfortable conversations" and provide feedback, even when expectations aren't being met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:31">[00:30:31]</a>.

Elizabeth Stone, CTO of Netflix, outlines a three-part framework for managers to [[techniques_for_effective_feedback_and_communication | help people level up]] and meet high standards:
1.  **Set Expectations:** Clearly define what the high bar entails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:21:26]</a>.
2.  **Give Specific Feedback:** Be direct about where the gaps are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:43">[00:21:43]</a>.
3.  **Help Fill the Gap:** Actively assist in improving performance, often by "jumping in with both feet" to work on something together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>. This support ensures that feedback is received in a safe space and encourages success, rather than simply pointing out failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:17">[00:24:17]</a>.

Feedback is ideally timely and direct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:07">[00:36:07]</a>. While there is an annual 360 feedback cycle, its purpose is for distillation of themes and conversation, not as an input to formal ratings or performance reviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:45">[00:34:45]</a>. This ongoing feedback model helps prevent people from being surprised if a difficult conversation about their fit arises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:44">[00:32:44]</a>.

## The "Keeper Test"

Netflix uses a "Keeper Test" as a mental framework for managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:45">[00:31:45]</a>. This means a manager regularly asks themselves: "If this person on my team came to me and said, 'I'm leaving today for a different opportunity, would I do everything I could to keep them at Netflix?'" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:56">[00:31:56]</a>. If the answer is no, it signals that a tough conversation about the person's role or fit within the company should occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:10">[00:32:10]</a>.

This test is a key part of the manager's role at Netflix and is frequently discussed in one-on-one meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:34">[00:33:34]</a>. While it may seem like a "heavy concept," it creates a "lightness" around regular conversations about performance and expectations, allowing employees to know where they stand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:20">[00:34:20]</a>. This transparency, despite the high bar for excellence, can alleviate stress by providing clarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:42">[00:37:42]</a>.

## Avoiding Traditional Metrics and Structures

Netflix operates without many traditional corporate processes and metrics:
*   **No Performance Reviews:** Netflix does not have a practice of formal performance reviews or ratings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:32">[00:34:32]</a>. Performance is considered in annual compensation cycles and promotions, but it's fundamentally integrated into the day-to-day operating rhythm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:01">[00:35:01]</a>.
*   **Unlimited Vacation:** The company maintains an unlimited vacation policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:47">[00:46:47]</a>.
*   **Individual Contributor (IC) Levels:** Until two years ago, Netflix did not have levels for individual contributors (e.g., all engineers were "senior engineers") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:26">[00:49:26]</a>. The introduction of IC levels was a significant shift, prompting a candid postmortem to reflect on what went well and what could be improved in its implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:55">[00:50:55]</a>. This openness to reflection, even on challenging changes, helps build community and trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:36">[00:51:36]</a>.

This lack of strict process and prescriptiveness is predicated on the high talent density, trusting employees to have strong judgment and contribute innovatively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:08">[00:46:08]</a>. Many of Netflix's successful product features and innovations have originated from individual contributors due to this space for exploration and experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:31">[00:47:31]</a>.

## Hiring for Additive Skills

To maintain high talent density, Netflix focuses its hiring not just on baseline skills, but on identifying individuals who will make the team stronger by bringing additive skills, new perspectives, and a willingness to challenge existing thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:09">[00:41:09]</a>. This constant infusion of exceptional talent helps to continually raise the bar for the entire organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:22">[00:41:22]</a>.

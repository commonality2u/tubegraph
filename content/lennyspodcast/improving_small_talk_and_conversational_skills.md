[[conversational_public_speaking_techniques | Conversational public speaking techniques]] are essential, and the ability to engage in small talk is a foundational element that can lead to significant connections and opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:13">[01:11:13]</a>. While often dreaded, small talk can lead to deep friendships and foster relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:20">[00:46:20]</a>.

## Mindset for Small Talk

Many people find small talk awkward and dread it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:02">[00:46:02]</a>. However, it's important to reframe this perception, as "a lot of big things happen in small talk" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:11">[00:46:11]</a>.

A key piece of advice for small talk, attributed to Matchmaker Rachel Greenwald, is to "be interested, not interesting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:44">[00:46:44]</a>. Instead of feeling pressure to be super interesting or "spike the ball over the net every time," small talk is more like playing hacky sack, where the goal is to set the other person up for success and keep the conversation flowing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:49">[00:46:49]</a>.

## Key Techniques for Effective Small Talk

### Comparable Levels of Disclosure
In small talk, there should be a balance in the depth of disclosure over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:12">[00:47:12]</a>. If one person shares something very personal while the other offers only superficial information, it creates a discrepancy that can feel awkward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:22">[00:47:22]</a>. The principle of reciprocity suggests that if one person shares appropriately, the other should aim to match or come close to that level of disclosure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:33">[00:47:33]</a>. The key is not to be too disclosive too quickly, as depth of sharing should evolve naturally over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:57">[00:47:57]</a>.

### Supporting vs. Shifting Responses
Conversations involve two types of responses:
*   **Supporting responses**: These encourage the other person to continue speaking and elaborate on their topic. For example, if someone says they just got back from Costa Rica, a supporting response would be, "Oh great, did you spend time in San Jose? Did you get to any of the beaches?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:33">[00:48:33]</a>.
*   **Shifting responses**: These redirect the conversation back to oneself. For example, "Oh, you went to Costa Rica? I went to Hawaii!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:46">[00:48:46]</a>.

In a good conversation, the goal is to have more supporting responses than shifting responses, but also to include some shifting responses to show engagement and willingness to share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:51">[00:48:51]</a>. An imbalance, such as constantly supporting without sharing, can make it seem like one doesn't want to disclose anything, leading to an awkward dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:59">[00:48:59]</a>.

## Why These Skills Matter
These social skills are not typically taught, yet people engage in them constantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:24">[00:49:24]</a>. Focusing on [[techniques_for_enhancing_public_speaking_skills | improving public speaking skills]] in areas like small talk can be a "superpower" because many individuals don't dedicate time to developing these abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:34">[00:49:34]</a>.

## Related Concepts and Further Learning
*   **Being present**: Being focused on the moment helps manage anxiety and improves communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:47">[00:28:47]</a>.

*   **Improvisation**: Can help individuals become more comfortable, present, and collaborative in conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:47">[00:42:47]</a>.

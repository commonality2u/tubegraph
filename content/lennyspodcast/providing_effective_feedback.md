Effective feedback aims to motivate behavior change, rather than serving as an outlet for personal frustration. This approach ensures that feedback is received constructively and leads to desired outcomes [1:06:07].

## Strategy Not Self-Expression

A common pitfall in [[providing_constructive_feedback | giving feedback]] is that individuals often wait until they are deeply frustrated before addressing an issue. This delay can lead to feedback sessions becoming mere venting sessions, where the focus is on expressing personal annoyance rather than on the recipient's growth [1:05:13].

The core principle of effective feedback is to focus on the desired **behavior change**. If behavior change is the goal, then any information that does not directly contribute to that goal should be omitted [1:06:07].

### Key Components for Effective Feedback

*   **Focus on Outcome** The goal of feedback is to motivate behavior change [1:06:07]. To achieve this, it's crucial to explain the benefit of the change to the individual and to those around them [1:06:24].
*   **Preparation** Before a feedback conversation, it is beneficial to release any pent-up frustrations. This could involve talking to a trusted friend, partner, or therapist. Clearing emotional energy beforehand allows for a more clear, grounded, and positive tone during the actual discussion [1:07:27].
*   **Conciseness** Typically, this means trimming about 90% of what one initially feels compelled to say, retaining only the 10% that will genuinely encourage change [1:06:34].
*   **Continuous Improvement** Recognizing that there's always "more juice left to squeeze" in [[improving_communication_skills | improving communication skills]] is important. People often prematurely conclude that a method has reached "diminishing returns" when further refinement could yield significant benefits [1:09:58].

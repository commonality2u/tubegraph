At Linear, a core approach to [[inventiveness_and_innovation_in_business | creativity]] and finding non-obvious solutions to customer problems involves a "systemized way of being creative" through extreme product design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:40">[01:40:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>. This method encourages designers and product managers to explore the "possibility space" beyond conventional boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:07">[04:45:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>.

## The Principle of Extremes

The fundamental question asked in this approach is: "How extreme can you take it?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:32">[04:33:32]</a>. This means designing the most outrageous version of a product or solution along a specific trait, similar to exploring an "11-star experience" or a "10x version of some idea" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.

The purpose of this radical thinking is to:
*   **See beyond defaults** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:30">[04:29:30]</a>: It helps overcome ingrained constraints and assumptions that subconsciously limit design choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>.
*   **Expand the search space** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:00">[04:35:00]</a>: By considering extreme possibilities, teams are more likely to uncover the "right choice" that might otherwise be overlooked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>. The greatest risk in product decisions is not seeing the optimal solution to begin with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>.

This method aligns with the concept of [[leveraging_first_principles_thinking_in_product_management | working backwards]] from an ideal scenario, but with a more tactical twist: pick extreme versions of specific attributes, build them quickly, and learn from the insights they provide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>.

## Application in Practice: Linear's Drafts Feature

A concrete example of this approach is the development of Linear's draft-saving feature for issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>.

1.  **Initial Problem:** Users often get interrupted while creating an issue and need to save their progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>.
2.  **Extreme 1: The "Fastest" Version**
    *   **Concept:** Make draft saving as fast and unintrusive as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>. If a user closed the issue composer, the draft would simply be saved without any pop-ups or confirmations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>. If they hit 'x', it would be thrown away instantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>.
    *   **Outcome:** Internally, this version felt "super unsafe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>. Users felt like they accidentally lost changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>.
3.  **Extreme 2: The "Safest" Version**
    *   **Concept:** Implement universal autosave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>. Any single character typed would trigger a save <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.
    *   **Outcome:** While safe, it led to a "paper trail" of unintended drafts, similar to "Untitled document" files in other tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>. Users felt overwhelmed by irrelevant saved items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>.
4.  **Final Solution (Balanced Approach)**
    *   **Compromise:** A balance between speed and safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>.
    *   When creating a *new* issue, Linear will interrupt the user to ask if they want to save a draft upon closing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>. This addresses the "unsafe" feeling of potentially losing initial work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>.
    *   When editing an *existing* draft, the system automatically saves changes without interruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>. This avoids creating unnecessary "Untitled" clutter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>.

This iterative process of building and testing extreme versions, learning from user reactions, and then finding a balanced solution leads to highly refined and user-centric features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>. This approach directly contributes to Linear's reputation for [[the_importance_of_design_in_modern_products | beautiful design]] and [[strategies_for_fast_product_development_in_startups | fast product development]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>.

## Broader Implications

This method also ties into:
*   **Speed and Quality:** Linear believes there's no trade-off between speed and quality. Instead of rushing, focus on competence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Rapid iteration, enabled by quickly building and testing extreme versions, leads to higher quality outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. Patrick Collison of [[stripes_approach_to_product_development_and_cocreation | Stripe]] tweeted that "slow and expensive usually go together" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>.
*   **Early Validation:** The goal is to have a workable solution or prototype available after only 10% of the estimated time budget has passed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>. This allows for early testing of key hypotheses and immediate learning, preventing wasted effort on features nobody wants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>.
*   **Talent and Intent:** Success with this method requires engineers who are not blocked by every design choice and are willing to build "workable solutions" even if they're not perfect initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. There's no expectation for the first version to be great; it's a "best guess" to validate or invalidate major assumptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>.
*   **Company Promise:** The chosen extreme attributes for exploration should align with the core promise or [[crafting_a_compelling_product_vision | product vision]] of the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>. For Linear, it's about being fast and making work enjoyable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>.
*   **User-Centricity:** This approach ties into the broader [[philosophy_of_product_design_and_human_potential | philosophy of product design]] at Linear: constantly seeking to understand users' emotional experiences and addressing moments where they "feel bad" about existing workflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. By feeling the extreme "bad," they can better identify the core emotional problem to solve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>.

Ultimately, by pushing the boundaries of what a product can be in extreme ways, companies like Linear can uncover non-obvious solutions and build beloved products that truly resonate with users, demonstrating a powerful strategy for [[building_and_scaling_product_innovations | building and scaling product innovations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>.

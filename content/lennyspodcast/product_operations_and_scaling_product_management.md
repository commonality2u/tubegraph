When organizations seek to [[transforming_to_a_product_operating_model | transform]] or establish a [[role_of_product_managers_in_organizations | product organization]], they often mistakenly believe that most of their issues stem from inadequate training of their people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. However, 99% of the time, the real problem lies in how goals are set and strategy is deployed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Without proper context on what to work towards, training alone is ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Therefore, setting up a product organization requires a holistic approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

Melissa Perri, through her extensive experience in speaking, consulting (including interim CPO roles), and teaching at Harvard Business School and Product Institute, has observed more product organizations closely than almost anyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. She has worked with over 30 companies in deep consulting roles for [[transforming_to_a_product_operating_model | transformations]], setting up product management, defining strategy, or aiding with roadmaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. Through training, she has worked with hundreds of companies, including nearly all Fortune 100 companies, and approached 5,000 [[role_of_product_managers_in_organizations | Product Managers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

## Challenges in Scaling Product Management

One of the biggest [[challenges_in_product_management | challenges]] for SaaS companies, particularly during their pivotal scale-up phase (transitioning from product-market fit to rapid growth), is hiring an effective Chief Product Officer (CPO) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. This CPO helps navigate the transition from a single product to a multi-product portfolio and manage complex scaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

Key problems observed in scaling product organizations include:
*   **Strategy Formulation and Deployment** Companies often struggle to formulate a comprehensive and prioritized strategy, then deploy it effectively to hundreds or thousands of employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.
*   **Lack of Communication** Executives and board members often lack visibility into what tech and product teams are doing or how they are contributing to goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.
*   **Misaligned Teams** Teams may be working intensely but without moving key metrics, leading to a perception that product/tech is a "black box" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:06">[00:22:06]</a>.
*   **Unclear Strategy** Often, a strategy exists only in people's heads and is not explicitly written down or communicated, leading to misaligned understandings across the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:04">[00:23:04]</a>.
*   **Infighting and Lack of Alignment** Different executive goals can lead to internal conflicts, with teams not working as "one team" towards common company objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:51">[00:28:51]</a>.
*   **Lack of Standardization** At scale, processes break down, leading to inconsistent roadmaps, missing [[product_management_competencies | career ladders]], ineffective meetings, and difficulty accessing necessary data for informed decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:27">[00:44:27]</a>.
*   **Customer Overload** Multiple product teams may repeatedly contact the same customers for interviews, leading to frustration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:04">[00:45:04]</a>.

## The Role of Product Operations

Product operations is an emerging role designed to address the difficulties of [[building_and_scaling_product_leadership_programs | scaling product management]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:11">[00:44:11]</a>. It helps organizations get the right insights to product teams and standardize outputs and check-ins to ensure strategy remains on track <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:16">[00:45:16]</a>.

Product operations typically encompasses three main areas:
1.  **Internal Data and Insights** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:34">[00:45:34]</a>: This team gathers and surfaces data from internal financial systems, user analytics, and other sources to help product teams monitor strategy progress, track OKRs, and make informed decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:38">[00:45:38]</a>.
2.  **Customer Research and User Insights** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:04">[00:46:04]</a>: This involves collecting external data and market research to inform strategy. It includes maintaining subscriptions to publications, leveraging subject matter experts, and standardizing customer research approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:08">[00:46:08]</a>. The goal is to scale user research, enabling more product managers to talk to customers without over-bothering them, and ensuring interviews are recorded and searchable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:49">[00:46:49]</a>. This role aims to empower, not centralize, user research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:51">[00:46:51]</a>.
3.  **Standardizing Processes and Cadences** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:31">[00:47:31]</a>: This involves defining regular check-ins for strategy and roadmaps, outlining inputs and outputs for planning sessions, and ensuring consistency in processes that interact with other divisions (e.g., sales, product marketing) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:33">[00:47:33]</a>. Product operations focuses on standardizing inter-departmental processes, not individual team practices like daily stand-ups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:10">[00:48:10]</a>.

Melissa Perri is currently writing a book on "Product Operations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>, aiming for release by the end of the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:35">[00:48:35]</a>.

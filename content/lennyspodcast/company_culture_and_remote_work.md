Melton Coron Berkowitz, Head of Growth at Deel, shares insights into how Deel, a global payroll, HR, and compliance platform, approached its rapid growth and [[building_and_maintaining_company_culture | company culture]] in a remote-first environment. Deel grew from less than a million dollars in ARR in July 2020 to $295 million in ARR by early 2023, while remaining EBITDA positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

## The Impact of Remote Work on Deel's Growth

Deel was founded before the COVID-19 pandemic, with a vision of a global work platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:41">[00:44:41]</a>. The pandemic inadvertently forced people into a "pilot program" of this vision, accelerating the adoption of remote work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:52">[00:44:52]</a>.

While many businesses transitioned back to offices, Deel always saw itself as a "global work platform" rather than strictly a "remote work platform" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:28">[00:45:28]</a>. The shift helped people realize they could work just as effectively with colleagues remotely, and that the best talent might not be geographically close <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>. This increased comfort with remote and global hiring directly benefited Deel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:16">[00:46:16]</a>.

## Building Deel's Culture in a Remote Environment

Melton emphasizes that [[Building and maintaining company culture | culture]] is composed of two parts: what team members bring to the company and what the company gives back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:13">[00:55:13]</a>.

### Core Values

Deel's core values, or what they expect from team members, emerged naturally and were formalized about a year into the company's existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:57">[00:57:57]</a>:

*   **Deel Speed:** This is Deel's version of [[productivity_and_innovation_in_remote_work_environments | velocity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:28">[00:55:28]</a>. It means acting with urgency for customers, ensuring problems are solved within 24 hours, and building products ten times faster than competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:30">[00:55:30]</a>.
*   **Default Optimism:** In a new and evolving space, Deel needs team members who approach challenges with a positive outlook, focusing on how something *can* work rather than why it won't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:07">[00:56:07]</a>. This fosters a proactive mindset to identify and solve risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:25">[00:56:25]</a>.
*   **Customer Focus:** Recognizing that Deel handles people's livelihoods and company hiring, there's a deep personal care for the customer. Ensuring paychecks are on time and contracts are legal is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:37">[00:56:37]</a>.

Deel's culture is intense, but this is openly shared with prospective employees and is seen as what sets them apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:39">[00:57:39]</a>. This urgency and focus on getting things done contributes to less burnout, as people feel a sense of accomplishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:10">[01:00:10]</a>.

### Company's Commitment to Employees

In return for employees embracing these values, Deel offers significant flexibility:

*   **Freedom and Flexibility:** Employees choose how and when they do their job, including where they work from and their hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:23">[00:57:23]</a>. This allows individuals to arrange their lives as they wish, provided they deliver results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:01">[01:03:01]</a>. For example, Melton worked from Istanbul using an ironing board as a desk, a testament to this flexibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:37">[01:01:37]</a>.
*   **Authenticity and Camaraderie:** As a remote-first company from day one, Deel fostered a culture where people could be their authentic selves. Interactions often included pets and partners, building sincerity and camaraderie even before in-person meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:40">[01:04:40]</a>. Melton herself didn't meet many Deel team members in person until a year and a half after joining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:19">[01:03:19]</a>.

The company's focus was always on the product and getting things done, leading to some non-essentials, like company swag, being an afterthought (they only created T-shirts when they needed them for a NASDAQ photo opportunity after reaching a billion dollars in valuation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:02">[01:04:02]</a>.

### Key Takeaways for Remote Company Culture

*   **Focus on the Product First:** A strong product is the core; [[hiring_and_team_management_philosophy_in_tech_startups | marketing]] and sales won't sustain a "crappy product" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:31">[00:43:31]</a>. In early-stage companies, a higher proportion of product and engineering staff signals a solid foundation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:47">[00:43:47]</a>.
*   **Prioritize Willingness to Do "Dirty Work":** When [[hiring_and_team_management_philosophy_in_tech_startups | building a team]], especially in early stages, prioritize candidates willing to engage in the "nitty-gritty" tasks with limited resources, a concept Deel calls "little hands" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:28">[00:48:28]</a>.
*   **Formalize Values Organically:** Values should represent who the company already is, rather than aspirational goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:04">[00:59:04]</a>.
*   **Foster Urgency:** A constant sense of urgency can lead to greater fulfillment and less burnout among employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:59">[00:59:59]</a>.
*   **Embrace Authenticity:** Remote work can foster a sincere and authentic team culture by allowing individuals to present their true selves in their home environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:40">[01:04:40]</a>.

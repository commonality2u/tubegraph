Marc Benioff, co-founder and CEO of Salesforce, the second-largest B2B SaaS company globally, shares insights into his [[Leadership and personal growth as a CEO | leadership]] philosophy, drawing from decades of experience and transformative moments in technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>.

## Embracing a "Beginner's Mind"
Benioff emphasizes the importance of cultivating a "beginner's mind" (**shoshin** in Japanese) to remain open to new possibilities and avoid the limitations of an "expert's mind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:23:00">[23:23:00]</a>. This mindset is crucial for continuous innovation and problem-solving, even after decades in the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:43:00">[23:43:00]</a>.

He likens this practice to meditation, often visiting Zen temples in Kyoto to clear his mind and foster creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:28:00">[27:28:00]</a>. Benioff believes that finding a physical or mental space to clear one's mind allows new ideas to emerge, enabling leaders to "write that music" of their business or product plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:49:00">[28:49:00]</a>.

## The Journey is the Reward
Benioff explicitly states that he "never look[s] at the stock" because he finds it "very distracting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:29:00">[30:29:00]</a>. He encourages his employees to do the same, asserting that "the stock isn't the goal... that's not why we're doing this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:42:00">[30:42:00]</a>. This philosophy, also echoed by Steve Jobs, centers on the idea that "the journey is the reward" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:50:00">[30:50:00]</a>.

## Perpetual Startup Mentality
Despite Salesforce's size, Benioff considers himself a "startup CEO" and Salesforce a "startup entrepreneur" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:05:00">[31:05:00]</a>. This mindset allows him to constantly seek new beginnings, such as pioneering the "digital labor industry" with their Agent Force product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:37:00">[31:37:00]</a>.

## Experimentation and Adaptation
Benioff's approach to launching new initiatives, like Salesforce's Agent Force product, is to "throw everything against the wall and look at what's going to stick" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:21:00">[21:21:00]</a>. He aims to find the "winning tactic and turn it into a winning strategy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:09:00">[21:09:00]</a>.

This experimental mindset is critical for breaking through the "noisy world" of technology and gaining attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:41:00">[18:41:00]</a>. Examples of this strategy include:
*   Hiring fake protesters and news crews at a rival conference for Salesforce's initial launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:33:00">[15:33:00]</a>.
*   Utilizing celebrity friends (Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson) for advertising campaigns and seeking public feedback on Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:06:00">[20:06:00]</a>.
*   Aggressively marketing against competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:47:00">[20:47:00]</a>.
*   Expanding distribution by hiring thousands of new account executives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:36:00">[21:36:00]</a>.

Benioff compares this iterative process to comedian Chris Rock testing jokes in clubs before a Netflix special, refining what works through constant experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:40:00">[22:40:00]</a>.

## The "Orchestra Leader" Approach
For Benioff, [[lessons_from_successful_founders_and_startups | entrepreneurship]] is not just about product, sales, or marketing, but about orchestrating all aspects of the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:02:00">[45:02:00]</a>. He advises against being a "clarinet player" and instead encourages leaders to "be playing the whole Symphony" encompassing shareholders, stakeholders, and customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:14:00">[45:14:00]</a>.

## Navigating Challenges and Non-Linear Success
Benioff acknowledges that [[Leadership and personal growth as a CEO | leadership]] is a "roller coaster" with no "linear success" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:24:00">[50:24:00]</a>. He shares a personal "fail corner" experience from two years prior when Salesforce had to lay off 10% of its workforce due to over-hiring during the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:14:00">[47:14:00]</a>. While painful, this "financial transformation" and simultaneous "technology and product and innovation transformation" were necessary to regenerate the company and achieve its current success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:50:00">[48:50:00]</a>. He maintains that "massive issues" are constantly present for entrepreneurs, and one must learn and evolve from them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:31:00">[49:31:00]</a>.

## Strategic Vision: Anticipating the Next Wave
Benioff has a history of anticipating future trends, evidenced by his early acquisition of numerous domain names, including `salesforce.com`, `appstore.com`, and `einstein.com` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>. His decision to gift `appstore.com` to Steve Jobs highlights a long-standing, mutually beneficial relationship and shared visionary outlook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:25:00">[12:25:00]</a>.

He views AI as the "defining technology of our lifetime" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:31:00">[31:31:00]</a> and focuses on evolving Salesforce into an "agentic platform" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:27:00">[38:27:00]</a>. Rather than fearing what's next, Benioff advocates for a mindset that says, "oh the next thing is coming, I can't wait for the next thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:03:00">[53:03:00]</a>. This includes embracing continuous improvement (Kaizen) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:20:00">[52:20:00]</a> and welcoming competition, as it validates the market and drives progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:29:00">[51:29:00]</a>.

Every item in a product backlog is considered a "bet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While [[continuous_product_discovery | continuous Discovery]] helps make better bets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, it's crucial not to halt product development (making bets) to conduct discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Instead, product teams should strive to do both in parallel, allowing discovery to continuously improve the quality of those bets over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

The common misconception is viewing discovery and delivery as sequential phases â€“ "first I discover and then I deliver" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. However, in effective product management, teams are always delivering and always discovering simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## The Role of [[continuous_product_discovery | Continuous Discovery]]

Teresa Torres, author of *Continuous Discovery Habits*, defines [[continuous_product_discovery | continuous Discovery]] as building in continuous feedback loops to ensure product teams are making good decisions about what to build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a>. This approach acknowledges that digital products are never truly "done" and require continuous evolution based on evolving customer needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>.

### Addressing the "No Time for Discovery" Argument

The argument that there's "no time for discovery" often stems from outdated project-based research methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:16">[00:24:16]</a>. In a continuous delivery environment, teams cannot afford to pause development for lengthy research projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:21">[00:24:21]</a>. [[continuous_product_discovery | Continuous Discovery]] can be integrated efficiently:

*   **Small, Sustainable Efforts**: It can be sustained with as little as one customer interview per week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:49">[00:24:49]</a>.
*   **Parallel Work**: Continue making "bets" (delivering) while concurrently conducting discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:16">[00:26:16]</a>. This parallel effort ensures that future bets become increasingly better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:23">[00:26:23]</a>.

### Managing Risk in Product Bets

Not all solutions require extensive discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:13">[00:30:13]</a>. The level of discovery needed depends on the inherent risk of the "bet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:51">[00:30:51]</a>.

*   **Assess Risk**: Product teams should instrument their products and measure the impact of releases to understand the real risk involved in different ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:05">[00:31:05]</a>.
*   **Over-Index Initially**: For those new to discovery, it's advisable to "over index" on discovery to develop a refined judgment for assessing risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:22">[00:31:22]</a>.
*   **Multiple Solutions for Core Functionality**: When developing solutions for core product functionality or differentiators, it's best practice to explore and compare multiple potential solutions. This approach helps guard against settling for the most "obvious" solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:31">[00:31:31]</a>.

### Integrating Assumption Testing and Delivery

Assumption testing is not separate from delivery; it is considered the start of delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:03">[00:25:03]</a>. To make [[continuous_product_discovery | continuous Discovery]] sustainable, product teams need to:

1.  **Break Down Ideas**: Deconstruct large ideas into their underlying assumptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:10">[00:45:10]</a>.
2.  **Prioritize Assumptions**: Determine which assumptions are most critical to test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:15">[00:45:15]</a>.
3.  **Run Small, Focused Tests**: Design tests that specifically validate individual assumptions, rather than the entire idea at once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:19">[00:45:19]</a>. This allows teams to run many tests (e.g., half a dozen to a dozen per week) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:49">[00:45:49]</a>, supporting the evaluation of multiple solution ideas simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:54">[00:45:54]</a>.

### The Foundation: Understanding Customers

Companies that build successful products intuitively or explicitly dedicate time to deeply understand the customer journey, their unmet needs, and pain points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. This deep understanding is crucial for making informed decisions on what to build.

### Autonomy in Discovery

Product managers, even those in individual contributor roles within larger organizations, can empower themselves by focusing on developing [[continuous_product_discovery | continuous Discovery]] habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>. This includes seeking opportunities to talk to customers, even if it means finding contacts outside of official channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>. By gaining a fuller context of business and customer needs, product managers can make better daily decisions, even when prescribed solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>.

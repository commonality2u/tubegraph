Elena Verna, recognized for her expertise in [[growth_strategies_in_tech_companies | growth strategies]], emphasizes that growth is a "layering game" rather than a "switching game" when it comes to adopting different models like sales-led and [[productled_growth_strategies | product-led]] approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. She has led growth at companies such as Miro, SurveyMonkey, and Amplitude, and advised firms like MongoDB, Netlify, and HP on their [[growth_strategies_in_tech_companies | growth strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## Evolution of B2B Products and Marketplaces

Traditionally, B2B products were designed for enterprise buyers focused on utility, efficiency, and solving organizational problems, often resulting in "cold interfaces" and "unusable products" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a>. These buyers were typically not the end-users of the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>. This contrasts with B2C products, which must be "shiny and exciting" because they market directly to users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>.

A significant shift over the last decade has seen decision-making power pushed back to the "prosumer" or employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a>. This has led to a new wave of B2B products that are "shiny and fun," "consumer-like" in their functionality, and aim to build habits and become part of users' lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>. Elena is excited to work in B2B because the industry is correcting itself by creating "fantastic experiences" focused on effectiveness, making employees "more productive" and "more successful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>.

### Consumerization of B2B

The "consumerization" of B2B is driven by a redefinition of the customer from an enterprise buyer to a user, leading to products built for the actual users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>. Key elements include:
*   **Onboarding and Activation:** Focus on the initial user experience and "time to value" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>.
*   **Habit Loops:** Building products that foster regular usage and engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>.
*   **User-Centricity:** Measuring success by user affinity, advocacy, and Net Promoter Score (NPS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>.

Examples of companies that have successfully leveraged user-centricity to disrupt traditional B2B markets include:
*   **Slack:** Gained traction by building for users, forcing enterprise buyers to adopt it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:44">[00:20:44]</a>.
*   **Miro:** Users bring the software into companies because it enhances collaboration and effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>.
*   **Amplitude:** Shifting from traditional top-down sales where a head of data buys the product, to a bottom-up user adoption model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>.

This evolution signifies a move towards solving user problems rather than just fulfilling "checklists of security data storage and compliance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:35">[00:21:35]</a>.

## [[productled_growth_strategies | Product-Led Growth (PLG)]] Explained

[[productled_growth_strategies | Product-led growth]] refers to a specific approach within a [[developing_growth_models | growth model]] where the product itself drives acquisition, retention, and monetization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>.

### Bottoms-Up vs. Product-Led

*   **Bottoms-Up:** Leveraging user engagement and usage to generate leads for sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:33">[00:22:33]</a>.
*   **[[productled_growth_strategies | Product-Led]]:** A version of bottoms-up where the product actively generates leads and leverages product qualification criteria to facilitate enterprise contracts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>.

## The Relationship Between Sales-Led and [[productled_growth_strategies | Product-Led Growth]]

Elena asserts that successful companies execute both sales-led and [[productled_growth_strategies | product-led]] strategies, viewing them as a "sequential play" rather than a binary choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. If a company is sales-led, transitioning to [[productled_growth_strategies | product-led]] means "hunkering down" on existing sales strategies and "overlaying product-led" approaches to amplify [[growth_strategies_in_tech_companies | existing growth]], never to switch entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:47">[00:27:47]</a>. Ultimately, to own the market, companies must do both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:19">[00:27:19]</a>.

### When to Prioritize [[productled_growth_strategies | Product-Led Growth]]

Companies should first focus on being [[productled_growth_strategies | product-led]] in retention, which involves nailing activation and engagement through habitual loops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>. Without strong product-led retention, acquisition via product-led means (e.g., users buying, referring, or creating content) is highly unlikely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>.

Whether a product has a "one-to-many" (collaborative) relationship like Slack or Miro, or a "single mode" relationship like Snowflake, influences the viability of [[productled_growth_strategies | product-led]] acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:05">[00:25:05]</a>. Many B2B products lack this "one-to-many" relationship, making [[productled_growth_strategies | product-led]] acquisition difficult and often necessitating reliance on marketing-led and sales-led approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:31">[00:25:31]</a>.

## Common Pitfalls for [[productled_growth_strategies | Product-Led]] Companies Adding Sales

A common pattern for [[productled_growth_strategies | product-led]] companies is experiencing initial success, attracting multiple users within organizations, and closing large enterprise contracts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:52">[00:28:52]</a>. This leads to doubling down on sales hires, fueled by strong initial usage and existing advocates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:31">[00:29:31]</a>.

However, a "slowness occurs" when companies exhaust their existing base of enterprise buyers within their user base, as often only a minority of buyers are active users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:56">[00:29:56]</a>. Companies then start investing in enterprise marketing and demand generation, sometimes "disconnecting the dots" from their product's organic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:24">[00:30:24]</a>.

The "crucial mistake" is letting go of [[productled_growth_strategies | product usage growth]] and [[productled_growth_strategies | product-led]] tactics in favor of enterprise sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:54">[00:30:54]</a>. This often means prioritizing hiring enterprise reps over growth PMs or marketers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:02">[00:31:02]</a>. Neglecting continuous user growth, community building, and habitual loops eventually leads to a slowdown in enterprise pipeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:38">[00:31:38]</a>.

Many companies overcorrect, forgetting their [[productled_growth_strategies | product-led]] roots, leading to a "dangerous turn" or even a "complete slowdown in growth" if not realized quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:01">[00:32:01]</a>.

### Avoiding the Downfall
*   **Understand ACVs:** [[productled_growth_strategies | Product-led growth]] (PLG) and product sales are expansion games. Average Contract Values (ACVs) in PLG are not directly comparable to sales top-down models, as PLG often lands customers much earlier in the relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:13">[00:35:13]</a>.
*   **Protect User-Focused Roadmap:** Avoid shifting product roadmap focus exclusively to enterprise features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:02">[00:36:02]</a>. Continuously innovate and delight users so they remain "the selling agent within the organization" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:17">[00:36:17]</a>. Building solely for enterprise buyers risks losing the essence of [[productled_growth_strategies | product-led]] growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:27">[00:36:27]</a>.

## The Rise of Product-Led Sales (PLS)

Product-Led Sales is an emerging trend that Elena predicts will "box out" traditional top-down sales organizations in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:52">[00:36:52]</a>.

### Product-Led Sales Defined
Product-Led Sales involves:
1.  **Self-Serve Usage:** Starts with product acquisition (marketing or product-led) and some form of self-serve usage (freemium or self-serve monetization) without human involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:05">[00:39:05]</a>.
2.  **Usage-Based Qualification:** Growing the ability to understand how closely users are approaching a point where the entire enterprise would benefit. This involves looking for "network effects" within an organization's user base and scoring users based on factors like usage volume, velocity, breadth of feature use, behavior, and demographics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:28">[00:39:28]</a>.
3.  **Sales Involvement:** Sales teams get involved based on this product qualification model.
    *   **Hand-Raisers:** First, generate organic leads through user-driven sales lead forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:28">[00:40:28]</a>.
    *   **Outbound Based on Usage:** Secondly, identify users who act like hand-raisers but haven't explicitly reached out, and proactively engage them to connect with an enterprise buyer or facilitate introductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:44">[00:40:44]</a>.

In essence, Product-Led Sales uses the product as the "sales enablement material" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>. This contrasts with traditional sales-led models that rely on Marketing Qualified Leads (MQLs), prospecting, outbound efforts to find buyers, numerous demos, and "wining and dining" to convince them to purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:05">[00:41:05]</a>. PLS leads to lower acquisition costs because it focuses on users rather than buyers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:19">[00:37:19]</a>.

Elena believes that enterprise buyers are increasingly being "boxed out" of the decision-making process, with the decision moving to the user. [[productled_growth_strategies | Product-led sales]] is the best way to capture this user intent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:27">[00:38:27]</a>.

## Freemium vs. Trial Models

Elena is a strong advocate for freemium models over time-bound trials, especially in B2B <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:57">[00:41:57]</a>.

*   **Freemium:** Allows for ongoing free usage of a product, often with feature or usage limitations ("walls") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:13">[00:42:13]</a>.
*   **Trial:** Allows free usage for a limited, time-bound period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:26">[00:42:26]</a>.

The core issue with time-bound trials is that the time needed to evaluate a product varies significantly across different organizational sizes and complexities. A 7-day trial might work for a small startup but alienate large enterprises with many dependencies, which may need months to get value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:47">[00:42:47]</a>. This "superficial time component" is not a good measure of value realization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:44">[00:43:44]</a>.

Instead of time-based trials, Elena suggests usage-based freemium models, like MongoDB's free community cluster, which allows playing around without a time limit, pushing production use cases to paid models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:57">[00:43:57]</a>. Even high-friction products like Amplitude, Twilio, and Contentful, which require significant setup, can benefit from freemium, especially for smaller businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>. The trend is for all industries to adopt some form of freemium as a "Trojan horse" into organizations, driven by user focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:07">[00:47:07]</a>.

### Strategic Reasons for Freemium
The biggest mistake is viewing freemium solely as a conversion rate optimization tactic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:52">[00:49:52]</a>. Instead, companies should have a clear strategy for their freemium offering, focusing on its strategic business impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>:
*   **Indirect Monetization:** Drives virality or network effects, acquiring new users, as seen with Miro's free boards or SurveyMonkey's free user base driving 100% of acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:54">[00:47:54]</a>.
*   **Proof of Concept (POC):** Helps users reach an "aha moment" and lowers activation friction, as with MongoDB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:36">[00:47:36]</a>.
*   **Strategic Land:** Allows landing with a segment not immediately monetized but offers future expansion potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:43">[00:48:43]</a>.
*   **Commoditization Defense:** If core features are commoditized, offering them free can differentiate the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:47">[00:48:47]</a>.
*   **Habit Loops:** Promotes engagement through features like notifications or communication channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:59">[00:50:59]</a>.
*   **Product Development & Data Collection:** Serves as a "breeding ground" for discovering adjacent use cases and personas, or for collecting data to build paid products, like LinkedIn leveraging its freemium base for Sales Navigator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:06">[00:49:06]</a>.

Anything that creates friction for the [[growth_strategies_in_tech_companies | growth model]] should be gated behind paid features, while anything that promotes it should be free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:09">[00:51:09]</a>.

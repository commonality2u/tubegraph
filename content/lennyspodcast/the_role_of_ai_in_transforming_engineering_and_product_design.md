Michael Tru, co-founder and CEO of Any Sphere, the company behind Cursor, envisions a future "after code" where the process of building software is fundamentally transformed by AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">00:00:04</a>. Cursor, an AI code editor, is at the forefront of this shift, changing how engineers and [[impact_of_ai_on_product_teams | product teams]] build software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">00:01:06</a>.

## The "After Code" World: A New Type of Programming

The core goal with Cursor is to invent a new type of programming, a different way to build software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">00:00:00</a>, distilled into describing intent to the computer in the most concise way possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">00:04:53</a>. This future involves defining how software should work and look, leveraging maturing AI technology to achieve a much higher level of productivity and accessibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">00:05:01</a>.

Tru contrasts this vision with two common perspectives on the future of software building:
*   **Continuation of current practices:** Some believe software building will remain largely the same, involving text editing formal programming languages like TypeScript, Go, C, and Rust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">00:05:50</a>.
*   **Chatbot-style interaction:** Others imagine simply typing requests into a bot to build and modify software in a "chatbot Slackbot style" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">00:05:58</a>.

Tru argues that both visions have problems. The chatbot approach lacks the precision needed for humans to have complete control over software appearance and function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">00:06:27</a>. The belief that nothing will change ignores the significant advancements in AI technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">00:06:51</a>.

Instead, the "after code" world will feature a representation of software logic that resembles English or an evolution of programming language towards pseudocode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">00:07:01</a>. This allows for high-level editing and navigation, replacing impenetrable millions of lines of code with something "much terser and easier to navigate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">00:07:18</a>. The human will remain in the driver's seat, maintaining control over all aspects of the software and having the ability to make very quick changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">00:08:11</a>.

## [[transformations_in_engineering_roles_with_ai | Transformations in Engineering Roles with AI]]

In this evolving landscape, Michael Tru anticipates significant [[transformations_in_engineering_roles_with_ai | transformations in engineering roles with AI]] and the skills required:
*   **Shift to Logic Designer:** Being an engineer will increasingly feel like being a "logic designer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">00:09:41</a>. The focus will be on specifying the *intent* for how things should work (the "what"), rather than the precise implementation details (the "how") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">00:09:46</a>.
*   **Importance of "Taste":** "Taste" will become increasingly valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">00:08:52</a>. While taste often refers to visual design (UI/UX), Tru expands it to encompass the logic and functionality of software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">00:09:09</a>. This means having the "right idea for what should be built," enabling effortless translation of intent into working software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">00:12:01</a>.
*   **Less Emphasis on "Carefulness":** While currently a critical skill, engineers will eventually need to be less careful as AI improves, reducing the risk of glaring deficiencies and functionality issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">00:10:27</a>. The focus will shift from carefulness to taste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">00:10:37</a>.
*   **Vibe Coding:** The concept of "vibe coding" (generating code without fully understanding the details) is related <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">00:10:49</a>. While currently problematic due to limitations in control, future solutions aim to provide continued control even when users don't fully understand the underlying code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">00:11:20</a>.

## [[impact_of_ai_and_machine_learning_on_product_development | Impact of AI and Machine Learning on Product Development]]: Cursor's Origin and Approach

Cursor's inception was a "solution search of a problem," reflecting on how AI would improve over the next decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">00:13:06</a>. Key inspirations included:
*   **Git Co-pilot:** The first beta version of Git Co-pilot was seen as a truly useful AI product and one of the most useful dev tools adopted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">00:13:26</a>.
*   **OpenAI Scaling Papers:** Research demonstrating that AI would improve simply by scaling models and data, even without new ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">00:13:56</a>.

This led to the realization that AI products were now possible and the technology would mature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">00:14:15</a>. While many focused on making models, Cursor aimed to apply AI to a specific area of knowledge work, considering the end state of that work and the tools used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">00:14:30</a>.

Initially, Cursor's team made a "misstep," trying to automate mechanical engineering, an area they perceived as "uncompetitive and sleepy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">00:15:19</a>. However, they lacked domain expertise and found challenges in developing models without sufficient data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">00:15:47</a>. They eventually pivoted to programming, seeing an "ambition gap" among existing tools and a need for a more comprehensive transformation of software creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">00:16:40</a>.

### Cursor's Strategic Choices
Cursor chose the IDE (Integrated Development Environment) path over a full AI agent or model-only approach. This decision was driven by:
*   **Human Control:** A core belief in giving humans control over all decisions in the end product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">00:19:10</a>. This contrasts with visions where AI makes all decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">00:19:24</a>.
*   **Realism of Current AI:** An "intense realist" view of AI's current capabilities, acknowledging that despite magical feats, models still have "massive issues" and cannot do everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">00:19:51</a>.
*   **Dogfooding:** The product development process was centered on "dogfooding" – intensely using the tool internally every day to ensure it was useful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:03">00:20:03</a>.
*   **Anticipating Change:** The belief that programming will change significantly, necessitating control over the entire application, not just a plugin to an existing environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:49">00:20:49</a>.

Tru expects the IDE itself to evolve, allowing seamless movement between direct interaction and AI spinning off tasks in the background, such as bug fixes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">00:21:20</a>.

### Custom Models and Ensemble Approach
Counterintuitively, Cursor, a company often perceived as a "GPT wrapper," found it necessary to develop its own custom models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">00:20:20</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:18">00:32:18</a>. While they utilize large generative models like Sonnet, Gemini, and GPT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:23">00:32:23</a>, every "magic moment" in Cursor involves a custom model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:40">00:23:40</a>. This "ensemble of models" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:45">00:37:45</a> is critical for:
*   **Cost and Speed:** Foundation models are too slow and expensive for certain use cases, like autocomplete, which requires completions within 300 milliseconds for every keystroke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:45">00:34:45</a>.
*   **Specialty Use Cases:** Custom models are trained for specific tasks, such as autocompleting a series of diffs (changes in codebase) across multiple files <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">00:36:00</a>.
*   **Complementing Foundation Models:** Smaller, specialized models enhance the input to and output from large models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:35">00:36:35</a>:
    *   **Input Side:** Models search codebases to find relevant parts to show to big models (like a "mini Google search for code") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:47">00:36:47</a>.
    *   **Output Side:** Models fill in the details of changes suggested by high-level foundation models, turning sketches into full code diffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:03">00:37:03</a>.

This pragmatic approach involves starting with the best pre-trained models, often open-source, and fine-tuning them for specific tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:08">00:38:08</a>.

## Market Dynamics and Defensibility

Cursor's rapid growth—from $0 to $100 million ARR in 20 months, and $300 million ARR in 2 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">00:01:13</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">00:01:18</a>—is attributed to a strategy focused on continuous product improvement and being product-led <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">00:27:07</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:44">00:28:44</a>.
*   **Sustained Paranoia:** Success comes from "sustained paranoia" about how the product can always get better, constantly iterating and making the tool consistently better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:16">00:27:16</a>.
*   **Product-Led Growth:** The company focused heavily on building a product they and their team loved, and then adjusting it based on user feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:15">00:29:15</a>. They deliberately "let fires burn" on sales and marketing initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:10">00:29:10</a>.
*   **Hybrid Company:** Cursor operates as a hybrid between a normal software company (building a product for millions of people) and a foundation model company (investing in science and models) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:51">00:29:51</a>.

On defensibility, Tru believes that in the AI space, the ceiling for innovation is incredibly high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:25">00:39:25</a>. This leads to a consumer-like market dynamic where companies must "be the best thing consistently" rather than relying on lock-in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:56">00:40:56</a>. The market for building tools for developers is seen as vastly larger than in the past, driven by the profound capabilities of AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">00:43:00</a>. While many solutions will emerge, Tru predicts one company will eventually build the "general tool that builds almost all the world's software," becoming a "generationally big business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:38">00:43:38</a>.

## [[tips_for_using_ai_in_product_development | Tips for Using AI in Product Development]] with Cursor

To become more successful with Cursor and other AI tools, Tru offers two key [[tips_for_using_ai_in_product_development | tips for using AI in product development]]:
1.  **Chop things up:** Instead of trying to give the model one giant instruction, break tasks into smaller bits. Specify a little, get a little work, specify a little more. This iterative approach is currently more effective than expecting the model to handle a large, complex task in one go <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:28">00:47:28</a>.
2.  **Explicitly discover limits:** In a safe environment (like a side project), intentionally push the AI to its limits to understand what it *can* and *cannot* do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:05">00:48:05</a>. Many users underestimate AI's capabilities because they haven't fully tested its boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:25">00:48:25</a>. This builds a "gut feeling" for the model's capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:48">00:48:48</a>.

## Impact on Junior vs. Senior Engineers

AI tools like Cursor benefit both junior and senior engineers, though they fall into different "anti-patterns" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:45">00:49:45</a>:
*   **Junior Engineers:** Tend to rely too "wholesale" on AI for everything, which is not yet feasible for professional, large-scale projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:55">00:49:55</a>.
*   **Senior Engineers:** On average, senior engineers tend to underrate what AI can do for them and stick to existing workflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:46">00:50:46</a>. However, some very senior individuals, especially those on developer experience teams, are pushing boundaries and adopting the technology extensively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:20">00:50:20</a>.

## Future of Engineering Roles

Despite concerns about AI automating coding, Tru believes engineers will continue to be needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:18">01:07:18</a>. The demand for software is "very lasting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:26">01:07:26</a>, and AI will enable engineers to do "much more" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:24">01:07:24</a>. The current cost and labor-intensiveness of building software are substantial, even for simple applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:35">01:07:35</a>. By reducing this friction, AI will unlock a "tons and tons and tons" more demand for software and tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:56">01:07:56</a>. Therefore, there will be more demand for engineers long into the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:49">01:08:49</a>.

The broader shift in AI is expected to be "incredibly consequential," more so than the internet or the advent of computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:07">01:03:07</a>. This transformation will take decades, involving progress on both the scientific side (making models faster, cheaper, smarter) and the product experience side (how humans interact with and control these tools) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:18">01:03:18</a>. Companies that build both the underlying technology and the product experience for specific areas of knowledge work will be particularly impactful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:13">01:04:13</a>.

[[product_leadership_and_management_techniques | First principles thinking]] is a core tenet of Toby's approach to [[product_leadership_and_management_techniques | leadership]] and product development at Shopify, alongside a deep focus on [[leadership_and_personal_growth_as_a_ceo | maximizing human potential]]. This methodology involves deconstructing problems to their fundamental truths and building solutions from there, rather than relying on analogies or conventional wisdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:05">[02:05:05]</a>.

## Defining First Principles Thinking
At its heart, [[leveraging_first_principles_thinking_in_product_management | first principles thinking]] is about questioning every assumption and approaching problems as if starting from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:16">[03:16:16]</a>. It's akin to thinking from the "atomic building blocks" of a problem, rather than relying on existing solutions or what has been done before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:50">[03:20:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:46">[05:00:46]</a>.

### Energy Source for Builders
Toby's personal energy source is "dissatisfaction with the status quo" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:07">[02:07:07]</a>. He views today's world as "the dystopia of the future" and believes it is incumbent upon builders to create products that lead towards progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:03">[02:44:03]</a>. This dissatisfaction fuels the drive to re-evaluate existing solutions and build anew from fundamental truths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:52">[02:51:52]</a>.

### Challenging Conventional Wisdom
A key aspect of this approach is a default skepticism towards common practices:
> "If most people are doing it a certain way, I by default don't want to do it that way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:31">[00:31:31]</a>.
> "If you want to do something world class, you can't do it like everyone else" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:02">[03:40:02]</a>.

This mindset is rooted in the belief that "optimism always sounds dumb or at least naive" while "pessimism sounds extremely sophisticated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:56">[00:53:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:37">[02:37:37]</a>. However, true "alpha" (value) in the world often lies in "unobvious but true" things that people dismiss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:27">[02:46:27]</a>.

## Application in Decision-Making
[[leveraging_first_principles_thinking_in_product_management | First principles thinking]] manifests in several ways within Toby's [[product_management_and_leadership_insights | leadership]] and at Shopify:

### The "Toby Tornado"
This term describes a process where conversations, change management, or conflicts are "compressed into a very short time frame" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>. If a project is deemed not good, it might be stopped, and a new version started, often with the same team becoming "founders of the next version" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>.

[!INFO] This rapid decision-making stems from a belief that it's "super unfair for letting people work on something that isn't going to make it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:00">[06:46:00]</a>. Ignoring a problem is seen as an "abdication of CEO and founder responsibility" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:54:00">[06:54:00]</a>.

### Challenging Feedback and Maximizing Potential
Toby's feedback style is often direct and "hard to hear" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:00">[08:35:00]</a>, but it's driven by the conviction that "not a single person on this planet who is even close to being at their maximum potential" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:49:00">[08:49:00]</a>. This directness aims to remind people of their capabilities and push them beyond "unambitious things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:21:00">[09:21:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:00">[09:32:00]</a>. This aligns with [[coaching_and_leadership_in_product_management | coaching and leadership]] by holding individuals to a high standard, enabling them to achieve things they didn't imagine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:25:00">[10:25:00]</a>.

### Data-Informed vs. Data-Driven
Shopify does not use strict KPIs or OKRs in the conventional sense for core product teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>. This is to avoid "overfitting" or "Goodhart's Law," which states that "any metric that becomes a goal ceases to be a good metric" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>. While extremely data-informed, decisions are ultimately made by "pilots" (leaders) who also value "unquantifiable things such as taste, quality, passion, love, fun, and delight" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>. If everyone is having more fun, metrics will eventually follow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>.

### Remote Work Decision During COVID-19
The decision to go "remote only forever" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a> during COVID-19 is a prime example of FPT. It involved re-running foundational assumptions, such as whether people were allowed to leave their homes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. This external change invalidated previous optimal choices (e.g., in-person offices) and led to a completely different optimal outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>. It highlighted that "most of the time you end up in a bad part of a tree in a bad in in a local maxima of a path dependent environment by only making good choices" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>.

### Being "Close to the Metal"
For leaders, especially in tech, FPT requires being "in the details" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>. Toby, despite being CEO, actively codes and immerses himself in engineering details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>. This hands-on involvement ensures a fundamental understanding of the "atomic building blocks" (the computers and code) necessary to create effective solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>.

## An "Algorithm" for First Principles Thinking
While not a rigid five-step algorithm, Toby's approach to FPT can be summarized as:
1.  **Analyze Path Dependence:** Understand the historical assumptions and compromises that led to existing solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>.
2.  **Identify Overfitting:** Determine what existing solutions or metrics are over-optimizing for, potentially missing larger opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.
3.  **Re-derive from Foundational Assumptions:** Start with the current fundamental building blocks and capabilities, then derive the optimal solution without being constrained by legacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>.
4.  **Embrace Disagreement and Courage:** Actively invite and value disagreement, as it helps uncover unstated or incorrect foundational assumptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>. Courage is seen as rarer than IQ or genius in business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>.
5.  **Long-Term Horizon (100-Year Vision):** Think with a 100-year vision, focusing on the mission and long-term value rather than short-term gains or "tactic-driven" approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>.
    *   This long-term view transforms business into an "infinite game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a> (referencing James Carse's "Finite and Infinite Games") where the goal is to perpetuate the game, not win it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>.
    *   On a long enough timeline, "playing positive sum games with your customers is the ultimate growth hack" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:37">[01:09:37]</a>.

## Impact on Entrepreneurship
[[leveraging_first_principles_thinking_in_product_management | First principles thinking]] at Shopify also extends to its mission of making entrepreneurship more common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>. By rigorously simplifying complex processes and user interfaces, Shopify aims to reduce the "courage needed" to start a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:38">[01:19:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>. This includes features that "autopilot taxes or payments" and reduce the risk of new entrepreneurs being "stunned" and giving up due to complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>. This directly [[effective_team_building_and_leadership_in_startups | enables more businesses]] to exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:32">[01:24:32]</a>.

## Conclusion
Ultimately, the quality of any product is a reflection of how much its creators "gave a sh*t" about it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:17">[01:37:17]</a>. For [[product_management_and_leadership_insights | product leaders]], this means being "exothermically infectious with actually caring about this thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:07">[01:39:07]</a> and "looking around corners" to deeply understand the product and its users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:35">[01:38:35]</a>. This "founder mode" of infusing energy and protecting innovation is crucial for sustained success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:37">[01:39:37]</a>.

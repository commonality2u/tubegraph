When discussing pricing, it's crucial to understand that **how you charge** is often more significant than the specific dollar figure you set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:52">[00:59:52]</a>. Price acts as a measure of value, indicating how much people truly want and are willing to buy a product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. Entrepreneurs and companies should consider this early to ensure they are on the right track <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:21">[00:24:21]</a>.

## Core Pricing Strategies

Before diving into specific models, it's important to understand the three fundamental [[pricing strategies for premium products|pricing strategies]] a company can adopt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:50">[00:53:50]</a>:

*   **Skimming Strategy**: This involves launching a product at a higher price and gradually lowering it over time, effectively "skimming" the top layers of the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:59">[00:53:59]</a>. It's often associated with premium products, where price signals quality, like Apple's iPhones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:14">[00:54:14]</a>.
*   **Penetration Strategy**: This involves setting a low initial price to gain market share quickly, a strategy famously used by Amazon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:21">[00:54:21]</a>. This approach is challenging and requires a robust business model that supports high volume and efficient cost management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:31">[00:54:31]</a>.
*   **Maximization Strategy**: This is a middle-ground approach, neither at the extremes of skimming nor penetration, aiming to maximize profits over a couple of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:02">[00:55:02]</a>. Microsoft is cited as an example of a company that might fall into this category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:10">[00:55:10]</a>.

## Different Pricing Models

The choice of pricing model should align with your business situation and customer needs, rather than simply following current trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:28">[01:07:28]</a>.

### Subscription Models

Subscription models are suitable when:
*   Customers demand predictable bills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:26">[01:04:26]</a>.
*   Usage is similar month over month, like laundry pods where usage is consistent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:28">[01:04:28]</a>.
*   Usage is intermittent but the value delivered is ongoing, such as identity theft protection services like LifeLock, where the product's value persists even with infrequent usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:02">[01:05:02]</a>.
*   Simplifying the pricing conversation is an advantage, as seen with Spotify and Netflix, where a flat monthly fee for access to vast content libraries is preferred over per-song or per-movie charges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:23">[01:05:23]</a>.

### Usage-Based / Pay-As-You-Go Models

Usage-based models are effective when:
*   Customers desire low commitment or less friction, making it easier to onboard, as exemplified by AWS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:45">[01:05:45]</a>.
*   Customers demand transparency and fairness, meaning they pay for exactly what they use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:58">[01:05:58]</a>.
*   Usage is intermittent or episodic, and the value delivered is also episodic (e.g., booking a movie ticket or flight) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:27">[01:06:27]</a>.
*   There are underlying costs that scale directly with usage, such as cloud computing services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:41">[01:06:41]</a>.
*   You have clear, trackable metrics that customers agree reflect the value they receive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:48">[01:06:48]</a>.

**Examples of Usage-Based Models:**
*   **Michelin's Tires**: For moving trucks, Michelin innovated by charging based on the number of miles driven instead of per tire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:19">[01:00:19]</a>. This provided flexibility for truckers and allowed them to pass costs through to their customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:09">[01:01:09]</a>.
*   **Segment's Data Platform**: Initially priced by APIs, Segment shifted to a "monthly tracked users" metric, which was a fairer and more understandable measure of value for their diverse customer personas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:13">[01:02:13]</a>.

### Hybrid Models

Hybrid models combine elements of both subscription and usage-based pricing, offering a balance of predictability and flexibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:08">[01:07:08]</a>.
*   **HubSpot**: Uses a hybrid model with a fixed monthly fee and then charges for exceeding certain quotas or limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:11">[01:07:11]</a>.
*   **Marketplaces**: Often combine a platform fee (subscription) with a transaction-based fee, offering a predictable base and usage-scaled revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:04">[01:10:04]</a>.

### Freemium Models

Freemium models, mentioned as an option, allow users to access a basic version of a product for free, with premium features or expanded usage requiring payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:11">[01:08:11]</a>. This can be effective for user acquisition before conversion to a paid model.

### Razor Blade Model

This model involves selling a base product at a low price (or even giving it away for free) and then making profit on recurring sales of consumables or add-ons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:34">[01:23:34]</a>.
*   **Gillette's Razors and Blades**: The razor handle is cheap, but the blades add up quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:39">[01:22:39]</a>.
*   **HP Printers and Ink Cartridges**: Printers are often inexpensive, but proprietary ink cartridges are costly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:50">[01:22:50]</a>.
*   **SaaS Context**: A base platform might be offered at an attractive price to onboard users, who then pay for "chunks of usage" or additional features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:59">[01:22:59]</a>. This model can be attractive due to the lower upfront cost for customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:17">[01:23:17]</a>.

## Testing Pricing Models

Testing different pricing models is essential. A simple "break-even exercise" can provide insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:42">[01:10:42]</a>. By presenting economically equivalent options (e.g., different combinations of transaction fees and flat fees that result in the same total cost), you can observe customer preferences and identify psychological biases in their decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:09">[01:11:09]</a>. Often, people will choose a preference rather than being indifferent, revealing underlying perceptions of value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:22">[01:11:22]</a>.

## Pricing in Economic Downturns

In a slowing market, proactive [[the importance of pricing strategy for startups and tech companies|pricing strategy]] is critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:46">[01:28:46]</a>:
1.  **Develop a Less Expensive Alternate**: Create a "de-featured" version of your product to offer customers who can no longer afford the full price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:02">[01:29:02]</a>. This helps retain customers in your ecosystem without simply discounting, which can devalue your core product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:26">[01:29:26]</a>.
2.  **Employ Non-[[Behavioral pricing tactics and their impact on consumer decisionmaking|Pricing Actions]]**: Instead of cutting prices, consider alternatives like providing more product for the same price, extending contract terms (e.g., a three-year contract), or adjusting payment terms (e.g., from 15 to 30 days) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:07">[01:30:07]</a>. This maintains [[pricing strategies for premium products|price integrity]] while offering customer flexibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:50">[01:29:50]</a>.
3.  **Consider Changing Your Business/Pricing Model**: A downturn can be an opportune time to transition to an outcome-based or [[Understanding willingness to pay in pricing strategy|attribution-based pricing]] model, or to usage-based pricing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:10">[01:31:10]</a>. If customers are using your product less, a usage-based model will result in lower bills, which customers might welcome, setting the stage for increased revenue when the economy improves and usage goes up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:27">[01:31:27]</a>.

Developing and launching new products, especially `0 to 1 products` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>, within a company requires a unique blend of vision, conviction, user immersion, and an entrepreneurial spirit. Mahika Kapor, a design engineering PM hybrid at Figma, is renowned for her ability to spearhead new product development and launch initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. Her approach emphasizes the importance of a compelling vision, securing buy-in, and cultivating an environment where new ideas can thrive from inception to widespread adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

## Core Principles for New Product Development and Launch

### The Importance of Vision and Buy-in
A strong vision is paramount for product development, providing an anchor amidst the "messy" and "chaotic" product development cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. If the team's job is done correctly, the vision paints a clear picture of what the world will look like <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.

To craft a compelling vision:
*   **Deep User and Team Integration** Be "fundamentally inseparable" from both users and the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. This involves constant cross-pollination of functions, incorporating research insights to understand user feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>, utilizing beautiful designs and prototypes to communicate future possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>, and rooting the vision in engineering feasibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. This collaborative approach leads to a "really strong vision" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.
*   **Visual Communication** At Figma, words alone are insufficient; the future is communicated visually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. Pitches combine pain points, solutions, and proof points (like user testimonials or prototypes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. Designing and prototyping are heavily leveraged even before a project receives a green light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>.
*   **Single Artifact Creation** The team should create a unified artifact for the vision, rather than separate readouts from research, design, and product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>. This fosters shared ownership and passion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>.

An example of this visioning process can be seen with FigJam. The team observed the highly democratic and generative nature of brainstorms in FigJam, which contrasted with the often one-way communication in other meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>. The vision became creating a world where this generative nature of a brainstorm is the norm for all meetings, leading to features like music and voting to enhance flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>.

### Cultivating Conviction
Developing "strong conviction" quickly is crucial for navigating the messy `0 to 1` journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:59">[00:21:59]</a>. This allows product managers to rally their team effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:06">[00:22:06]</a>.
*   **Building Intuition** Product sense, or intuition, is built through "insatiable curiosity" and constant user engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>. Regularly talking to users, even informally, helps build a "repository or library of conversations" for product decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:52">[00:23:52]</a>.
*   **Embrace Early Opinions** Putting out an idea, even if it might be wrong, is a better catalyst for finding a good solution than starting from nothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:12">[00:25:12]</a>. People are more likely to react to an idea than to a vacuum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:25">[00:25:25]</a>.
*   **Strong Opinions, Weakly Held** While having strong conviction is important, it's equally crucial to be willing to "kill your darlings" if external signals or user feedback suggest a different direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:20">[00:26:20]</a>. This "strong opinions weakly held" approach allows for agility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:27">[00:26:27]</a>.
*   **Direct Communication** Mahika practices a very direct communication style, explicitly stating her confidence level in opinions ("medium confidence" or "I defer to you") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:51">[00:27:51]</a>. This encourages others to speak up, creating a culture where everyone feels comfortable sharing their opinion and confidence level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:18">[00:29:18]</a>. This directness is effective when it is two-way, fostering a continuous flow of feedback where "feedback is a gift" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:09">[00:30:09]</a>.

### The Power of Hype and [[innovative_product_launching_strategies | Innovative Product Launching Strategies]]
Building hype is essential for generating momentum and getting a product out the door <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:37">[00:33:37]</a>.
*   **PM as Hype Generator** If a PM is pushing a `0 to 1` idea from the bottom up, the onus is on them to ensure the project "is constantly propped up" and people are excited about it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:05">[00:34:05]</a>.
*   **Leverage Large Forums** Utilize company-wide events like sales kickoffs (SKOs), internal hackathons ([[innovative_product_development_strategies | Maker Week]]), or annual showcases (Config) to showcase the product, even if it's still rough around the edges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:55">[00:36:55]</a>. An unexpected demo can generate significant hype and help people envision the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:18">[00:36:18]</a>. This "scrappy" approach, pushing the product to its limits for visibility, leads to "incredible learnings" and "fuel to the fire" for the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:10">[00:37:10]</a>.
*   **Emotional Connection and Brand Identity** Hype is tied to emotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:17">[00:41:17]</a>. Products can drive excitement by making users feel special, rather than just advancing company goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:25">[00:41:25]</a>. Understanding a product's unique "brand of delight" (e.g., FigJam's cheeky personality vs. Figma's niche design capabilities) is key to generating effective hype with the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:42">[00:41:42]</a>. For FigJam's one-year anniversary, they didn't just have a party but a "birthday party" with a mini-launch of Easter-egged features, allowing users to "get the presents" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:28">[00:40:28]</a>.

### User Immersion and [[innovative_product_development_strategies | Innovative Product Development Strategies]]
Deep immersion in the user base is fundamental for understanding problems and building compelling products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:26">[00:42:26]</a>.
*   **Constant Conversations** Regularly talk to users, even friends in tech, about how they use the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:45">[00:43:45]</a>.
*   **Engage Non-Users** Crucially, ask non-users why they *aren't* using the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:38">[00:44:38]</a>. These conversations can be "the most insightful" as they reveal perceptions and marketing challenges, leading to product insights and feature investments (e.g., FigJam's placeholder experience for non-designers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:43">[00:44:43]</a>.
*   **Tailor Engagement to Product Type**
    *   **Prosumer Products (like Figma):** Conversations with anyone in tech can provide insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:42">[00:45:42]</a>.
    *   **Early Stage Companies:** The PM needs to actively seek out and connect with users, often leveraging "founder market fit" to quickly validate needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:14">[00:46:14]</a>.
    *   **Larger Companies:** Develop a tight relationship with the sales team, joining sales calls to understand customer pain points and cross-pollinate into the product roadmap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:41">[00:46:41]</a>.
*   **Operationalize Insights** Insights from conversations inform product roadmap prioritization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:30">[00:49:30]</a> and can lead to artifacts (like Loom videos of product usage) for the sales team to evangelize features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:38">[00:49:38]</a>. For non-immediately actionable feedback, tools like Slack integrations (e.g., a "nana emoji" to create a task) can store requests for future grooming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:09">[00:50:09]</a>.

### Adapting to Change and [[challenges_in_early_startup_growth_and_product_pivots | Challenges in Early Startup Growth and Product Pivots]]
Successful product leaders must pivot with "grace and enthusiasm" when priorities shift or projects are altered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:15">[00:57:15]</a>. This means being adaptable with resources and having the agility to pivot based on external signals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:43">[01:11:43]</a>.

An example from Mahika's college years with Design Nation illustrates this:
Initially, she planned to build a national design conference within an existing Princeton organization for resources. However, when that organization was skeptical of design's business value and denied funding, she had to pivot. She leveraged her .edu email address to cold email executives and designers, many of whom resonated with the problem of a lack of design education and offered support. This allowed her to build the conference from the ground up, adapting to prioritize fundraising and a landing page to establish legitimacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:56">[01:09:56]</a>. This demonstrates "high agency" – the drive to make things happen personally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>.

## Building an Entrepreneurial Culture for New Products

To stay competitive, a company must remain entrepreneurial, constantly thinking about "what's next" and defining industry standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:39">[01:16:39]</a>. Figma's "run with it" core value encourages individuals to sprint in new directions, viewing it as a manifestation of company values, not a distraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:04">[01:17:04]</a>.

### Internal Initiatives
Many of Figma's "most Monumental launches" originated from hackathons and bottom-up projects, like multi-edit, Jambot, and the widgets platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:24">[01:17:24]</a>.
*   **Maker Week** Figma's internal hackathon, "Maker Week," pauses the entire company for a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:32">[00:30:32]</a>. Anyone can have an idea and recruit others to work on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:02">[00:31:02]</a>. Hackathons are not just for engineers; PMs can use them to pitch ideas and build prototypes, even if it feels "crazy" to build a new product in a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:19">[01:25:19]</a>.
*   **Hot Seat** A tradition started by Mahika at a PM offsite, Hot Seat involves each person getting two minutes for colleagues to ask them anything. This breaks the ice and helps team members understand what motivates each other, fostering connections and trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:12">[00:59:12]</a>.
*   **The Figgies** An Oscar-style awards ceremony for the product team, designed to make people feel appreciated for their quirks and energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:45">[01:02:45]</a>. Categories like "most likely to name their child Figma" celebrate individuality and build closer team bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:48">[01:02:48]</a>. This low-cost, high-impact initiative promotes the company's "play" value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:37">[01:03:37]</a>.

These initiatives underscore that building culture is about establishing trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:07">[01:05:07]</a> and feeling a connection to colleagues, which makes teams more durable during tough times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:36">[01:05:36]</a>.

### The "Flame" Metaphor: Keeper of the Hearth
The person pushing a `0 to 1 product` is "The Keeper of the Flame" or "Hesta" (from Greek mythology's goddess of the Hearth) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:11">[01:19:11]</a>. Their job is to stoke the flames when they risk dying out and ensure the idea "spreads like wildfire" to generate company-wide demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:45">[01:19:45]</a>.

Three things are needed to bring an idea into existence:
1.  **Have the right idea:** Derived from user empathy and continuous user conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:18">[01:21:18]</a>. The idea must also align with broader company goals (e.g., Figma's shift from designers to the entire product development cycle) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:50">[01:21:50]</a>.
2.  **Secure buy-in:** Rallying leadership and the team behind the idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:22">[01:20:22]</a>. This requires optimism that borders on "delusion," translating "no" into "not yet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:14">[01:23:14]</a>. Being scrappy with presentations (e.g., swapping out an icon to make a new product feel real) can communicate differentiation effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:30">[01:25:30]</a>.
3.  **Make it spread:** Get the idea to a point where new hires are curious about the "flame burning there" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:35">[01:20:35]</a>.

### Overcoming Challenges in a Large Company ([[building_a_product_at_a_large_company | Building a Product at a Large Company]])
*   **Extended Staging/Dogfooding** Figma employs a "multi-month plus long staging or dogfooding process" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:10">[01:27:10]</a>. This early exposure to the product, even when vulnerable, allows for crucial feedback from across the company, helping the product mature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:42">[01:27:42]</a>.
*   **Fostering Investment** When employees provide feedback and see their suggestions implemented, they feel they "shaped that part of the product" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:29">[01:28:29]</a>. This deepens investment and ensures a constant feedback loop, elevating the product's quality as `product development is a team sport` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:48">[01:28:48]</a>.

## Mahika's Approach and [[founder_mode_in_product_leadership | Founder Mode in Product Leadership]]
Mahika's approach aligns with the concept of [[founder_mode_in_product_leadership | Founder Mode in Product Leadership]] within an existing company.
*   **Scope is the World** Rather than focusing solely on the current project, Mahika believes a PM's "scope is the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:01">[00:55:01]</a>. This allows for identifying passionate ideas within the company's broader vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:05">[00:55:05]</a>.
*   **Founding Within a Company** It's possible to "found something inside of an existing company" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:32">[00:55:32]</a>, leveraging distribution, technical, or platform advantages, and potentially reducing risk compared to starting from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:40">[00:55:40]</a>. While internal founding might make executive decisions and fast movement harder, the approach to team building and pitching differs significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:06">[00:56:06]</a>.
*   **Understanding Motivations** A key to running a team and driving an idea forward is understanding individual motivations within the product team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:09">[01:30:09]</a>. Some engineers might prefer a solution handed to them to focus on technical implementation, while others need to contribute to feel passionate about the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:33">[01:30:33]</a>. Directly asking team members how involved they want to be in product decisions and taking decisions in the open helps cater to individuals and fosters a more collaborative environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:21">[01:31:21]</a>.

By fostering these elements, companies can create a culture that continuously develops and launches impactful new products.

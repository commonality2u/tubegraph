Building a sustainable and fulfilling career requires a long-term perspective, moving beyond short-term gratification or reactive decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:54">[07:27:54]</a>. Instead of focusing solely on the "next job," it's beneficial to consider the "job after next" to ensure continuous motivation and purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>.

## The Pitfalls of Short-Term Thinking

Many professionals are driven by immediate concerns like disliking their boss or perceiving a company as stagnant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:43:00">[07:43:00]</a>. However, these issues can exist in many roles, and lateral moves often don't represent true [[career_growth_and_strategic_positioning | career growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:00">[08:01:00]</a>. A common short-term trap is conflating promotions with overall [[career_growth_and_strategic_positioning | career growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:18:00">[09:18:00]</a>. While promotions are internal company systems for advancement, a true career arc is about long-term development, potentially leading to leaving the company post-promotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:12:00">[10:12:00]</a>.

The analogy of dog tracks illustrates the danger of focusing solely on achieving a single goal: just as dogs stop running if they catch the "fake rabbit," individuals might become demotivated or lost after achieving a major career milestone if they haven't considered "what's next" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

### Avoiding "Ex-Growth Companies"

Another short-term trap is joining or staying with "ex-growth companies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:52:00">[14:52:00]</a>. These are companies that experienced rapid growth fueled by abundant capital but have since slowed, often without raising new rounds or undergoing significant layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:38:00">[15:38:00]</a>. Many still operate on multi-billion dollar valuations but are effectively in a "pre-product market fit" stage, trying to find their footing with too many employees and outdated expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:37:00">[17:37:00]</a>. For employees, staying in such a company can mean that substantial equity compensation becomes worthless, representing a significant opportunity cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:00:00">[20:00:00]</a>.

A key sign of an ex-growth company is if they are still trying to find a "customer sucking sound" (strong organic pull) while already valued in the hundreds of millions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:30:00">[18:30:00]</a>. The primary reasons to stay might be to gain executive experience if it's the biggest role available or due to strong loyalty to the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:31:00">[21:31:00]</a>.

## Core Principles for a Long-Term Career

1.  **Work Backwards from Your End State**: Envision your ideal career outcome and then strategically plan the steps (versions) to get there, similar to [[creating a winning product strategy | building a product]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a>. This means thinking about the job after your next one, or even your boss's boss's job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:30:00">[08:30:00]</a>.
2.  **Seek Diverse Experiences**: Accumulating varied experiences — from pre-product-market fit startups to large, scaled organizations, and across consumer and business-to-business problems — makes you a better "builder" and generally leads to greater satisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:59:00">[11:59:00]</a>. While having "FAANG" (or "MAGMA") company logos on your resume can unlock opportunities, especially for executives seeking to bring expertise in scaling organizations, it's not the sole path to a fulfilling career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:02:00">[13:02:00]</a>.
3.  **Differentiate Promotion from Career**: Understand that company promotions are short-term milestones within a long-term career arc <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>.

## Early Career: Setting the Foundation

In early career stages, two key things should be prioritized:

1.  **Develop a World-Class Expertise**: Aim to become an expert in at least one area of product ambiguity, such as:
    *   Crafting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:12:00">[23:12:00]</a>
    *   Market ambiguity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:18:00">[23:18:00]</a>
    *   Organizational ambiguity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:27:00">[23:27:00]</a>
    *   Domain expertise (e.g., ML, hardware) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:37:00">[23:37:00]</a>
    *   Team management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:44:00">[23:44:00]</a>
    *   [[building and managing growth teams | Growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:15:00">[24:15:00]</a>
    Picking a "lane" and becoming world-class in it is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:21:00">[24:21:00]</a>.
2.  **Craft a Compelling Story**: Be able to articulate exactly what you learned and did in each role for future employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:26:00">[24:26:00]</a>. Think about the "press release" of your role before you start, focusing on the problem solved, skills built, headwinds faced, and how you overcame them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:57:00">[24:57:00]</a>. Always use "I" instead of "we" when describing your personal contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:08">[01:22:08]</a>.

## Mid-Career: Promotions, Feedback, and Management

### Understanding Promotion Blockers

When facing difficulty with promotions, consider four common reasons:
1.  **Lack of Advocacy**: Your "magic" isn't recognized by your manager or the promotion committee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:26:00">[26:26:00]</a>.
2.  **Non-Existent Role**: The next logical role for promotion doesn't actually exist within the company, especially common in non-hyper-growth environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:05:00">[27:05:00]</a>.
3.  **Impatience**: You're moving faster than the organization's promotion cadence, especially as leadership roles often require more soft skills and longer-term impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:02:00">[28:02:00]</a>.
4.  **Undeveloped Areas**: There's a substantive development area that's not being connected to the individual, possibly due to poor feedback from managers or the individual's refusal to acknowledge it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:57:00">[28:57:00]</a>.

### Seeking Real Feedback

To understand if you genuinely have a development area or if your "magic" isn't seen, seek "real feedback" rather than formal feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:41:00">[30:41:00]</a>. This requires strong listening skills, avoiding justification, and triangulating feedback from peers, distant colleagues, and managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:11:00">[31:11:13]</a>. Create a safe environment where people feel comfortable providing honest input without fear of retaliation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:53:00">[31:53:00]</a>. A powerful technique is to repeat back the feedback to show internalization and understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:46:00">[32:46:00]</a>. Managers can encourage more feedback by publicly recognizing individuals who provide valuable input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:11:00">[34:11:00]</a>.

### Becoming an Effective Manager

The tech industry often fails to train managers, promoting skilled individual contributors (ICs) directly into management roles without proper preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:28:00">[35:28:00]</a>. For new managers, two critical aspects are:
1.  **Sharing the Steering Wheel**: Management is not about simply dividing and conquering or teaching someone to ride a bike and letting go <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:19:00">[37:19:00]</a>. It's more like a sidecar on a motorcycle, where the manager provides counsel while the direct report drives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:51:00">[37:51:00]</a>.
2.  **Earning the Right to Manage**: A manager must be "invited in" by their team, like a vampire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:36:00">[38:36:00]</a>. This means earning trust and understanding how you can genuinely assist your direct reports, rather than simply asserting authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:46:00">[38:46:00]</a>.

### The Rise of the Senior IC Path

The growth of the individual contributor (IC) track is a positive development for the industry, countering the past trend of promoting ICs into management simply for career progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:46:00">[40:46:00]</a>. This allows "builders" to remain focused on their craft and develop deep expertise without being forced into managerial roles that may not align with their strengths or desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:44:00">[41:44:00]</a>. This trend makes product management career paths more aligned with engineering and design, where IC tracks are well-established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:02:00">[43:03:00]</a>.

### The Power of Community Learning

Given the often weak structured training for managers, joining active communities (internal or external) is crucial for [[building strategy skills and effective goal setting | learning]] and support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:16:00">[46:16:00]</a>. Communities like "The Skip CPO Community" foster authenticity, provide a safe space to share challenges, and facilitate the exchange of best practices, recognizing that many leaders face similar problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:44:00">[48:44:00]</a>.

## Late Career: "Act Three" and Mental Health

As careers extend into 60-year spans or more, the concept of "Act Three" becomes increasingly relevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:48">[01:03:48]</a>. Many senior leaders, after achieving their long-sought goals, face unexpected mental health challenges or a sense of being lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:09">[01:04:09]</a>. This is because their entire career was "wired" around reaching a specific "North Star," and once achieved, there's no clear "what's next" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:25">[01:05:25]</a>.

### The Shadows of Superpowers

A key challenge for senior leaders is that the very strengths (superpowers) that propelled them to the top can become their biggest development areas (shadows) at higher levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:35">[00:53:35]</a>. For example, a "great collaborator" who was successful when people agreed with their view might struggle when working with senior, cross-functional leaders who hold differing opinions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:44">[00:54:44]</a>. Similarly, someone who excels at [[building and managing growth teams | growth]] might struggle with [[creating a winning product strategy | innovation]], or a strong political player might become unprincipled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:34">[00:55:34]</a>. Recognizing and re-wiring these "shadows" is crucial for continued [[career advancement strategies | career advancement]] and can be a difficult, identity-challenging process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:35">[00:56:35]</a>.

### Redefining Your North Star

To avoid feeling lost in Act Three, it's essential to start thinking about a new [[longterm_vision_and_entrepreneurship | North Star]] now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:05">[01:06:05]</a>. Common paths for this later stage of career include:
*   **Scaled Economics**: Continuing to pursue wealth creation through investing, private equity, or other financial avenues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:09">[01:09:09]</a>.
*   **Giving**: Focusing on contributions to others, whether through content creation, volunteering, or founding mission-based companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:41">[01:09:41]</a>. While Act One and Two might be about "taking" and "creating," Act Three can be profoundly fulfilling through "giving" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.

## Practical Strategies for Career Building

*   **Treat Meetings as a Product**: In scaled organizations, the meeting operating system is as crucial as the products themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:49">[01:19:49]</a>. Regularly review and iterate on meeting structures, attendees, decision-making processes, and cadences as if they were products (e.g., "version 7" of your team's meetings) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:12">[01:20:12]</a>.
*   **Proactively Craft Your Career Story**: Regularly consider the story you'll tell about your current work for your "skip job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:38">[01:21:38]</a>. Focus on the problems you solved, skills you built, headwinds you faced, and how you overcame them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:02">[01:22:02]</a>. If the story isn't compelling, strategize how to make it so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:26">[01:22:26]</a>. This intentional [[building strategy skills and effective goal setting | goal setting]] and self-reflection ensures that your career advancements are meaningful and align with your long-term vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:31">[01:22:31]</a>.

Maggie Crowley, VP of Product at Toast, emphasizes that a core trait of successful product managers (PMs) is their willingness to take on any task necessary for the product's success, demonstrating true ownership and accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.

## "That's Not My Job" Mentality

Crowley states that if a PM ever finds themselves saying, "that's not my job," it's likely a task they *should* do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While it might genuinely be someone else's responsibility, successful PMs overcome frustration and simply "get the work done" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This proactive approach leads to faster progress, more successful products, and reduced personal frustration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## The Product Manager as Emotional Center

A product manager often serves as the emotional center of their team, responsible for keeping people motivated, excited, and bought into the project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. This requires maintaining optimism, which is a demanding aspect of the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. Taking on additional tasks, like hopping on a sales call or implementing a solution with a customer, is part of this commitment to "whatever it takes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## "Carrying the Water" â€“ Embracing Unglamorous Work

Crowley highlights "carrying the water" as a significant theme learned from David Cancel at Drift, which means being willing to do the "hard, boring, unglamorous work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. This includes tasks such as:
*   Customer support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>
*   Sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>
*   Marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>
*   Writing copy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>
*   Project management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>
*   Quality Assurance (QA) of products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:27">[00:31:27]</a>

Since the PM is ultimately responsible for outcomes and results, they must perform these tasks if no one else will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. This willingness to do "whatever it takes" makes a product and the PM successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.

Crowley summarizes this concept with the lesson:
> "When in doubt, it's your job as a PM" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>

Unlike engineers (who write code) or designers (who create user experiences), PMs do not have a single defining task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:14">[00:29:14]</a>. Their role is to deliver a business result, uniquely positioning them to fill any gaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:46">[00:29:46]</a>. An engineer might finish their code and hand it off, but a PM's job isn't complete until the customer's problem is solved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:59">[00:29:59]</a>. No task is "above you" as a PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:36">[00:31:36]</a>. This can make the PM job feel less glamorous and include many "boring, annoying things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:23">[00:30:23]</a>.

## Beyond Ownership: Embracing Risk and Accountability

While [[building_high_agency_in_product_management_roles|ownership]] is crucial, Crowley believes the word "ownership" doesn't fully capture the "oh shit feeling" of taking a bet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>. As a PM, you must be willing to make the bet, knowing there's a chance it might not work out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>. This willingness to take responsibility and be accountable for [[decision_making_in_product_management|picking the right thing]] is what separates the PM role from many others and makes it a [[challenges_and_pitfalls_in_product_management|challenging job]] when done correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>.

The product manager's role is not just to [[role_of_product_managers_in_owning_the_why|own the why]] and define a strategy, but to ensure that work actually "gets out the door" and creates impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.

## The "Why Now" and Strategic Bets

When crafting a product strategy, it's vital to clearly articulate "why this problem matters and why this problem matters now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:02">[00:51:02]</a>. This is critical for prioritizing among many potential opportunities, especially when dealing with perishable opportunities that must be seized in the moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:56">[00:52:56]</a>. This deliberate thinking ensures confidence in strategic [[decision_making_in_product_management|decisions]] and the allocation of resources against the most impactful problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:52">[00:40:52]</a>.

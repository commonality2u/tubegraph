Product-Led Sales (PLS) necessitates a reconfigured internal [[collaboration_between_product_and_sales_teams | collaboration]] between product and sales teams, a departure from traditional sales models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Traditional vs. Product-Led Sales Collaboration

In a traditional sales world:
*   Marketing creates pipeline for sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.
*   Sales sells the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.
*   Product engages with the paid user to drive retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

In [[sales_involvement_in_productled_growth | Product-Led Sales]]:
*   Product acquires and activates customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
*   Product then creates pipeline for sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
*   The relationship is not one where a go-to-market organization (marketing and sales) exists separately, with product merely "throwing features across the fence" for them to sell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.
*   Instead, the core [[collaboration_between_product_and_sales_teams | collaboration]] is directly between product and sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

### Product Accountability in PLS

This shift means that product must take accountability for the pipeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Attempting Product-Led Growth (PLG) or Product-Led Sales primarily through marketing efforts is a "recipe for disaster" that will likely lead to failure within six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Product must take accountability over the selling of the product itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

Historically, in B2B, product management has become complacent, focusing on building features and then handing off the product to marketing and sales to sell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:24">[00:25:24]</a>. This has alleviated product management from monetization ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:56">[00:25:56]</a>. For Sales-Led Growth (SLG) companies transitioning to product-assisted tactics or PLG, the biggest challenge is educating the product team on how to get the product to sell itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:02">[00:26:02]</a>.

Product leadership should be accountable for the revenue target, while individual product managers are responsible for KPIs such as free-to-paid conversion rate, package mix, Product Qualified Accounts (PQAs), and potentially Product Qualified Leads (PQLs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:58">[00:56:58]</a>.

## Defining Product-Led Sales (PLS)

Product-Led Growth (PLG) focuses on a product's ability to self-serve for activation, engagement, and conversion of usage into monetization opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. This can involve direct revenue capture (self-serve monetization) or indirect value via virality or user-generated content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

Self-serve monetization has a typical cap of around $10,000, constrained by credit card limits and consumer willingness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. It's often a "prosumer" use case where individuals solve problems independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.

Product-Led Sales converts this self-serve usage into a sales opportunity, attaching a salesperson to close much larger contracts (e.g., $15,000, $20,000, $100,000) to provide an Enterprise-level solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.

### The "Escalator" to Enterprise Solutions
PLS assumes a migration from an individual use case (where an end-user is acquired) to an escalation into an Enterprise-level solution that solves Enterprise-level problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. Products are good at showing individual user value but struggle to showcase organizational benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>. Sales bridges this gap, increasing perceived value to justify larger contracts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.

Examples of companies using PLS and their enterprise-level problems:
*   **Miro**: Moves from individual workshop facilitation to increasing innovation and productivity across entire teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>.
*   **Figma**: Progresses from a designer needing feedback to faster turnaround times for designs and better product performance at the organizational level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>.
*   **Amplitude**: Expands from an individual needing data for product decisions to self-servability and democratization of data, leading to a more data-driven culture across the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.

### Sales Involvement in PLS
Sales in PLS still involves outbound efforts but focuses on understanding user motivation, ability, and permission within an organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. Many end-users lack the permission or ability to solve Enterprise-level problems themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. PLS helps bridge these friction points by:
*   Attracting the right decision-makers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>.
*   Identifying champions and their capabilities/permission levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>.
*   Creating a committee for decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>.
*   Marketing also plays a crucial role in educating potential buyers on how to bridge the gap and "sell things internally" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>.

## Lead Qualification in PLS

### Product Qualified Account (PQA)
A PQA is an aggregation of multiple users within an account (or a specific team/workspace) that meet a product threshold of engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:04">[00:29:04]</a>. This differs from activation or core engagement metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:10">[00:29:10]</a>. PQA metrics include:
*   Volume of use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:31">[00:29:31]</a>.
*   Velocity change (e.g., rapid increase in users or events) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:34">[00:29:34]</a>.
*   Feature usage highly correlated to Enterprise interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:47">[00:29:47]</a>.

Product teams should aim for every account to reach this PQA threshold to qualify them for a sales conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:55">[00:29:55]</a>.

### Product Qualified Lead (PQL)
A PQL is a specific person within a PQA who can be sold to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:03">[00:30:03]</a>. In smaller segments (SMB, lower mid-market), the user might equal the buyer. However, in larger enterprises, the end-user is often far removed from the decision-maker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:31">[00:30:31]</a>. Sending sales to an end-user without decision-making power leads to a "terrible user journey" and low close rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:47">[00:30:47]</a>.

### Marketing Qualified Lead (MQL)
If a PQA exists but there's no PQL (buyer) within the account, marketing (specifically Enterprise marketing or Account-Based Marketing) must qualify and bring in a lead and connect them with the existing usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:19">[00:31:19]</a>.

There are three main lead attribution buckets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:15">[00:32:15]</a>:
1.  **Usage + PQL**: Usage exists, and one of the users is the lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:17">[00:32:17]</a>.
2.  **Usage + MQL**: Usage exists, but marketing needs to bring in the lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:21">[00:32:21]</a>.
3.  **No Usage + MQL**: A lead comes through with no existing usage; the entire product still needs to be sold to them (traditional top-down) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:26">[00:32:26]</a>.

These three channels have different conversion rates, playbooks, and often require different sales teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:39">[00:32:39]</a>.

## Implementing Product-Led Sales

### Data Needs
Start with intuition to identify signals that correlate with sales excitement about hand-raisers or sales form submissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:41">[00:37:41]</a>. Do not send every user to sales, as this will lead to sales disregarding the product channel due to low close rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:22">[00:38:22]</a>.

Escalate to a simple regression model or histogram analysis to differentiate hand-raisers from non-hand-raisers and identify others fitting the criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:03">[00:39:03]</a>. This forms the first PQA model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:18">[00:39:18]</a>.

Key data principles:
*   Involve sales early on to partner and ensure strong feedback cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:34">[00:39:34]</a>.
*   PQA definitions should be constantly evolving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:52">[00:39:52]</a>.
*   Tools like Amplitude's Compass or Mixpanel's Signal can help identify correlations, but manual analysis is recommended initially to understand data nuances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:04">[00:40:04]</a>.
*   Buying a platform won't bridge the gap until you understand what truly matters in your data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:08">[00:41:08]</a>. This is about achieving "data sales fit" before scaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:26">[00:41:26]</a>.

Common indicative metrics for sales engagement:
*   **Number of users in the company using the product**: Creating network effects within a team is crucial. Actively pull and push users into existing company accounts rather than letting them create rogue individual accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:20">[00:42:20]</a>. A "magic number" of seven users is often seen as a threshold for Enterprise conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:34">[00:43:34]</a>.
*   **Volume threshold**: E.g., number of events sent (Amplitude), number of boards (Miro), number of revisions (Figma) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>.
*   **Velocity**: Changes in the rate of user additions, events, or storage utilization are strong predictors of the right timing for intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:28">[00:44:28]</a>.
*   **Behavioral signals**:
    *   An admin switch in an account often indicates an evaluation is happening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:33">[00:45:33]</a>.
    *   Visiting terms of use, privacy, or policy pages suggests consideration for an Enterprise deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:57">[00:45:57]</a>.

### Tooling and Infrastructure
Approach tooling as an evolution, not a revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:23">[00:49:23]</a>. Avoid forcing sales teams to switch from their existing tools (e.g., Salesforce); instead, embed the necessary data within their current system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:30">[00:49:30]</a>. Start with simple tools like Google Sheets, Looker/Tableau dashboards, Amplitude charts, and existing CRM integrations (e.g., HubSpot, Marketo into Salesforce) to prove viability before investing in large platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:02">[00:50:02]</a>.

### People and Resources
The core people needed for PLS are:
*   **Product Managers**: To get accounts to the PQA stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:11">[00:51:11]</a>.
*   **Sales People**: To understand PQA triggers, find buyers, and convert opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:21">[00:51:21]</a>.
*   **Marketing**: To educate end-users and Enterprise buyers on the value proposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:36">[00:51:36]</a>.
*   **Analytics Team**: Data analysts to continuously find correlative signals for testing causation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:46">[00:51:46]</a>.
*   **(Implicit) Engineering**: To support product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:01">[00:52:01]</a>.

If starting from a Sales-Led Growth company, run a pilot with existing sales team members (e.g., an Account Executive or SDR) to prototype the PLS motion separately from the main sales engine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:09">[00:52:09]</a>.

If starting from a Product-Led Growth company, consider having founders or support teams handle initial sales to understand the process before hiring dedicated salespeople <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:43">[00:52:43]</a>. For PLS in PLG, start with a blend of SDR/AE roles where the same person can both outbound and close, then specialize later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:18">[00:53:18]</a>. The philosophy is to prove an ROI for a new hire before posting a job req <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:55">[00:53:55]</a>.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid
1.  **Treating PLS as a traditional top-down sales process**: Not every user is a sales opportunity. Understand the right triggers and usage signals to automate qualification and ensure sales interactions add value, rather than being disruptive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:42">[01:06:42]</a>.
2.  **Not holding product accountable**: This motion requires [[collaboration_between_product_and_sales_teams | collaboration between product and sales]] to be one of the closest relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:45">[01:07:45]</a>. Product cannot operate as a "feature factory" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:47">[00:58:47]</a>. Product leadership must own monetization targets, and product teams should focus on KPIs like free-to-paid conversion and PQA targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:58">[00:57:58]</a>.
3.  **Leaving marketing out of the equation**: Marketing, especially Enterprise and Account-Based Marketing, is crucial for finding and connecting buyers to existing product usage when a PQL isn't present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:17">[01:08:17]</a>.
4.  **Delaying investment in data and efficacy**: Start with intuition but quickly plan for how to scale data analysis. PLS is about leveraging usage for pipeline creation, which requires measuring, understanding, tracking, and evolving usage data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:51">[01:08:51]</a>.

## Benchmarks and Best Practices

*   **Time to Enterprise Contract**: It takes time for an individual's usage to escalate to an Enterprise-level solution. Across companies like Netlify, Miro, or Amplitude, it was typically **12 months or more of usage** before sustainable sales contracts could be created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:47">[01:09:47]</a>. PLS is a long-term growth strategy, closing contracts from sign-ups that occurred much earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:29">[01:10:29]</a>.
*   **Don't confuse user and buyer**: Profile users upon sign-up. Onboarding questions that gather company size, department, seniority, and use case are crucial for segmentation and personalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:38">[01:10:38]</a>. Users who drop off at this stage were likely low-intent anyway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:50">[01:10:50]</a>.
*   **Conversion Rates**:
    *   Freemium conversion rates are typically around **5%** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:29">[01:11:29]</a>.
    *   Trial conversion rates are closer to **10-15%** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:34">[01:11:34]</a>.
    *   The focus is on increasing contract values and customer lifetime value, as self-serve conversion rates often remain similar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:50">[01:11:50]</a>.

### Monetization Awareness
A major area for product to focus on is monetization awareness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:17">[01:13:17]</a>. In freemium products, up to 75% of customers may not be aware of what is being sold in paid plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:23">[01:13:23]</a>. Product needs to communicate the value of paid offerings through:
*   Feature walls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:43">[01:14:43]</a>.
*   Usage walls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:43">[01:14:43]</a>.
*   Trials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:43">[01:14:43]</a>.

Ensuring that users see paid functionality and triggers multiple times (rule of three) can significantly drive monetization awareness and conversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:56">[01:15:56]</a>. In sales-led companies, design reviews should include how paid functionality is exposed to users in all states (free, lower-tier paid) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:48">[01:05:48]</a>.

## The Future: AI Sales?
The rise of AI might further automate sales conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:27">[01:13:27]</a>. If AI can provide very deep and personalized answers via chat, email, or even deep-fake Zoom calls, it could transform sales by surfacing highly personalized information in seconds, surpassing human or content management systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:51">[01:13:51]</a>.

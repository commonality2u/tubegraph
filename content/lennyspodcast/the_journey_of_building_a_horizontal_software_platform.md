Ivan Zhao, co-founder and CEO of Notion, offers a unique perspective on the journey of building a horizontal software platform, emphasizing philosophical depth, resilience, and a distinctive approach to product development and company culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:05">[01:33:05]</a>.

### The "Lost Years": Finding Product-Market Fit
Notion's early years, from 2013, were described as "the Lost Years," a period of three to four years without clear product-market fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:15">[01:45:15]</a>. The initial vision was to enable everyone to create their own software, leading them to build an easy-to-use developer tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:51">[01:11:51]</a>. However, after a couple of years, they realized that most people simply "don't care" about creating software; they care about getting their jobs done and having reports due <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>.

This realization led to a pivotal shift: they decided to "hide their vision" of universal software creation within a form factor people already cared about—productivity software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:41">[01:29:41]</a>. Zhao uses the analogy of "sugar and broccoli": people want sugar, so you give them the sugar with the broccoli (the core vision) hidden inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:09">[01:46:09]</a>. Notion, while deeply integrating no-code developer power, is primarily understood as a productivity suite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:46">[01:46:46]</a>. This shift took over two years to fully realize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:04">[01:04:04]</a>.

### Challenges and Resilience in Early Development
The team's commitment to their vision, which Zhao calls "Lego for software," kept them going through difficult times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:07">[01:56:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:07">[01:57:07]</a>. They had to rebuild their codebase multiple times, even throwing away all previous code, due to betting on an unstable technical foundation (Web Components from Google instead of React) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:58">[01:39:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:53">[01:40:53]</a>. This required them to "restart a company" and rebuild everything on a more stable foundation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:55">[01:49:55]</a>.

To survive, the company stayed extremely lean. At one point, they laid off all five employees, leaving only Zhao and his co-founder Simon, and moved to Japan to save money by subleasing their San Francisco apartment and office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:05">[01:37:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:53">[01:40:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:40">[01:41:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:07">[01:42:07]</a>. Zhao's mother even helped kickstart the company and later provided a bridge loan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:03">[01:49:03]</a>.

Zhao advises founders to not be afraid to reset, as finding a "better abstraction" or system can lead to faster progress that quickly recovers sunk costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:31">[02:22:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:04">[02:55:04]</a>. He emphasizes the importance of balancing building for user needs (business) with building for one's own values and aesthetics (art project), avoiding either extreme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:50">[00:50:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>.

### Operational Philosophy: Staying Lean and Craft-Focused
Notion's sustained success is attributed to its commitment to remaining lean and efficient. The company has been profitable for years and still retains most of the money it raised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:04">[03:11:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:05">[03:17:05]</a>. They didn't hire a salesperson until reaching over $10 million in ARR and their first PM until 50 employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:44">[03:23:44]</a>.

This lean approach stems from a belief in solving problems through better systems and tools, rather than just adding more people. Notion itself, as a "meta tool," is used to run the company, reducing internal communication overhead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:20">[03:36:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:50">[03:41:50]</a>. This focus also fosters "talent density" and a positive compounding effect within the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:50">[03:17:50]</a>, which aligns with [[Building and scaling a companys culture]].

The company's workspace also reflects its philosophy. Notion's offices are designed to feel cozy, like an artist's studio or home, to foster creativity and ease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:30">[03:51:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:01">[03:56:01]</a>. Conference rooms are named after "Timeless Tools in history" to inspire the team to create durable, impactful software, much like a Toshiba rice cooker or a Sony transistor radio changed daily life for decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:58">[03:46:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:39">[03:58:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:30">[03:59:30]</a>. This embodies a deep commitment to "craft" – applying skill, taste, and values to make clever trade-offs and create something new and useful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:38">[03:37:38]</a>. This aligns with [[Building a productoriented engineering culture]].

### The Nature of Horizontal Software
Building a horizontal platform is notoriously difficult but offers immense potential. Zhao has "no regret" and "wouldn't want to build anything else" because of Notion's core vision as "Lego for software," which is inherently horizontal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19:06">[05:19:06]</a>.

A key learning has been the importance of segmentation: distinguishing between "Lego bricks" (the core, flexible building blocks) and "Lego boxes" (ready-made solutions, especially for enterprise customers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a>. While Notion's strength lies in its modular "bricks," moving up-market required understanding and selling "solutions" to fit specific business needs and P&Ls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>.

Notion's success spans multiple categories, performing highly in project management, docs, and CRM, despite not intending to build a dedicated CRM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a>. This versatility comes from its relational database foundation, allowing users to build their own systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a>.

The company's growth strategy, "B2C2B," leverages a large "top of funnel" from individual users. Many users start with Notion for simple tasks like note-taking or document sharing, then discover its broader capabilities (relational database, task management) and bring it into their workplaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>. This led Notion to expand into other high-volume use cases like calendar and email products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>.

### The Impact of AI and Future Directions
The advent of large language models (LLMs) has been a "gift" for tools like Notion, fundamentally changing the material developers can work with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:19:00">[06:19:00]</a>. AI excels with bundled, horizontal offerings because it performs best when all information is together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>.

Notion's AI strategy involves:
1.  **AI Writer Product:** Leveraging AI for writing capabilities where users spend daily time (writing, task management) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:00">[06:08:00]</a>.
2.  **AI Q&A/Connectors:** Enhancing search and understanding by consolidating information within Notion and connecting to external tools like Jira or Zendesk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:00">[06:10:00]</a>.
3.  **AI as a Builder:** The most fascinating aspect is AI's ability to "piece things together." With Notion's existing "Lego blocks" for knowledge work, an AI coding agent could potentially create any kind of knowledge or customer software agent for vertical use cases, unlocking new value by overcoming the challenge of manual assembly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:18:00">[06:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:23:00">[06:23:00]</a>.

Zhao sees the market as cycling between "bundling" and "unbundling," a concept he relates to ancient Chinese literature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:00">[06:46:00]</a>. After a period of SaaS unbundling, leading to companies using nearly a hundred different tools, the market is now shifting towards bundling, especially with AI, which favors integrated solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:00">[07:05:00]</a>.

Ultimately, Zhao views tools as "extensions of us" that, once shaped, can "come back to shape us" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:00">[06:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:00">[06:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22:00">[06:22:00]</a>. His goal for Notion is to amplify creativity and beauty, aspects he feels are often lacking in software, to "shape our user of our product towards the better part of themsel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:00">[06:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>.

When considering [[building_a_brand_for_startups | building a brand]] for AI companies, it's important to understand that AI will soon cease to be a distinguishing feature itself, much like electricity is no longer a feature for products that run on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>.

## What is a Brand?
A brand is not merely a logo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>. Instead, it is:
*   A promise: "What do I expect from you?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>
*   What someone would miss if the entity were gone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>

For example, Nike has a brand, while Hyatt Hotels have a logo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>. If Nike opened a hotel, consumers would have an expectation of what it would be like, but if Hyatt made sneakers, there would be no clear expectation beyond comfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>. To build a brand, a company must stand for something and clarify what it does *not* do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>.

## Building Brands for AI Companies
For AI companies, and all companies, the focus must shift to asking: "What's in this for the user?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>.
The core strategy for building a brand in the age of AI is to:
1.  **Make a promise:** This promise should be difficult and remarkable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>.
2.  **Keep the promise:** Breaking a promise can quickly erode consumer trust and brand value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>.

### The Role of Promise-Keeping in AI
The rise of AI has raised the bar for promise-keeping, as many more promises are being made, but fewer are being kept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>.

As an example, Claude.ai is perceived as having a strong brand due to its "kindness and humility," clearly indicating when it doesn't know something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>. This contrasts with ChatGPT, which has a less favorable reputation for "overpromising and under-delivering" without humility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>. Users are willing to pay extra for Claude because it has established a reliable brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:45">[00:18:45]</a>.

## The Importance of Being Remarkable
The concept of being "remarkable" is crucial for brand building, especially in the context of AI products. "Remarkable" means "worth making a remark about" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:20">[00:30:20]</a>. This goes beyond creating viral gimmicks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:24">[00:30:24]</a>.

A product is remarkable if:
*   The user's life improves by discussing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>.
*   The creators know in advance what they want users to say about it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:35">[00:30:35]</a>.

This leads to powerful word-of-mouth marketing, which is often more effective than paid advertisements or sales teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:07">[00:32:07]</a>. If a product is designed to encourage users to tell others about it, the [[leveraging_ai_tools_in_product_management | marketing problem]] is largely solved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>.

## Key Takeaways for Brand Building with AI
*   **AI as an underlying utility:** Soon, AI will be an underlying utility, not a differentiating feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>.
*   **Promise and delivery:** Build a brand by making a clear, remarkable promise to the user and consistently delivering on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>.
*   **Empathy:** Understand what users truly want and how your product can help them achieve it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:31">[00:43:31]</a>.
*   **Remarkability drives word-of-mouth:** Design your product to be so valuable and engaging that users are compelled to talk about it, raising their own status by recommending it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:56">[00:31:56]</a>.

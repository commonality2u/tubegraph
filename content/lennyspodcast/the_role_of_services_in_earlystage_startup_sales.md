In the early stages of a startup, especially for B2B SaaS companies selling into larger organizations, incorporating services can be a crucial strategy to land initial customers and gain valuable insights. This approach is particularly relevant when the target market is not yet ready to adopt a new technology or lacks an existing process for the problem the startup aims to solve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:51">[00:43:51]</a>.

## Why Services are Important in Early Sales

When a market is not yet mature enough to buy a specific technology, a startup needs to "sell them some form of a service" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:56">[00:43:56]</a>. This strategy allows the startup to:
*   **Educate the market** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>.
*   **Secure initial logos** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:06">[00:44:06]</a>.
*   **Show revenue** to investors, even if it's not recurring revenue initially, demonstrating intent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:08">[00:44:08]</a>.
*   **Be paid to educate the customer** and help them design their internal processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:45">[00:44:45]</a>. This is where significant power lies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:51">[00:44:51]</a>.

Many AI startups, for example, engaged in services contracts to help set the buyer's mindset around how the new technology would look and integrate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:53">[00:44:53]</a>.

## Addressing Investor Concerns

While some investors may be hesitant about [[Sales strategies for startups | service-based revenue]] because it's not recurring, founders can argue that waiting for the market to be ready to buy a pure technology solution could mean waiting 18 months or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:13">[00:44:13]</a>. Engaging in services ensures the startup is the one educating the market, preventing a competitor from stepping in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:26">[00:44:26]</a>.

## Timeboxing and Examples of Services

It is crucial to timebox service engagements, ideally in 90-day increments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:13">[00:45:13]</a>. This prevents locking the startup into long-term service commitments, as needs can change quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:23">[00:45:23]</a>.

Examples of services an early-stage startup might offer:
*   Helping a customer design a custom pitch to their boss to justify the purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:56">[00:47:56]</a>.
*   Assisting with the design of a new internal process required to deploy the technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:26">[00:48:26]</a>.
*   Mapping out how the new technology would integrate with existing tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:36">[00:48:36]</a>.

This approach is essentially consulting, guiding them toward the acquisition of the product, rather than one-off consulting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:47">[00:48:47]</a>.

## When to Offer Services vs. Pure Technology Sales

Approximately 40% to 50% of B2B SaaS companies, particularly those focused on [[Enterprise sales strategies for tech startups | top-down sales]] where the user and buyer are different, need to sell some form of service before they can sell their technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:26">[00:47:26]</a>.

If the market is already able to acquire and adopt the technology without needing to create a new strategy or process, then selling the technology directly is appropriate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:15">[00:49:15]</a>. However, for new technologies like AI, where strategies, processes (e.g., "human in the loop"), measurement of success, and risk awareness are undefined, services can bridge the gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:41">[00:46:41]</a>. Procurement and legal teams, especially in traditional industries, are accustomed to buying services, which are often the largest budget line item <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:04">[00:47:04]</a>.

The ability to offer services in the early stages helps founders get into the Enterprise market faster, setting the stage for future technology contracts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:16">[00:46:16]</a>.

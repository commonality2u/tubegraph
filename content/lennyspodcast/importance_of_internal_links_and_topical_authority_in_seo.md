Successful Search Engine Optimization (SEO) involves understanding and leveraging key concepts like internal links and topical authority. These elements are crucial for a website's visibility and performance in search engine results.

## Topical Authority

[[Topical Authority]] is one of the most important, yet least understood, aspects of SEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:14">[01:09:14]</a>. It evolved from Google's initial PageRank system, which prioritized pages based on the number of inbound links, similar to academic citations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:21">[01:09:21]</a>. Over time, Google's understanding of authority has become more complex and includes additional inputs beyond just links <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:49">[01:09:49]</a>.

Key inputs for [[Topical Authority]] include:
*   **Links from other sites (Referring Domains)**: The more external links a site has pointing to it, the more important it is perceived to be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:52">[01:09:52]</a>.
*   **Non-SEO Traffic**: Google considers traffic coming from other channels (direct, paid, email, social) as a signal of credibility and authority, indicating the site is not "just an SEO site" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:10">[01:10:10]</a>. This data is observed via Chrome and Android <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:04">[01:10:04]</a>.
*   **Shares and Social Activity**: Engagement on social platforms also acts as an authority signal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:12">[01:10:12]</a>.
*   **Branded Search**: The frequency with which users search for a brand name directly on Google (e.g., "MasterClass") contributes to its overall authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:14">[01:10:14]</a>.

Crucially, authority is topical, not just a total domain score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:26">[01:10:26]</a>. Google looks for sites with disproportionate authority in specific, narrow themes or topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:48">[01:10:48]</a>. This is determined by factors like the anchor text of backlinks (e.g., "chicken recipes" versus "digital camera") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:57">[01:10:57]</a>, and the content of shared material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:05">[01:11:05]</a>.

**Examples of Topical Authority in Action:**
*   **Jello Shots Recipe Site**: A viral blog post about "jello shots" led to the entire domain ranking higher for semantically related terms like "vodka recipes" and "whiskey recipes," even for pages not directly linked from the viral post <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:28">[01:11:28]</a>. This demonstrates how authority for one specific topic can spread to adjacent topics across the entire domain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:09">[01:12:09]</a>.
*   **MasterClass**: Initially, MasterClass had authority for instructor names like "Gordon Ramsay" but not for "food" in general <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:22">[01:12:22]</a>. By focusing on content related to Gordon Ramsay's known expertise (e.g., "beef wellington," "how to poach an egg"), they leveraged existing topical authority to rank for adjacent terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:35">[01:12:35]</a>. This strategy allows newer companies to compete and outrank larger sites that may have more overall domain authority but less specific topical authority in a niche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:04">[01:13:04]</a>.

A "topic" in SEO is typically a cluster of keywords for which Google shows similar search results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>. The label for a topic is often the highest search volume keyword within that cluster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:17">[01:14:17]</a>. Google dynamically generates these topic graphs by crawling the web, looking for co-occurrences of words on pages, and analyzing search refinements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:47">[01:15:47]</a>.

## Internal Links

Internal links are a powerful and often underappreciated lever for SEO growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:44">[01:16:44]</a>. In 2007, an analysis of an e-commerce site revealed a clear causal relationship: pages with more internal links received significantly more traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:29">[01:17:29]</a>. Adding internal links to product pages that had none resulted in a 300% increase in traffic to those pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:07">[01:18:07]</a>. This fundamental principle remains true today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:19">[01:18:19]</a>.

**Why Internal Links are Crucial:**
*   **Crawlability**: Google crawls the web and your site through links <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:30">[01:18:30]</a>. Without sufficient internal links, Google struggles to find and index all of your pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:32">[01:18:32]</a>.
*   **Page Discovery and Credit**: It's not enough to just include a page in a sitemap; Google needs many paths to find pages, and the more paths, the better (up to a point) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:39">[01:18:39]</a>. Ideally, a page should have at least 10 internal links for Google to find and crawl it regularly enough to give it credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:49">[01:18:49]</a>.
*   **Link Distribution**: A common problem is an uneven distribution of internal links, often following a "power curve" where 5% of pages receive 95% of links <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:17">[01:20:17]</a>. Many pages often have zero or only one link <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:25">[01:20:25]</a>.
*   **Common Algorithm Flaws**: Typical internal link algorithms (e.g., facet-based, recommendation-based, popular, or most recent) often create "silos" or gaps where less popular or older pages don't get sufficient links <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:01">[01:19:01]</a>.

**Implementing Effective Internal Linking:**
*   **Shortest Path from Crawl Points**: The goal is to ensure every page is easily accessible from "crawl points" (where Google frequently enters your site, like the homepage or popular pages) with as few "hops" or levels as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:52">[01:20:52]</a>. A flatter link graph is generally preferred over a deep hierarchical structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:30">[01:21:30]</a>.
*   **Body Links vs. Navigational Links**: While footer and navigation links (navigational links) count, links embedded within the body of the content (body links) carry more weight because Google distinguishes between navigational and core content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:46">[01:22:46]</a>.
*   **Significant Opportunity**: Fixing a poorly optimized internal link structure can lead to significant traffic increases, often 25% or more, and sometimes even 100% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:05">[01:22:05]</a>. This is often seen as a "quick win" for companies starting their SEO efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:21">[01:22:21]</a>.

**Tools for Analysis:**
*   [[Screaming Frog]]: This tool can be used to crawl your entire site and analyze internal link counts, identifying pages with insufficient links <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:07">[01:20:07]</a>.

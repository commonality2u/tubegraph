Ki Sarin, co-founder and CEO of Linear, shares insights into how his company achieved and scaled [[Product Market Fit]] (PMF) in the B2B SaaS space, particularly for their issue tracking tool. Linear's journey emphasizes a unique approach focused on craft, quality, and a deep understanding of customer needs.

## Linear's Origins and Unique Approach
Linear was founded in 2019 to address the shortcomings of existing project and issue tracking systems for software companies and technical teams, which often felt "clunky or complex" and had a "legacy way of thinking" about software development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. The founders, including Ki (founding designer at Coinbase, principal designer at Airbnb), aimed to build the "most frictionless and streamlined system for modern software development" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

Their approach emphasizes:
*   A huge focus on craft and quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
*   No A/B tests or metric-based goals; instead, a focus on taste and opinions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
*   Teams assembling around projects and dispersing afterward, rather than durable cross-functional teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   Only one product manager, who serves as the head of product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

## Initial Launch and Customer Acquisition
Linear started officially in April 2019, with months of exploration and prototyping prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:43">[01:08:43]</a>. A key technical challenge they addressed early on was making the application "really fast" by developing a local-based data structure where data resides in the client and syncs with the backend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>.

### The Waitlist and Selective Onboarding
Upon announcing the company in mid-April 2019, Linear launched a website with a waitlist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:39">[01:09:39]</a>. This waitlist wasn't just for email addresses; it included a survey asking about:
*   Current tools used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:19">[01:10:19]</a>.
*   Reasons for wanting to use Linear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:21">[01:10:21]</a>.
*   Company size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:24">[01:10:24]</a>.

This allowed Linear to selectively invite smaller companies using the tools they supported, and prioritize those most interested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:28">[01:10:28]</a>. Within about a month, they had around 4,000 people on the waitlist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:34">[01:12:34]</a>.

Initially, this was a manual process where Ki would personally read surveys, copy emails, and send invite links <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:49">[01:12:49]</a>. They invited users in small cohorts (e.g., 10 people a week) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:07">[01:13:07]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Cohort-Based Feedback Loop
> This slow, cohort-based approach was crucial. If they invited everyone at once, users would likely hit the same early-stage bugs, leading to redundant feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:18">[01:13:18]</a>. Instead, they would:
> 1.  Invite a cohort. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:41">[01:13:41]</a>
> 2.  Receive feedback on issues. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:43">[01:13:43]</a>
> 3.  Fix those issues. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:47">[01:13:47]</a>
> 4.  Invite the next cohort, who would then encounter new issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:49">[01:13:49]</a>.
> This systematic process ensured effective initial development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:11">[01:14:11]</a>.

## The Private Beta and Pricing Experiment
Linear remained in private beta for almost a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:07">[01:10:07]</a>. By May 2019, they could use the product internally, and by June-July, they had about 100-200 users and around 10 companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:44">[01:09:44]</a>.

During the private beta, they introduced a payment function with an optional slider, allowing users to choose how much they wanted to pay per seat (from $1 to $20+) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:05">[01:15:05]</a>. This experiment, while not providing extensive data for final pricing, built confidence that there was a market for their product at a price point under $20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:09">[01:16:09]</a>.

## Feeling [[Product Market Fit]] as a Spectrum
Ki views [[Product Market Fit]] not as a binary state, but as a spectrum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:07">[01:19:07]</a>. They consistently felt a level of "paranoid" about their PMF, always questioning its strength and applicability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:30">[01:16:30]</a>.

> [!INFO] Stages of Product-Market Fit
> Linear's journey involved:
> 1.  **Early Fit:** They first felt strong PMF with "smaller, early-stage companies" where the founder was still heavily involved in product and cared about speed and certain values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:07">[01:17:07]</a>.
> 2.  **Market Focus:** For the first two years, their primary goal was to become the "default for startups" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:18">[01:18:18]</a>, focusing purely on that segment to achieve strong PMF.
> 3.  **Expansion:** In the last two years, they have shifted focus to making the software work better and achieving stronger [[Product Market Fit]] with larger companies (hundreds to thousands of people) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:43">[01:18:43]</a>, acknowledging that a Fortune 500 company might not be a perfect fit today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:41">[01:17:41]</a>.

This approach aligns with the idea of "doubling down" on categories where you're doing well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:21">[01:20:21]</a>, similar to Zoom's early strategy of focusing on universities when they found a good fit there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:37">[01:20:37]</a>. Linear observes trends like AI companies or crypto companies increasingly using their product and considers how to support and acquire more of those specific segments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:26">[01:21:26]</a>.

## Key Principles for Achieving PMF in B2B SaaS
### Focus on Core Value
Linear believes that productivity software should be "opinionated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>. Instead of creating flexible software that leads to users spending time "figuring things out," they provide "good defaults or good opinions" on workflows. This allows users to "focus on the work you do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>.

### Deep Customer Understanding
Despite not using A/B testing or specific metric goals for features, Linear emphasizes "science" through extensive user research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:59">[00:45:59]</a>. Founders and team members regularly engage with customers through weekly calls, shared Slack channels, and directly answering questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:12">[00:46:12]</a>.

> [!INFO] "Magic and Science" Approach
> This constant interaction ensures the entire team understands the "actual reality of the customers or the product" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:35">[00:47:35]</a>. This deep understanding allows them to rely on intuition and judgment ("magic") rather than solely on data for product decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:41">[00:47:41]</a>. Mistakes are seen as opportunities to fix and learn, rather than something to be avoided at all costs by relying on metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:52">[00:49:52]</a>.

### Respecting the Customer and Building Trust
Linear operates in the "retention business" and "trust business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:10">[00:51:10]</a>. Their aim is for companies to start using Linear early and "stay with us forever" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:19">[00:51:19]</a>. This long-term relationship is built on continuously delivering a "good quality product" and maintaining trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:22">[00:51:22]</a>. This contrasts with more transactional businesses where customer interaction might end after a sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:37">[00:51:37]</a>.

### Strategic Product Development (The [[Productmarket fit framework|Linear Method]])
Linear's "Linear Method" is centered around consistent Cycles, similar to sprints but without the pressure of "sprinting anywhere" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:57">[00:42:57]</a>. These cycles help teams focus on a prioritized list of tasks for a defined timeframe (e.g., 1-2 weeks), preventing distraction from an "infinite list of things to do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:53">[00:41:53]</a>. This deliberate focus on opinionated software and structured development allows them to build quality into their product consistently.

By combining meticulous craft, a deep understanding of their target user segments, and a culture of continuous improvement based on genuine customer feedback, Linear has successfully navigated the path to [[Product Market Fit]] and sustained growth in the competitive B2B SaaS landscape.

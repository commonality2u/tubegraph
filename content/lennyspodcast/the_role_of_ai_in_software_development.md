The landscape of software development is undergoing a profound transformation with the advent of artificial intelligence. Verun Mohan, co-founder and CEO of Windsurf (from Kodium), offers insights into how [[ai_and_software_development | AI is reshaping software development]], from the underlying infrastructure to the skills required of engineers.

## From Infrastructure to Application: Kodium's Evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>

Kodium began its journey nearly four years ago, before [[ai_and_software_development | AI coding]] was a widespread concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. Initially, the company focused on building GPU virtualization and compiler software, with the belief that deep learning would permeate many industries beyond autonomous vehicles, such as financial services, defense, and healthcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. Their core offering was making complex deep learning applications runnable on computers without direct GPU access, handling the underlying complexity and optimizing workloads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

By mid-2022, Kodium was profitable and managing over 10,000 GPUs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. However, with the rapid improvement of generative models, they realized their infrastructure-layer value proposition might diminish as all companies would eventually run similar generative AI models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. Believing generative AI would be "the next internet," Kodium made a pivotal decision to vertical integrate and build applications on top of their own inference infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

This led to the creation of Kodium, which eventually spawned Windsurf. Early adopters of GitHub Copilot, they identified a significant opportunity in the coding space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. Windsurf began as a free autocomplete tool for developers across various IDEs (VS Code, Jet Brains, Eclipse, Visual Studio, Vim, Emacs), leveraging their infrastructure background to optimize workloads and offer the product at no cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

As large businesses like Dell and JP Morgan Chase showed interest, the focus expanded to enterprise solutions, emphasizing secure and personalized offerings tailored to private company data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. Six months prior to the interview, Kodium realized that existing IDEs like VS Code were limiting the potential of their [[ai_and_software_development | AI capabilities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. This prompted the strategic decision to fork VS Code and build their own IDE, Windsurf, incorporating new agentic capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. This bold move, while risky, immediately tripled the acceptance rate of their ML models, proving the value of a custom interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>.

## Where Value Accrues in AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>

Kodium's journey highlights a key lesson: the initial assumptions in a startup are often wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. Their initial hypothesis that model architectures would remain highly heterogeneous proved incorrect as the industry shifted predominantly to transformers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. This led to the conclusion that value would not primarily accrue at the pure infrastructure layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

Instead, Verun believes the [[the_impact_of_ai_on_software_and_business | application layer]] is where true differentiation occurs, by building better user experiences and workflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. The ability to pivot quickly, even from a revenue-generating product, is crucial, driven by the belief that if core assumptions change, the entire business strategy must be re-evaluated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. This aligns with the philosophy of "fall in love with the problem, not the solution" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.

## The Transformation in Software Engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>

Windsurf's experience indicates that [[ai_and_software_development | AI will write over 90% of software]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>. This fundamentally shifts the [[the_evolution_of_software_development_with_ai | role of engineers]]. Engineering tasks can be categorized into three buckets:
1.  **What should I solve?** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>
2.  **How should I solve it?** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>
3.  **Solving it** (pure execution) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>

AI is expected to handle the vast majority, if not all, of the "solving it" phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>. With deep understanding of codebases and organizational environments, AI will increasingly assist in "how to solve it" by suggesting best practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>. This means engineers will increasingly focus on the most important business problems and strategic technical decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>.

Despite AI's capabilities, a Computer Science (CS) degree remains valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>. It cultivates problem-solving skills and an understanding of underlying principles (like operating systems, parallel computing) that inform better design decisions, even if the engineer isn't directly manipulating low-level components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>. This foundational knowledge allows engineers to better understand application performance and make informed trade-offs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>.

### The Importance of Agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:37">[00:21:37]</a>

Beyond technical skills, "agency" is an undervalued skill for engineers in the AI era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a>. This refers to the drive and initiative to build things, rather than just following well-defined paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:03">[00:22:03]</a>. Startups, in particular, seek high-agency individuals who understand that constant innovation is critical for survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:28">[00:22:28]</a>.

## Windsurf's Product Differentiators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:46">[00:37:46]</a>

Windsurf's core differentiators stem from its unique approach:
*   **Codebase Understanding**: Kodium's history of working with large enterprises (e.g., Dell with 100 million lines of code) led to significant investment in deeply understanding massive codebases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:04">[00:38:04]</a>. This involves custom models that consume and rank large chunks of code in parallel to provide relevant snippets for any question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:18">[00:38:18]</a>.
*   **Platform Agnosticism**: While Windsurf is its own IDE, Kodium remains committed to supporting other platforms like JetBrains, which is popular among Java developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:41">[00:39:41]</a>. The goal is to provide an agentic experience to *every* developer, regardless of their preferred IDE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:06">[00:40:06]</a>.
*   **Enterprise-Grade Security**: Windsurf operates in secure environments, offering FedRAMP compliance and a hybrid mode where indexed code resides on the user's tenant, addressing concerns about sensitive IP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:48">[00:40:48]</a>.

### Live Demo Capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:21">[00:41:21]</a>

Windsurf functions as an IDE for building and modifying software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. Key features demonstrated include:
*   **Image-to-Code Generation**: Users can provide images (e.g., a mockup for an Airbnb for dogs website), and Windsurf can transform an existing boilerplate React project to match the design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:47">[00:41:47]</a>.
*   **Interactive UI Manipulation**: The tool allows users to select elements directly on the live preview of the application and instruct the AI to make changes (e.g., "make this background red") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:27">[00:45:27]</a>. This enables operating "entirely in app world" without needing to look at code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:57">[00:45:57]</a>.
*   **AI Review Flow**: As AI generates large chunks of code, developers' roles shift to reviewing this code. Windsurf integrates custom review flows to facilitate this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:40">[00:46:40]</a>.
*   **Intent Prediction and Refactoring**: Windsurf not only tracks AI actions but also user edits. If a developer manually changes a variable name, the AI can predict the intent and apply the change consistently across the entire codebase, effectively automating large-scale refactors and migrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:17">[00:47:17]</a>.

## Technical Underpinnings: Hybrid Model Approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:06">[00:54:06]</a>

Windsurf utilizes a hybrid model approach:
*   **Planning Model**: It leverages external models like Anthropic's Sonnet or OpenAI's GPT-4o for high-level planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:14">[00:54:14]</a>.
*   **In-House Models**: Kodium runs its own models for crucial tasks like high-quality retrieval and code editing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:30">[00:54:30]</a>. This is critical for handling large codebases (e.g., 100 million lines of code cannot be sent to external APIs due to token limits, cost, and latency) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:47">[00:54:47]</a>.
*   **Custom Training Data**: Kodium collects tens of millions of pieces of feedback per hour from users, including preference data on incomplete code snippets during typing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:37">[00:56:37]</a>. This unique dataset allows them to train superior in-house models for tasks like autocomplete and code edits, where frontier models might struggle with real-time, incomplete code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:04">[00:57:04]</a>.

## Impact on Business and Organizational Structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:51">[00:50:51]</a>

The [[the_impact_of_ai_on_software_and_business | impact of AI on software and business]] extends beyond engineering teams:
*   **Internal Tooling**: Kodium's own go-to-market team has used Windsurf to build internal apps, saving hundreds of thousands of dollars on SaaS products they would have otherwise purchased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:10">[00:50:10]</a>. This suggests that verticalized niche SaaS products, especially in areas like sales, legal, or finance, may face significant competition as domain specialists can now build custom tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>.
*   **Changing Build vs. Buy**: Historically, companies bought software for its "kitchen sink" of features, even if only 10% were needed, because building custom solutions was too complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:04">[00:52:04]</a>. Now, with tools like Windsurf, companies can quickly and securely build custom software tailored to their exact needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:19">[00:52:19]</a>.
*   **Increased Demand for Engineers**: While AI boosts productivity, the overall [[the_impact_of_ai_on_software_and_business | ROI of building technology has gone up]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:56">[00:55:56]</a>. For companies with a high technology ceiling (e.g., JP Morgan Chase with a $17 billion annual software budget and 50,000 engineers), increased productivity per engineer translates to *more* investment and hiring in technology, not less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:14">[00:56:14]</a>.
*   **Product Team Restructuring**: Kodium's core engineering team operates without dedicated product managers because their developers are the users, ensuring intuitive product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:03">[01:01:03]</a>. For enterprise clients with unique requirements (e.g., FedRAMP compliance), they employ "product strategy" roles to bridge customer needs with technical capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:58">[01:01:58]</a>. Teams are kept small ("two-pizza teams") to ensure leaders remain deeply involved in the technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:27">[01:02:27]</a>.

## Key Learnings for Building AI Products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:49">[01:06:49]</a>

*   **Cannibalize Your Own Product**: Kodium's internal goal is to make their existing product look "silly" every 6 to 12 months, constantly pushing for disruptive innovation that users aren't even asking for yet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:20">[01:07:20]</a>. This requires balancing incremental iteration with longer-term, high-impact bets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:57">[01:07:57]</a>.
*   **Embrace Being Wrong Faster**: Founders often struggle with letting go of initial ideas, but accepting that hypotheses will be wrong and quickly re-evaluating is critical for survival in a rapidly changing environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:09">[01:09:09]</a>.
*   **Get Your Hands Dirty**: The best way to leverage [[ai_and_software_development | AI tools]] is to actively use them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:56">[01:10:56]</a>. Understanding their capabilities, whether building new apps or modifying existing codebases, allows individuals to become "force multipliers" within their organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:39">[01:11:39]</a>. A product manager, for example, could directly implement changes in a codebase, gaining significant respect and efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:44">[01:11:44]</a>.

The future of software development, driven by AI, emphasizes not just *what* to build, but the incredible speed and autonomy with which it can be built, opening up new opportunities for individuals and organizations alike.

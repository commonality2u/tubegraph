The role of an SEO expert, often perceived as a "dark art" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>, is crucial for driving growth and requires a blend of analytical, scientific, and creative skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:27">[01:23:27]</a>. Companies frequently under-resource SEO compared to advertising, despite its potential for significant traffic generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Why SEO is Often Under-Resourced

Many companies disproportionately spend on ads while neglecting SEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, despite SEO potentially yielding equal amounts of traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. For large companies like Zillow or eBay, spending tens of millions on ads but only fifty thousand on SEO "doesn't make sense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

The disproportionate lack of [[seo_resource_allocation_vs_advertisement_spending | resources allocated to SEO]] can be attributed to several factors:
*   **Organizational Design** SEO is often not integrated into the product organization, even though many effective SEO changes are product changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:10">[01:07:10]</a>. Eli Schwartz's book "Product Led SEO" highlights how it *should* be done, but typically, separate SEO teams struggle to get product teams to prioritize their requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:17">[01:07:17]</a>.
*   **Mystery and Uncertainty** SEO is often seen as mysterious, making it hard to predict if efforts will work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:53">[01:07:53]</a>. This contrasts with less mysterious initiatives that get higher priority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:09">[01:08:09]</a>.
*   **High Scope** Implementing comprehensive SEO strategies often requires significant work and a large team, making it a high-scope endeavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:13">[01:08:13]</a>.

## When to Invest in SEO Expertise

Deciding when to [[evaluating_when_to_invest_in_seo_for_startups | invest in SEO]] involves evaluating market size and existing authority:
*   **Large Addressable Market** The market for SEO must be large enough to justify investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>. Most categories are typically large <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:02">[01:00:02]</a>.
*   **Existing Traction/Authority** Starting from zero with no authority or traction makes it very difficult, as Google prefers to rank credible domains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.
    *   **Traffic Volume** A site should ideally have at least 1,000 daily visits from non-SEO channels (direct, paid, email, social) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:19">[01:11:19]</a>. This signals to Google that the site is not "just an SEO site" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:55">[01:14:55]</a>.
    *   **Referring Domains** Aim for at least 1,000 referring domains, which can be checked using tools like Ahrefs or Semrush <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:29">[01:11:29]</a>.
*   **Comparative Opportunity** SEO investment should be weighed against other growth channels like paid ads or social media based on cost and expected opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:02">[02:23:02]</a>.

## Hiring Strategies for SEO Experts

### Who to Hire: In-House vs. Agency
While consultants and agencies exist (like Graphite, run by Ethan Smith), an in-house expert is generally preferred if possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:41">[00:46:41]</a>. The choice often depends on the specific SEO strategy and budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:44">[00:46:44]</a>.

### Types of SEO Expertise
There are three main types of SEO, each requiring different skill sets:

1.  **[[programmatic_vs_editorial_seo_strategies | Programmatic SEO]] Expert**
    *   **Definition:** Focuses on automatically generated pages from a database, such as product pages (eBay), address pages (Zillow), or UGC pages (Glassdoor) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>. This often involves category pages and item pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>.
    *   **Skills:** Highly specialized and harder to find <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:52">[00:45:52]</a>. Requires a "growth person with technical ability" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:44">[00:47:44]</a>. Knowledge of indexation logic, clustering keywords at a category level, and dealing with UGC are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:05">[00:46:05]</a>.
    *   **Role:** Primarily about building code and architecting taxonomies, working with engineers to automate page generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:21">[00:49:21]</a>. They don't necessarily write code themselves but manage the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:33">[00:49:33]</a>.
    *   **Recruiting:** Look for individuals who have achieved significant SEO growth (e.g., 80% of traffic from SEO) at less well-known companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:05">[00:48:05]</a>. This indicates they achieved results despite less existing authority, making them highly capable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:51">[00:48:51]</a>.

2.  **[[programmatic_vs_editorial_seo_strategies | Editorial SEO]] Manager**
    *   **Definition:** Focuses on manually written content like articles, guides, or listicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>. This type of SEO is increasingly driving more traffic than programmatic SEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>. Examples include MasterClass, BetterUp, NerdWallet, and HubSpot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>.
    *   **Skills:** Easier to find than programmatic experts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:59">[00:45:59]</a>. A "young and hungry" person can learn this role, especially if they are strong in content strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:48">[00:46:48]</a>. Prior SEO experience isn't always necessary if they have the right workflow and tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:59">[00:56:59]</a>.
    *   **Role:** The most important part is figuring out *what* to write about and *what topics* to cover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:30">[00:56:30]</a>. They define prioritized [[seo_best_practices_and_content_strategy | topics]] based on search volume, topical authority, and conversion intent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:07">[00:55:07]</a>. They also create comprehensive outlines for writers to ensure all subtopics are covered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:17">[00:55:17]</a>.
    *   **Team:** The MVP team for editorial SEO is typically one SEO manager and one writer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:07">[00:59:07]</a>. The SEO manager usually does not do the writing themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:26">[00:59:26]</a>.

3.  **Technical SEO:**
    *   **Definition:** Deals with the website's infrastructure, including internal link architecture, tags, redirects, and page speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>.
    *   **Importance:** While technical audits (lists of bugs) are often over-indexed, a strategy around technical components is crucial for growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. It's a foundational element that applies to all SEO types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>.

## Day-to-Day Role of an SEO Expert

An SEO expert's daily activities involve:

*   **Defining the Addressable Market:** Identifying relevant [[seo_best_practices_and_content_strategy | topics]] and keywords to acquire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>.
*   **Page Type Identification:** Determining the ideal page type (e.g., article, product page) by analyzing top-ranking results for target keywords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:58">[00:24:58]</a>.
*   **Content Strategy and Product Requirements:** Defining what content and product features (e.g., map, phone number) are needed on pages to fulfill user intent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:42">[00:26:42]</a>. This requires a "detective" mindset to reverse-engineer what Google wants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:01">[00:27:01]</a>.
*   **Infrastructure (Internal Links):** Ensuring Google can find all pages via a robust internal link architecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:30">[00:24:30]</a>. This is often an under-optimized lever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:19">[01:18:19]</a> and can yield significant traffic increases (e.g., 25%+ or even 100%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:05">[01:22:05]</a>.
*   **Analyzing Competitors:** A large portion of an SEO expert's time is spent examining other companies' sites to understand what's working and reverse-engineer successful patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:09">[00:50:09]</a>. This is more valuable than constant A/B testing, which primarily validates hypotheses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:12">[00:51:12]</a>.
*   **Data Analysis:** Regularly analyzing performance to see what is working and why <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:53">[00:50:53]</a>.
*   **Testing:** Conducting A/B tests or sequential tests, typically after initial launches (e.g., at month six) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:02">[00:52:02]</a>.

## Key Concepts for SEO Experts

*   **[[understanding_and_implementing_editorial_and_programmatic_seo | Topics vs. Keywords]]**: Modern SEO focuses on ranking for *topics* rather than individual keywords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:58">[00:31:58]</a>. A single page can rank for hundreds or thousands of keywords semantically related to a topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:55">[00:32:55]</a>. This impacts search volume assessment, prevents wasted effort on redundant content, and ensures comprehensive intent fulfillment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:01">[00:33:01]</a>.
*   **Topical Authority:** Google prioritizes sites known for specific themes and expertise, not just overall domain authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:49">[01:09:49]</a>. Factors like backlinks, non-SEO traffic, social shares, and branded searches contribute to this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:01">[01:10:01]</a>. Building authority in adjacent topics can lead to broader ranking success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:12">[01:12:12]</a>.
*   **Engagement Signals:** Google uses engagement metrics (click-through rate from search results, time spent on page, whether users return to search after visiting a page) as key ranking signals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:15">[00:28:15]</a>. Pages that provide comprehensive answers and good user experience lead to higher engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:17">[00:28:17]</a>.
*   **Tools:** Essential tools for an SEO expert include:
    *   Google Search Console (free, for real traffic data and SERP tracking) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:58">[00:37:58]</a>.
    *   Clearscope (for content analysis and scoring, identifying content gaps) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:16">[00:38:16]</a>.
    *   Keyword Research Tools (Ahrefs, Semrush for URL and keyword data) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:41">[00:38:41]</a>.
    *   Screaming Frog (for site crawling, auditing, and internal link analysis) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:24">[00:39:24]</a>.

## [[impact_of_ai_on_seo | Impact of AI on SEO]]

While [[using_ai_to_optimize_seo_efforts | AI-generated content]] (like GPT-3) can produce grammatically correct sentences, it often lacks factual accuracy and underlying wisdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:35">[01:25:35]</a>. For content requiring factual precision (e.g., financial advice, medical information), AI-only generation is "really bad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>.

However, AI is highly useful in other aspects of the SEO workflow:
*   **Content Planning:** AI can extract structure, cluster keywords into topics, identify sub-themes, and analyze topical authority to help decide what to write about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:35">[01:27:35]</a>.
*   **Data Analysis:** AI can process large datasets to sort information, look for overlaps, and provide insights that feed into strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:50">[01:27:50]</a>.

The ideal application is where AI provides the structure and data, and a human expert (who possesses wisdom and domain expertise) writes the content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:10">[01:28:10]</a>.

## First Steps for Companies to Explore SEO

For a company considering SEO, the initial steps are:
1.  **Assess Addressable Market Size:** Determine if the market is large enough by analyzing competitor traffic via tools like SimilarWeb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:46">[01:28:46]</a>.
2.  **Evaluate Existing Authority:** Check current non-SEO traffic and the number of referring domains to understand the company's existing authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:57">[01:28:57]</a>.
3.  **Compare with Other Channels:** Objectively weigh the cost and opportunity of SEO against other growth channels to make an informed investment decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:09">[01:29:09]</a>.

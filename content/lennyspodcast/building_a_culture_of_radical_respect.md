## What is Radical Respect?
[[radical_candor_framework_by_kim_scott | Radical Respect]] is presented as the prequel to [[radical_candor_framework_by_kim_scott | Radical Candor]], emphasizing that if you don't respect another person, it's impossible to care about them, and you won't bother challenging them directly [01:11:45].

## Connection to [[radical_candor_framework_by_kim_scott | Radical Candor]]
Kim Scott, author of the highly referenced book *Radical Candor*, recognized that while [[radical_candor_framework_by_kim_scott | radical candor]] focuses on caring personally and challenging directly, an underlying foundation of respect is crucial [00:35:55]. This realization prompted her to write her next book, *Radical Respect* [01:14:31]. She observed a significant misunderstanding where people would claim to act "in the spirit of [[radical_candor_framework_by_kim_scott | radical candor]]" but behave in an "obnoxiously aggressive" manner, which is not the intended spirit of the framework [01:11:16].

## Why Radical Respect Matters
The need for [[radical_candor_framework_by_kim_scott | radical respect]] became acutely clear to Kim Scott through an experience with a colleague who was a Black woman CEO [01:12:10]. Her colleague found it much harder to implement [[radical_candor_framework_by_kim_scott | radical candor]] because, as soon as she offered even gentle criticism, people would stereotype her as an "angry black woman" [01:12:25]. This unfair bias highlighted a systemic issue where individuals, particularly women and minorities, face additional challenges in being direct, even when their intent is helpful [01:12:42].

## Addressing Bias, Prejudice, and Bullying
Reflecting on this experience, Kim Scott realized she had failed to:
*   **Be an upstander** She had not noticed the extent to which her colleague had to appear "unfailingly cheerful and pleasant" in every meeting, even when she had reason to be frustrated [01:12:49].
*   **Acknowledge her own experiences of bias, prejudice, and bullying** She had been in denial about a host of negative workplace experiences, partly because she didn't want to see herself as a victim [01:13:23].
*   **Acknowledge her own role as a culprit** Even more deeply, she had been in denial about times when she had said or done things that hurt others, were biased, or even amounted to bullying [01:13:55].

Kim Scott notes that leaders are especially prone to bullying, even if they do not think of themselves as bullies [01:14:10]. She also acknowledged that she had allowed "all manner of BS to pass" as a leader [01:14:22].

## Key Roles in Building Respectful Environments
Kim Scott's book *Radical Respect* addresses these issues by offering guidance for various roles people play in the workplace [01:15:07]:
*   **For Leaders** Chapters outline actions leaders can take [01:15:10].
*   **For those harmed** Guidance is provided for individuals affected by bias, prejudice, or bullying [01:15:15].
*   **For colleagues** Advice on how to be a great upstander and a better colleague [01:15:19].
*   **For culprits** Instructions on how to become part of the solution when you have caused harm [01:15:26].

It is emphasized that everyone finds themselves in all four of these roles at different moments [01:15:32], and that no single group can solve this problem; everyone is responsible for creating a more respectful work environment [01:15:37].

## Kim Scott's New Book: Radical Respect
The book *Radical Respect* is available for pre-order and comes out in May [01:14:46]. It is designed to help people move beyond the false dichotomy of being either "a total jerk but really competent" or "really nice but incompetent" [01:06:53]. The core message is that there is another way that works better and "doesn't hurt people" [01:07:07]. This approach allows for greater success by leaning into genuine care [01:07:15].

To encourage change, Kim Scott recommends that leaders share their own stories of acting like a "jerk" and the negative [[impact_and_application_of_radical_candor_in_leadership | impact]] it had, then ask others to share similar experiences [01:00:13]. This approach helps foster self-awareness and encourages a growth mindset [01:00:30]. It highlights that making mistakes is universal [01:01:21] and that "it's not mean, it's clear" [01:21:46] is a valuable principle for effective communication.

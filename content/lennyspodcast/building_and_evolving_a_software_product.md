Ivan Zhao, co-founder and CEO of Notion, shares insights into the company's decade-long journey, emphasizing the philosophical approach to [[Design and innovation in software development | building a product]] that balances vision with user needs, maintains lean operations, and adapts to technological shifts like AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:17">[01:30:17]</a>.

## The Early Years: Finding Product-Market Fit

### The "Lost Years" and Vision vs. User Needs
The first three to four years of Notion, starting in 2013, are described by Zhao as the "lost years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. The initial vision was to build a developer tool so easy that more people could create their own software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. However, after a couple of years, the team learned that most people didn't care about creating software; they simply needed to get their jobs done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>.

The realization came that their vision – "everybody can create their software" – needed to be hidden within a form factor that people *did* care about: productivity software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:43">[01:29:43]</a>. Zhao uses the analogy of "sugar and broccoli": people don't want to eat broccoli (the hidden vision of software creation), but they like sugar (productivity tools), so you give them the sugar with the broccoli inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. This shift took over two years to fully realize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>.

### Technical Challenges and Resets
During these initial years, Notion rebuilt its codebase multiple times, even throwing away existing code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. They initially bet on Web Components, a new technology from Google, which proved unstable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. This led to a complete restart of the company and codebase to build on a more robust technical foundation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>.

A major crisis occurred during COVID when Notion's infrastructure, running on a single PostgreSQL database instance, was rapidly running out of space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>. The team had to stop all new feature development and focus solely on sharding the database, narrowly avoiding a complete shutdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>. This emphasizes the importance of planning ahead, even while avoiding premature optimization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>.

### Sustaining the Vision
Sticking with an idea for three to four years without clear product-market fit requires deep belief in the product's necessity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>. For Zhao, Notion was about creating a "Lego for software" – a modular, playful tool for everyday work and life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. He attributes perseverance to a personal disposition where "high is never too high, low is never too low" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>, and the ability to reset mentally with rest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.

Financial support from his mother helped bridge critical periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. A period of working solely with his co-founder in Japan after laying off the team also provided a crucial reset and productive coding environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>.

Product-market fit for Notion wasn't a sudden "boom" but a gradual realization as users started to care, reach out, and pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>. External validation, such as VCs knocking on the door, served as a signal of traction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>.

## Principles of Product Building and Evolution

### Balancing Vision and Business Reality
[[Building a product at a large company | Building a product]] or business requires a balance between pursuing one's values and taste, and meeting user and revenue demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>. If too much emphasis is placed on personal vision, it risks becoming an "art project" with no users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>. Conversely, too much focus on business can lead to [[Building a brand and maintaining product quality | building a commodity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>. The most fulfilling path is creating something authentic that is also useful to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>.

### The Importance of "Craft" and Trade-offs
Zhao emphasizes "craft" as a core philosophy at Notion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>. Craft involves applying one's values to technical know-how to make clever tradeoffs and create something new and useful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>. This applies not only to the product but also to [[Building a product at a large company | building the business]] and company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>.

Product development inherently involves [[Balancing speed and quality in product development | trade-offs]]: deciding what to give up in a dynamic market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>. New technologies, like AI, act as new "materials" that unlock new ways of making these trade-offs, which must also consider human behavior and adaptability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. A product maker's job is to find the "sweet spot" across these dimensions to create something durable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>.

### Maintaining Lean Operations and Talent Density
Notion has maintained a remarkably lean and efficient operation:
*   Profitable for years, with most raised money still in the bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>.
*   No salesperson until over $10 million ARR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>.
*   First product manager hired at around 50 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>.
*   Operates mostly on Notion itself, minimizing internal communication overhead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>.

This lean approach stems from the founders' diverse skill sets (coding, design, marketing, sales) and a belief that better systems and tools can solve problems more efficiently than simply adding more people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>. The internal metaphor of Notion as a "small bus" encourages optimizing for "talent density" (revenue per employee) and hiring people who can do a lot, ensuring agility and a positive compounding effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>.

### Thoughtful Design of the Workspace
Notion's office design reflects its product philosophy, focusing on creating a pleasant and cozy environment that feels like an artist's studio or home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. This extends to details like choosing "warm white" wall shades, using home furniture, and avoiding harsh overhead lighting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>.

Conference rooms are named after "Timeless Tools" from history (e.g., iPhone, Macintosh, Lamy 2000 pens, Toshiba rice cookers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. This serves to inspire the team to create software products that endure and change people's lives for decades, contrasting with the often short technological cycles in tech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>.

## Building Horizontal Software

[[Building horizontal software platforms | Building horizontal software]], which aims to do many things well rather than specializing in one, is notoriously difficult and often takes a long time to find product-market fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.

### The Joy and Pain
For Zhao, the "Lego for software" vision naturally leads to a horizontal product, a choice he has "no regrets" about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.

A key learning in building horizontal products is the importance of "segmentation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. While hardcore users appreciate "Lego bricks" (modular components), most people, especially enterprise customers, want "Lego boxes" (ready-made "solutions") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. Notion learned to shift its mindset towards providing solutions as it moved upmarket to B2B <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.

There was a period where Notion deviated from its "Lego" value by hard-coding features like "Sprints" for project management, rather than building them from modular components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. This led to "organ rejection" from employees and customers, as the features felt underpowered and didn't fit the core system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. The team later returned to its original "Lego way" of building the product, realizing that if you build in a "non-Lego" way, "the system works against you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.

### The Bundling/Unbundling Cycle
The market constantly cycles between "bundling" and "unbundling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. Historically:
*   Early PC era saw many unbundled applications (e.g., dBase) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.
*   Microsoft bundled everything into one suite in the 90s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.
*   SaaS unbundled applications again, leading to companies using nearly 100 different tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.
*   Now, with AI and macro trends, the market is shifting back towards bundling, where more value can be created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.

Notion's success as a horizontal tool is exemplified by its high rankings across various categories in user surveys, including project management (2nd after Jira), docs (4th), and CRM (3rd after Salesforce and HubSpot) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. The advantage of a bundled offering is that users can address multiple use cases in one place, saving costs and providing a unified information hub for AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.

Notion leveraged a "B2C2B" strategy, starting with a large top-of-funnel use case: notes and documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. Many personal users adopted Notion for simple note-taking, then realized its broader capabilities (relational database, task management) and brought it to work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. This strategy guides their expansion into other broad categories like calendar and email, which also have over a billion users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.

## The Impact of AI
AI, particularly language models, has been a "gift" for tool builders, fundamentally changing the "material" they can work with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. Notion has leveraged AI in phases:
1.  **AI Writer Product**: Integrating writing capabilities into Notion's daily work surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.
2.  **AI Q&A/Connectors**: AI excels at reasoning, understanding, and searching information, especially when all data is together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. Notion built Q&A features and connectors to integrate external data (e.g., from Jira, Zendesk) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.
3.  **AI Coding Agents for Lego Blocks**: The most fascinating development is AI's ability to "piece things together" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. This addresses Notion's long-standing weakness: the difficulty for non-builders to assemble Lego sets from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. With AI, Notion aims to enable users to create any kind of knowledge work software or customer agent using existing Lego blocks, without needing to be a software engineer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.

## The Philosophy of Tools
Zhao views tools as "extensions of us" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. Once humans shape and bring tools into the world, those tools can, in turn, shape humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. This idea, encapsulated by Marshall McLuhan's quote, "We shape our tools, thereafter our tools shape us," guides Notion's development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.

For Notion, the goal is to extend the "good" parts of human nature, specifically creativity and beauty, which Zhao feels are often lacking in software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. By amplifying these human natures, Notion aims to shape its users towards a better version of themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. The most fulfilling aspect is seeing non-programmers make a living by selling Notion templates and apps, fulfilling the original mission of allowing more people to create software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.

## Conclusion
Ivan Zhao's journey with Notion highlights that [[Building a productoriented engineering team | building and evolving a software product]] is a continuous, iterative process of learning, adapting, and balancing core values with market realities. It emphasizes the power of modular systems, strategic resets, and a deep philosophical commitment to empowering human potential through well-crafted tools.

For early-stage founders, mastering the art of [[Sales strategies for startups | sales]] is crucial, especially when focusing on [[importance_of_founderled_sales_over_hiring_salespeople_early_on | founder-led sales]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The founder embodies the product, possessing unique insights and experiences that the market may not yet fully grasp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Initial Outreach: Getting Attention

In an environment saturated with SaaS tools constantly emailing about their products, the challenge is to make someone want to engage and learn about what you're doing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

### Messaging Strategy

The effectiveness of initial outreach largely hinges on compelling messaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.
*   **Relevancy First**: Start by immediately addressing why the message is relevant to them and their role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. This is more important than personalization, which can sometimes come across as forced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>.
*   **Novel or Counterintuitive Insight**: Lead with a unique technical or business model insight that inspires a new way of thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. Aim for something that has "shock value" or is counterintuitive, prompting a "what?" or "how could that be?" reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. Avoid claiming your product is merely "better," as this is hard to define and measure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:56">[00:29:56]</a>.
*   **Conciseness**: Keep the message short—ideally three to four sentences maximum—so it can be read without scrolling on a mobile phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>.
*   **Problem-Focused**: Talk about the problem you want to solve and why it needs to be addressed, rather than immediately presenting your solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>. This leaves the recipient wanting more information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE]
> A founder used the line: "0 to 1 sales talent doesn't exist, that's why I want to have a conversation with you." This served as the counterintuitive hook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>. They then tied it to relevancy, such as the prospect's recent funding round, and connected it to the company's belief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>.

### Channels

Common channels for initial outreach include:
*   Email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>
*   LinkedIn DMs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>
*   Cold calling (surprisingly effective, often yielding higher interest rates than email) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>

### Conversion Rates & Win Rates

While initial conversion rates (responses to outreach) are often a focus, a high win rate (deals closed from calls) is more impactful in the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>. If your win rate is high (e.g., 30-40%), you don't need an extremely high outbound conversion rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Win Rate
> Win rate is defined as the percentage of prospects who go through the sales process and sign up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>.

A healthy outbound conversion rate for a mature process might be 5-7%, but for founders solving a difficult problem, it can be as high as 8-15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>. Ultimately, when the market truly feels a problem, people will respond and get on a call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a>. If outreach isn't yielding results, it's often due to a lack of an interesting message or a problem that isn't widely felt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:08">[00:20:08]</a>.

## Finding the Right Leads

Before investing in [[Sales strategies for startups | sales]] tools, begin with manual discovery to ensure you're targeting the right audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:29">[00:23:29]</a>.

### Manual Discovery First

*   **Identify 30 Prospects**: Manually find 30 people you are genuinely excited to learn from <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:55">[00:23:55]</a>.
*   **Craft Thoughtful Messages**: Invest 15-20 minutes writing a personalized, "rock-solid" note to each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:59">[00:23:59]</a>. Test if you would respond to such an email yourself, even using text-to-speech to gauge tone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:13">[00:28:13]</a>.
*   **Analyze Responses**: Observe how many respond. Zero responses indicate a need to change messaging or target a different role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:13">[00:25:13]</a>.
*   **Truncate Experiments**: Focus on quality over volume in the early stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>. Volume comes after identifying key parameters and validating the approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:08">[00:26:08]</a>.

### Identifying Common Parameters

Through this manual process, you'll start to uncover commonalities among responsive prospects, such as company size, industry, role, or career history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:20">[00:24:20]</a>. These parameters are crucial for later leveraging enrichment tools effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:13">[00:26:13]</a>. A key early signal is whether you can even find 30 relevant people; if not, it suggests potential issues with market discoverability for your solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:53">[00:26:53]</a>.

## The First Sales Call: Learning and Engagement

Once a prospect agrees to a call, the goal shifts from convincing to learning and engaging them further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:01">[00:40:01]</a>.

### Be Vulnerable and Honest

*   **Acknowledge Your Stage**: Be transparent that you are an early-stage startup with much to learn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:06">[00:44:06]</a>. This fosters trust and encourages more raw, honest feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:37">[00:32:37]</a>.
*   **Seek Insight**: Frame the conversation around gaining their insight into how the problem manifests on their side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:01">[00:32:01]</a>. [[importance_of_talking_to_customers_in_startups | Founder-led sales]] is fundamentally about learning as fast as humanly possible, not immediate revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

### Focus on the Problem, Not the Solution

*   **Avoid Early Demos**: On the first call, avoid giving a full product demo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:30">[00:49:30]</a>. The demo is a valuable "carrot" you control; show it only when you've qualified them and they are genuinely invested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:40">[00:49:40]</a>.
*   **Visualize the Problem**: Encourage prospects to visualize the problem and its solution in their own minds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>. Ask "how would this look in your head?" to uncover deep insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:07">[00:39:07]</a>.

### Signs of a Strong Problem (and Potential Product-Market Fit)

During conversations, look for these signals:
*   **Growing Problem**: The problem must be growing and widening, not static <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:07">[00:40:07]</a>.
*   **Measurement and Management**: Ask if the problem is currently measured or managed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:24">[00:40:24]</a>. A "no" suggests it's not a high priority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:36">[00:40:36]</a>.
*   **Previous Attempts to Solve**: Inquire about past efforts to solve the problem (e.g., hiring headcount, using other tools, or if it remains an open gap) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:43">[00:40:43]</a>. This reveals their maturity in addressing the issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:57">[00:40:57]</a>.
*   **Bringing Others In**: A strong indicator of momentum is when prospects volunteer to bring colleagues or decision-makers onto subsequent calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:16">[00:41:16]</a>. This signifies they see a potential solution and want to move forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:40]</a>.

### What to Avoid

*   **Generic Questions**: Do not ask "what keeps you up at night?" or "if you had a magic wand?" as these yield inconsistent and unhelpful answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:06">[00:42:06]</a>.
*   **Being Boring**: Bring passion and energy to the call; remember that your prospects may be in "boring jobs" and are looking for something invigorating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:40">[01:11:40]</a>.
*   **Short-Selling**: Only sell solutions that genuinely solve the prospect's problem to avoid churn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:47">[01:12:47]</a>. Honesty builds trust, which is the "number one currency in sales" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:06">[01:13:06]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Biggest Pitfall
> The most significant opportunity to improve sales conversion lies in **qualification**. Many founders mistakenly believe they have a "bottom of funnel problem," but it's almost always a "top of funnel problem" – meaning they are talking to the wrong people, using the wrong message, not solving the right problem, or lacking differentiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:24">[01:10:24]</a>.

Brian Chesky, CEO and co-founder of [[Airbnbs unique company culture and growth | Airbnb]], has implemented significant organizational changes and refined his leadership style, particularly following the challenges of the pandemic. His approach emphasizes clarity, detail-orientation, and a unified company vision, moving away from traditional models that led to bureaucracy and slow growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Leadership Philosophy

Chesky believes that founders should not apologize for how they want to run their company, as clarity is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. He distinguishes "being in the details" from micromanagement, asserting that leaders must understand specifics to ensure quality and progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. He maintains that the CEO of a product or tech-led company should ideally serve as the chief product officer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>.

Key tenets of his leadership include:
*   **Decisiveness and Pace-Setting** He stresses the importance of making fast decisions to improve company speed, fostering a bias for action rather than prolonged discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:51">[00:47:51]</a>.
*   **Pushing for 10x Thinking** Chesky encourages teams to think "add a zero" (10x bigger or better) to problems, forcing them to deeply understand issues and apply first-principle thinking for innovative solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:52">[00:46:52]</a>.
*   **Fostering a Growth Mindset** He views pushing a team as believing in their untapped potential, fostering a growth mindset rather than demoralization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:11">[00:49:11]</a>.
*   **Continuous Learning and Curiosity** Chesky maintains a "beginner's mindset," constantly seeking to learn and remaining curious about the world and new approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:21">[00:59:21]</a>. He studies historical organizational structures, like those of Apple, General Motors, and DuPont, to understand the origins of common company problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:16">[01:00:16]</a>.
*   **Shamelessness in Seeking Help** He encourages seeking help from others, viewing it as an honor for those providing assistance. He emphasizes that advice can come from peers or those just a few years ahead, not just seasoned veterans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:51">[01:00:51]</a>.
*   **Proactive Prioritization** Instead of reacting to emails and meeting requests, Chesky prioritizes his time based on a clear strategy and meaningful relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:57">[00:56:57]</a>. He strives to avoid "fake work"â€”tasks that feel like work but don't advance key objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:37">[00:57:37]</a>.

## Organizational Transformation at Airbnb

Before the pandemic, Airbnb faced issues of slow product development, rising costs, internal politics, bureaucracy, and a lack of accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:37">[00:20:37]</a>. Chesky became less involved in product, leading to slower movement and less clarity, despite efforts to empower teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>. The company was spending heavily on performance marketing ($1 billion on AdWords by 2019) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a>, and was overly reliant on AB testing without clear hypotheses, leading to incremental changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>.

Airbnb operated with a divisional structure, including separate divisions for flights, homes, business travel, experiences, and regions like China, resulting in fragmented efforts and internal competition for resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:27">[00:22:27]</a>. This created a culture where managers sought to become general managers, further subdividing the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:44">[00:22:44]</a>.

The pandemic, which caused an 80% loss in business in eight weeks, served as a "near-death business experience" that provided clarity and pushed Chesky to take decisive action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:20">[00:24:20]</a>.

### Post-Pandemic Changes:
*   **Return to Functional Model** Airbnb shifted from a divisional to a purely functional model, akin to a startup, with centralized design, engineering, product marketing, marketing, communications, sales, and operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:52">[00:25:52]</a>.
*   **Streamlined Projects and Seniority** The number of concurrent projects was drastically cut (to about 20% of previous levels), and the company focused on having fewer, more senior employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:30">[00:25:30]</a>. As of the interview, Airbnb has fewer than 7,000 employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:15">[00:26:15]</a>.
*   **Expert Leadership** Executives are required to be experts in their functional domains, ensuring that leaders manage the work first and people second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:29">[00:26:29]</a>. There are no "people managers" whose sole responsibility is managing people without also having domain expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:07">[00:36:07]</a>.
*   **Centralized Decision-Making** Chesky pulled decision-making inward, fostering a "one shared consciousness" among the top 30-40 people in the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:12">[00:27:12]</a>.
*   **[[The significance of strategic planning and road mapping at Airbnb | Single, Rolling Product Roadmap]]** The company now operates with a single, rolling two-year product roadmap, updated monthly, dictating all projects outside of infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:24">[00:27:24]</a>.
*   **Integrated Product Marketing** The traditional product management function was modified to combine inbound product development responsibilities with outbound product marketing responsibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. Product marketers are now responsible for understanding how people will learn about the product, creating demos, and developing the product's story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>.
*   **Strategic Launches** Airbnb shifted to two major product launches per year (May and November/October) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>, with marketing and communications working months in advance to craft the product's story, which often dictates the product itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>. This approach encourages building brand through educating users about new features rather than relying on paid growth channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.
*   **CEO Review Schedule** Chesky instituted a rigorous CEO review schedule, reviewing all product and marketing work weekly or bi-weekly. This direct involvement allows him to identify bottlenecks and ensure collaboration without mandates or internal politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:31">[00:28:31]</a>.
*   **In-House Creative Agency** Airbnb established its own in-house creative agency for marketing and creative production, reducing reliance on external firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:21">[00:30:21]</a>. UX writing was combined with marketing writing to ensure a unified voice across all customer touchpoints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:41">[00:30:41]</a>.
*   **Unified Guest and Host Experience** Instead of separate guest and host teams, Airbnb now has a unified design and engineering team, recognizing that most features impact both sides of the marketplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:49">[00:41:49]</a>.

These changes led to a period of intense work for 1-2 years, but ultimately resulted in greater alignment, fewer conflicts, reduced turnover, and a more proactive leadership role for Chesky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:18">[00:51:18]</a>. The shift has aimed to enable "a thousand people to work but it'll look like 10 people did it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>.

## Personal Balance and Growth

While acknowledging he's not a "poster child" for work-life balance, Chesky shares strategies for avoiding burnout:
*   **Structured Breaks** He takes every other weekend completely off work, with the alternate weekend being more intense. If he had a family, this would likely be one day a weekend of intense work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:20">[00:53:20]</a>.
*   **Physical Health** Prioritizes daily cardio and regular gym workouts, along with a disciplined, healthy diet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:35">[00:53:35]</a>.
*   **Strong Relationships** Emphasizes the importance of healthy relationships for happiness, making an effort to stay in constant touch with friends, including old high school and college friends, often through shared experiences like travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:03">[00:54:03]</a>.
*   **Creative Outlets** Engages in drawing and reading as personal outlets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:48">[00:55:48]</a>.

## Artistic Background and Airbnb's Genesis

A less-known "fun fact" about Brian Chesky is that he spent most of his life as an artist and designer before founding Airbnb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:19">[01:05:19]</a>. This background profoundly influenced his approach to building the company.

*   **Early Artistic Pursuit** From age five, he was obsessive about art, attempting to reproduce Norman Rockwell paintings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:25">[01:05:25]</a>. He later explored architectural and landscape design, and even theme park design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:13">[01:06:13]</a>.
*   **Industrial Design** At RISD, he discovered industrial design, which he describes as "the design of everything from a toothbrush to a space ship" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:17">[01:09:17]</a>. This field trained him to work with engineering, understand manufacturing, and be accountable to sales and marketing, providing a holistic view of product creation that differed from purely graphic design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:38">[01:09:38]</a>.
*   **Founding Airbnb** At RISD, he met co-founder Joe Gebbia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:22">[01:10:22]</a>. After moving to San Francisco, the idea for "Airbed and Breakfast" emerged when they rented out air mattresses in their apartment during a design conference when hotels were sold out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:37">[01:11:37]</a>. Chesky believes his artistic and design background contributes to Airbnb's unique approach, as few designers or artists lead major corporations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:57">[01:11:57]</a>.

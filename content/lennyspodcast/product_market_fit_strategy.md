[[the_concept_of_product_market_fit_and_its_evolution | Product market fit]] is the cornerstone of a successful startup, making something that people want <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. However, achieving it requires a deliberate and nuanced approach, especially concerning customer feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Measuring and Optimizing Product Market Fit

Rahul Vora, founder and CEO of Superhuman, advocates for a systematic approach to [[understanding_the_framework_for_finding_productmarket_fit | finding product market fit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:57">[01:53:57]</a>, asserting that it can be measured, optimized, and even numerically increased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:17">[00:53:17]</a>.

The core of this strategy relies on the [[the_sean_ellis_test_and_product_market_fit | Sean Ellis test]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:30">[00:55:30]</a>, which asks users: "How would you feel if you could no longer use this product?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:13">[00:55:13]</a>. The responses are:
*   **Very disappointed**: Indicates a strong need or love for the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:22">[00:55:22]</a>.
*   **Somewhat disappointed**: They like the product, but something small is holding them back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:37">[00:56:37]</a>.
*   **Not disappointed**: They are far from loving the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:27">[00:56:27]</a>.

Companies that struggle to grow typically have less than 40% "very disappointed" users, while fast-growing companies usually have more than 40% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:40">[00:55:40]</a>. This metric is more predictive of success than Net Promoter Score (NPS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:55">[00:55:55]</a>.

To increase this score, the focus should be on the "somewhat disappointed" segment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:35">[00:56:35]</a>. It is crucial to identify those within this segment for whom the product's main benefit resonates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:46">[00:56:46]</a>. Feedback from those who do not resonate with the core benefit should be politely disregarded, as they are pulling the product in a different direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:17">[00:57:17]</a>.

At the start of each planning cycle, Rahul advises spending half the time reinforcing what users already love and the other half systematically addressing the objections of the "somewhat disappointed" users who align with the core benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:01">[00:58:01]</a>.

## Customer Feedback and User Understanding

Contrary to common advice, it is sometimes necessary to deliberately *not* act on feedback from many early users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. While the goal is to build something people want, it cannot be for "all people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. The challenge lies in discerning which feedback to prioritize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Manual Onboarding for Early Product Market Fit

Superhuman employed a highly contrarian strategy: manually onboarding every single new user for years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:47">[01:47:47]</a>. At its peak, Superhuman had about 20 people dedicated to manual onboarding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:36">[01:34:36]</a>.

This approach was pivotal for several reasons:
*   **User Metrics**: It led to excellent metrics across engagement, retention, [[levels_of_productmarket_fit_and_their_significance | product market fit score]], NPS, and virality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:56">[01:49:56]</a>.
*   **Brand Building**: It helped create an early cohort of "super fans," which is essential for kickstarting word-of-mouth and building a strong brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:15">[01:50:15]</a>. True virality comes from spontaneous word of mouth, not just viral mechanics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.
*   **Resource Allocation**: In a high-funding environment, it allowed the company to invest engineering resources primarily into [[levels_of_productmarket_fit_and_their_significance | finding product market fit]], solution deepening, or market widening, rather than building a first-time user experience or activation loops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:48">[01:50:48]</a>.

The decision to transition away from manual onboarding arises when the market widens, and a segment of users prefers self-service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:30">[01:54:30]</a>. Superhuman ensured they maintained profitability throughout this process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:15">[01:55:15]</a>.

## Product Design Principles for Product Market Fit

Rahul emphasizes building "remarkable" products that drive word-of-mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:19">[01:19:19]</a>. This means creating delight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:55">[01:53:55]</a> and delivering remarkable quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:58">[01:53:58]</a>, baking these ingredients into company values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:18">[01:13:18]</a>.

Key design decisions contributing to this:
*   **Attention to Detail**: Superhuman extensively researched and modified a font (Adelle Sans) to optimize for gorgeousness, message conveyance, reading speed, comprehension, and the display of email addresses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:31">[01:33:31]</a>. This level of detail, even pre-launch, reflects confidence in the product's eventual success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:38">[01:38:38]</a>.
*   **Balancing Speed vs. Perfection**: The criticality of the product dictates the balance. For a mission-critical tool like email, a half-baked product is unacceptable, as it can lead to a loss of trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:12">[01:42:12]</a>.
*   **Game Design, Not Gamification**: Instead of superficial points or badges, Superhuman focuses on fundamental game design principles: goals, emotions, toys, controls, and flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:56">[01:02:56]</a>. Products should be fun, indulge playful exploration, and elicit pleasant surprises, like the time autocompleter that understands varied inputs and handles time zone math <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:01">[01:04:01]</a>.

## Pricing Strategy and Product Market Fit

Rahul asserts that pricing strategy must follow positioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:02">[01:06:02]</a>. Since Superhuman positions itself as the "best email tool on the market" for high-performing individuals and teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>, its pricing reflects this premium positioning.

Superhuman used the Van Westendorp Price Sensitivity Meter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:04">[01:07:04]</a>, asking users four key questions about price perception (too expensive, too low, starting to get expensive, a bargain) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:15">[01:07:15]</a>. Most startups price around the "bargain" point, especially in greenfield opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:46">[01:07:46]</a>. However, Superhuman targeted the "starts to feel expensive, but you'd still buy it" price point, which was determined to be $30 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:13">[01:08:13]</a>. This price supports a best-in-class, best-in-position product, and was validated against venture scale revenue targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:30">[01:08:30]</a>.

## AI's Role in Product Market Fit

Superhuman's recent focus on AI has significantly enhanced its product and driven user love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:40">[01:09:40]</a>:
*   **Write with AI**: Generates emails that match the user's voice and tone, used 37 times per user per week on average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:09">[01:10:09]</a>.
*   **Auto Summarize**: Provides one-line summaries of conversations, updating instantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:35">[01:10:35]</a>.
*   **Instant Reply**: Automatically drafts replies for incoming emails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:53">[01:10:53]</a>.
*   **Ask AI**: Allows users to query their email trove for specific information, reducing search time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:22">[01:11:22]</a>.
*   **Automated Workflows**: Includes features like auto labels, auto reminders, and autodrafts, turning emails into repeatable processes that can even run while the user is offline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:19">[01:12:19]</a>.

These AI features have led to a fourfold increase in AI-written and sent emails within a single year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:15">[01:11:15]</a>.

## Evolution and Scaling of Product Market Fit

As a company grows, its strategy for [[the_concept_of_product_market_fit_and_its_evolution | product market fit]] evolves.
*   **Solution Deepening vs. Market Widening**: Early focus is on "solution deepening" (making the product better for existing users) to achieve [[levels_of_productmarket_fit_and_their_significance | product market fit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:34">[01:15:34]</a>. Later, "market widening" (making the product available to more users) becomes necessary for growth, which can involve supporting new platforms (iOS, Android, Mac, Windows) and email providers (Outlook) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:44">[01:15:44]</a>. This widening may *appear* to slow product velocity from existing users' perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:39">[01:17:39]</a>.
*   **[[finding_productmarket_fit_in_a_b2b_company | Finding product market fit in a B2B company]] (Enterprise)**: Selling to enterprises introduces new challenges and stakeholders. Outlook users, for example, have different expectations than Gmail users, requiring features like integrated calendar functionality and enterprise mobile management support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:12">[01:16:12]</a>. This requires building support for enterprise-specific needs and engaging with multiple stakeholders beyond just end-users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:11">[01:17:11]</a>.

By systematically applying these strategies, Superhuman has continued to evolve its product and grow its market, constantly refining its approach to product market fit.

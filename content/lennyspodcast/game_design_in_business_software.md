Rahul Vora, founder and CEO of Superhuman, advocates for the application of game design principles in building business software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:50">[00:59:50]</a>. His core belief is that when products are made like games, people find them fun, tell their friends, and fall in love with them, ultimately contributing to brand building and word-of-mouth growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:06">[01:00:06]</a>. This approach represents a different kind of [[building_and_evolving_a_software_product | product development]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:21">[01:00:21]</a>.

## Game Design vs. Gamification

Vora emphasizes a clear distinction between game design and gamification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:27">[01:00:27]</a>. Gamification, which he states "does not work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:10">[01:02:10]</a>, is not simply adding points, levels, trophies, or badges to a product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:35">[01:00:35]</a>. When gamification *appears* to work, it's because the underlying experience was already designed like a game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:13">[01:02:13]</a>.

The ineffectiveness of gamification stems from how it interacts with human motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:43">[01:00:43]</a>.

### Stanford Study on Motivation

A Stanford study from the 1970s illustrates the difference between intrinsic and extrinsic motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:47">[01:00:47]</a>:
*   Researchers recruited children aged 3 to 4 who were generally interested in drawing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:55">[01:00:55]</a>.
*   Some children were told they would receive a certificate with a gold seal and ribbon (a reward) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:01">[01:01:01]</a>. Others were not told about any reward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:08">[01:01:08]</a>.
*   Each child drew for six minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:15">[01:01:15]</a>.
*   Over the next few days, observations showed how much they continued to draw independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:22">[01:01:22]</a>.
*   Children with no expected reward spent 17% of their time drawing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:29">[01:01:29]</a>.
*   Children who expected a reward spent only 8% of their time drawing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:36">[01:01:36]</a>.

The study concluded that the very presence of a reward can halve motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:43">[01:01:43]</a>.
*   **Intrinsic motivation**: Doing things because they are inherently interesting and satisfying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:54">[01:01:54]</a>.
*   **Extrinsic motivation**: Doing things to earn rewards and achieve external goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>.
The problem with rewards is that they undermine intrinsic motivation, which is why gamification often fails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:04">[01:02:04]</a>.

## Principles of Game Design

Vora, having been a professional game designer before founding Superhuman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:33">[01:02:33]</a>, notes that there is no unifying theory of game design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:39">[01:02:39]</a>. Instead, it draws upon psychology, mathematics, storytelling, and interaction design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:44">[01:02:44]</a>.

At Superhuman, five key areas are considered for [[design_and_innovation_in_software_development | game design in software]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:51">[01:02:51]</a>:
1.  **Goals** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:56">[01:02:56]</a>
2.  **Emotions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:56">[01:02:56]</a>
3.  **Toys** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:59">[01:02:59]</a>
4.  **Controls** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:59">[01:02:59]</a>
5.  **Flow** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:59">[01:02:59]</a>

One key principle derived from these areas is to "make fun toys and then combine those into games" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:06">[01:03:06]</a>.

### The "Toy" Concept

Toys differ from games: one plays *with* toys, but plays *games* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:17">[01:03:17]</a>. For example, a ball is a toy, but football is a game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:20">[01:03:20]</a>. The best games are built from toys because they are fun on both levels â€“ the toy itself and the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:27">[01:03:27]</a>.

**Example: Superhuman's Time Autocompleter**
Superhuman's time autocompleter is an example of a "toy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:37">[01:03:37]</a>. This feature, which appears when snoozing or setting reminders for emails, allows users to type various inputs (e.g., "2D" for 2 days, "3 H" for 3 hours, "1 M O" for 1 month) and the system intelligently understands them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:41">[01:03:41]</a>.

This feature is fun because it:
*   **Indulges playful exploration** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:01">[01:04:01]</a>. Users experiment with inputs like "10" (October 10th at 10:10 p.m.) or "22" (February 2nd, 2022, at 2 p.m.) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:14">[01:04:14]</a>.
*   **Provides pleasant surprises** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:30">[01:04:30]</a>. For instance, typing "in a Fortnite and a day" works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:27">[01:04:27]</a>, or typing a time in Tokyo will automatically calculate the Eastern Time equivalent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:36">[01:04:36]</a>. Users were also delighted to discover they could snooze emails "until never" with a shrug emoji <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:45">[01:04:45]</a>.

To incorporate game design into software, Vora encourages developers to consider whether their product features:
*   Indulge playful exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:09">[01:05:09]</a>.
*   Are fun even without a specific goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:14">[01:05:14]</a>.
*   Elicit moments of pleasant surprise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:17">[01:05:17]</a>.

If features possess these qualities, they can be considered "toys" that can be combined to build a "game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:23">[01:05:23]</a>.
